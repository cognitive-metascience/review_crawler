In mammals, MBNL proteins negatively regulate an exon program specific of embryonic stem cells; however, little is known about the <italic>in vivo</italic> significance of this regulation. We studied AS in a powerful <italic>in vivo</italic> model for stem cell biology, the planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic>. We discover a conserved AS program comprising hundreds of alternative exons, microexons and introns that is differentially regulated in planarian stem cells, and comprehensively identify its regulators. We show that functional antagonism between CELF and MBNL factors directly controls stem cell-specific AS in planarians, placing the origin of this regulatory mechanism at the base of Bilaterians. Knockdown of CELF or MBNL factors lead to abnormal regenerative capacities by affecting self-renewal and differentiation sets of genes, respectively. These results highlight the importance of AS interactions in stem cell regulation across metazoans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16797.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16797.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16797.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Stem cells are specialized cells found in all animals that can develop into several different types of mature cells. Stem cells are therefore well suited for maintaining organs that are in heavy use, such as the intestine, and for regenerating tissues that are prone to injury, like the skin.</p><p>One reason why stem cells differ from mature cell types is because they activate, or “express”, different sets of genes. In addition, many genes can be expressed as one of several versions. These variants, also known as isoforms, are generated by a process called alternative splicing. In mature cells in mammals, a group of proteins called the MBNL proteins help to prevent the expression of gene isoforms that are characteristic to stem cells.</p><p>The adult flatworm <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> contains stem cells that can regenerate any part of the body. Solana, Irimia et al. have now investigated whether alternative splicing is important for controlling how the worm’s stem cells behave. After establishing which gene isoforms are expressed in the stem cells and the mature cells, the levels of different sets of proteins that control alternative splicing were experimentally reduced.</p><p>The results indicate that just as seen in mammals, the MBNL proteins reduce the expression of stem cell-related gene isoforms in the flatworms. Furthermore, Solana, Irimia et al. found that another protein called CELF counteracts MBNL proteins by helping to express gene isoforms that are active in stem cells.</p><p>The interplay between the MBNL and CELF proteins has also been observed in human cells. Thus, it appears that this way of controlling alternative splicing is common to flatworms and mammals and is therefore evolutionarily ancient. This suggests that other similar ways of controlling stem cells by interactions between regulatory proteins might be working in all animal stem cells. Further studies are now needed to investigate these control proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16797.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16797.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>Schmidtea mediterranea</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>post-transcriptional gene regulation</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>planaria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SO 1308/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Solana</surname><given-names>Jordi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2014-55076-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Irimia</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-125894</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morris</surname><given-names>Quaid</given-names></name><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Timothy R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SEV-2012-0208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Irimia</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A conserved alternative splicing program is specific to planarian stem cells and is controlled by the highly conserved splicing factors CELF and MBNL; therefore, this mode of regulating stem cells is likely ancestral to all animals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem cells are found in all animals and are defined by their capacity to self-renew and to differentiate into different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sánchez Alvarado and Yamanaka, 2014</xref>). In mammals, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from pre-implantation embryos can be cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> and differentiated into virtually any cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martello and Smith, 2014</xref>); however, a similarly potent cell type has not been found in adults. In contrast, in other animals, pluripotent stem cells are maintained during the entire life, and are often associated with extraordinary regenerative capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Solana, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka and Reddien, 2011</xref>). One of the most extreme examples are freshwater planarians, from which almost any body part can regenerate a complete organism in a few days. This ability relies on a large number of stem cells present in the adult, called neoblasts. Illustrating their pluripotency, single neoblasts transplanted into lethally irradiated hosts can rescue this lethality, restore tissue turnover, generate all cell types of the adult planarian and completely transform the genotype and phenotype of the host into that of the donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). However, recent analyses at single-cell resolution showed that the neoblast pool is highly heterogeneous, also including multiple lineage-committed precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). Despite significant progress, how neoblasts are regulated and enable planarian cell turnover as well as regeneration upon wounding is still largely unknown.</p><p>Initial transcriptomic analyses of planarian neoblasts have revealed hundreds of genes that are differentially enriched in both planarian and mammalian stem cells compared to all differentiated cell types despite 500 million years of independent evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Labbé et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Onal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reddien et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Resch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rouhana et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Solana et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting the existence of universal regulatory features across animal pluripotent cells. However, this conservation does not include the major transcriptional regulators of mammalian stem cells. In ESCs, pluripotency is maintained by a core set of transcription factors that include OCT4, NANOG and SOX2, but these factors and their interactions are largely not conserved beyond the vertebrate lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernandez-Tresguerres et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gold et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Onal et al., 2012</xref>). For instance, no homolog of NANOG has been described to date in any invertebrate species, despite extensive search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scerbo et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, elucidating how the regulation of pluripotency in invertebrates occurs in the absence of this core set of factors is crucial to understand the biology of animal stem cells.</p><p>Post-transcriptional regulation is more recently emerging as another key mechanism for controlling ESC biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ye and Blelloch, 2014</xref>). In particular, various reports have established the importance of alternative splicing (AS) for ESCs and somatic cell reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Venables et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ye and Blelloch, 2014</xref>). AS is the process by which introns and exons are selectively included or excluded from the pre-mRNA to produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms. AS can therefore expand transcriptomic complexity in a cell type- or developmental stage-specific manner, adding an extra layer of regulation to the control of gene expression. Moreover, highly regulated alternative exons often encode disordered regions of proteins that embed binding motifs, and thus have the potential to rewire protein-protein interactions in a context-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buljan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ellis et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>AS is chiefly regulated by RNA binding proteins (RBPs), which are themselves often differentially expressed in a cell type-regulated manner. These factors typically bind to pre-mRNAs in a sequence- and position-specific fashion, thereby modulating inclusion or exclusion of the target alternative sequence. For example, members of the MBNL family of RBPs are lowly expressed in mammalian ESCs, but show higher levels of expression in all profiled differentiated samples – ranging from transformed cell lines (e.g. HeLa, 293T, etc.) to highly histologically and functionally diverse adult tissue types (including multiple brain regions, muscle, liver, kidney, testis, etc.) – where they repress a program of alternative exons that are characteristic of ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2013</xref>). Knockdown of MBNL in differentiated cultured cells thus induces ESC-like AS patterns and this is sufficient to enhance somatic cell reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2013</xref>). MBNL targets are involved in diverse cellular processes, from cytoskeletal dynamics to gene regulation, and include disparate actors, from protein kinases to transcriptional regulators. For instance, MBNL-regulated AS of the transcription factor FOXP1 in mouse and human embryonic stem cells changes its DNA-binding properties, so that its stem cell specific isoform (FOXP1-ES) promotes transcription of pluripotency genes and represses differentiation genes, while its canonical isoform activates genes involved in differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gabut et al., 2011</xref>). Consistently, FOXP1-ES is repressed by MBNL upon differentiation by direct binding to intronic regions in the pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, members of another RBP family, CELF, have been shown to regulate AS in an antagonistic manner to that of MBNL factors in mammals. For example, during heart development, CELF factors promote embryonic AS patterns, which are later replaced by adult heart AS patterns promoted by MBNL proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalsotra et al., 2008</xref>). Multiple exons have been shown to antagonistically respond to CELF and MBNL factors in a variety of mammalian differentiation, disease and cell culture systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dasgupta and Ladd, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalsotra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee and Cooper, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). CELF factors, however, have not been linked so far to regulation of AS in stem cells.</p><p>Despite these studies, the degree to which regulation by AS is conserved or whether AS plays any role in non-mammalian stem cells is still entirely unknown. To address these questions, we here investigated the regulatory role and functional importance of AS in planarian stem cells and regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results show that AS and the factors involved in its regulation, as well as their specific interactions (i.e. functional antagonism between MBNL and CELF proteins), are crucial for planarian stem cell biology and regeneration and likely a deeply conserved feature of animal stem cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide annotation of planarian intron-exon structures</title><p>We used a recent <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2013</xref>) to annotate intron and exons in the genome of <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> (assembly version 3.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>, Materials and methods). Most planarian protein-coding genes (75%) are multiexonic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Intron length displays a sharp bimodal distribution: whereas most introns are relatively small, with lengths centred on 57 bp, another subset ranges between 1 and 10 Kbps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Next, we produced and compiled over 30 samples of novel and available deep coverage RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from multiple sources (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). These consist of FACS-isolated cell populations – including neoblast-enriched (X1), neoblast progeny-enriched (X2) and differentiated cell-enriched (Xins) fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) – as well as wild type and neoblast-depleted whole animals.

Importantly, in contrast to cassette exon events, which were predicted to generate different protein isoforms in neoblast and differentiated cells, nearly all X1-included IR events were predicted to disrupt the reading frame specifically in neoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>, chi-squared test).

Therefore, altogether these data suggest that neoblast-specific IR may be operating to ensure that a subset of early-transcribed differentiation genes is not active in neoblasts.

Strikingly, a member of the CELF family (<italic>Smed-bruno-like, bruli</italic>) of AS regulators showed the strongest differential expression enrichment in X1 fractions among the multiple probed AS factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), and had been previously reported to be needed for planarian stem cell self-renewal and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guo et al., 2006</xref>). Most other investigated AS factors showed no differential enrichment in X1 fractions compared to the core spliceosome (e.g. <italic>Smed-ptbp-1</italic>, -2, <italic>Smed-rbfox-1</italic>), or were differentially enriched in Xins fractions (e.g. <italic>Smed-mbnl-1, Smed-esrp-1,2</italic>, etc.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>To query the role of these factors in the regulation of the neoblast AS program and in regeneration, we performed RNAi of these genes separately or in combinations (for paralogs with similar enrichment in X1 or Xins fractions). A total of eight RNAi groups comprising two single RNAi and six multiple RNAi combinations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>) were knocked down in parallel with a control RNAi. Tests of regeneration capability upon head ablation in these knockdowns showed diverse defects for several AS factor groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As previously reported, <italic>bruli</italic>(<italic>RNAi</italic>) showed a dramatic phenotype with no regeneration. A similar phenotype was also observed for the <italic>ptbp</italic>(<italic>RNAi</italic>) group. Combined knockdown of the three other CELF factors, enriched in Xins fractions, induced elongation and movement defects, but did not seem to affect regeneration time dynamics. Finally, a significant delay in regeneration was observed for the <italic>mbnl</italic> group.</p><p>To evaluate the transcriptomic impact of these factors in regulating neoblast-differential AS in stem cells, we FACS-sorted planarian X1 cell populations from these eight RNAi groups 10 days after RNAi (when the neoblast population was still not decreased upon <italic>bruli</italic> RNAi treatment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR for eight representative neoblast-differential AS events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Only <italic>bruli</italic>(<italic>RNAi</italic>) treatment induced dramatic changes in inclusion levels in X1 fractions compared to the control RNAi in the expected direction (i.e. towards the differentiated pattern; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that <italic>bruli</italic> may act as a positive regulator of the neoblast AS program. Next, to assess the importance of the AS factors that were enriched in differentiated cells, we performed RNA-Seq of whole worms from these eight RNAi groups. Knockdown of the <italic>mbnl</italic> group [a four-gene knockdown: <italic>Smed-mbnl-1;Smed-mbnl-like-1, -2, -3</italic>(<italic>RNAi</italic>), hereafter <italic>mbnl</italic>(<italic>RNAi</italic>)] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>) showed the most widespread changes in the X1-differential AS program towards the neoblast pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that MBNL proteins may act as negative regulators of the neoblast AS program. Remarkably, RNA sequence motif enrichment analyses using a library of RNAcompete-derived binding profiles for over 100 animal RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ray et al., 2013</xref>) showed that MBNL consensus motifs are also the most significantly enriched in the downstream introns of X1-excluded cassette exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This result is consistent with planarian MBNL proteins enhancing X1-excluded exons via binding to their downstream introns, as described for mammalian MBNL proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).

Cluster 1 comprises genes with strong differential expression enrichment in neoblasts, while Cluster six genes are conversely expressed mainly in differentiated tissues and excluded from the neoblast compartment. Consistent with a prominent neoblast loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guo et al., 2006</xref>), Cluster 1 genes were highly significantly decreased upon <italic>bruli</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> ; p&lt;5.6 × 10<sup>−56</sup> for the three time points, hypergeometric test).

We find widespread and strong differences in the pre-mRNA processing of genes expressed in both stem and differentiated cells. Most of these AS differences were evolutionarily conserved between two planarian species, strongly arguing for functional importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Irimia et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, even several human genes undergo stem cell-specific AS in similar regions to those of their planarian orthologs. Moreover, we also found a large number of introns that are specifically retained in neoblast transcripts and that reduce the production of functional proteins in this cell type. Our results thus provide evidence that IR may play an important and distinct role in the regulation of stem cell gene expression.</p><p>Our results further indicate that BRULI and MBNL proteins functionally interplay to regulate planarian regeneration. <italic>bruli</italic> is highly expressed in stem cells and contributes to shape neoblast-specific transcriptomes at least in part through regulation of exon skipping and intron retention. Depletion of <italic>bruli</italic> results in neoblast loss and thus in a complete lack of regeneration. On the other hand, <italic>mbnl</italic> factors are more expressed in differentiated cells, where they contribute to establish differentiated gene expression. Therefore, loss of <italic>mbnl</italic> function is likely to affect neoblast differentiation, thereby reducing and/or slowing down regeneration. Our computational, biochemical and functional experiments indicate that CELF and MBNL proteins functionally antagonize by directly binding to their targets to control stem cell biology and regeneration in planarians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, these two families of RBPs not only play antagonistic roles in the regulation of multiple mammalian differentiation systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalsotra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ward et al., 2010</xref>), but directly control stem cell-specific AS in an evolutionarily distant organism. Moreover, MBNL proteins have been shown to be major direct negative regulators of mammalian ESC-differential AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Venables et al., 2013</xref>), similarly to what we describe here for planarian neoblast AS. While MBNL targets are largely not shared between planarians and humans (only seven orthologous gene groups have MBNL-regulated, non-homologous, exons in both species), the upstream role of MBNL proteins as repressors of stem cell-differential AS appears equivalent in both species. This suggests that direct negative regulation of stem cell transcriptomes by MBNL proteins, and perhaps positively by CELF factors, is a deeply conserved ancestral feature of animal stem cells. Indeed, a recent study has shown that sponges – the most basal metazoan lineage –also differentially express a CELF homolog in their stem cells and an MBNL homolog in differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alié et al., 2015</xref>). However, since the true homology status of planarian, poriferan and human stem cells is unclear, it also possible that CELF and MBNL proteins form an ancestral developmental regulatory module that has been deployed to regulate pluripotent vs. differentiated transcriptomes multiple times across evolution. For instance, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> a Bruno homolog (<italic>aret</italic>) is only highly expressed in the early pluripotent embryo stages (from 0 to 4 hr post fertilization) during development, while the embryonic expression of the single Mbnl ortholog (<italic>mbl</italic>) gradually increases from 6 hr post fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graveley et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, we have shown that not only the antagonistic expression but also the binding specificities of BRULI and MBNL proteins are very similar to those of their human counterparts, an observation that is in line with the high level of conservation of binding specificities and positional regulatory codes described for several other RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Irimia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lareau and Brenner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Loria et al., 2003</xref>). The dual regulation by CELF and MBNL suggests that other interactions between factors in the control of AS might exist.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16797.029</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for BRULI and MBNL regulation of neoblast-specific AS.</title><p>Schematic representation of BRULI and MBNL regulation of AS in different planarian cell fractions and respective RNAi mediated knockdown phenotypes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16797.029">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16797.029</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-16797-fig8-v1"/></fig></p><p>In summary, we have unveiled an ancient post-transcriptional antagonistic regulatory switch formed by CELF and MBNL factors that is associated with pluripotency in multiple animal systems.

Given the relatively fragmentary nature of this genome assembly, we used a recent <italic>de novo</italic> genome-independent transcriptome assembly based on multiple RNA-Seq data sources (Dresden transcriptome - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://planmine.mpi-cbg.de/">http://planmine.mpi-cbg.de/</ext-link>) as transcript reference for the annotation. The 26,562 transcripts from this transcriptome were mapped to the genome using <italic>blat</italic> with the following parameters:–q = rna –fine (to search for initial and terminal exons in high quality transcripts). The output was then sorted using pslSort, and then filtered using pslCDnaFilter with the following parameters: -minCover = 0.75 -minId = 0.96 -globalNearBest = 0.005 –filterWeirdOverlapped. If multiple redundant mappings (i.e. of overlapping sequences in the query) of a single transcript fulfilled these conditions, only the hit with the best <italic>blat</italic> score was kept. If different regions of a transcript mapped to different scaffolds (936 transcripts), the transcript was split into two or more gene models, one in each scaffold (gene sub-models were designated with suffixes following '_2', '_3', etc.).</p><p>Next, a series of filters were applied to remove usual annotation errors. First, the strand of a gene model was flipped if there were more CT-AC than GT-AG introns (often occurring in gene chimeras in opposite orientations; 301 gene models). Second, extra multiple-mapping transcript regions within the same scaffold were filtered out (in 281 gene models). Third, exons separated by annotated introns shorter than 30 nucleotides (usually 1–5 nucleotides) were collapsed into single exons (these often reflected UTR polymorphisms or discrepancies between the transcriptome and genome assemblies; 7665 merged exons). This resulted in a GTF containing 23,161 single-transcript gene models. We next used TransDecoder (version 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haas et al., 2013</xref>) with default parameters and compared against the Pfam A database to identify coding sequences (CDS). A total of 15,008 gene models had detected open reading frames (ORFs). For those cases in which TransDecoder detected more than one ORF in a given transcript (usually due to assembly errors that introduce PTCs), we generated multiple transcript identifiers (designated with suffixes following '_b', '_c', etc.). Custom perl scripts were then used to add start_codon and stop_codon lines to the GTF. Finally, to provide meaningful gene names, we performed tblastx (e-value 0.001, without low complexity filter) of the original planarian transcriptome against human mRNAs from Ensembl v71 and assign the gene symbols of best human hits (for 12,171 cases). This genome annotation was used as reference for our pipeline for alternative splicing (AS) identification, which includes multiple steps to identify non-annotated exons and splice sites (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Library preparation and RNA sequencing</title><p>Libraries for RNA sequencing generated in the present study were produced with poly-A selected RNA and according to the manufacturer’s directions.

First, a 'transcript-based' approach uses full transcript information from multiple sources to identify single or groups of multiple cassette exons (consecutive alternative internal exons flanked by constitutive exons). Given the limited availability of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) and cDNAs for planarians, we used other published <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assemblies as ESTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamidi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blythe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Labbé et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Onal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Resch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rouhana et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, we also used RNA-Seq-based transcript annotations, derived from our multiple samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) individually using STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) and cufflinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trapnell et al., 2010</xref>). Novel junctions obtained in the 'splice site-based' module (see below) were also incorporated. Finally, 215 additional cassette exons identified from previous transcriptomic assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Labbé et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Onal et al., 2012</xref>) were incorporated manually (indicated as 'CASSETTEd' in the Sme.EXSK.Template.*.txt files from <italic>vast-tools</italic>, see below). With this information, we identified individual or groups of neighbouring internal exons that are skipped in certain transcripts. Next, to quantify their inclusion levels, we mapped RNA-Seq reads to combinations of exon-exon junctions (EEJs) that define each splicing event. For the case of single exon skipping events, we generated EEJs for C1A, AC2 and C1C2 (A represents the alternative exon and C1 and C2 represent the neighboring constitutive exons), requiring a minimum of eight positions from each exon. For multi-exon events we generated all possible forward combinations from C1 to C2 exons. If multiple alternative 5’ and/or 3’ splice sites were associated with any alternative, C1 or C2 exons, they were also included in the combinations.</p><p>Second, a 'splice site-based' module utilizes the joining of all hypothetically-possible EEJ forward combinations from annotated and <italic>de novo</italic> splice sites (as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2013</xref>), where it was used to identify Embryonic Stem Cell [ESC]-differential exons). To identify splice sites <italic>de novo</italic>, for each annotated splice site donor/acceptor, we scanned two downstream/upstream introns for potential splice site acceptors/donors that would constitute a novel EEJ. Next, after subtracting the reads that map to the genome, we mapped our RNA-Seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) to this library of all potential EEJs, and considered 'novel splice sites' those supported by at least five reads mapped to multiple positions of the EEJ. Identification and quantification of cassette exons was done as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2013</xref>). Third, a 'microexon module' includes <italic>de novo</italic> searching of pairs of donor and acceptor splice sites in intronic sequence to detect novel, very short (i.e. 3–15 nt) microexons and subsequent quantification of inclusion levels using exon-microexon-exon junctions (EEEJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Irimia et al., 2014</xref>). The outputs from the three AltEx modules were combined to produce a non-redundant list of cassette exons and associated quantifications. For exons that are identified by more than one module, the representative with the highest overall read coverage is kept. In case of equal coverage, priority is given to events derived from the 'transcript-based' module, followed by those from the 'microexon' module. For intron retention (IR), we used the approach described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braunschweig et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, to detect and quantify Alt3 and Alt5 events, we used the output from mapping RNA-Seq reads to the EEJ library generated by the 'splice site-based module', which provides information on the usage of every hypothetical splice site donor and acceptor, as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Irimia et al., 2014</xref>). In all modules, quantification of alternative sequence inclusion in the transcripts is derived only from junction reads (either EEJs or EIJs). Raw RNA-seq reads were processed and EEJ/EIJ read counts corrected for mappability obtained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Irimia et al., 2014</xref>).

We grouped those in clusters of orthology using KEGG annotations. When the X1/Xins ratio of different orthologs of the same group differed greatly (indicating differential expression of the orthologs), the group was split into two groups to separate the orthologues highly specifically expressed in X1 from the highly specifically expressed in Xins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>). Since in a previous version of the transcriptome (BIMSB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamidi et al., 2011</xref>]) the mbnl-1 locus had two different transcripts IDs (isotig19687 and isotig20952), one dsRNA was designed against both of them (noted as <italic>mbnl-1</italic> and <italic>mbnl-1*,</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Comparison to spliceosomal components was done to gain insight of housekeeping gene expression in stem cells vs. differentiated cells. We selected core spliceosomal components from Complexes A, B and C by searching the relevant KEGG terms in our KEGG annotation.

For those alternative sequences that are not present in our reference annotation, mapping was projected based on the information of the upstream exon. Then, sequences that contained in-frame stop codons (based on annotations and in-frame sequence translation from the upstream exon) or start codons (based on annotations) were flagged. Following a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Irimia et al., 2014</xref>), AS events were predicted to generate alternative protein (ORF-preserving) isoforms upon both inclusion and exclusion when they fall in the CDS, do not disrupt the reading frame (i.e. they have lengths multiple of three nucleotides), and do not contain in-frame stop codons predicted to trigger non-sense mediated decay (NMD; those stop codons that fall further than 50 nucleotides away from a downstream EEJ). Furthermore, if an alternative sequence is predicted to introduce an in-frame stop codon that would not trigger NMD but would generate a protein &gt;100 aminoacids shorter than the annotated isoform, it was also considered as an ORF-disrupting event. For multiexonic cassette events (arrays of more than one alternative exon), NMD/ORF-disruption was assessed for all exons as a group based on their inclusion patterns in neoblast and differentiated samples (e.g. if one frame-shifting exon is downregulated in neoblast samples and another upregulated, both the neoblast and differentiated isoforms can have intact reading frames). For ORF-disrupting AS events, two main categories were defined: ORF-disruption upon sequence inclusion or upon sequence exclusion. Therefore, depending on the neoblast inclusion pattern, we defined events that cause ORF disruption in neoblast samples, but not in other tissues ('ORF disruption in X1'), or the opposite, AS events that disrupt ORFs only in differentiated samples ('ORF disruption in Xins').</p><p>To investigate the overlap of alternative exons with disordered regions and protein domains we first mapped the alternative exons as well as the upstream (C1) and downstream (C2) exons to the proteome as annotated in our genome annotation (see above). Next, to include unannotated exons, we recreated novel protein isoforms by introducing the exonic sequence downstream of the upstream C1 exon. The final set of proteins was used to run <italic>de novo</italic> predictions using Disopred2 (for structural disorder, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ward et al., 2004</xref>]), and Pfam (for protein domains, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finn et al., 2014</xref>); only domains from the A module were used), both with default parameters. For both disorder and Pfam domains, the fraction of residues from alternative exons overlapping those features are reported. For consistency, for all exon classes, only exons that would generate protein isoforms both when included and skipped (i.e. internal exons with lengths multiple of three nucleotides without in-frame stop codons) were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Study of evolutionary conservation in <italic>D. japonica</italic></title><p>With the aim of designing <italic>D. japonica</italic>-specific primers for all validated neoblast-differential AS events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), we first blasted the <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> alternative sequences, as well as the neighbouring upstream and downstream exons against a recently published transcriptome assembly of <italic>D. japonica</italic>.

First, Inparanoid v8.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ostlund et al., 2010</xref>) was run for one reference protein per gene in planarian and human using default parameters. If the planarian and human proteins were grouped in the same cluster, they were considered putative orthologs. Second, we blasted the planarian proteins against the human reference proteome and the first three hits were matched against the subset of genes with ESC-differential exons. From these two complementary approaches, orthology calls were manually verified and dubious mis-assignments were discarded. In total 15 orthologous groups comprising 17 planarian genes (with neoblast-differential 30 exons) and 20 human genes (harbouring 22 ESC-differential exons). Next, to assess orthology at the exonic level, we mapped intron positions into protein sequence alignments, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D'Aniello et al., 2008</xref>); in addition, conserved protein domains were used as milestones to define homologous protein regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). With this information, we evaluated whether (i) the exons fall in equivalent protein regions (e.g. within two protein domains), (ii) the sequence was orthologous, and (iii) the exons were orthologous (based on the intron position alignments). The exons were defined to be in 'similar protein regions' (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) if they fall in the same relative region of the protein (as per (i)) and the distance in the alignment is lower than 100 residues.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RNAcompete and motif enrichment analyses</title><p>The Full-length version of <italic>bruli, mbnl-1</italic> (both the X1- and Xins-enriched isoforms), <italic>mbnl-like-1</italic> and <italic>mbnl-like-2</italic> were cloned into GST-tagged vector (pTH6838) using primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

The sub-sequences corresponding to the first and last 80nt of each intron were further subdivided into 20-nt bins. Introns shorter than 160-nt were excluded from the analysis (see below). Next, all 7-mer occurrences within each bin were counted and summed for corresponding bins over all events in the signal and background sets.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Aviv Regev as the Senior editor and three reviewers, including Jernej Ule (Reviewer #2) and Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado (Reviewer #1), who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity:</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this comprehensive study, Dr. Solana et al. investigate the role that alternative splicing (AS) may or may not play in the regulation of stem cells <italic>in vivo</italic> using the planarian model system <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>. The authors report on the conservation of an AS program comprising hundreds of alternative exons, microexons and intron retention events that is differentially regulated. Additionally, the authors identify a cohort of RNA binding proteins associated with the regulation of the uncovered AS program. Chiefly, the authors focus on two known functional antagonists involved in AS regulation, i.e., CELF and MBNL. Knockdown of either CELF or MBNL factors lead to abnormal regeneration by affecting the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation sets of genes. Additionally, the authors find neoblast-unique patterns of splicing that is opposingly regulated by the <italic>bruli</italic> and <italic>mbnl</italic> genes in neoblasts versus differentiated cells. Overall, the experiments are carefully executed and the data produced opens a significant number of novel lines of future investigations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following issues need to be addressed fully in a revised submission.</p><p>1) The comparison of the planarian dataset to ES cells is somewhat superficial and could be improved if the authors were to delve in more detail on the role of MBNL in mammalian cells and its significance in regulating AS and relate it to the reported planarian data more specifically. For example, the fourth paragraph of the Introduction is confusing (<italic>mbnl</italic> promotes ES form of FoxP?). Also in the fourth paragraph of the Introduction: differentiated cell role is very relevant –therefore noting more detail would be helpful (which cell types were examined for instance).</p><p>2) Because a major emphasis of this paper lies on the evolutionary conservation of the CELF/MBNL AS regulation axis, the authors should attempt to determine whether there is or there is not conservation of the planarian regulated isoforms in other species, i.e., human and/or mouse stem cells. Is there any overlap between MBNL alternative spliced isoforms in human and the orthologous planarian genes in stem cells? For instance in the subsection “Unexpected abundance of neoblast-specific retained introns”, the authors put forward a very interesting mechanism that is, nonetheless, speculative. The authors could word this more conservatively by mentioning ES data, then state these genes are good targets to test in planarian neoblasts to test for mechanistic similarity. Overall, given the embryonic strategy used by mammalian embryos to derive ES cells from embryos undergoing implantation, and that such an attribute is unlikely associated with the common ancestor of planarians and mammals, the homology between ES cells and neoblasts is dubious. Nonetheless, opposing roles for CELF/MBNL factors in stem/progenitor/embryonic cells, or cells associated with multi/pluripotency in their last common ancestor is certainly possible and would be very interesting. Such a role could have been variously recruited to embryonic cells and different stem cell classes in the course of evolution. This could be assessed by studying many stem cell/embryonic cell classes in other organisms/animal tissues. It is also possible that opposing roles in AS programs for CELF/MBNL proteins is what is conserved and that this could be variously utilized in different types of biology. We recommend a more careful/nuanced wording throughout, but particularly in the discussion. This may help bring the evolutionary line of argumentation into sharper focus.</p><p>3) The model put forward in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> overinterprets the data. We find no clear evidence in the manuscript for &quot;impaired differentiation&quot;. Additionally, the significance of the connecting lines and arrows is far from clear. Do these arrows represent phenotypes caused by RNAi loss of gene function or do they represent gene function? In other words, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, bottom image, the arrow seems to imply that <italic>bruli</italic> functions to negatively regulate stem cell renewal, etc., but the proposed roles for <italic>bruli</italic> and <italic>mbnl</italic> are opposite to arrows. If the negative arrows are meant to reflect phenotype, that is an atypical and confusing way to summarize gene function. <italic>mbnl</italic> arrows reflect more interpretation than is possible from the data-the authors have not shown whether there is more progression from SC to prog cells or less progression from prog cells to differentiated cells.</p><p>4) The high conservation of tissue-specific splicing regulators and their regulatory codes has also been documented before (PMID: 21389270, 25576366, 20921232). The human CELF4 can rescue the function of <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologue (PMID: 12906792) and the MBNL sequence specificity, its regulatory program and many of its binding sites are conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human (PMID: 22901804).

In addition, we have edited parts of the Introduction to clarify the role of MBNL in repressing the ES isoform of FoxP1 and how this isoform regulates mammalian ESC biology. Finally, we have further expanded the discussion of the conservation of MBNL between planarian and mammalian stem cells (see below).</p><p><italic>2) Because a major emphasis of this paper lies on the evolutionary conservation of the CELF/MBNL AS regulation axis, the authors should attempt to determine whether there is or there is not conservation of the planarian regulated isoforms in other species, i.e., human and/or mouse stem cells.

We recommend a more careful/nuanced wording throughout, but particularly in the discussion. This may help bring the evolutionary line of argumentation into sharper focus.</italic></p><p>We have now performed an evolutionary comparison between the MBNL targets in humans (described in Han et al., Nature 2013) and those we identified by knocking down the <italic>mbnl</italic> genes in planarian Xins fractions. We have found no conservation of specific exon targets, but we identified several genes with MBNL-regulated exons in both lineages (most of these overlap with the ES/neoblast-regulated exons, described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). It should be noted, however, that while we see a very good level of conservation in the wild-type samples from two planarian species (<italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> and <italic>Dugesia japonica)</italic> conservation over such large evolutionary distances (i.e. planarians to mammals) is much harder to assess. Based on these results and following the Editor's suggestion, we have used more conservative phrasing when referring to the conservation of Mbnl regulation. Furthermore, we emphasize that the similarity is at the level of the regulatory axis (upstream factors) primarily and not the targets. This is for instance the case for miRNAs and their targets: while the upstream factors (miRNAs) are very well conserved there is extensive rewiring of the miRNA-target relationships. To reinforce this view, we have further elaborated the discussion by mentioning recent transcriptomic studies in animal stem cells and embryo development where CELF/MBNL antagonism could be at work in pluripotent cells, and more carefully worded the conservation case throughout. We believe that under the light of the recent findings of Alie and co-workers (PNAS 2015) – where they find expression of a CELF homolog in sponge (poriferan) stem cells (archeocytes) and an MBNL homolog expressed in all other differentiated cell types profiled – the case for conservation of CELF/MBNL antagonism in stem cells of all animals is stronger. However, this and other possibilities are now properly discussed in the text.</p><p><italic>3) The model put forward in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> overinterprets the data.
