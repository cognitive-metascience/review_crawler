for dementia, a successful therapy will require an understanding of the physiological changes that occur in the brain with aging. Here, two structurally distinct Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug candidates, CMS121 and J147, were used to identify a unique molecular pathway that is shared between the aging brain and AD. CMS121 and J147 reduced cognitive decline as well as metabolic and transcriptional markers of aging in the brain when administered to rapidly aging SAMP8 mice. Both compounds preserved mitochondrial homeostasis by regulating acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) metabolism. CMS121 and J147 increased the levels of acetyl-CoA in cell culture and mice via the inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), resulting in neuroprotection and increased acetylation of histone H3K9 in SAMP8 mice, a site linked to memory enhancement. These data show that targeting specific metabolic aspects of the aging brain could result in treatments for dementia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>metabobolomics</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG046153</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schubert</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Maher</surname><given-names>Pamela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1 AG054714</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schubert</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Maher</surname><given-names>Pamela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldberg</surname><given-names>Joshua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R41 AI104034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maher</surname><given-names>Pamela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008097</institution-id><institution>Edward N. and Della L.

While genetic risk factors have been the major focus of AD drug discovery, it is important to consider the progressively detrimental metabolic processes that take place with normal aging as possible therapeutic targets. Clinical evidence shows that a decline in cerebral glucose metabolism (hypometabolism) precedes the pathology and symptoms of AD and is more severe than that observed in normal aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costantini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cunnane et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yin et al., 2014</xref>). Given that energy production from glucose supports the majority of brain activity as well as the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, it is likely that a failure to supply cells with adequate energy contributes to the neuropathological cascade in both aging and age-associated dementias such as AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Caldwell et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Most of the energy derived from glucose oxidation is produced in mitochondria. Not surprisingly, a number of mitochondrial-dependent functions are found to be impaired during aging and AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Caldwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Currais, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin and Beal, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Onyango et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Swerdlow and Khan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yin et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, brain mitochondrial dysfunction has been hypothesized to be responsible for the pathological hallmarks of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Swerdlow and Khan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Because the current approach to AD drug discovery has largely failed, we devised a novel drug discovery paradigm based on phenotypic screening assays that mimic numerous aspects of old age-associated neurodegeneration and brain pathology, including energy failure and mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prior et al., 2014</xref>). We have identified two compounds that are very neuroprotective – CMS121 and J147. J147 is active in transgenic AD animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daugherty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prior et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prior et al., 2016</xref>). It enhances memory and prevents some aspects of aging in rapidly aging (15 month median lifespan) senescence-accelerated prone 8 (SAMP8) mice when administered early in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Currais et al., 2015b</xref>). CMS121 is a more potent derivative of the flavonol fisetin that maintains most of its biological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiruta et al., 2012</xref>). CMS121 is not as well studied as J147, but we have recently shown that fisetin is able to ameliorate some aspects of aging in SAMP8 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Currais et al., 2018</xref>). The target of J147 is the alpha subunit of ATP synthase, which engages a neuroprotective response involving the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldberg et al., 2018</xref>). ATP synthase is an anti-aging target in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chin et al., 2014</xref>). We have ruled out that CMS121 also targets ATP synthase (unpublished data), and its molecular targets are currently under investigation. However, because the two compounds were developed based upon brain toxicities associated with aging and therefore share similar biological activities in vitro, we hypothesized that they may mitigate some aspects of aging brain metabolism and pathology via a common pathway despite differences in molecular structure and direct targets.</p><p>To test this idea, we fed CMS121 and J147 to aged SAMP8 mice and used a multiomics approach to identify modes of action. We first show that both compounds reduce metabolic and gene transcription markers of aging in the SAMP8 model of aging and dementia when administered at a late stage of the aging process. We further demonstrate that both compounds share a mechanism of action that maintains high levels of acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), at least in part, by the inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1). Importantly, the compounds increase histone acetylation in cultured neurons and SAMP8 mice at a site on histone H3 that is required for memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mews et al., 2017</xref>). Together, these data show that aging and dementia share a common metabolic pathway related to brain mitochondrial function that can be therapeutically targeted.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Aging is associated with changes in the hippocampal transcriptome that are prevented by CMS121 and J147</title><p>To identify age-dependent changes in brain metabolism that are causally associated with dementia, we tested CMS121 and J147 in SAMP8 mice. The SAMP8 mice are a model of accelerated aging that develop a progressive, age-associated decline in brain function as well as a number of brain pathologies similar to human dementia and AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiguchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Butterfield and Poon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Currais et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pallas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takeda, 2009</xref>). Some of the pathological traits developed by the SAMP8 mice with aging that are also found in AD include: progressive decline in brain function with early deterioration in learning and memory; increased oxidative stress; inflammation; vascular impairment; gliosis; Aβ accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takeda, 2009</xref>).</p><p>We asked whether J147 and CMS121 could prevent the development of the aging phenotype in SAMP8 mice when administered in the last quadrant of their lifespan, reflecting the therapeutic context for human AD patients. Treatment with the diets containing the compounds started at 9 months of age and continued for four months (13 months of age); the median lifespan of these mice is 15 months.</p><p>We began our analyses with an unbiased approach by studying the entire transcriptome of brain hippocampal tissue. Principle component analysis (PCA) showed a clear distinction in the variation of the transcriptome between the 9 and 13 months old SAMP8 groups, indicating that aging has a strong effect on gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Importantly, both compound-treated groups presented a distribution in the two major principle components (PCs) that was closer to the 9 months old mice, suggesting that the compounds can prevent transcriptomic changes that take place with aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This effect was particularly noticeable with CMS121. Transcriptomic drift analysis, a method to characterize the aging process that measures changes in gene expression at a global level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rangaraju et al., 2015</xref>), showed a significant age-associated drift in gene expression between 9 and 13 months that was also suppressed by both compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Aging of the hippocampal transcriptome in SAMP8 mice is significantly prevented by CMS121 and J147.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PCA of the top 10% most highly expressed genes in the hippocampus of 9 months, 13 months, 13 months+CMS121 and 13 months+J147 SAMP8 mice.

Venn diagrams highlighting the shared DE genes between the 9 months vs 13 months old mice and 13 months vs each of the 13 months+compounds are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. Fold changes of the DE genes were log-transformed and plotted on correlation graphs for each pair of comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right side). For all of the DE genes that overlap between aging and compound treatment (shared DE genes), the age-dependent changes in expression were prevented by the compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, middle set of graphs). Furthermore, analysis of the DE genes that are specific for each comparison (those that do not overlap) also shows that the age-dependent alterations in most of these DE genes follow the same trend of prevention by the compounds. Thus, these data provide evidence that both compounds reduce aging at the level of the transcriptome in the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice when administered at a late stage of the aging process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CMS121 and J147 improve cognitive function in SAMP8 mice when administered at advanced stages of dementia</title><p>We next determined if the changes in gene transcription in old SAMP8 mice and the effects by CMS121 and J147 were associated with functional alterations in cognition.</p><p>Assessment of spontaneous behavior in the open field assay showed only a decline in average velocity between the 9 and 13 months SAMP8 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

One of the downstream effects of AMPK activation is the inhibition by phosphorylation at serine 79 of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), an enzyme responsible for the conversion of acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA, which is then utilized to synthesize fatty acids. The flux of acetyl-CoA through ACC1 to malonyl-CoA is a major mechanism of acetyl-CoA catabolism and lipid biosynthesis. Inhibition of ACC1 can thus potentially lead to a build up in acetyl-CoA. Therefore, we determined the effects of the compounds on ACC1 phosphorylation and acetyl CoA levels in both primary neurons and the mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22, the primary phenotypic screening model used in our laboratory to identify CMS121 and J147 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiruta et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This assay relies on the lethal induction of mitochondrial ROS in the HT22 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prior et al., 2014</xref>), a programmed cell death pathway called oxytosis with physiological features similar to those implicated in the nerve cell damage seen in aging and AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Currais and Maher, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tan et al., 2001</xref>). Oxytosis can be triggered by glutamate which inhibits cystine uptake via system X<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup>, leading to depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH), production of ROS and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tan et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>We first determined that the compounds can increase acetyl-CoA in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In HT22 cells as well as primary neurons, both CMS121 and J147 increased the phosphorylation of ACC1 at serine 79 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>; Western blots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, both CMS121 and J147 also increased phospho-ACC1 levels in the brains of the SAMP8 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). ACC1 phosphorylation was also elevated with aging, and this observation could be associated with a compensatory mechanism. In addition, inhibition of ACC1 by the compounds was accompanied by a decrease in free fatty acids in primary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) as well as in the brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>) and plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>) of old SAMP8 mice. Thus, inhibition of ACC1 can at least partially explain the increases in acetyl-CoA levels seen with both compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and E</xref>).</p><p>To test this hypothesis directly, ACC1 activity was blocked with the competitive inhibitor 5-(tetradecyloxy)−2-furoic acid (TOFA) or ACC1 expression was reduced with a specific siRNA. Both of these approaches significantly increased the levels of acetyl-CoA in the HT22 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L and N</xref>). If acetyl-CoA is a key metabolite that contributes to the biological activity of CMS121 and J147, then inhibiting ACC1 activity or reducing its levels should phenocopy the compounds' neuroprotective effects. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M and O</xref> show that both approaches were neuroprotective in HT22 cells exposed to glutamate. Similarly, both CMS121 and J147 as well as knocking down ACC1 expression protected HT22 cells from ferroptosis induced by RSL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P and Q</xref>), a non-apoptotic form of regulated cell death that is similar to oxytosis, including mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewerenz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tan et al., 2001</xref>).

As such, our laboratory has developed a novel drug discovery program based upon cell-based screening assays that mimic multiple aspects of old age-associated neurodegeneration and AD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prior et al., 2014</xref>) and has used a rapidly aging mouse model to study drug candidate effects in the context of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Currais et al., 2015b</xref>). This approach has led to the identification of CMS121 and J147, two potent neuroprotective small molecules. Because these compounds have different structures, but are effective in the same in vitro models of toxicities associated with the aging brain, we asked if they could be used to identify metabolic changes associated with age-related cognitive dysfunction, leading to the identification of novel therapeutic targets.</p><p>CMS121 and J147 were able to reduce age-related cognitive dysfunction, even when administered to SAMP8 mice at a late stage of their lives. In addition, CMS121 and J147 share a common mechanism of action that is associated with the maintenance of mitochondrial health in terms of transcriptional stability and metabolism. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the hallmarks of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>), and an acceleration in this dysfunction may be responsible for the onset of AD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Swerdlow and Khan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yin et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, mitochondria represent an important therapeutic target for the treatment of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Caldwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Onyango et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with these observations, CMS121 and J147 reduced several molecular parameters of brain aging. PCA and drift analysis of the transcriptome showed that the two compounds significantly prevented changes in gene expression associated with aging. The level of suppression by CMS121 was particularly remarkable as evidenced in the correlation plots. Although not as strong, J147 also significantly prevented transcriptomic aging, which is in accordance with what we found in the SAMP8 mice treated from a young age (3 months old) with this drug candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Currais et al., 2015b</xref>).</p><p>The drift suppression was not as strong at the level of the brain metabolites as it was with gene expression. Instead, numerous metabolites that did not change with age were directly altered by the compounds. The effects of CMS121 and J147 on certain metabolic pathways and individual metabolites were very specific, namely the increase in acyl carnitines. Since acyl carnitines are direct substrates for fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria and a source of acetyl-CoA, they further support the conclusion that the compounds have a direct effect on mitochondrial metabolism in the brain. CMS121 and J147 also suppressed the metabolic drift in the plasma, indicating that the compounds may prevent the aging process at the systemic level as well.</p><p>Pathway analysis of the transcriptome identified genes that code for proteins that are part of the ETC and ATP synthase as being preferentially maintained at the younger level by the compounds. Mitochondria-related genes were also the top pathways affected by aging, indicating that mitochondrial dysfunction is part of the SAMP8 aging process. Because a decrease in mitochondrial DNA copy number was found with aging, the increased expression of gene transcripts associated with the ETC with aging is likely a compensatory response to a lack of adequate mitochondrial metabolism. The conclusion is supported by the observation that deficits in the respiratory chain and mitochondrial bioenergetics increase as a function of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Caldwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>), and by our data showing significant alterations in a number of TCA cycle metabolites in 13 months old SAMP8 mice.</p><p>Acetyl-CoA is a key metabolite that bridges glycolysis, fatty acid β-oxidation, fatty acid synthesis and the TCA cycle in the mitochondria. Its metabolism in the TCA cycle leads to the production of metabolites that are used in other metabolic pathways essential for the proper functioning of the cell, including the neurotransmitter acetylcholine which is reduced in forebrain neurons at early stages of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mufson et al., 2008</xref>). Acetyl-CoA is also used by histone acetyltransferases to acetylate histones and thus regulate memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mews et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the TCA cycle generates reducing potential that is used by the ETC. Therefore, our data have substantial implications for the therapeutic use of CMS121 and J147 in AD, given that deficits in mitochondrial metabolism are thought to play a key role in the cognitive dysfunction of AD patients.</p><p>Although acetyl-CoA can be derived from multiple sources, our data argue that the elevation of acetyl-CoA by the compounds is due to the inhibition of ACC1 via its phosphorylation by AMPK. This conclusion is based on the following observations: 1) both compounds cause ACC1 phosphorylation in vivo, primary neurons, HT22 cells and fibroblasts, and increase acetyl-CoA levels in all four models; 2) knockdown of ACC1 increases acetyl-CoA levels and provides neuroprotection; 3) chemical inhibition of ACC1 also increases acetyl-CoA levels and provides neuroprotection; and 4) absence of AMPK prevents the inhibition of ACC1, increases in acetyl-CoA levels and reduces the protection against oxytosis.</p><p>One of the few clinical approaches targeting mitochondrial metabolism that has been tested in the context of AD is the use of ketogenic diets. In animals, ketone bodies are mainly produced in the liver from fatty acid β-oxidation through acetyl-CoA and are then transported via blood to other tissues, such as the brain, where they are once again metabolized to generate acetyl-CoA. Administration of a variety of ketogenic diets has been shown to have some positive effects in both AD transgenic mice as well as human AD patients (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lange et al., 2017</xref>). Because CMS121 and J147 increase acetyl-CoA levels in the brains of animals and in vitro, our data suggest a therapeutic alternative to the ketogenic diet that leads to an improvement in mitochondrial health as well as an improvement in other parameters of aging.</p><p>Acetyl-CoA, along with several mitochondrial metabolites, has been directly implicated in the regulation of gene expression via the modification of chromatin (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kinnaird et al., 2016</xref>). Histone acetylation requires acetyl-CoA that is synthesized in the cytoplasm and nucleus from acetate, citrate or pyruvate. These metabolites are intermediates of the TCA cycle and were all found to be altered with aging in SAMP8 mice. Other TCA metabolites, such as fumarate and succinate have been identified as inhibitors of Jumonji-C (JMJC) domain-containing histone demethylases (JHDMs) and TET demethylases, which rely on the TCA metabolite α-ketoglutarate as a co-substrate. The levels of all these metabolites were also altered in the brains of 13 months old SAMP8 mice. CMS121 and J147 decreased the levels of succinate and α-ketoglutarate. Therefore, it is not unexpected that alterations in mitochondrial metabolism in the 13 months old SAMP8 mice would be followed by changes at the level of gene expression.</p><p>It should be noted that, due to limitations in the amount of material, the transcriptomic analysis was carried out with brain hippocampus and that the metabolomic study was performed with brain cortex. Despite being from two different brain regions, the interpretation of the global effects of the compounds on these parameters with aging still hold valid. This is because network analysis using GAM identified acetyl-CoA as a central metabolite regulated by CMS121 and J147 in both cortex and hippocampus, and this finding was validated in primary neurons and HT22 cells. In addition, both transcriptomics and metabolomics also identified mitochondrial dysfunction as a feature of aging in SAMP8 mice in both tissues.</p><p>The link between brain acetyl-CoA metabolism and behavioral improvement caused by CMS121 and J147 may be the increased acetylation of H3K9, known to regulate the expression of genes involved in memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mews et al., 2017</xref>). H3K9 acetylation was reduced in the brains of old SAMP8 mice as well as in the brains of APPswe/PSEN1dE9 transgenic AD mice. Both CMS121 and J147 increased acetylation at this site in the mouse brains as well as in primary cortical neurons. The ability of these compounds to prevent a large number of transcriptomic changes with aging might thus be a consequence of their direct effects on acetyl-CoA-mediated histone modifications.</p><p>The reason that the compounds share a common effect on metabolism is likely related to the fact that the same cell-based screening platform was used to identify both. In fact, some of these assays are characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, such as the glutamate-directed oxytosis assay in HT22 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prior et al., 2014</xref>). We show that, despite engaging distinct initial molecular targets in the cell, the compounds activate mechanisms that overlap at the level of mitochondrial metabolism, leading to the same phenotypic outcome.</p><p>In conclusion, when administered at advanced stages of aging and cognitive dysfunction, two structurally distinct AD drug candidates preserve brain mitochondrial homeostasis during this period of life, making mice appear younger at the level of cognition, transcription and metabolism. The analysis of molecular pathways based upon data overlapping the action of CMS121 and J147 and respective mechanistic validation identified a unique neuroprotective mechanism that maintains acetyl-CoA levels in cell culture and animal models of aging and AD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Because mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of both old age and AD, it follows that other therapies that target acetyl-CoA in the brain may preserve mitochondrial homeostasis and prevent the metabolic deficits in AD patients that occur with aging.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary diagram.</title><p>CMS121 and J147 preserve brain mitochondrial homeostasis with aging via a neuroprotective mechanism that regulates acetyl-CoA metabolism.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47866-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design</title><p>Twenty-three 9 months old female SAMP8 mice were fed with vehicle diet (LabDiet 5015, TestDiet, Richmond, IN), and twenty-two and twenty-two 9 months old female SAMP8 mice were fed with CMS121 and J147 diets, respectively (LabDiet 5015 + 400ppm CMS121, LabDiet 5015 + 200ppm J147, TestDiet).

A video-tracking system (Noldus EthoVision) was used to automatically collect behavioral data. The software was installed on a PC computer with a digital video camera mounted overhead on the ceiling, which automatically detected and recorded when mice entered the open or closed arms of the maze and the time spent in each. Mice were habituated to the room 24 hr before testing and habituated to the maze for 1 min before testing by placing them in the center of the maze and blocking entry to the arms. Mice were then tested for a 5 min period and their behavior recorded. Disinhibition was measured by comparing the time spent on the open arms to time spent on the closed arms.</p><p>Barnes maze - The maze consisted of a flat circular surface (36’ diameter) with 20 equally spaced holes (2’ diameter) along the outer edge. One of the holes led to a dark hide box while the other 19 led to false boxes that were too small to be entered. The latency to enter the hide box was recorded. The test was conducted in three phases. Phase 1 (Training): A hide box was placed under one of the holes. Animals were placed into an opaque cylinder in the center of the maze for 30 s to promote spatial disorientation at the start of the test. After 30 s, the cylinder was removed and the animal explored the maze until it found and entered the hide box. The number of incorrect entries was scored. If the mouse failed to enter the box within 3 min, it was gently led into the box. The animal remained in the box for an additional 20 s before it was removed from the boxed and gently placed into the home cage. Training is repeated three times a day for four days. The location of the hide box remained the same during every trial but it was shifted between subjects to reduce the potential for unintended intra-maze cues. Phase 2 (Retention): This phase measures retention of spatial memory following a delay. After a two day break from training, each animal was re-tested for a one day, three-trial session using the same hide box location as before. Phase 3 (Reversal): This phase examines memory reversal. On the day following the retention phase, a new hide box location was established 180 degrees to the original location. The same method as before was used and trials were repeated three times a day over two consecutive days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Western blots were carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Currais et al., 2015b</xref>).

Although these compounds target different upstream pathways, they are capable of preventing age-associated cognitive decline and metabolic changes in the mouse model. Using transcriptomics and metabolomics, the authors identified that the target pathways converge on the TCA cycle, and acetyl-CoA specifically, demonstrating its causative role in neuroprotection. The study not only enhances the translational value of the two compounds but also provides deeper understanding of processes that are effectively modulated in the course of drug administration. This study is also relevant for the broad audience, because it brings an important step in understanding of age-related pathologies, and provides a new concept to develop prevention strategies and cures.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Elevating acetyl-CoA levels reduces aspects of brain aging&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lee-way Jin (Reviewer #1); Martin Denzel (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers find the data valuable and interesting. However, they raised several points that must be addressed in the revised version. As you will see from the reviewers detailed comments appended below, the work requires a number of substantial revisions addressing the concerns. The number of them are to be addressed by additional justifications, explanations or toning down the interpretations. Specifically, the reviewers require to explain and justify an inconsistent experimental design, including the thorough analyses of statistical significance. The reviewers also agree that the manuscript should be experimentally enriched addressing the role of AMPK in mediating these effects. These additional experiments should be performed as thoroughly as possible given the time frame for revisions, i.e. focusing on most important effects and using cultured rat cortical neurons.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The data are complex; the readers will benefit from a diagram illustrating key pathways affected by senescence and by CMS121 and J147. Also, the authors state that &quot;the coordinated responses at the gene expression level with aging represent a compensatory mechanism that is linked to dysregulation at the metabolic level&quot;. However, the authors only present correlational data and no evidence for this compensatory mechanism.</p><p>The description/explanation of the numbers and sexes of mice used is confusing:</p><p>1) The authors used only female SAMP8 mice because &quot;women are at a higher risk than men of developing AD&quot;. However, this is not exactly a study on AD. On the other hand, when it came to AD mice, only male APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice were used.</p><p>2) &quot;Eleven 9 months old male SAMP8 mice were used as the baseline control group.&quot; It is not clear how male &quot;baseline&quot; mice were used (in which experiments) and how their values were compared to female baseline.</p><p>3) The Materials and methods indicates 4 mice per treatment group; however, it is indicated in Figure 1, n=5-6/group, and in Figure 2, n=11-18/group. Please clarify. A group number of 4 for behavioral tests is not likely feasible.</p><p>4) Subsection “Increases in acetyl-CoA levels are neuroprotective and are associated with inhibition of ACC1 by CMS121 and J147”: there is no Figure 1I, 1J and 1K.</p><p>5) Materials and methods: &quot;Because the SAMP8 mice are an inbred strain, the effect of the compounds was only assessed in older SAMP8 mice after the four months of treatment.&quot; Please explain.</p><p>6) Subsection “CMS121 and J147 enhance acetyl-CoA levels and histone acetylation in neurons”: &quot;acetylation of H3K9 (in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice) was increased by the compounds&quot;. However, the data and figure legend are confusing. First, comparing Figure 6—figure supplement 1 (D and E) and (F and G) – the Ac-H3K9 level of Tg-AD animals in the latter is much smaller than the former (comparing the green bars), even they appears to be from similar animals. Second, in the legend to Figure 6—figure supplement 1, it is described that tissue in D and E was from 18 months and tissue in F and G was from 23 months. Why was that?</p><p>The transcriptome was done in the hippocampus while the metabolome was analysed in the cortex. This and how it affects the analysis of the data need to be explained.</p><p>The SAMP8 model needs to be interpreted more carefully regarding normal WT aging. In this context, it would be helpful to compare SAMP8 aging data with published data from WT mice during aging. This would solidify the model. Further, I wonder to what extent the changes in SAMP8 are representative for changes in AD?</p><p>The Western blots in Figure 6 show only minor changes. For example, the blot in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 A does not support the change documented in Figure 6C regarding Ac-H3K9. In Figure 6H, pACC1 levels go up with age, while compounds change the signal in the same direction. Thus, these data need to be interpreted more carefully.</p><p>The authors have previously identified ATP synthase as a target of J147, with downstream AMPK activation. Is this effect on ATP synthase responsible for the observed effects on the ETC, ACC1 and acetylation? This would be a plausible explanation but is only mentioned in the Introduction. It is therefore essential to experimentally test the role of AMPK in this context. Are the changes caused by the compounds regarding TCA metabolite levels, ACC1 phosphorylation, H3K9 acetylation, and neuroprotection caused by increased AMPK activity?</p><p>A color code label is missing for Figure 3 G and H.</p><p>The authors state in Figure 3A and B that the majority of the changed genes are the same. It would be great to back this up by showing the overlap. What proportion of these genes are the upregulated fraction?</p><p>The text does not properly explain the neurotoxicity assay in Figure 6E.</p><p>Generally, the text should follow the order of the figures. In the manuscript, the reader has to jump between sections, making it harder to read. The results in Figures 4, 5, and 6, for example, are presented in a way that is a bit confusing. It would be better to arrange the figures to the order of the text or change the text so that it is not necessary to jump between the figures.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Elevating acetyl-CoA levels reduces aspects of brain aging&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Why was that?</p></disp-quote><p>These tissues were generated as part of two separate studies with Tg-AD mice that we had carried out previously. The tissues were already available in our laboratory. Therefore, the differences observed in H3K9 acetylation between mice from the two independent studies might be explained by the age difference. This has been clarified in the Materials and methods and legend of Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The transcriptome was done in the hippocampus while the metabolome was analysed in the cortex. This and how it affects the analysis of the data need to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>There was not enough tissue to carry out both the transciptomics and metabolomics with the same area of the brain. Based upon data for pathway identification, the global effects of the compounds on these parameters with aging still hold valid despite being from two different parts of the brain, both of which are affected in aging and AD. This is because network analysis using genes and metabolites (GAM) identified acetyl-CoA as a central metabolite regulated by CMS121 and J147 in both cortex and hippocampus, and this finding was further validated in primary neurons, HT22 cells and fibroblasts. In addition, both transcriptomics and metabolomics also identified mitochondrial dysfunction as a feature of aging in SAMP8 mice in both tissues. We have added this information to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The SAMP8 model needs to be interpreted more carefully regarding normal WT aging. In this context, it would be helpful to compare SAMP8 aging data with published data from WT mice during aging. This would solidify the model. Further, I wonder to what extent the changes in SAMP8 are representative for changes in AD?</p></disp-quote><p>There are a large number of publications detailing how the phenotype developed by SAMP8 mice with aging is directly relevant to brain aging, and why they should be considered as a model of dementia and sporadic AD (Butterfield et al., 2005; Pallas et al., 2008; Takeda, 2009; Morley et al., 2012; Akiguchi et al., 2017). Some of the pathological traits developed by the SAMP8 mice with aging that are also found in AD include: progressive decline in brain function with early deterioration in learning and memory; increased oxidative stress; inflammation; vascular impairment; gliosis; Aβ accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation (Takeda, 2009; Morley et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2014). It is very difficult to compare changes at the molecular level between different strains of mice due to the genetic variability inherent to each strain. There is no ideal mouse model for AD at the moment, but the SAMP8 mice appear to be one of the best to study the overlap of aging and AD. This information and respective references were added and discussed more thoroughly in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Western blots in Figure 6 show only minor changes. For example, the blot in S5A does not support the change documented in Figure 6C regarding Ac-H3K9. In Figure 6H, pACC1 levels go up with age, while compounds change the signal in the same direction. Thus, these data need to be interpreted more carefully.</p></disp-quote><p>The data presented in Figure 6C is a result of unbiased band quantification. It should be noted that values of H3K9 acetylation were normalized to total H3 protein, which may be visually misleading. We agree with the reviewers that the data should be interpreted carefully and that is what we tried to do. One possible explanation for the increases in ACC1 phosphorylation in SAMP8 mice with aging could be that this increase represents a compensatory mechanism. This information has now been discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have previously identified ATP synthase as a target of J147, with downstream AMPK activation. Is this effect on ATP synthase responsible for the observed effects on the ETC, ACC1 and acetylation? This would be a plausible explanation but is only mentioned in the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous study (Goldberg et al., 2017), we showed that decreasing ATP synthase activity activated AMPK and increased ACC1 phosphorylation. Because ATP synthase has only been identified as the target of J147 and not CMS121, it was not the focus of our study. However, we did carry out experiments to address the role of AMPK in the signaling pathway identified, and these new data were added to the revised text, as detailed next.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is therefore essential to experimentally test the role of AMPK in this context. Are the changes caused by the compounds regarding TCA metabolite levels, ACC1 phosphorylation, H3K9 acetylation, and neuroprotection caused by increased AMPK activity?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now tested the role of AMPK in the mode of action of CMS121 and J147. Using fibroblasts (obtained from Ruben Shaw at Salk Institute) that do not express AMPK (knock out) we show that, similar to what we had found with J147 (Goldberg et al., 2017), the absence of AMPK also reduces the protection against oxytosis by CMS121. In addition, we show that the absence of AMPK prevents the phosphorylation (inhibition) of ACC1 as well as the consequent increases in acetyl-CoA levels. These new data are described in the text and appended as Figure 6—figure supplement 2. Altogether, these results support our conclusion that ACC1 may be a novel target for AD therapy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A color code label is missing for Figure 3 G and H.</p></disp-quote><p>The label has been added to the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state in Figure 3A and B that the majority of the changed genes are the same.

In addition, this information was made clearer in the text, &quot;The top KEGG pathway targeted by both aging and CMS121 was oxidative phosphorylation (OP). […] Surprisingly, the expression of all these genes went up between 9 and 13 months in the SAMP8 mice and this was prevented by CMS121 and J147 (Figure 3C).&quot;. The figure legend was also altered accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The text does not properly explain the neurotoxicity assay in Figure 6E.</p></disp-quote><p>This was made clearer in the text, &quot;The primary phenotypic screening model used in our laboratory to identify CMS121 and J147 (Chen et al., 2011; Chiruta et al., 2012) (Figure 6E) relies on the lethal induction of mitochondrial ROS in the mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22 (Prior et al., 2014), a programmed cell death pathway called oxytosis with physiological features similar to those implicated in the nerve cell damage seen in aging and AD (Currais and Maher, 2013; Tan, Schubert, and Maher, 2001). Oxytosis can be triggered by glutamate which inhibits cystine uptake via system X<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup>, leading to depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH), production of ROS and cell death (Tan et al., 2001)&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Generally, the text should follow the order of the figures.
