are largely unknown. We studied the role of calcium-activator protein for secretion (CAPS) proteins in neuronal DCV secretion at single vesicle resolution. Endogenous CAPS-1 co-localized with synaptic markers but was not enriched at every synapse. Deletion of CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 did not affect DCV biogenesis, loading, transport or docking, but DCV secretion was reduced by 70% in CAPS-1/CAPS-2 double null mutant (DKO) neurons and remaining fusion events required prolonged stimulation. CAPS deletion specifically reduced secretion of stationary DCVs. CAPS-1-EYFP expression in DKO neurons restored DCV secretion, but CAPS-1-EYFP and DCVs rarely traveled together. Synaptic localization of CAPS-1-EYFP in DKO neurons was calcium dependent and DCV fusion probability correlated with synaptic CAPS-1-EYFP expression. These data indicate that CAPS-1 promotes fusion competence of immobile (tethered) DCVs in presynaptic terminals and that CAPS-1 localization to DCVs is probably not essential for this role.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05438.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05438.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05438.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our ability to think and act is due to the remarkable capacity of the brain to process complex information. This involves nerve cells (or neurons) communicating with each other in a rapid and precise manner by releasing synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters across the gaps—called synapses—between neurons. In addition to this fast neurotransmitter signalling, neurons can transmit signals by releasing chemical signals called neuropeptides. Neuropeptides are major regulators of human brain function, including mood, anxiety, and social interactions.</p><p>Neuropeptides and other neuromodulators such as serotonin and dopamine are normally packaged into bubble-like compartments called dense-core vesicles. Compared to synaptic vesicles we know much less about how dense-core vesicles are trafficked and released. Dense-core vesicles are generally mobile and move around the inside of cells to release neuropeptides where and when they are needed. However, some vesicles are stationary and may even be loosely tethered to the cell membrane. Most of the sites where dense-core vesicles can fuse with the cell membrane are at synapses.</p><p>Previous work has suggested that the protein CAPS-1 is important for moving dense-core vesicles to the correct sites on the cell membrane, and for releasing neuropeptides across the synapses of worms and flies. However, detailed insights into this process in mammalian neurons are lacking.</p><p>By examining neurons from both normal mice and mice lacking the CAPS-1 protein, Farina et al. have now analyzed the role CAPS-1 plays in releasing neuropeptides. In cells lacking CAPS-1 fewer dense-core vesicles merged with the cell membrane than in cells containing the protein. However, a new technique that tracks the movement of individual vesicles revealed that only stationary dense-core vesicles had difficulties fusing; mobile vesicles continued to fuse with the cell membrane in the normal manner. Introducing CAPS-1 into cells lacking this protein corrected the fusion defect experienced by the stationary vesicles.</p><p>Farina et al. also showed that CAPS-1 was present at most—but not all—synapses, and synapses that had more CAPS-1 released more neuropeptides. This work shows that CAPS proteins strongly influence the probability of dense-core vesicle release and that neurons can tune this probability at individual synapses by controlling the expression of CAPS. Future work will be aimed at understanding how neurons can achieve this and which protein domains in CAPS are required.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

for brain development and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McAllister et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang and Reichardt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Samson and Medcalf, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van den Pol, 2012</xref>). These neuromodulators are transported in dense-core vesicles (DCVs). Dysregulation of DCV transport and fusion is associated with cognitive and post-traumatic stress disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sadakata et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sah and Geracioti, 2013</xref>). DCVs bud off at the Golgi network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2006</xref>) and are transported via microtubule-based motor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schlager and Hoogenraad, 2009</xref>). High-frequency firing facilitates DCV fusion and the resultant calcium influx triggers SNARE complex-dependent DCV secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartfai et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hartmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van de Bospoort et al., 2012</xref>). Unlike synaptic vesicles (SVs), DCVs lack a local recycling mechanism. To ensure a constant and uniform supply of DCVs at release sites, DCVs are generally very dynamic although some DCVs are stationary. Stimulation triggers arrest of moving DCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Wit et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shakiryanova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsuda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wong et al., 2012</xref>), probably promoting their local availability for secretion. DCV fusion sites can be located in the entire neuron but DCVs preferentially fuse at presynaptic terminals and release at extra-synaptic sites requires more robust stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van de Bospoort et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, we have shown that Munc13 is an important regulator of DCV fusion at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van de Bospoort et al., 2012</xref>). However, in contrast to SV release, a comprehensive insight in the molecular mechanisms of DCV secretion is still lacking.</p><p>Previous studies in Caenorhabditis <italic>elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> have implicated calcium-activator protein for secretion (CAPS) proteins in DCV secretion. Mutants of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> CAPS ortholog UNC-31 show reduced peptide release without affecting synaptic vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Speese et al., 2007</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons, UNC-31 is required for the docking of DCVs at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hammarlund et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, deletion of dCAPS also affects DCV release but in contrast to <italic>C. elegans</italic>, leads to an increased DCV presence in terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Renden et al., 2001</xref>). Mammals express two CAPS genes, CAPS-1 and CAPS-2, which are complementarily expressed in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Speidel et al., 2003</xref>) and are essential for synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jockusch et al., 2007</xref>). In adrenal chromaffin cells, CAPS-1 deletion affects catecholamine uptake in chromaffin granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Speidel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunk et al., 2009</xref>) and deletion of CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 abolishes their fusion without affecting docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). CAPS-2 is important for cerebellar development and neuron survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sadakata et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2007a</xref>), and deletion of CAPS-1 in cerebellar neurons perturbs DCV trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sadakata et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2013</xref>). Hence, these studies suggest that CAPS proteins are involved in several aspects of DCV trafficking and release in invertebrates and in mammalian chromaffin cells, but their role in mammalian versus invertebrate systems appears to differ considerably, especially regarding synaptic transmission and cell survival.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed the distribution and function of CAPS proteins in DCV trafficking and fusion in mammalian neurons using wild type (WT), CAPS-2 null mutant and CAPS-1/2 null mutant mice. Endogenous CAPS-1 was present in puncta that partially overlapped with synaptic markers and also co-localized with DCV markers. CAPS deletion did not affect DCV biogenesis, neuropeptide loading or average DCV transport velocity. In CAPS double null mutant (DKO) neurons, DCV fusion was strongly reduced at synapses and at extra-synaptic sites. We developed a novel release assay to track single DCVs prior to fusion and found that CAPS deletion strongly affected DCV release of stationary, presumably tethered vesicles. We provide evidence that CAPS-1 localization at synapses is calcium dependent and that DCV release probability correlates with synaptic CAPS-1 expression levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CAPS-1 is present at synapses and overlaps with secretory vesicles markers</title><p>To understand CAPS-1 function in neuronal DCV release, we first investigated its sub-cellular localization in cultured neurons. Hippocampal neurons at 14 days in vitro (DIV 14) were stained with a novel, CAPS-1-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). CAPS-1 was present in the cytosol and in dendritic and axonal puncta, probably membrane domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Approximately 45% of these CAPS-1 puncta co-localized with the synaptic marker VGLUT1 in the entire neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>, Pearson's coefficient: 0.42±0.04, n=7). CAPS-1 immunoreactivity was detectable in approximately 60% of VGLUT1 positive synapses and vice versa approximately 60% of the CAPS-1 puncta co-localized with VGLUT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, D</xref>, Manders' coefficients CAPS-1 in VGLUT1: 0.67±0.08, and VGLUT1 in CAPS-1: 0.64±0.05, n=8). CAPS-1 domains were also found at extra-synaptic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, E</xref>, white arrowheads). The CAPS-1 expression pattern differed from the sub-cellular localization of the DCV priming protein Munc13-1, which was much more restricted to the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>, Pearson's coefficient in the entire neuron: 0.64±0.04, n=10) with 96% of synapses containing M13-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, number of synapses containing M13-1: 96.3±0.7%, n=4, number of synapses containing CAPS-1: 58.1±10.9%, n=7). Since CAPS proteins have been initially identified as DCV resident proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berwin et al., 1998</xref>), we tested the co-localization of CAPS-1 with DCVs in hippocampal neurons. Using the endogenous DCV protein chromogranin B (ChrB) we found that the majority of DCVs are located in the axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Antibody incompatibility precluded co-staining of CAPS-1 antibody with antibodies against ChrB. Therefore, we used the DCV cargo neuropeptide Y (NPY) fused to Venus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nagai et al., 2002</xref>), which showed more than 80% co-localization with this endogenous marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H, I</xref>, Manders' coefficients for chromogranin B in NPY-Venus puncta: 0.97±0.02, and NPY-Venus in ChrB puncta: 0.84±0.01, n=14). Approximately 35% of NPY-Venus labeled DCVs co-localized with endogenous CAPS-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–L</xref>, Pearson's coefficient: 0.45±0.05, n=21, number of NPY-labeled DCVs co-expressing CAPS-1: 34.71±3.03%, n=6). These data show that endogenous CAPS-1 is present at many but not all synapses. In addition, CAPS-1 domains are found at extra-synaptic regions and CAPS-1 partly co-localizes with DCV markers.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05438.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CAPS-1 clusters are present at synaptic and extra-synaptic sites and partly co-localize with DCVs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example image of a hippocampal neuron (DIV 14) stained for endogenous CAPS-1 (green), dendrite marker MAP2 (blue) and synapse marker VGLUT1 (red).

Persistent events are typical for cargo that interacts with the intra-vesicular matrix like Semaphorin. These events are very rare when using NPY as cargo.

CAPS-1 is present at synapses and co-localizes with DCV markers but rarely travels together with dynamic DCVs. Using two DCV secretion assays we found that CAPS-1 deletion strongly impaired synaptic and extra-synaptic DCV release in hippocampal neurons. CAPS-1 deletion did not reduce the presence or docking of DCVs at synaptic sites, but strongly affected DCV secretion of stationary DCVs. Synaptic expression levels of CAPS-1 were modulated by neuronal activity and correlated with DCV release probability. CAPS-1 thus functions as a priming protein at synaptic and extra-synaptic sites, promoting the fusion competence of stationary DCVs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>CAPS-1 is present at mammalian synapses and overlaps with secretory vesicles markers</title><p>CAPS-1 was identified as a brain protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Walent et al., 1992</xref>) that binds membranes associated with DCV secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berwin et al., 1998</xref>) and stimulates calcium-dependent fusion of secretory vesicles in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mennerick et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loyet et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grishanin et al., 2002</xref>). This suggests that CAPS-1 might be a DCV resident protein that is delivered to sites of exocytosis on DCVs. However, we observed that in mammalian neurons endogenous CAPS-1 localized in axonal and dendritic domains that often, but not always, co-localized with synaptic and DCV markers. Cell-wide CAPS-1 co-localization with the canonical DCV marker NPY yielded an average co-localization of only 35%. Furthermore, in CAPS DKO neurons rescued with CAPS-1-EYFP, DCVs and CAPS-1-EYFP only rarely traveled together. Finally, the increased dynamics of synaptic CAPS-1-EYFP with CAPS-1 redistribution upon stimulation are best explained by diffusion (see below) but not with a redistribution of vesicular CAPS-1. Thus, in mature mammalian neurons, CAPS-1 does not appear to be a general DCV-resident protein, but a dynamic, cytosolic factor translocating to synapses and extra-synaptic sites in an activity-dependent manner to promote fusion of pre-docked (tethered) DCVs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A post-docking role for CAPS-1 in DCV fusion</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> show that in the absence of CAPS-1, DCV fusion in hippocampal neurons is severely impaired, without defects in vesicle biogenesis and loading of endogenous or exogenous DCV cargo proteins. In addition, analysis of DCV dynamics in our live cell imaging experiments and intra-synaptic localization on electron micrographs of CAPS DKO neurons revealed that CAPS-1 deletion does not affect DCV trafficking along microtubules, synaptic accumulation and membrane docking of DCVs. Together, this suggests that in mature neurons most CAPS-1 molecules interact with DCVs after these vesicles arrived at the plasma membrane. This conclusion is consistent with observations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junctions where deletion of dCaps results in an increase in the number of DCVs present at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Renden et al., 2001</xref>) and the lack of a docking defect upon deletion of CAPS-1/-2 in adrenal chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). However, chemical fixation used in our study might produce artifacts that change the precise distance between vesicles and the membrane. As a consequence, vesicles touching the membrane in fixed tissue may in fact have been at a short distance from the membrane. Recent excellent work using cryo-fixation and EM tomography to analyse docking of SVs and DCVs in central synapses of several mutant mouse strains including CAPS DKO showed that SV docking is impaired in CAPS DKO neurons. In line with our findings, DCVs were present in similar numbers in CAPS DKO synapses. However, although not statistically significant, the distribution of DCVs within 200 nm of the active zone appeared to be reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imig et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, general consensus exists on a post-synapse delivery role for CAPS but future studies using cryo-fixation might unmask (subtle) docking defects upon CAPS loss.</p><p>CAPS-1 likely functions at the final stages of DCV fusion, interacting with proteins and lipids that function in DCV docking, priming and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grishanin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sadakata et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">James et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parsaud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sah and Geracioti, 2013</xref>). CAPS-1 changes the conformation of syntaxin-1 from a state incompatible with SNARE-complex formation (‘closed-state’), to a state that allows formation of functional SNARE complexes (‘open-state’), as release in CAPS DKO chromaffin cells is rescued by expression of an ‘open’-variant of syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2010</xref>) and overexpression of open syntaxin can bypass the requirement for CAPS in DCV docking in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hammarlund et al., 2008</xref>). CAPS-1 shares this characteristic with Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van de Bospoort et al., 2012</xref>).

The fact that both proteins appear to bind syntaxin-1 via different binding modes may account for this non-redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parsaud et al., 2013</xref>). A recent paper indeed showed that CAPS-2 and Munc13 use different mechanisms to prime vesicles, whereas Munc13-dependent priming requires its MUN domain this domain in CAPS-2 is dispensable for priming. Instead CAPS-2 appears to require its PIP2 binding pleckstrin homology domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen Truong et al., 2014</xref>). We found that both proteins play important stimulatory roles in DCV release from mammalian neurons. However, functional differences were evident: CAPS-1 deletion resulted in a larger reduction of DCV release events compared to deletion of Munc13-1 with a ±70% reduction in CAPS DKO (this study) and ±60% reduction in Munc13 DKO neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van de Bospoort et al., 2012</xref>). For synaptic vesicle fusion the situation is opposite: Munc13 DKO neurons clearly show larger defects in synaptic transmission than CAPS DKO neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jockusch et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>CAPS-1 displayed a different expression pattern than Munc13-1. Munc13-1 expression is strictly synaptic and specifically supports DCV secretion from synapses, while being dispensable for extra-synaptic secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van de Bospoort et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, CAPS-1 accumulations are found at many synapses, but not all, and at extra-synaptic sites along neurites. Also, CAPS-1 deletion equally affects DCV release from synapses and from extra-synaptic sites. Finally, CAPS-1 redistributes from synapses during activity while Munc13-1 does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalla et al., 2006</xref>). These differences in (re)distribution suggest that (1) CAPS-1 domains at extra-synaptic sites promote DCV release independently of Munc13-1. However, CAPS-1-dependent extra-synaptic release is less efficient than synaptic DCV release, which indicates that the concerted action of CAPS-1 and Munc13-1 is most efficient in priming DCVs for release. (2) At synapses, CAPS-1 and Munc13-1 have non-redundant roles in promoting DCV release, similar to their non-redundancy in SV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jockusch et al., 2007</xref>). The larger effect of CAPS deletion on DCV release may be explained by the additional reduction of extra-synaptic release events compared to Munc13-1 deletion. Finally, some extra-synaptic DCV release remained in CAPS DKO neurons indicating that extra-synaptic DCV release can occur in the absence of CAPS and Munc13 albeit with very low release probability.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Synaptic activity reorganizes synaptic CAPS-1 levels</title><p>Strong stimulation triggered redistribution of synaptic CAPS-1 into the axonal shaft. This redistribution was very similar to synapsin-ECFP (our work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Richmond et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parsaud et al., 2013</xref>) and is also reported for other synaptic proteins like Rab3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsuriel et al., 2009</xref>), Syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ribrault et al., 2011</xref>) and Munc18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cijsouw et al., 2014</xref>) and for SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheung and Cousin, 2011</xref>). In contrast, the mobility of active zone proteins like Munc13-1 and Bassoon is not affected by acute stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalla et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsuriel et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, synapses rapidly exchange part of their components during high frequency stimulation. This allows synapses to adapt their release probability during and directly after stimulation as we showed for Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cijsouw et al., 2014</xref>). This is also an attractive explanation for the re-distribution of CAPS-1 as we found that synapses with increased CAPS-1 expression levels had a higher release probability than synapses with low/no CAPS-1. CAPS-1 binds to PI 4,5-P2 (PIP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loyet et al., 1998</xref>) and localizes to PIP2 clusters in the plasma membrane via its PIP2-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">James et al., 2008</xref>). The PH domain is also required to prime secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kabachinski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen Truong et al., 2014</xref>). Robust Ca2+ influx in our experiments likely activates phospholipase C, which hydrolysis PIP2 and may trigger CAPS-1 dispersion from synapses. Hence, calcium-dependent PIP2 hydrolysis may act as negative feedback mechanism reducing CAPS-1 availability at the synapse after robust stimulation. In addition to direct membrane interaction, CAPS-1 also binds syntaxin via its MUN domain. Syntaxin also disperses from synapses resulting in CAPS-1 co-dispersion. As Munc13-1 does not show activity-dependent redistribution among synapses but instead increases its membrane-bound fraction upon calcium influx, synapses appear to utilize two distinct mechanisms to control release probabilities during/after high frequency stimulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>SemapHluorin was generated by replacing EGFP in Sema3A-EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Wit et al., 2005</xref>) with super-ecliptic pHluorin (SpH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>).

A 2×2 pixel region (0.4×0.4 μm) was analyzed according to the experiment as follows. Sema and NPY-pHluorin: fluorescent traces were expressed as fluorescence change (∆F) compared to initial fluorescence (F<sub>0</sub>), obtained by averaging the first four frames of the time-lapse recording. A fusion event was counted when fluorescence showed a sudden increase two standard deviations above F<sub>0</sub>. Onset of fusion was defined as the first frame with an increase of fluorescence of two standard deviations above F<sub>0</sub>. A cargo-pHl release event or punctum was scored as synaptic when the fluorescence center of such a release event/punctum was within 200 nm (±1 pixel, the approximate minimal point spread function of our system) of the Synapsin-mCherry fluorescence centroid. Extra-synaptic events were all events that did not meet this criterion. We only measured release events from neurites and excluded somatic release events. Somatic release events cannot be reliably measured using wide-field fluorescence microcopy due to the bright fluorescence from vesicles in/near the Golgi apparatus in which the intraluminal pH is not yet acidic. The total number of vesicles was automatically analyzed from the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> application time lapse using SynD software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmitz et al., 2011</xref>). When using NPY-mCherry: only the fusion events were scored in which NPY-mCherry fluorescence completely disappeared from a 2×2 pixel punctum after bleaching correction (ImageJ Bleaching correction plug-in). DCVs were categorized as stationary or moving based on the slope of the Kymopgraph (ImageJ, MultipleKymograph), if the slope of the line over the kymograph was different from 0 at any point of the movie, the DCV was considered moving.</p><p>CAPS-1-ires-EGFP was used to rescue CAPS DKO neurons in combination with NPY-mCherry for DCV fusion assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>Protein dispersion was analyzed by placing regions of interest (ROIs) at the synapses and analyzing the ΔF over F<sub>0</sub> (average of the first four frames) of Synapsin-ECFP and CAPS-1-EYFP over time.

Your article has been generally favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers. However, several issues were identified that require major revisions before a final decision can be made.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this article, the authors convincingly demonstrate that CAPS positively regulates the exocytosis of stationary large-dense core granules in presynaptic nerve terminals. They used mouse KO, cultured neurons particularly autotaptic, electrophysiology and time-lapsed imaging to reach this conclusion. The authors examine subcellular CAPS-1 localization, DCV localization, DCV loading, DCV docking and fusion in CAPS DKO mutants. The main conclusion of this paper is that CAPS is involved in priming DCVs in neurons, but the manuscript explores CAPS function in detail at many levels and touches on many controversies. There are a large number of conclusions from these data, many at odds with existing literature. The experiments in this manuscript are well designed and executed. Although a role for CAPS in DCV priming is well-established, this manuscript represents the most complete study of CAPS function in DCV secretion in neurons.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The authors attempt to distinguish what they term kiss-and-run from full fusion by employing NPY-pHluorin and NPY-mCherry. They show time course for fluorescent decrease for an event with the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) but not the former. There are several mistaken notions in these studies. Full release of cargo (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) implies nothing about the mode of fusion other than the fusion pore has dilated sufficiently to allow full cargo release. The fusion pore may dilate and reclose and still allow full release of NPY-mCherry (or NPY-pHluorin, not shown). Differences in numbers of events detected with each NPY fusion protein is very likely due to sensitivity of detection, looking for a decrease in red compared to a 100x increase in green fluorescence. This entire section seems to be mistakenly rationalized and inadequately documented.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: What is going on in the bottom cartoon? The text says that semaphorin is secreted, but the figure indicates that there is no secretion. It also indicates that reacidification is instantaneous. Also, it is unclear why the cartoon shows a kiss and run type of event given the rapid spike-like nature of the semaphluorin fluorescence. The authors may wish to consider removing all points and discussions about kiss-and-run vs. full fusion if their available data cannot distinguish between these mechanisms.</p><p>3) There are several errors in citations. The authors cite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Renden et al. 2001</xref>, as evidence that there is no docking defect in <italic>Drosophila</italic> dCAPS mutants.

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Comments by reviewer 1</italic>:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: In the rebuttal (point #2) the authors state that they are showing NPY-pHluorin in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, but they probably mean semaphorin-pHluorin.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the plasma membrane for the docked vesicle on the left is broken. What happened to the membrane between the TM domains of syntaxin? Is this meant to illustrate a hemi-fusion?</p><p>3) The cartoon shows a vesicle opening and the contents rushing from it. In the bottom row, three events are shown. One appears to be a full fusion that does not result in reacidification of the cargo. Two more appear to indicate that the vesicle reacidified without any release of cargo. These seem to have no relationship with the cartoon. There is no explanation of these two kinds of events in the figure legend or in the text (Results section).</p><p>4) In the legend it says that this sudden increase in fluorescence is counted as a fusion event in panels C and E. Does that mean only the one with a permanent increase was scored as fusion events? Or were any increases counted as fusion events? Should these be labeled as “complete release” or “incomplete release”, as described for NPY in the rebuttal? The legend and text needs to be less ambiguous, for example: “Both complete and incomplete release of Semaphorin as labeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> were counted as fusion events in panels C and E.”</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The different assays scored in the top row versus second row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are not clear from looking at the figure. The authors should label the top row 'NPY-pHluorin' and the second row 'NPY-mCherry'.</p><p>6) The events in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref> are all fusions, regardless of whether they were complete or incomplete release. Can the authors indicate what the complete and incomplete fusions look like for NPY-pHluorin. The authors indicate what NPY-mCherry complete release events look like In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, but there is no indication what the events in the top row might look like. This is the exact same problem as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. It is just not clear what is being scored and how these events are assembled into the panels in the figure.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> is labeled 'fusion events', and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> is labeled 'events'. One assumes from looking at the figure that they are the same events. Using 'fusions / cell' and 'complete release / cell' would be clearer.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> shows that 50% of the DKO cells show no release. The authors should make it clear that these cells were excluded from the analyses showing the 50% decrease in the rate of fusions in the top rows. (Otherwise the data can be explained simply by the fact that a fraction of cells failed to respond, not that their rates of fusion were affected).</p><p><italic>Comments by reviewer 3</italic>:</p><p>9) There remains some confusion about studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and their re-interpretation. This issue can be considered minor but some further clarification would be useful. In the original version of the manuscript, increased fluorescence of a pHluorin construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) versus complete loss of fluorescence of an mCherry construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) were interpreted to indicate fusion pore opening and full fusion, respectively. The revised manuscript more appropriately describes what these data indicate but it remains unclear whether these data support the interim conclusion that “incomplete and complete cargo release events were affected (by CAPS KO) to the same extent”. It depends on how these experiments were done. If they were done as suggested in the rebuttal letter: “we compared fusion pore opening (step-like increases in the green channel) to full cargo release (complete loss of signal in the red channel) and concluded that fusion pore openings occur more often than full cargo release” using both channels to detect single events, then the authors' conclusion would stand because they would show pHluorin brightening events that were accompanied by complete or incomplete mCherry loss. If this is the case, the figure legend should indicate this and the authors could consider showing traces pHluorin brightening that were accompanied by either complete or incomplete mCherry loss. If, however, the number of pHluorin brightening’s and mCherry complete losses were determined independently, then it could be the case that sensitivity of event detection favors pHluorin brightening events. From what is currently described in the manuscript, it is unclear.</p><p>10) In the revised manuscript, there is an expanded discussion of how CAPS functions with an emphasis on its PH domain and PIP2. This section needs editing and greater attention to the references cited (see the Nguyen Truong paper for references). What is PLC16?

We have made changes to our manuscript to fully comply with the reviewers’ suggestions and added new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig4 fig7">Figure 1D, I; 2B; 4F; 7 B, C</xref>; and Figure 4–figure supplement 1) and better analysis and discussion of the data, as requested. Together, we feel this has considerably strengthened the conclusions of the data.</p><p><italic>Major comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The authors attempt to distinguish what they term kiss-and-run from full fusion by employing NPY-pHluorin and NPY-mCherry. They show time course for fluorescent decrease for an event with the latter (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref><italic>) but not the former. There are several mistaken notions in these studies. Full release of cargo (shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref><italic>) implies nothing about the mode of fusion other than the fusion pore has dilated sufficiently to allow full cargo release. The fusion pore may dilate and reclose and still allow full release of NPY-mCherry (or NPY-pHluorin, not shown). Differences in numbers of events detected with each NPY fusion protein is very likely due to sensitivity of detection, looking for a decrease in red compared to a 100x increase in green fluorescence. This entire section seems to be mistakenly rationalized and inadequately documented</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers argue that our interpretation of the data in terms of vesicle ‘fusion modes’ is not justified and that partial release might not be detected in the red channel due to sensitivity issues. We agree on both these issues. We have now removed interpretation in terms of fusion modes and made the text more factual. It is not the aim of this study to interpret fusion modes and this should not interfere with the main message on CAPS function. Throughout the manuscript we changed the text: completely disappearing NPY-mCherry puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 D-F</xref>) represent “complete cargo release” (avoiding the term ‘full fusion’), and NPY-pHluorin events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 B-C</xref>) represent fusion pore opening (avoiding the term ‘kiss and run’) with either “complete release” or “incomplete release”, depending on loss in the red channel or not. Regarding the sensitivity issues: we compared fusion pore opening (step-like increases in the green channel) to <italic>full</italic> cargo release (complete loss of signal in the red channel) and concluded that fusion pore openings occur more often than full cargo release. We changed the text (” DCV fusion pore opening can progress to complete release […] synaptic preference of DCV release.”) to make this clearer.</p><p><italic>2)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref><italic>: What is going on in the bottom cartoon? The text says that semaphorin is secreted, but the figure indicates that there is no secretion. It also indicates that reacidification is instantaneous. Also, it is unclear why the cartoon shows a kiss and run type of event given the rapid spike-like nature of the semaphluorin fluorescence. The authors may wish to consider removing all points and discussions about kiss-and-run vs. full fusion if their available data cannot distinguish between these mechanisms</italic>.</p><p>We changed the cartoon to better represent the data, as suggested by the reviewers. For our analysis of fusion events in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> we used the sudden increase in NPY-pHluorin fluorescence as signal for fusion pore opening. We added text in figure legend and results to better explain this. In line with comment #1 we removed our comments on vesicle fusion modes.</p><p><italic>3) There are several errors in citations.

We agree and changed the text to “Synaptic dispersion of CAPS-1-EYFP in DKO neurons was calcium-dependent”. We have recently shown that synaptic dispersion and reclustering of Munc18-1 allows neurons to modulate synaptic strength upon network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cijsouw et al., 2014</xref>). Reclustering of Munc18-1 required PKC activation and was syntaxin 1 independent. CAPS1 membrane association requires its PIP2-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Robust Ca2+ influx in our experiments likely activates phospholipase C (PLC) which hydrolysis PIP2 and may trigger CAPS1 dispersion from synapses. Recent work on CAPS2 shows that the PH-domain is required to prime vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen Truong et al, 2014</xref>). Calcium-dependent PIP2 hydrolysis may therefore act as negative feedback mechanism reducing CAPS1 availability at the synapse upon robust activity. In addition to direct membrane interaction, CAPS1 also binds syntaxin via its MUN domain. Syntaxin also disperses from synapses, which may result in CAPS1 co-dispersion. We added this to the Discussion ” This is also an attractive explanation[…]after high frequency stimulation”.</p><p><italic>14)</italic> “<italic>Deletion of CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 did not affect DCV… docking…</italic>”<italic>. Docking corresponds to a putative functional state of DCVs. It has been measured by conventional fixation EM, rapid freeze EM, and TIRF microscopy for which there is frequent disagreement.

As a consequence, vesicles touching the membrane in fixed tissue may in fact have been at a short distance from the membrane. This is true and we have considered it common knowledge, but we have now added a statement on this in the text. We feel that this fact does not preclude the use of the term ‘docking’ and that the suggested alternative ‘DCVs close to the membrane’ is not better, because this might give the impression that DCVs are positioned accidentally near a membrane. The term ‘docking’, like many words in shipping, has a Dutch origin, in this case the word ‘dok’, which describes a situation in which a vessel can be loaded or unloaded. Whether or not the vessel touches the quay is not defined and typically there is some space between vessel and quay. The essential thing is the functional state (to permit (un)loading), very similar to the reviewer’s definition for vesicles in synapses (‘docking corresponds to a putative functional state’).</p><p>Although earlier reports using chemical fixation of mouse synapses did not find differences in DCV localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jockusch et al., 2007</xref>). The reviewers are right that future studies using cryo-fixation might unmask (subtle) docking defects upon CAPS loss. In fact, Imig et al., using cryo-fixation, found a reduction in the number of docked SVs and a lower, albeit not statistically significant number of DCVs within 200 nm of the active zone between CAPS DKO and controls. We added text to the Discussion to point this out.</p><p><italic>15) In the single cell studies, the authors use the CAPS2 KO as controls to compare with CAPS DKO cells.

We renamed “control” to “CAPS 2KO” to avoid confusion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>We have changed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2 and 3</xref> as suggested by reviewer 1 and added Figure 2–figure supplement 2 to better explain the different fusion modes reported by Semaphluorin.

One appears to be a full fusion that does not result in reacidification of the cargo. Two more appear to indicate that the vesicle reacidified without any release of cargo. These seem to have no relationship with the cartoon. There is no explanation of these two kinds of events in the figure legend or in the text (Results section)</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer is correct; the cartoon does not represent the different fusion modes reported by Semaphluorin. The cartoon and fluorescence traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> illustrate the definition of fusion events counted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-F</xref>: a sudden increase in fluorescence two standard deviations above initial fluorescence (F0). Hence, all 3 events were counted as fusion events. This was not clear in the original figure and we changed the figure adding a grey dotted line representing the 2xSD, and added text to the figure legend and main text (Results section) to make this clearer. We realize that the different traces may raise confusion. Therefore, we added Figure 2–figure supplement 2 to better explain the different fusion modes reported by SemapHluorin.</p><p><italic>4) In the legend it says that this sudden increase in fluorescence is counted as a fusion event in panels C and E. Does that mean only the one with a permanent increase was scored as fusion events? Or were any increases counted as fusion events? Should these be labeled as</italic> “<italic>complete release</italic>” <italic>or</italic> “<italic>incomplete release</italic>”<italic>, as described for NPY in the rebuttal? The legend and text needs to be less ambiguous, for example:</italic> “<italic>Both complete and incomplete release of Semaphorin as labeled in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref> <italic>were counted as fusion events in panels C and E</italic>.”</p><p>We are sorry for the confusion; all 3 events are fusion events. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-F</xref>, we counted all events with an increase in fluorescence two standard deviations above F0.

The different assays scored in the top row versus second row in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>are not clear from looking at the figure.

The authors indicate what NPY-mCherry complete release events look like In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref><italic>, but there is no indication what the events in the top row might look like. This is the exact same problem as in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>.

We added this to figure legend and text. We also added a typical NPY-pHluorin trace to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, which reports a fusion event counted in 3B. After the increase in fluorescence, the decline in fluorescence may represent either NPY-Phluorin cargo diffusion (‘complete release’) or vesicle resealing and re-acidification (‘incomplete release’).

This issue can be considered minor but some further clarification would be useful. In the original version of the manuscript, increased fluorescence of a pHluorin construct (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref><italic>) versus complete loss of fluorescence of an mCherry construct (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3E</italic></xref><italic>) were interpreted to indicate fusion pore opening and full fusion, respectively. The revised manuscript more appropriately describes what these data indicate but it remains unclear whether these data support the interim conclusion that</italic> “<italic>incomplete and complete cargo release events were affected (by CAPS KO) to the same extent</italic>”<italic>. It depends on how these experiments were done. If they were done as suggested in the rebuttal letter:</italic> “<italic>we compared fusion pore opening (step-like increases in the green channel) to full cargo release (complete loss of signal in the red channel) and concluded that fusion pore openings occur more often than full cargo release</italic>” <italic>using both channels to detect single events, then the authors' conclusion would stand because they would show pHluorin brightening events that were accompanied by complete or incomplete mCherry loss. If this is the case, the figure legend should indicate this and the authors could consider showing traces pHluorin brightening that were accompanied by either complete or incomplete mCherry loss. If, however, the number of pHluorin brightening’s and mCherry complete losses were determined independently, then it could be the case that sensitivity of event detection favors pHluorin brightening events. From what is currently described in the manuscript, it is unclear</italic>.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> the number of pHluorin brightening’s and mCherry complete losses were determined independently and the reviewer is correct that we therefore cannot formally exclude that sensitivity of event detection favors pHluorin brightening events. Which would explain why we see more pHluorin events than mCherry disappearances. To exclude any misinterpretation, we changed the concluding sentence of this paragraph to “Thus, deletion of CAPS-1 resulted in a strong reduction of DCV fusion events reported by NPY-Phluorin or NPY-mCherry”.</p><p><italic>10) In the revised manuscript, there is an expanded discussion of how CAPS functions with an emphasis on its PH domain and PIP2. This section needs editing and greater attention to the references cited (see the Nguyen Truong paper for references). What is PLC16? See Kabachinski et al. for discussion of PLCs in CAPS function</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We apologize and corrected citations as suggested. PLC16 is a typo and should state PLC.</p></body></sub-article></article>
