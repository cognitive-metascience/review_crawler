associated with favorable melanoma outcomes. Here, we show that much of the melanoma protective effect likely results from estrogen signaling through the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) on melanocytes. Selective GPER activation in primary melanocytes and melanoma cells induced long-term changes that maintained a more differentiated cell state as defined by increased expression of well-established melanocyte differentiation antigens, increased pigment production, decreased proliferative capacity, and decreased expression of the oncodriver and stem cell marker c-Myc. GPER signaling also rendered melanoma cells more vulnerable to immunotherapy. Systemically delivered GPER agonist was well tolerated, and cooperated with immune checkpoint blockade in melanoma-bearing mice to dramatically extend survival, with up to half of mice clearing their tumor. Complete responses were associated with immune memory that protected against tumor rechallenge. GPER may be a useful, pharmacologically accessible target for melanoma.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GPER</kwd><kwd>GPCR</kwd><kwd>melanoma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 CA206325</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Natale</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 CA163566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ridky</surname><given-names>Todd W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002224</institution-id><institution>Melanoma Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Established Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ridky</surname><given-names>Todd W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50CA174523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ridky</surname><given-names>Todd W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 AR0007465-32</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Natale</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-AR069589</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dentchev</surname><given-names>Tzvete</given-names></name><name><surname>Ridky</surname><given-names>Todd W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Driving melanoma differentiation through G protein-coupled estrogen receptor signaling decreases proliferative capacity, decreases expression of the oncodriver and stem cell marker c-Myc, and increases the effectiveness of immunotherapy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer and incidence is rising worldwide. Despite recent advancements in immunotherapies, the majority of patients with metastatic melanoma will still succumb to their disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hamid et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ribas et al., 2016</xref>). There is an acute need for new therapeutic strategies that augment the efficacy of standard-of-care immune checkpoint inhibitors. Clues to potential new therapeutic targets for melanoma may be found in 50 year old observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">White, 1959</xref>), validated in recent studies, that female sex, history of multiple pregnancies, and decreased maternal age at first birth are associated with decreased melanoma incidence and favorable prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bannister-Tyrrell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gandini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hersey et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Joosse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karagas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Magnus, 1977</xref>). Although the mechanism of this protective effect is unknown, the clinical association suggests that sex hormone signaling is involved. We hypothesized that understanding the relevant hormones, receptors, and downstream signaling events activated in melanocytes by pregnancy-associated sex steroids would help define the mechanism of the female melanoma protective effects, and suggest new therapeutic opportunities.</p><p>In melanocytes, facultative pigmentation and differentiation is primarily regulated by melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R), which is a G<sub>s</sub>-coupled G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). MC1R activation results in the stimulation of adenylate cyclase, which produces cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP activates a range of diverse downstream pathways, including the exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP (EPAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lissitzky et al., 2009</xref>). In melanocytes, cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates and activates the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). CREB is a component of a transcription factor complex that drives transcription of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), which is known as the master regulator of melanocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Orazio and Fisher, 2011</xref>). MITF directs transcription of melanocyte specific genes required for melanin synthesis including tyrosinase. In previous studies we determined that estrogen, which is higher in females, especially during pregnancy, acts directly on skin melanocytes to increase both pigment production and melanocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Natale et al., 2016</xref>). These estrogen effects are mediated entirely through a GPCR named G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER). GPER activates signaling pathways that are completely distinct from classical estrogen receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Filardo et al., 2002</xref>). Although there are no approved drugs that specifically target GPER, we determined that GPER is activated in both female and male normal melanocytes by estrogen, as well as by a selective agonist (G-1) that activates GPER signaling without affecting the activity of classical estrogen receptors (ERÎ±/Î²) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bologa et al., 2006</xref>). An independent laboratory subsequently validated these results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we show that GPER activation in melanoma induces a constellation of long-lasting phenotypic changes that inhibit tumor growth, and also render tumor cells more susceptible to clearance by native immune cells, which increases the clinical efficacy immune checkpoint blockade. Selective GPER agonists may represent a new class of anti-cancer therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To test whether pregnancy affects melanoma development, we used genetically-defined human melanoma (heMel) xenografts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chudnovsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McNeal et al., 2015</xref>). In this tissue model, primary human melanocytes were engineered with lentiviruses to express mutant oncoproteins commonly associated with spontaneous human melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McNeal et al., 2015</xref>) including BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> (doxycycline-inducible), dominant-negative p53<sup>R248W</sup>, active CDK4<sup>R24C</sup> and hTERT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The oncogene expressing melanocytes were combined with primary human keratinocytes and native human dermis to construct functional 3-dimensional human skin tissues that were grafted into the orthotopic location on the backs of female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). After grafts healed, mice were randomized and separated into nonbreeding or breeding groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Doxycycline chow was then provided to induce the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> oncogene in all animals. After 15 weeks and three consecutive pregnancies in the breeding group (or no pregnancies in the nonbreeding group), human tissues were harvested and analyzed histologically. Grafts from the nonbreeding group developed into melanocytic neoplasms with hallmark features of human melanoma including large, mitotically active melanocytic nests with cellular atypia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâD</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, tissues from the breeding group were relatively unremarkable, and contained primarily quiescent, single, non-proliferating melanocytes that were confined to the basal epidermal layer. These results show that repeated pregnancies inhibit the growth of BRAF-driven human melanocytic neoplasia.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31770.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Multiple pregnancies inhibit melanomagenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental timeline of genetically-defined human xenograft melanoma on SCID mice, nÂ =Â 5 per group.

As with most cell types, melanocyte differentiation and proliferation are inversely correlated, and melanocytes in normal skin rarely proliferate outside of cycling hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jimbow et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rabbani et al., 2011</xref>). Melanoma tissue is generally less differentiated than normal melanocytes or benign nevi. In our xenograft studies, pregnancy was associated withÂ the relative lack of proliferating melanocytes and aÂ corresponding increase in epidermal melanin, suggesting that these melanocytes are relatively more differentiated. Although the nonbreeding group, which developed melanomas, had significantly more melanocytes in the grafted skin than the breeding group, melanin abundance within the surrounding epidermal keratinocytes was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These data suggest that pregnancy inhibits melanoma development and induces melanocyte pigment production.</p><p>To test whether pregnancy-associated hormones induce long-lasting changes in melanocytes that could account for the melanoma survival benefit observed in some studies of women who experienced pregnancy decades earlier, we transiently exposed primary human melanocytes to estrogen or progesterone. Continuous estrogen exposure drove increases in melanin production, while progesterone had opposite effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). After hormone withdrawal, progesterone treated cells quickly returned to their baseline level of melanin production. In contrast, estrogen treated cells stably produced more melanin through continual cell divisions over the subsequent 50 days. A subset of cells that were exposed to transient estrogen were subsequently treated with progesterone. This reversed the estrogen effects, and melanin production decreased to the sub-baseline level seen upon initial progesterone treatment. Remarkably, after progesterone withdrawal, these cells fully returned back to the heightened level of melanin production induced by the initial estrogen exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition to increased melanin production, transient estrogen exposure was associated with stable increases in well-established melanocyte differentiation proteins including tyrosinase (TYR), p-CREB and MC1R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results indicate that estrogen signaling, even transiently, induces durable, long-lasting effects in melanocytes associated with markers of a more fully differentiated cell state.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31770.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>GPER signaling drives stable differentiation in normal human melanocytes and in melanoma.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Long-term melanin assay in which normal human melanocytes were transiently treated with progesterone (P4), or estrogen (E2).

Consistent with changes observed in heMel cells in vivo, estrogen or G-1 decreased melanoma cell proliferation and increased melanin production, independent of the specific oncodrivers (BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> or NRas<sup>Q61L</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1AâD</xref>). G-1 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of melanoma proliferation, saturating at an optimal dose of 500 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1EâF</xref>). The effects of G-1 were lost completely when GPER was genetically depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1HâJ</xref>). These data, coupled with the fact that G-1 is a specific agonist of GPERÂ which has no activity on classical estrogen receptors, indicate that the entirely of the estrogen and G-1 effects in melanoma cells are mediated through GPER. Consistent with this, we did not detect expression of ER in several melanoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1G</xref>). In previous work, we demonstrated that GPER was also the sole mediator of estrogen and G-1 effects in normal primary human melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Natale et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To test whether transient GPER signaling induces a persistent state in melanoma cells that affects subsequent tumor growth in vivo, we treated melanoma cells with estrogen, G-1, or vehicle in vitro, and subsequently injected equal numbers of treated cells into host mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Pretreatment with estrogen or G-1 markedly reduced subsequent tumor size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâE</xref>), indicating that transient GPER activation has durable, long-lasting effects on melanoma cells that limit tumor growth in vivo.</p><p>Amplification of c-Myc â a transcription factor that antagonizes differentiation and promotes proliferation, survival, and escape from immune surveillance â is one of the most common genetic alterations in human cancers, including melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gabay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schlagbauer-Wadl et al., 1999</xref>). We found that GPER signaling in melanoma cells stably depleted c-Myc protein, and induced a relative growth arrest. This was associated with persistent hypophosphorylation of RB, increased expression of melanocyte differentiation proteins including TYR, MITF, and MC1R, increased expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA), and reduced expression of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâD</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1EâF</xref>). Genetic knockdown of GPER eliminated G-1 effects on p-RB, c-Myc, and proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1HâJ</xref>). To verify this finding indicating that G-1 effects in melanoma are mediated entirely through GPER, we utilized a selective GPER antagonist, G-36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dennis et al., 2011</xref>), that specifically inhibits GPER. In melanoma cells, a two-fold molar excess of G-36 completely blocked G-1 effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). c-Myc loss is a major mediator of the anti-proliferative effects of GPER signaling, as melanoma cells engineered to maintain c-Myc protein in the face of GPER activation were resistant to G-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). c-Myc loss following GPER activation was rapid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) and PKA dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), suggesting that canonical stimulatory GPCR signaling destabilized c-Myc protein. Consistent with this, c-Myc loss after GPER activation was proteasome dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), and c-Myc protein half-life was markedly shortened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Together, these data indicate that GPER activation regulates c-Myc through protein degradation. A recent report showed that melanomas arising during pregnancy are associated with higher GPER protein within tumor sections, suggesting that hormonal factors may upregulate GPER expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">FÃ¡biÃ¡n et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with these clinical data, G-1 induced a dose-dependent increase in GPER expression in melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

We used G-1 to activate GPER in murine B16F10 melanoma cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We then injected equal numbers of vehicle or G-1 treated tumor cells into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice, and treated the animals with either anti-programmed cell death 1 (Î±PD-1) antibody or isotype antibody control. Consistent with the premise that GPER signaling has long-lasting effects on melanoma cells, G-1 pretreatment alone inhibited subsequent tumor growth in mice and extended survival compared to controls. Î±PD-1 antibody monotherapy in animals injected with vehicle treated B16F10 cells also similarly prolonged survival. However, combination of G-1 pretreatment with Î±PD-1 antibody extended survival beyond that seen with either agent alone, indicating that GPER activity in tumor cells induced persistent changes in the tumor sufficient to improve the anti-tumor activity of systemically administered Î±PD-1 therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4EâF</xref>). To further demonstrate that GPER activation has tumor-cell intrinsic activity in vivo, independent of lymphocytes, we treated YUMM1.7-bearing immunocompromised mice with G-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Treatment with G-1 slowed tumor growth and extended survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1BâC</xref>).

G-1, which lacks systemic toxicities associated with estrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), was well tolerated in mice, andÂ extended survival to the same extent as Î±PD-1. Treatment with both Î±PD-1 and G-1 extended survival dramatically, indicating a marked combinatorial benefit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâC</xref>). Although B16F10 melanoma is the most commonly used model for melanoma immunology studies, and experimental results have largely translated to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benci et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Twyman-Saint Victor et al., 2015</xref>), B16F10 lacks the <italic>Braf</italic> or <italic>NRas</italic> oncodriver mutations present in most human melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shain et al., 2015</xref>). To test whether GPER signaling has similar anti-melanoma activity in a potentially more medically relevant model, we used genetically-defined melanoma cells from the newly-available Yale University Mouse Melanoma collection (YUMM). This resource contains melanoma lines generated from established genetically engineered mouse models that were backcrossed onto C57BL/6 backgrounds specifically to facilitate immunology studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meeth et al., 2016</xref>).

A pharmacologic approach that recapitulates the female/pregnancy protective effects in men, and women who have not been pregnant, might significantly diminish the overall melanoma burden. Progress in this area has likely been limited by the fact that estrogen effects in melanocytes are not mediated by the well-known nuclear estrogen receptors, but rather through the nonclassical G protein-coupled receptor GPER, which was only recently demonstrated to be expressed in melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Natale et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that this nonclassical estrogen signaling promotes differentiation in melanoma, inhibits tumor cell proliferation, and critically, promotes a phenotype that renders tumors more susceptible to immune-mediated elimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Consistent with this, recent independent work from others has demonstrated that GPER protein levels are higher in human pregnancy-associated melanoma compared to melanoma from non-pregnant females or men, and that high GPER expression is associated with favorable prognostic indicators including decreased Breslow depth, decreased mitotic rate, and increased lymphocyte infiltration into tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">FÃ¡biÃ¡n et al., 2017</xref>).

High c-Myc protein in tumor cells inhibits expression of antigen presenting HLA/MHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schlagbauer-Wadl et al., 1999</xref>) and activates expression of PD-L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2017</xref>).

Consistent with this, G-1 pretreatment of human melanoma cells also inhibited subsequent tumor growth in SCID mice, indicating that G-1 has anti-tumor activity that is independent of CD4Â +or CD8+ T cells. Further indicative of a tumor cell intrinsic effect of GPER agonist, we demonstrated that pretreatment of murine melanoma in vitro with GPER agonist still potentiated the in vivo anti-tumor activity of Î±PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4DâF</xref>). Finally, murine YUMM melanoma tumors established in SCID mice (lacking CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) were also inhibited by systemically delivered G-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Differentiation drivers likely have very large âtherapeutic windowsâ as anti-cancer agents. Melanocytes (and other GPER-expressing cells) normally respond to physiologic GPER activation, whose natural ligand is endogenous estrogen, and the synthetic specific GPER agonist G-1 is well tolerated in mice. Although no approved drugs specifically target GPER, GPCRs are biologically important and are generally highly âdrugableâ, as up to 40% of all FDA approved medications act through these receptors. To our knowledge, this work is the first to discover the potential therapeutic utility of combining a GPCR agonist with immunotherapy. As many tumor types express GPER, the selective agonist G-1 may ultimately prove useful in combination therapy for many human cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and cell lines</title><p>Primary human melanocytes were extracted from fresh discarded human foreskin and surgical specimens as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McNeal et al., 2015</xref>) with some modifications detailed as follows.

Secondary endpoints include severe ulceration, death, and any other condition that falls within the IACUC guidelines for Rodent Tumor and Cancer Models at the University of Pennsylvania.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Adherent cells were washed once with DPBS, and lysed with 8M urea containing 50 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM iodoacetamide. Lysates were quantified (Bradford assay), normalized, reduced, and resolved by SDS gel electrophoresis on 4â15% Tris/Glycine gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Resolved protein was transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) using a Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad), blocked in 5% BSA in TBS-T and probed with primary antibodies recognizing Î²-Actin (Cell Signaling Technology, #3700, 1:4000, Danvers, MA, USA), BRAF V600E (Spring Bioscience, VE1, 1:500, Pleasanton, CA, USA) c-Myc (Cell Signaling Technology, #5605, 1:1000), CDK4 (Cell Signaling Technology, #12790, 1:1000), p-CREB (Cell Signaling Technology, #9198, 1:1000), CREB (Cell Signaling Technology, #9104, 1:1000), ERÎ±(Cell Signaling Technology, #8644, 1:1000),GPER (Sigma, HPA027052, 1:500), HLA-ABC (Biolegend, w6/32,1:500, San Diego, CA, USA), MC1R (Abcam, EPR6530, 1:1000 Cambridge, MA, USA), p53 (Cell Signaling Technology, #2527, 1:1000), human PD-L1 (Cell Signaling Technology, #13684, 1:1000), mouse PD-L1 (R and D systems, AF1019, 1:500, Minneapolis, MN, USA), p-RB (Cell Signaling Technology, #8516, 1:1000), RB (Cell Signaling Technology, #9313, 1:1000), and tyrosinase (Abcam, T311, 1:1000). After incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody, proteins were detected using either Luminata Crescendo Western HRP Substrate (Millipore) or ECL Western Blotting Analysis System (GE Healthcare, Bensalem, PA). All western blots were repeated at least three times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Melanin assay</title><p>Cells (1 Ã 10<sup>5</sup>) were seeded uniformly on 6-well tissue culture plates. Cells were treated with vehicle controls, estrogen, or G-1 for 4 days. Cells were then trypsinized, counted, and spun at 300 g for 5 min. The resulting cell pellet was solubilized in 120 Î¼L of 1M NaOH, and boiled for 5 min. The optical density of the resulting solution was read at 450 nm using an EMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The absorbance was normalized to the number of cells in each sample, and relative amounts of melanin were set based on vehicle-treated controls. All melanin assays were repeated at least three times</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunohistochemistry and quantification</title><p>Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human skin tissue sections from organotypic tissue was stained for MITF (NCL-L-MITF, Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany), MelanA (NCL-L-MITF, Leica Biosystems), and Ki67 (NCL-L-Ki67-MM1, Leica Biosystems). Staining was performed following the manufacturer's protocol for high temperature antigen unmasking technique for paraffin sections. For melanin staining, FFPE embedded tissue was subjected to Fontana-Masson histochemical stain as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Natale et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>FFPE subcutaneous tumor tissue sections were stained for CD8 (Cell Signaling Technology, #98941, 1:400), p-CREB (Cell Signaling Technology, #9198, 1:800), c-Myc (Abcam, ab32072, 1:100), GPER (Novus Biologics, NLS1183, 1:50, Littleton, CO, USA). Briefly, tissue sections were de-paraffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to heat induced antigen retrieval. Antigen retrieval was performed in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0 for CD8, p-CREB, and c-Myc; Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, BP2473-1) was used for GPER. Subsequent staining procedures were performed following the manufacturer protocol from the HRP/DAB detection kit (Abcam, ab80436). Sections were counter stained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and cover slipped with Permount Mounting Media (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p><p>Tissue section quantification was performed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Billings et al. (2015)</xref>. Briefly, 20X photomicrograph images of representative tissue sections were taken using the Zeiss Axiophot microscope and Keyence BZ-X710 (Itasca, IL, USA). Tiff files of the images were saved and transferred to Adobe Photoshop where pixels corresponding to staining were selected using the color selection and lasso selection tools. Images corresponding to the single specific color were then analyzed using FIJI (Image J) to determine the number of pixels in each sample and normalized to epidermal area. The numbers of pixels representing Fontana-Masson staining were normalized to the total amount of epidermal area. Ki67 proliferation index was calculated by dividing the number Ki67 positive cells by the total number of MelanA positive cells in the samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Cell surface markers were assessed by incubating single cell suspensions of tissues with primary fluorochrome-labeled antibodies at 4Â°C for 60 min in PBS with 5% FBS; FITC-anti-mouse-Nkp46 (29A1.4, Biolegend, #137606, 1:50), PE-CF594-anti-mouse-CD8a (53â6.7, BD Pharmingen, #562283, 1:100), PE-Cy5-anti-mouse-CD3Îµ (145â2 C11, Biolegend, #100310, 1:100, PE-Cy7-anti-mouse-I-A/I-E (M5/114.15.2, Biolegend, #107630, 1:600), V450-anti-mouse-CD44 (IM7, Biolegend, #560451, 1:100), AF700-anti-mouse-CD45 (30-F11, Biolegend, #103128, 1:400), APC-Cy7-anti-mouse-F4/80 (BM8, Biolegend, #123118, 1:100), PerCP-Cy5.5-anti-mouse-CD11b (M1/70, BD Pharmingen, #550993, 1:200), BV570-anti-mouse-CD62L (MEL-14, Biolegend, #104433, 1:50), Live/Dead Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit, for 405 nm excitation (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L-34966, 1:600). Intracellular staining was done using the Fixation/Permeabilization Kit from eBiosciences. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences). Collected data were then analyzed using the FlowJo software (Treestar, Ashland, Oregon, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism 8 (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.

Using cell culture and xenograft models the authors show that pregnancy is protective against melanoma and that this effect is due to estrogen and not progesterone. The authors go on to show that this protective effect is due to GPER signaling and is dependent on PKA, indicating the engagement of an anti-melanoma GPCR-&gt;cAMP-&gt;PKA signaling axis. Activation of this GPER cascade results in decreased melanoma cell proliferation and increased expression of melanocyte differentiation markers as well as elevated expression of cell surface HLA proteins. Concurrent with the expression of melanocyte differentiation markers, tumor cells exposed to estrogen or a selective GPER agonist (G-1) showed decreased levels of PD-L1 expression. Biochemically, activation of this pathway results in decreased levels of c-MYC expression purportedly due to decreased protein half-life, dependent on PKA, suggesting the increased proliferation and loss of melanocyte markers in these cells may be driven by elevated expression of c-MYC. Finally, the authors show that combined treatment of melanoma bearing mice with a GPER agonist increases survival similarly to treatment with anti-PD-1 antibodies, and that combined treatment is well-tolerated and results in profound tumor regression, sustained responses, and in one model, development of immune memory such that re-challenge of mice with previously treated disease prevented tumor formation. Overall, this paper provides a reasonably compelling preclinical rationale for exploring GPER agonists as a potential combination with immunotherapy in melanoma.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) Results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lack indications as to at what concentration G-1 was used in these experiments. Without this information the results cannot be conclusively assessed. In addition, related to results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: What is &quot;an optimized concentration of G-1&quot;? What were criteria for &quot;optimization&quot;, and how was/is &quot;optimization&quot; defined?</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> the authors show that stabilized expression of c-MYC in WM46 melanoma cells abolishes the biochemical effects of the GPER agonist. Does the same hold true in vivo? Does this entire phenomenon really pivot on the expression of a single oncoprotein transcription factor? Furthermore, what (if any) are the effects of GPER signaling upon the melanocyte master regulator and E-box binding transcription factor MITF? This is important since MITF plays such a critical role in melanomagenesis and alterations in MITF expression can have profound effects on melanoma cell behavior.</p><p>3) There is a lack of mechanistic depth on the effects of the GPER agonists on specific immune cell subsets. Have the authors attempted to deplete either CD4<sup>+</sup> cells or CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and then repeat the animal studies with the anti-PD-1 and GPER agonist? This would add a deeper level of mechanistic depth to the manuscript.</p><p>4) As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D and E</xref>, the effects of E2 and G-1 (albeit at 8-fold higher concentrations than E2) are equally potent to suppress murine and human melanoma tumor growth in vivo. The question of interest is, if selective GPER activation is as effective as non-selective estrogen receptor activation, what (if any) relative role do ER Î± and ER Î² play in this process compared to GPER?</p><p>5) Given that the authors show increases in immune infiltration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>, a histological image showing the location of these cells in/around the tumor would be useful here.

Yet, the authors conducted statistical analyses (two-tailed t-tests) and denote statistical significance. The authors should comment on the appropriateness of this approach since the reviewer notes that n numbers of 3 do not allow to test normality of distribution nor to select the appropriate parametric/non-parametric test. The reviewer suggests the removal of any statistical significance information from those experiments with too low n numbers.

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved and is largely suitable for acceptance for publication but there is one small, but potentially important issue, regarding the title of the manuscript raised by reviewer #2 that needs your attention prior to acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed the concerns raised in the previous manuscript. Some newly made changes, however, still require modification. The previous title of the manuscript was &quot;GPER signaling inhibits [â¦]&quot; which has been changed to &quot;Nonclassical estrogen signaling inhibits&quot; in the revised version. There are several issues with this. First, any signaling can be either activating or inhibitory, thus the title either way is vague. Second, the term &quot;Nonclassical estrogen signaling&quot; is not used correctly here, which may be due to a misunderstanding: Classical estrogen signaling is usually only referred to as the chronic, i.e. genomic cellular events mediated by the &quot;classical&quot; estrogen receptors ERa and ERb. Rapid, i.e. non-genomic signaling by ERa and ERb thus also falls in the &quot;nonclassical&quot; signaling category. Finally, even in the absence of estrogen stimulation unliganded ERa and GPER both exert basal signaling effects due to this constitutive activity which also would qualify as &quot;nonclassical&quot; signaling (PMIDs 27803283 (2016) and 27888004 (2017)). For the title to be unambiguous and in accordance with the main findings presented in this paper it is suggested to change it to &quot;Activation of GPER inhibits [â¦]&quot;</p><p>Further to the comments of reviewer 2, would you be willing to consider changing the title of your manuscript to:</p><p>Activation of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor signaling inhibits melanoma and improves response to immune checkpoint blockade?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31770.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) Results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lack indications as to at what concentration G-1 was used in these experiments.

This point is now clarified in the fourth paragraph of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> the authors show that stabilized expression of c-MYC in WM46 melanoma cells abolishes the biochemical effects of the GPER agonist.

Melanoma cells with stabilized c-Myc are especially aggressive, and given our clear data that they do not respond to GPER agonist in vitro, they will almost certainly not respond to GPER agonists in vivo. Based on these facts, we believe (and the editor agreed) that further experiments to test the effect of stabilized c-Myc transgenes on melanoma growth of engineered tumor cells in vivo are unlikely to add significantly to the current data and are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>We agree that it would be helpful to demonstrate that key GPER induced signaling events identified in vitro also occur in vivo. To that end, we treated mice harboring human BRAF mutant melanoma tumors (WM46) with systemically administered G-1. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor sections showed the expected GPER induced changes in c-Myc, p-CREB, and GPER proteins that parallel changes observed in vitro. These data are presented in a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We agree that it is important to test whether GPER alters MITF level. We included these data in the initial submission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) demonstrating that GPER activation induces MITF protein in melanoma cells. We have modified the text to more clearly call out this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is a lack of mechanistic depth on the effects of the GPER agonists on specific immune cell subsets. Have the authors attempted to deplete either CD4<sup>+</sup> cells or CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and then repeat the animal studies with the anti-PD-1 and GPER agonist? This would add a deeper level of mechanistic depth to the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We present several lines of evidence to indicate that the anti-tumor effect of GPER agonists results primarily from GPER signaling in the tumor cells, rather than host immune cells. First, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> that pretreatment of mouse and human melanoma cells with GPER agonists in vitro prior to injection into host mice drives durable cellular differentiation that inhibits subsequent tumor growth in mice, without treating the mouse with G-1. Also consistent with a tumor cell intrinsic effect of GPER agonist, we demonstrate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-F</xref> that pretreatment of murine melanoma in vitro with GPER agonist still potentiates the in vivo anti-tumor activity of anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade. To further address the reviewerâs question regarding the role of T-cells in the melanoma response to G-1, we introduced YUMM tumor cells into SCID mice (lacking CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) and treated animals with systemically delivered G-1. G-1 treatment in this setting inhibited tumor growth and extended survival. These data are presented in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>. Together, these data strongly support the model in which GPER agonists act on the tumor cells to inhibit growth.</p><p>Work from others has shown that, like other cancer models, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are required for a productive immunotherapy response to YUMM melanoma (Homet Moreno et al. 2016). We have modified the text to clarify the valuable points raised by the reviewer, and to include this reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D and E</xref>, the effects of E2 and G-1 (albeit at 8-fold higher concentrations than E2) are equally potent to suppress murine and human melanoma tumor growth in vivo. The question of interest is, if selective GPER activation is as effective as non-selective estrogen receptor activation, what (if any) relative role do ER Î± and ER Î² play in this process compared to GPER?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that at saturating concentrations, G-1 and E2 are equally potent at inducing differentiation in vitro prior to tumor implantation. However, the effects of both are lost completely when GPER is genetically depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1H-J</xref>). These data, coupled with the finding that G-1, which is a specific agonist of GPER that has no activity on classical estrogen receptors, indicate that GPER is responsible for the entirely of the estrogen / G-1 effects in melanoma cells and primary melanocytes. As we demonstrated previously in melanocytes (Natale et al. 2016), we now added a western blot for ERa in melanoma cells, showing that the nuclear receptor is not present. It is important to note that selective GPER activation with G-1 may have significant therapeutic advantages over non-selective activation with E2, as excess, unopposed estrogen in vivo affects many tissue types with toxicities that are not observed with G-1 (Wang et al. 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Given that the authors show increases in immune infiltration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>, a histological image showing the location of these cells in/around the tumor would be useful here.
