However, there are no data showing how exactly the regulation emerges from specific lipid-protein interactions. Here we show in atomistic detail how the human β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) – a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor – is modulated by cholesterol in an allosteric fashion. Extensive atomistic simulations show that cholesterol regulates β<sub>2</sub>AR by limiting its conformational variability. The mechanism of action is based on the binding of cholesterol at specific high-affinity sites located near the transmembrane helices 5–7 of the receptor. The alternative mechanism, where the β<sub>2</sub>AR conformation would be modulated by membrane-mediated interactions, plays only a minor role. Cholesterol analogues also bind to cholesterol binding sites and impede the structural flexibility of β<sub>2</sub>AR, however cholesterol generates the strongest effect. The results highlight the capacity of lipids to regulate the conformation of membrane receptors through specific interactions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18432.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18432.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18432.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins known as G protein-coupled receptors, or GPCRs for short, detect and respond to hormones and other signaling molecules found outside cells. A signaling molecule activates a GPCR by binding to it and causing the receptor to change its shape. This triggers a cascade of signals inside the cell that leads to the cell responding in a particular way. There are over 800 different GPCRs in human cells, making them the largest family of cell surface proteins.</p><p>GPCRs span the membrane that surrounds each cell. This membrane is made of molecules called lipids and previous studies have shown that many lipids are able to bind to GPCRs and influence their shape and activity. Lipids can cause these changes via so-called ‘allosteric’ regulation, in which the lipid binds to a site on the receptor that is separate to where the signal molecule binds. Lipid binding can either enhance or inhibit the activity of the receptor.</p><p>Human β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor is one of the best-studied GPCRs. It responds to a hormone called epinephrine (also known as adrenaline), which plays important roles in many organs in the body, including the heart and lungs. A lipid called cholesterol, which is plentiful in the cell membrane, can also bind to this receptor and influence its shape, but how this happens was not fully understood. Manna et al. now use computer simulations to analyze the interaction between cholesterol and β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor in more detail.</p><p>The simulations reveal that cholesterol makes the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor less flexible so that it can only adopt certain shapes. This helps to stabilize both the inactive and active states of the receptor so that it is not as easy for the receptor to switch between them. The cholesterol molecules bind to specific sites on the receptor within the region of the protein that crosses the cell membrane.</p><p>The new findings of Manna et al. provide detailed insights into how cholesterol governs the shape and activity of the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor. The next step is to extend this analysis to other types of lipids and GPCRs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18432.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18432.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>membrane receptor</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>lipid-protein interactions</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics simulation</kwd><kwd>allosteric regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>290974</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manna</surname><given-names>Moutusi</given-names></name><name><surname>Kulig</surname><given-names>Waldemar</given-names></name><name><surname>Rog</surname><given-names>Tomasz</given-names></name><name><surname>Vattulainen</surname><given-names>Ilpo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002341</institution-id><institution>Suomen Akatemia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>272130</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manna</surname><given-names>Moutusi</given-names></name><name><surname>Tynkkynen</surname><given-names>Joona</given-names></name><name><surname>Javanainen</surname><given-names>Matti</given-names></name><name><surname>Kulig</surname><given-names>Waldemar</given-names></name><name><surname>Rog</surname><given-names>Tomasz</given-names></name><name><surname>Vattulainen</surname><given-names>Ilpo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Atomistic simulations reveal how lipids can allosterically modulate membrane receptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are versatile signaling proteins that mediate diverse cellular responses. With over 800 members, GPCRs constitute the largest family of integral membrane proteins in human genome and represent roughly half of all drug targets in modern medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gilchrist, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The human β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) is one of the best-characterized GPCRs. It is expressed in pulmonary and cardiac myocyte tissues and is a therapeutic target for asthma and heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lefkowitz, 2000</xref>). The functional diversity of β<sub>2</sub>AR is associated with its structural dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manglik and Kobilka, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kobilka, 2013</xref>). Recently found structures of β<sub>2</sub>AR in the inactive and active states have provided valuable insights into the structure-function relationship of β<sub>2</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cherezov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rasmussen et al., 2011</xref>). Subsequent biophysical and biochemical studies have provided direct evidences of multiple distinct conformational states for specific GPCRs, such as β<sub>2</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manglik and Kobilka, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kobilka, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nygaard et al., 2013</xref>). Meanwhile, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have depicted the dynamic behavior of β<sub>2</sub>AR and have significantly enhanced our understanding of the activation mechanism of GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dror et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ozcan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dror et al., 2011</xref>). Intriguingly, it is now evident that the activation of GPCRs is modulated by lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oates and Watts, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The lipid raft concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2007</xref>) essentially states that cell membranes include functional nanoscale domains where the function emerges from proteins whose structure and activation are modulated by lipids. However, despite a large body of research data, direct substantiation of lipid-induced protein modulation remains limited. Contreras et al. showed that the COPI machinery protein p24 is recognized by a specific sphingomyelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Contreras et al., 2012</xref>). Coskun et al. showed that monosialoganglioside GM3 influences the activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coskun et al., 2011</xref>), however the mechanism is not known. Lipid modulation also holds to GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oates and Watts, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Neale et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawaliby et al., 2016</xref>) in particular through cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oates and Watts, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Paila and Chattopadhyay, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gimpl et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paila et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Muth et al., 2011</xref>), which changes the physical properties of cellular membranes and supports the dynamic assembly of nanoscale membrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simons and Ikonen, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The best known case is β<sub>2</sub>AR, which is a prototype of cholesterol-interacting GPCRs. β<sub>2</sub>AR belongs to the family of class A GPCRs. GPCRs belonging to this class show a high structural similarity and functional diversity. The literature reporting on the specific functional role of cholesterol and other lipids is extensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pucadyil and Chattopadhyay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gimpl, 2016</xref>). It has been experimentally shown that cholesterol affects the conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Muth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casiraghi et al., 2016</xref>) and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gimpl et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paila et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pucadyil and Chattopadhyay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casiraghi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jafurulla et al., 2014</xref>) of many GPCRs. Based on X-ray crystal structures cholesterol has specific contacts with β<sub>2</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cherezov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that β<sub>2</sub>AR has binding sites for cholesterol. Spectroscopic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gater et al., 2014</xref>) and MD simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prasanna et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2012</xref>) studies have reported direct interactions between cholesterol and GPCRs, including β<sub>2</sub>AR. Experimental data show that cholesterol binding to β<sub>2</sub>AR changes its structural properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zocher et al., 2012</xref>). Cholesterol is also necessary in crystallizing β<sub>2</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cherezov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>), and cholesterol and its analogue cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) have been exhibited to improve β<sub>2</sub>AR stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zocher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loll, 2014</xref>). Since the structure and function of GPCRs are closely related, cholesterol binding specifically to β<sub>2</sub>AR is also expected to change the functional properties of the receptor. Indeed experimental studies indicate that cholesterol has a functional role in β<sub>2</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paila et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pontier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xiang et al., 2002</xref>). Further, inhibition of β<sub>2</sub>AR-associated signaling has been observed with increasing membrane cholesterol content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pontier et al., 2008</xref>). However, as with GPCRs in general, the atomic-scale mechanism cholesterol uses to regulate β<sub>2</sub>AR is not known. Does cholesterol modulate β<sub>2</sub>AR activity through membrane-mediated effects by altering the physical properties of the membrane? Alternatively if regulation takes place through specific direct interactions, then what is the atom-scale mechanism?</p><p>We performed extensive atomistic MD simulations (totaling &gt;100 μs, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) to clarify the mechanism responsible for the modulatory role of cholesterol on β<sub>2</sub>AR. In essence, we show that as cholesterol concentration reaches ~10 mol%, the conformational distribution of β<sub>2</sub>AR is drastically altered. The mechanism of action is based on the binding of cholesterol at specific high-affinity sites of the receptor.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id

The receptor populates two major conformational states. One of them has a relatively open G protein site (L<sub>G</sub> being 10–12 Å) and a smaller ligand-binding site (L<sub>L</sub> ~ 13 ± 1 Å). The other conformation is characterized by a shift of ~3–4 Å from the intracellular end of H6 towards the receptor core that blocks the G protein interface (L<sub>G</sub> ~ 8.5 Å). At the same time, the ligand-binding pocket expands as the extracellular part of H5 moves ~ 4–5 Å away from H3 (L<sub>L</sub>now ~16 ± 1 Å). This conformation represents an alternative inactive structure of the receptor, as both changes occur in the opposite direction compared to the case of agonist binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kobilka, 2013</xref>); we do not observe any transition to the active state of β<sub>2</sub>AR. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows the receptor oscillating between the different inactive conformations during 2.5 µs. The closing of the intracellular G protein-binding surface is found to correlate with the opening of the extracellular ligand-binding pocket, and vice-versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The conformational correlation between the two distal sites supports the view of allosteric regulation in GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kobilka, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ozcan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the presence of cholesterol, the picture changes quite dramatically. With a cholesterol concentration of 10 mol%, the conformational flexibility of β<sub>2</sub>AR reduces significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The receptor stays predominantly in one conformation and no further opening of the ligand-binding site or the opening/closing of the G protein-binding site is observed, unlike in a cholesterol-free membrane. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, L<sub>L</sub> and L<sub>G</sub> fluctuate around ~13 and~9.5 Å, respectively. The slowing down of the movements of H5 and H6 correlates with the observed high-density spots of cholesterol at these helices (IC2 and EC1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> discussed in detail below). To further quantify this, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> depicts the standard deviation for the fluctuations of the intracellular and extracellular ends of H5 and H6, when these ends are bound or unbound to cholesterol. The data show that the deviations of these helices from their respective average positions are much smaller when they are bound to cholesterol. The effect is particularly strong for the extracellular end of H5 at the ligand-binding site and for the intracellular end of H6 at the G protein-binding site.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18432.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cholesterol interaction sites on β<sub>2</sub>AR.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) 2D number densities of cholesterol (Chol) around β<sub>2</sub>AR.

Here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) the concentration of cholesterol in the annular region is therefore high in the beginning of the simulation, while it is zero elsewhere. Cholesterols dissociate from β<sub>2</sub>AR during the course of the simulation (discussed in detail below) and at long times the system corresponds to a dilute (cholesterol-poor) system, where the total average cholesterol concentration is low (1.9 mol%). One finds that as the data are averaged over the simulation period, the conformational behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) translates from cholesterol-rich (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) to cholesterol-poor behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>Further, we studied the effect of cholesterol on the active conformation of β<sub>2</sub>AR in its apo form in the absence of the G protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rasmussen et al., 2011</xref>). In the active state, the intracellular end of H6 is splayed outward from the helical bundle, providing room for the G protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We observe inward swinging of H6 towards H3 in the absence of cholesterol (which occurred in two out of three replica simulations). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,E</xref>, the intracellular end of H6 spontaneously approaches H3 with L<sub>G</sub> dropping from 18.97 Å in the starting active conformation to ~11.5 Å that is comparable to the crystallographically observed inactive conformation of β<sub>2</sub>AR (L<sub>G</sub> ~ 11 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>).

We identify three such cholesterol interaction sites – two on the intracellular side (IC1 and IC2) and one on the extracellular side (EC1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Here we call them high-affinity sites since they reproducibly exhibit high cholesterol densities (normalized number density above 0.7) at different cholesterol concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>) and also have large lifetimes as the below discussion shows. IC1 is a shallow groove formed by the intracellular parts of transmembrane helices H1-H4 and coincides well with the location of cholesterol observed in the crystal structure of β<sub>2</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cherezov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>). In IC2 cholesterol penetrates deep into the cleft between H5 and H6 on the intracellular side. A high density of cholesterol is observed at IC2 not only in the inactive but also in the active β<sub>2</sub>AR conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D,F</xref>), which suggests that this site is biologically important.</p><p>EC1 is comprised of two closely spaced cholesterol hot spots located in the extracellular part of H5-H6 and H6-ECL3-H7 (where ECL stands for the extracellular loop). The occupancy of two cholesterol molecules at EC1 is in good agreement with the crystal structure of the adenosine receptor A<sub>2A</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), while IC2 is so far unidentified among the experimentally determined structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gater et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, the cholesterol binding residues of the three interaction sites are conserved to a large degree among β<sub>2</sub>AR orthologues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating that these sites have conserved during the evolution of the receptor. In addition, a few comparatively low-affinity cholesterol binding sites (IC3-4, EC2-3) with 10 and 40 mol% cholesterol are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). When cholesterol concentration is lowered below 10 mol%, many of the interaction sites, particularly IC1 and EC1, are occupied by cholesterol at concentrations as low as 5 mol% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). A few sites (IC2 and EC1) are visited, though transiently, by cholesterol even at 2 mol% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the above-discussed cholesterol hot spots, we observed two sites with comparatively weak cholesterol occupancies (reproducible at both 10 and 40 mol% cholesterol concentrations): IC3 between H3 and H5, and IC4 between H1 and H8, both on the intracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). IC4 recaptures the predicted cholesterol position at the dimerization interface of β<sub>2</sub>AR found by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cherezov et al., 2007</xref>). Besides these, another site with a low cholesterol density was observed near the extracellular part of H3-H4 (EC2) in the 10 mol% cholesterol system, and a high-density site was observed on the extracellular side of H1-H2-EC1 (EC3) in the 40 mol% cholesterol system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).</p><p>Concluding, we find cholesterol to bind to β<sub>2</sub>AR in specific binding sites.

As a result, the average density maps, showing the lateral arrangement of these sterols around β<sub>2</sub>AR, are similar to those of 10 and 40 mol% cholesterol systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and reproducible. Unlike 4β-OH-Chol, 27-OH-Chol prefers to interact with the receptor directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). For the IC1 site, 27-OH-Chol competes, though weakly, with cholesterol, while at EC1 and IC3, 27-OH-Chol exhibits preference over cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8K–N</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, our results show that also other cholesterol-like molecules interact with β<sub>2</sub>AR and may occupy the same binding sites on the receptor surface as cholesterol. However, the effects of cholesterol-analogues on β<sub>2</sub>AR are weaker compared to those induced by cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>). All the cholesterol analogues studied here have a rigid ring structure, yet their slightly different chemical compositions influence their occupancy as well as the strength of binding to the cholesterol-binding sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This is assessed here in terms of the van der Waals energy, which as a short-range interaction reflects how strongly two molecules are in contact and therefore serves as an appropriate measure for the gravity of lipid-protein binding in the binding site.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18432.025</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Interactions<sup>*</sup> of sterols at the three high-affinity cholesterol-binding sites.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18432.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18432.025</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" valign="top"><p>Cholesterol/Cholesterol analogue</p></th><th colspan="6" valign="top"><p><bold>High-affinity cholesterol interaction sites</bold></p> </th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" valign="top"><p><bold>IC1</bold></p> </th><th colspan="2" valign="top"><p><bold>IC2</bold></p> </th><th colspan="2" valign="top"><p><bold>EC1</bold></p> </th></tr><tr><th valign="top"><p>vdW interaction energy (kJ/mol)</p></th><th valign="top"><p>No. of contacts</p></th><th valign="top"><p>vdW interaction energy (kJ/mol)</p></th><th valign="top"><p>No. of contacts</p></th><th valign="top"><p>vdW interaction energy (kJ/mol)</p></th><th valign="top"><p>No. of contacts</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p>Cholesterol<sup>†</sup></p></td><td valign="top"><p>−138.04 ± 0.20</p> </td><td valign="top"><p>141.02 ± 0.22</p> </td><td valign="top"><p>−95.06 ± 0.12</p> </td><td valign="top"><p>90.65 ± 0.16</p> </td><td valign="top"><p>−129.51 ± 0.29</p></td><td valign="top"><p>104.38 ± 0.28</p> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>CHS</p></td><td valign="top"><p>−29.63 ± 0.14</p> </td><td valign="top"><p>28.78 ± 0.16</p> </td><td valign="top"><p>−98.75 ± 0.11</p> </td><td valign="top"><p>96.30 ± 0.16</p> </td><td valign="top"><p>-</p></td><td valign="top"><p>-</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>27-OH-Chol</p></td><td valign="top"><p>−32.17 ± 0.30</p> </td><td valign="top"><p>34.95 ± 0.33</p> </td><td valign="top"><p>−22.69 ± 0.23</p> </td><td valign="top"><p>28.41 ± 0.28</p> </td><td valign="top"><p>−132.85 ± 0.27</p> </td><td valign="top"><p>120.20 ± 0.30</p> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>4β-OH-Chol</p></td><td valign="top"><p>-</p></td><td valign="top"><p>-</p></td><td valign="top"><p>-</p></td><td valign="top"><p>-</p></td><td valign="top"><p>−41.80 ± 0.48</p> </td><td valign="top"><p>33.41 ± 0.42</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn5"><p><sup>*</sup> Shown are the total van der Waals (vdW) interaction energy and the number of contacts between cholesterol and β<sub>2</sub>AR, when cholesterol is in the IC1, IC2, or EC1 binding site (and similarly for the cholesterol analogues).</p></fn><fn id="tblfn6"><p><sup>†</sup> Calculations are based on systems having ≥10 mol% cholesterol.

At IC2 the strength of interaction of CHS and cholesterol is comparable. Meanwhile, the extracellular EC1 site remains unoccupied by CHS indicating the binding energy to be low. As to the two oxysterols, 4β-OH-Chol interacts with β<sub>2</sub>AR only at EC1 and the interaction is weak, while 27-OH-Chol binds at EC1 as tightly as cholesterol, but its interaction at the two other binding sites (IC1 and IC2) is much weaker than in the case of cholesterol. Concluding, CHS interacts at IC2 as strongly as cholesterol but its interactions at IC1 and EC1 are negligible compared to those of cholesterol. The oxysterol 27-OH-Chol interacts at EC1 as strongly as cholesterol but its interactions at IC1 and IC2 are negligible compared to those of cholesterol. The oxysterol 4β-OH-Chol does not interact with β<sub>2</sub>AR to a significant degree.</p><p>These data can be considered in the context of molecular structures. In CHS, the difference compared to cholesterol is the additional chain bridged to the cholesterol structure via an ester bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A</xref>). This additional chain does not interfere binding at IC2, but it does alter the binding at IC1 and EC1. In 27-OH-Chol, the oxidation has taken place in the short acyl chain that is the terminal subunit of the molecule. This does not interfere the binding at EC1 but does alter the binding at IC1 and IC2. Finally, in 4β-OH-Chol, the oxidation has occurred in the rigid steroid moiety, making the α-side of the molecule rougher. In cholesterol, the α-side is exceptionally flat. Given this change in surface roughness, and the importance of the surface-surface contact in lipid-β<sub>2</sub>AR binding in the binding site, it is quite obvious why this oxysterol does not bind to any of the cholesterol binding sites (IC1, IC2, EC1).</p><p>The results support the view that the restriction of β<sub>2</sub>AR dynamics arises from specific lipid binding to the receptor binding sites: the tighter the binding, the more is the receptor dynamics suppressed, and cholesterol induces the strongest effect.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results show that cholesterol has a preference to bind to β<sub>2</sub>AR at specific locations on its surface. We identified three high-affinity cholesterol interaction sites in β<sub>2</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>): IC1 (at the cleft of H1-H4 on the intracellular side), IC2 (H5-H6 on the intracellular side), and EC1 (the H5-H6-ECL3-H7 region on the extracellular side). IC1 and EC1 are in agreement with the locations of cholesterol found in GPCR crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cherezov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). IC1 contains a cholesterol consensus motif that predicts cholesterol binding for 44% of human class A receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, these binding sites appear to be evolutionarily conserved in β<sub>2</sub>AR, which suggests their possible allosteric role in receptor function. A recent simulation study reported a correlation between cholesterol occupancy at IC1 and β<sub>2</sub>AR dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prasanna et al., 2014</xref>). However, not much is known about the functional relevance of cholesterol binding to the other sites of β<sub>2</sub>AR.</p><p>The present work for the inactive conformation of β<sub>2</sub>AR shows that cholesterol binding at IC2 and EC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>) strongly influences the conformational dynamics of β<sub>2</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In a cholesterol-free membrane the receptor samples multiple conformational states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) accounting for the high basal activity of β<sub>2</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manglik and Kobilka, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kobilka, 2013</xref>). Our results show that the presence of cholesterol in high densities around H5-H6-H7 impedes the dynamic nature of the receptor. In cholesterol-containing (≥10 mol% cholesterol) membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>), the overall structural flexibility of the receptor is significantly reduced to one predominant conformation. We observed that in the presence of strongly bound cholesterol, H5 and H6 undergo much smaller displacements from their average positions as compared to the situation without cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Cholesterol analogues that occupy the same interaction sites also restrict the β<sub>2</sub>AR conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>), although their effects are weaker compared to those of cholesterol. Cholesterol or cholesterol-like molecules bound at these inter-helical clefts can thus confine the movement of the respective helices to a substantial degree, thus dampening the overall conformational dynamics of the receptor. At IC2 of inactive β<sub>2</sub>AR, cholesterol pushes the intracellular end of H6 more towards the core of the helical bundle and prevents the outward movement of H6 required for G protein binding. The restriction of H6 movement by cholesterol is a potentially important allosteric effect, which can be used to modulate the receptor activity.</p><p>Interestingly, our study on the active-state β<sub>2</sub>AR also exhibits a high cholesterol density at IC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>). Here cholesterol bound at IC2 acts as a spacer between H5-H6 and restricts the movement of H6, thereby stabilizing the open active-like conformation of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), while in the absence of cholesterol the receptor is more prone to undergoing spontaneous deactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result supports the postulate that cholesterol restricts the conformational dynamics of the receptor by binding at specific interaction sites and governs changes between different receptor states, therefore modulating its function. Moreover, cholesterol binding at IC2 in both inactive and active states of β<sub>2</sub>AR as found in our simulations highlights the biological relevance of this interaction site in allosteric regulation of the receptor conformation.</p><p>The highly conserved IC1 site shows no major influence on the mobility of H5-H6. On the other hand, IC1 exerts a stabilizing effect on H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">Figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>), in agreement with experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>). As H4 is one of the weakest points of the β<sub>2</sub>AR fold, its decreased mobility may account for the enhanced stability of the receptor.</p><p>Cholesterol modulates the physical properties of membranes by increasing the bilayer thickness and order, and slowing down the dynamics. These general membrane effects can also influence the dynamic nature of a membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manna and Mukhopadhyay, 2011</xref>). However, here we found that membrane-mediated interactions do not affect β<sub>2</sub>AR conformation to a significant degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>GPCRs are signaling machines that function by toggling between multiple conformers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Latorraca et al., 2016</xref>). The dynamic nature of GPCRs has made their crystallization process extremely challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kobilka, 2013</xref>). Besides techniques like protein engineering and use of detergents to increase the intrinsic stability of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loll, 2014</xref>), cholesterol/CHS has emerged as a necessary component for crystallization of many GPCRs, including β<sub>2</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cherezov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zocher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loll, 2014</xref>). Our work shows that in the presence of more than ~10 mol% cholesterol, inactive β<sub>2</sub>AR partly loses conformational variability and populates just one major conformation. Achieving conformational homogeneity is the key to crystallize membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loll, 2014</xref>). In agreement with our results, a recent experimental study showed that CHS impacts the conformational dynamics of a GPCR leading to a restricted conformational space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casiraghi et al., 2016</xref>). Earlier it was experimentally reported that cholesterol induces a more compact conformational state of the oxytocin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Muth et al., 2011</xref>). Our results are also in agreement with a recent dynamic single-molecule force spectroscopic study, which showed that CHS strengthens interactions that stabilize the structural segments in β<sub>2</sub>AR and thereby considerably increase the kinetic, energetic, as well as the mechanical stability of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zocher et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, the function of adrenergic receptors is known to be modulated by cholesterol: cholesterol depletion enhances β<sub>2</sub>AR-associated signaling, while increased cholesterol content inhibits signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paila et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pontier et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, the results presented in this work provide the first atomic-scale picture of how lipids can govern the conformation of membrane receptors through direct lipid-protein interactions in specific lipid binding sites, and hence dictate the state of a receptor.

A cholesterol molecule was considered bound when any of its heavy atoms came within ≤0.5 nm from an interaction site. To define the three major interaction sites on the β<sub>2</sub>AR surface, we used the amino acid residues (with contact fraction ≥ 0.4) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. The time series was then additionally smoothed (over one ns time windows) to discard very rapid ‘leave and return’ motions of cholesterol that take place due to thermal fluctuations. Given that lateral diffusion of lipids at the protein surface is very slow, and the lipids essentially do not move at all during a 1-ns time window, these fluctuations were then taken care of by the smoothing procedure. We then calculated the normalized time correlation function (to describe the time-dependent probability of cholesterol that is next to the receptor to stay in contact with the receptor) over all individual cholesterol binding/unbinding events occurred in all independent simulation trajectories for all cholesterol molecules present in a system at a given cholesterol concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnarez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horn et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Equilibration and error bar estimation associated with analysis</title><p>For all analysis to measure time-averaged properties, the first 100 ns of production simulations were excluded from the calculation.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Arup Chakraborty (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Nir Ben-Tal (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The effects of membrane lipids on the structural and dynamic properties of membrane-bound proteins, as well as on their biological function, has been the subject of numerous studies. Cholesterol constitutes a particularly interesting example, as it has a complex effect on membrane structure and is also known to bind specifically to many membrane proteins. One such case is the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), to which cholesterol molecules have been shown to bind specifically. Moreover, cholesterol has been found to improve the stability, ligand binding, and signaling properties of the β2-AR. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects have never been explained in detail, and it is unclear whether cholesterol acts directly or by changing membrane properties like thickness or order. Aside of the academic interest in understanding how cholesterol modulates GPCR action, this issue is also important for the pharmaceutical industry. GPCRs constitute a major target for pharmaceutical drugs and there is a growing interest in finding molecules that can modulate GPCR activity by binding to allosteric sites.</p><p>In the current project, Vattulainen et al. studied the effect of cholesterol on the structural and dynamic properties of the β2-AR using extensive MD simulations. The simulations predicted three main cholesterol binding sites. The first (IC1) is in agreement with the crystal structures of the β2-AR, and is at the general area of a known conserved cholesterol-binding motif (CCM). The second binding site (IC2) is undocumented, and the third (EC1) is in agreement with the crystal structure of the adenosine 2A receptor. While the validity of EC1 and IC2 as specific cholesterol binding sites is yet to be confirmed, the fact that the well-documented IC1 has also been predicted by the same simulations is encouraging. Furthermore, EC1 and IC2, if valid, can be used as potential target sites for GPCR-specific drugs.</p><p>The simulations also predicted two cholesterol-induced effects on the β2-AR. The first is a general restriction of the inherent dynamics of the protein. This effect was not observed when the general properties of the membrane were changed in the absence of cholesterol, and thus, the authors concluded that this effect is specific. The second cholesterol-induced effect predicted by the simulation appeared in the second binding site, IC2. There, cholesterol was predicted to push the intracellular end of TM6 more towards the core of the helical bundle, and prevented the outward movement of this helix. This effect is particularly interesting, as the outward movement of TM6 is associated with GPCR activation, and creates the binding site for the receptor's cognate G-protein. The restriction of TM6 movement by cholesterol is a potentially important allosteric effect, which again, can be used to modulate GPCR activity.</p><p>This is an important project and the manuscript reads well, however, a number of outstanding issues, listed below, should be addressed before decision can be made about publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The general restriction of β2-AR dynamics by cholesterol is rather obvious considering the rigid structure of cholesterol; this rigidity would restrict the dynamics of any molecule bound to cholesterol, be it a neighboring membrane lipid or a protein.

This site resides in a cleft created by TMs 1-4 and contains the conserved cholesterol consensus motif (CCM). The conservation of the CCM has implicated it as a possible allosteric site in class A GPCRs. Since the current study focusses on possible allosteric effects of cholesterol, the neglect of IC1 in the analysis of the results seems odd.

The Introduction says that cholesterol likely interacts with GPCRs and 'has been shown to influence the ligand binding and signaling properties of β2AR'. This is a bit vague given this underlies the whole of the study presented here. Or perhaps not much is known experimentally, in which case to what extent can one formulate a clear hypothesis to be tested via simulation?</p><p>8) Introduction, last paragraph. The 'physiological' concentration of cholesterol is given as 10 mol%; Sampaio et al. says cholesterol concentration in e.g. epithelial cell membranes is more like 25 to 30 mol% (Sampaio et al., 2011, PNAS).</p><p>9) Subsection “Membrane-mediated interactions not the key”: the authors show quite conclusively that the effects of cholesterol on the conformational dynamics of the receptor and are not due simply to a change in the physical state of the surrounding bilayer. A clinching test would be to place cholesterol at the binding sites (perhaps by taking a snapshot from the high cholesterol simulation), then place the receptor/cholesterol complex in a cholesterol free membrane and see how the conformational dynamics of the protein change as the cholesterol is release. Has this been done? From the discussion of binding lifetimes (subsection “Binding lifetime depends on cholesterol”), the bound cholesterols might dissociate on a 0.1 µs timescale. Indeed, is this the simulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> (it is not clear – <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> is a bit impenetrable)? And if so, what is the time course for unbinding of the cholesterols? This needs to be explored/explained in more detail.</p><p>10) Subsection “Cholesterol analogues interact with β2AR”.

Having said that, the fact that cholesterol analogues had a weaker effect on protein dynamics despite their rigid structure suggests that additional factors are in play. Perhaps this issue could be explored in greater detail to decipher the energy determinants and physicochemical underlines.</italic> </p><p>Our results suggest that the restriction to β<sub>2</sub>AR dynamics arises from the binding of cholesterol to specific interaction sites on the receptor surface. Cholesterol analogues, although being structurally very similar to cholesterol, induce weaker effects. We quantified this as follows.</p><p>We found that while both cholesterol and its analogues have a rigid ring structure, their different chemical compositions (such as the esterified succinic acid group in cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) compared to the hydroxyl group in cholesterol (at the 3β position), or the additional hydroxyl groups in oxysterols not found in cholesterol) influence their occupancy as well as the strength of binding to the specific interaction sites. To explore this in more detail, we calculated the total van der Waals (vdW) interaction energy as well as the number of contacts between cholesterol and β<sub>2</sub>AR, when cholesterol is in the IC1, IC2, or EC1 binding site (please see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Similar calculations were carried out for the cholesterol analogues. Given that the van der Waals energy is a short-range interaction, it reflects how strongly the two molecules are in contact and therefore serves as an excellent measure for the gravity of lipid-protein binding in the binding site. The results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> show without doubt that the van der Waals interaction of cholesterol with β<sub>2</sub>AR is substantially stronger than in the case of CHS or the oxysterols.</p><p>The new results show that among the three major interaction sites, the binding of CHS at IC1 is much weaker than that of cholesterol. At IC2 the strength of interaction of CHS and cholesterol are comparable. Meanwhile, the extracellular EC1 site remains unoccupied by CHS indicating the binding energy to be low. As to the two oxysterols considered in our study, 4β-OH-Chol interacts with β<sub>2</sub>AR only at EC1 and the interaction is weak. 27-OH-Chol binds at EC1 as tightly as cholesterol, but its interaction at the two other binding sites (IC1 and IC2) is much weaker than in the case of cholesterol. Concluding, CHS interacts at IC2 as strongly as cholesterol but its interactions at IC1 and EC1 are negligible compared to those of cholesterol. The oxysterol 27-OH-Chol interacts at EC1 as strongly as cholesterol but its interactions at IC1 and IC2 are negligible compared to those of cholesterol. The oxysterol 4β-OH-Chol does not interact with β<sub>2</sub>AR to a significant degree.</p><p>Consistently, we earlier found that CHS restricts the dynamics of the β<sub>2</sub>AR G protein binding site similarly as cholesterol (L<sub>G</sub>in<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9C, D</xref>), which supports our hypothesis that the binding of cholesterol or cholesterol-like molecules at IC2 (composed of intracellular ends of H5 and H6) suppresses the dynamics at the G protein binding site by suppressing the dynamics of respective helices. Similarly as EC1 remains completely unoccupied by CHS, it cannot restrict the dynamics of the extracellular ligand-binding site of the receptor (L<sub>L</sub>in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9C, D</xref>).</p><p>These data can be considered in the context of molecular structures. In CHS, the difference compared to cholesterol is the additional chain coupled to cholesterol via an ester bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A</xref>). Based on our results this additional chain does not interfere binding at IC2, but it does interfere the binding at IC1 and EC1. In 27-OH-Chol, the oxidation has taken place in the short acyl chain that is the terminal subunit of the molecule. This does not interfere the binding at EC1 but does alter the binding at IC1 and IC2. Finally, in 4β-OH-Chol, the oxidation has taken place in the rigid steroid moiety, making the α-side of the molecule rougher. In cholesterol, the α-side is exceptionally flat. Given this change in surface roughness, and the importance of the surface-surface contact in lipid-β<sub>2</sub>AR binding in the binding site, it is quite obvious why this oxysterol does not bind with any of the cholesterol binding sites (IC1, IC2, EC1).</p><p>The new results confirm that the binding of cholesterol or cholesterol-like molecules at the specific interaction sites restrict the conformational fluctuation of β<sub>2</sub>AR – tighter binding suppresses β<sub>2</sub>AR dynamics considerably, and the effect of cholesterol is the strongest. The new results also provide a more solid structural basis to understand why the binding of cholesterol with β<sub>2</sub>AR is superior compared to CHS or the oxysterols.</p><p>Based on the above, we have done the following revisions and additions:</p><p>We have discussed the above ideas (Section: Cholesterol analogues interact with β<sub>2</sub>AR);</p><p>We have presented <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and discussed its results.</p><p><italic>2) A discussion of the effect of cholesterol binding to the first binding site (IC1) is missing.

The given study defines a cholesterol consensus motif (CCM) [4.39-4.43(R,K)]—[4.50(W,Y)]—[4.46(I,V,L)]—[2.41(F,Y)], which predicts cholesterol binding for 44% of human class A receptors (Gilchrist, 2010). Our present simulation study reproduced cholesterol binding at this interaction site (named in our paper as IC1) and satisfied the condition of strict-CCM binding, where the conserved residues (R151<sup>4.43</sup>, W158<sup>4.50,</sup>I154<sup>4.46</sup>, andY70<sup>2.41</sup>) participated in cholesterol binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>). The close agreement between our simulation results and the experimental prediction strengthens the view that the simulation approach we have used is valid.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18432.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Specific cholesterol binding site in β<sub>2</sub>AR with CCM displayed with side chain positions of conserved amino acid residues, as found in (<bold>A</bold>) the crystal structure (1) and (<bold>B</bold>) during our simulation.</title><p>In the simulation snapshot, residues are colored according to their strength of interaction with cholesterol (red represents the weakest and blue represents the strongest interaction).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18432.026">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18432.026</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-18432-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>The physiological relevance of specific cholesterol binding at IC1 is not yet fully understood. In the article describing the crystal structure, the authors used the occluded surface area method to analyze internal packing of helices (Gilchrist, 2010). The study showed that cholesterol increases the packing of H4, indicating decreasing mobility (Gilchrist, 2010). The effect was suggested to be due to the binding of cholesterol at IC1, where H4 establishes major binding interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>). From the simulation trajectory we calculated the standard deviation of H4 fluctuations, when IC1 is either occupied or unoccupied by cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref>). Our results show that the fluctuations of H4 around its average position are more suppressed when cholesterol is bound to IC1. This result is in agreement with experimental findings. While H4 is not one of the strongest points of β<sub>2</sub>AR fold, its decreased mobility may account for the enhanced stability of the receptor. We did not observe similar stabilizing effects of cholesterol binding at IC1 on the helices H1-H3. Finally, a recent simulation study reported a correlation between cholesterol occupancy at IC1 and β<sub>2</sub>AR dimerization (Lefkowitz, 2000). This study showed that cholesterol occupancy at H4 restricts its participation in dimer interface formation and subsequently stabilizes the dimer interface with H1 and H2 instead of H4 and H5 (Lefkowitz, 2000).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18432.027</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>For the time-dependent distance betweenH4 and its average position, as the H4 helix fluctuates around its average location, shown here are results for the standard deviation of the distance fluctuations.</title><p>Data are given for cases, where IC1 is occupied (blue) or unoccupied (orange) by cholesterol.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18432.027">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18432.027</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-18432-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p>We move on to discuss if there is any impact of IC1 on the observed conformational change of β<sub>2</sub>AR reported in our work. To decouple the effect of IC1 from the two other binding sites, we consider the following cases. Our results show that CHS interacts at IC2 as strongly as cholesterol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In systems with 10 mol% CHS, we observed a high CHS density at IC2, but not at IC1 or EC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8C, D</xref>). In the system with 40 mol% CHS, in addition to a high CHS density at IC2, IC1 is also occasionally occupied by CHS, while EC1 remains unoccupied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8E, F</xref>). In either of these cases, CHS restricts the dynamics of the G protein-binding site similarly to the extent of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9C, D</xref>), irrespective of whether IC1 is occupied or unoccupied by cholesterol. The result indicates that sterol occupancy at IC2, but not at IC1, is crucial for controlling the dynamics of the G protein binding site, calculated by the displacement of the intracellular part of H6. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that in the presence of 5 mol% cholesterol, β<sub>2</sub>AR exhibits large fluctuations at the G protein binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 3</xref>), where IC1 is occupied by cholesterol but IC2 remains unoccupied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>(top panel)). In bilayers with CHS, no CHS was observed at the extracellular binding site EC1. Consequently, in these systems β<sub>2</sub>AR shows large fluctuations at the extracellular ligand binding site, irrespective of the high CHS occupancy at IC2 and also at IC1 for systems with 40 mol% CHS.</p><p>Altogether these results suggest that IC1, located at the intracellular surface cleft between H1-H4, does not show much influence on the mobility of H5 and H6, which play a major role in determining the conformational dynamics of β<sub>2</sub>AR.</p><p>Based on the above, we have done the following revisions and additions:</p><p>We have discussed the above ideas (Section: Discussion);</p><p>We have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">Figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>and discussed this new data;</p><p>We have included two new videos (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> (related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)).</p><p><italic>3) Furthermore, the results could be correlated with evolutionary data (e.g., using ConSurf). The anticipation is that biologically relevant binding sites would be shared among other GPCRs (orthologues at the very least), which implies that the binding residues should be evolutionarily conserved.</italic> </p><p>Our simulations suggest three main binding sites of cholesterol on β<sub>2</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). One of these sites (IC1), located at the intracellular surface cleft between H1-4, matches very well the recently reported crystal structure of β<sub>2</sub>AR (Gilchrist, 2010). This site contains a cholesterol consensus motif (CCM) with the sequence [4.39-4.43(R,K)]—[4.50(W,Y)]—[4.46(I,V,L)]—[2.41(F,Y)]. As also discussed in the previous point, our simulations reproduce interactions between these conserved amino acid residues and cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>) that are important in binding cholesterol at IC1.44% of human class A receptors are predicted to bind cholesterol at the same site as β<sub>2</sub>AR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> of Gilchrist, 2010). In addition to IC1, our simulations proposed two other cholesterol interaction sites (IC2 and EC1) on β<sub>2</sub>AR. EC1 is in agreement with the location of cholesterol found in the crystal structure of the adenosine receptor A<sub>2A</sub>AR (Manglik and Kobilka, 2014).</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, in order to examine whether our predicted β<sub>2</sub>AR cholesterol binding sites are conserved during the evolution of the receptor, we analyzed amino acid sequences of β<sub>2</sub>AR orthologues from available databases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). We used the PhylomeDB server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://phylomedb.org/">http://phylomedb.org/</ext-link>) (Kobilka, 2013) for finding orthologues and Clustal Omega (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/</ext-link>) (Cherezov et al., 2007) for sequence alignment. The amino acid residues of β<sub>2</sub>AR segments constituting the cholesterol binding sites as obtained from our simulations are used for the set of sequences obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). The following sequences belong to diverse species, such as insects, fish, birds, reptile, mammals, etc. The alignments show that the cholesterol binding residues of the three interaction sites are conserved in most of the species. Therefore, it appears that these cholesterol-binding sites are evolutionarily conserved in β<sub>2</sub>AR.</p><p>Based on the above, we have done the following revisions and additions to the paper:</p><p>We have discussed the above ideas in the main paper (Section: Specific binding of cholesterol);</p><p>We have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>, where we provide this new data in full.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>: That the shape of the distances distribution changes with cholesterol concentration in a non-monotonic manner is of concern. Maybe in spite of the long simulation time the results are still not converged in all ranges?</italic> </p><p>We are afraid that there was a misunderstanding of the data shown in the original manuscript. We consider this possibility in the end of this point, however let us first discuss the data and show that their cholesterol concentration dependence is systematic/monotonic, as expected.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 3</xref> we depict the distributions of L<sub>L</sub> (width of the ligand binding site) and L<sub>G</sub> (width of the G protein interface) distances separately for each individual trajectory and for all the different cholesterol concentrations (0-40 mol%). These data correspond to the L<sub>L</sub> vs. L<sub>G</sub> distance distributions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-E</xref>. It is apparent from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 3</xref> that the distributions of both L<sub>L</sub> and L<sub>G</sub> are broad in the absence of cholesterol, and also at a very low cholesterol concentration (2 mol%), indicating that for low cholesterol concentrations the β<sub>2</sub>AR receptor undergoes continuous conformational fluctuations between “wide ligand-binding site/narrow G protein-binding site” and “narrow ligand-binding site/wide G protein binding site”. However, the distributions become more and more narrow with increasing cholesterol concentration. At cholesterol concentrations above about 10 mol%, one finds sharper distributions with a single peak, reflecting the confinement of the receptor in a particular conformational state. Moreover, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 3</xref> shows that in individual simulations for a given cholesterol concentration, the receptor samples essentially similar states, indicating quite complete convergence of the present simulation results. The results therefore confirm a systematic/monotonic effect of cholesterol concentration on the β<sub>2</sub>AR conformational distribution.</p><p>Further, we have binned the 2D conformational distance data (shown, e.g., in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B and 1C</xref>in the main text) to a 2D histogram, and then counted its ‘area' by calculating the number of bins that had a non-zero value. The results depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 4</xref> show that for increasing cholesterol concentration, the area covered by the (L<sub>L</sub>, L<sub>G</sub>) conformational distribution decreases, in line with the data shown in Autghor response <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">image 3</xref>. To make sure that this result is not compromised by bins where the value of the probability of being in a given (L<sub>L</sub>, L<sub>G</sub>)-state is very low, we repeated the analysis by disregarding the bins whose occupancy was less than 1% of the maximum value in the 2D distribution. The latter calculation (cutoff 0.01 x P<sub>max</sub> shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 4</xref>) does not affect the result: the effect of cholesterol is systematic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 4</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, the data presented here show that the conformational distribution of the receptor determined as a function of L<sub>L</sub> and L<sub>G</sub> distances changes in a systematic/monotonic manner with increasing cholesterol concentration from 0 to 40 mol%. These concentration values correspond to the distance distributions presented in panels A-E(earlier B-F) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Panel F(earlier A) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>is an exception, however here the initial configuration of the simulated system was distinctly different compared to the other simulated systems. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>(earlier 1A) describes a situation, where 8 cholesterol molecules were initially (at time zero of the simulation) bound at the 8 interaction sites on β<sub>2</sub>AR that were predicted by our simulations and previous experimental data, while the rest of the membrane system had no cholesterol. Therefore, in this system, at large times in the multi-microsecond scales, all or at least most of the cholesterol molecules were no longer bound to β<sub>2</sub>AR and instead they resides in the membrane far from the receptor – therefore at long times this system describes cholesterol-poor conditions. We consider that since this background was not described to a sufficient degree in the original paper, the reviewers unfortunately misunderstood the situation described by this system. A detailed discussion of this system and its results are given in the point 9 below.</p><p>Based on the above, we have clarified the concerns and questions presented. However, we concluded that the new results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 4</xref>) do not add significant new insight to the paper; therefore, they have not been included to the paper.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18432.028</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Distributions of L<sub>L</sub> and L<sub>G</sub> distances from individual trajectories (shown in different colors) for various cholesterol concentrations.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18432.028">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18432.028</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-18432-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18432.029</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Area in the 2D histogram visited by the receptor conformations.</title><p>The bin edge length was set to 0.1 Å in both dimensions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18432.029">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18432.029</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-18432-resp-fig4-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>5) This has implications on the main research question here, i.e., whether cholesterol affects the conformational changes of the receptor directly or via general effect on membrane properties. The authors argue that the distribution of receptor' conformations when cholesterol binds the receptor directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is markedly different in comparison to when it does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, to me the difference is small, and in view of the non-monotonic behavior mentioned above, the conclusion might be erroneous.</italic> </p><p>Please see our answer above regarding the “non-monotonic” behavior. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> represents the distribution of the receptor’s conformation in the presence of 10 mol% cholesterol when cholesterol binds to the receptor directly. As we discussed in the earlier point, here the distribution is restricted to one particular conformation with L<sub>L</sub> ~ 13 Å and L<sub>G</sub> ~ 9.5 Å. The receptor samples a similar conformational space at higher cholesterol concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 3</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, in the absence of cholesterol, β<sub>2</sub>AR samples a much broader conformational space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 3</xref>) with L<sub>L</sub> ranging between ~11-17 Å and L<sub>G</sub> ranging between ~7-13 Å).</p><p>Importantly, the broad conformational distribution of β<sub>2</sub>AR found under cholesterol-poor conditions is also observed in cholesterol-free bilayers whose physical properties are consistent with cholesterol-rich bilayers (but without cholesterol). First, cholesterol is known to increase membrane thickness significantly. We induced this effect with long-chain PC lipids that give rise to a thick membrane and found (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) (earlier <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that in this system L<sub>L</sub> fluctuates strongly between ~11-16.5 Å and L<sub>G</sub> varies between ~7-12.5 Å. This implies that a thick membrane does not induce the restricted conformational behavior we found in cholesterol-rich bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Second, cholesterol is known to order lipid membranes significantly. To test this membrane-mediated effect, we used pyrene instead of cholesterol to increase membrane order to a level that matches the membrane order found with 10 mol% of cholesterol. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) show L<sub>L</sub> to range between ~9-17.5 Å and L<sub>G</sub> to vary between ~7-13.5 Å, therefore the receptor’s conformational fluctuations match the data found in the absence of cholesterol. This implies that membrane-mediated interactions do not cause the restricted conformational behavior we found with cholesterol.</p><p>Altogether, the data show that when cholesterol concentration is increased from low to high (from about zero to 10 mol%), the conformational behavior of β<sub>2</sub>AR is altered significantly. At small cholesterol concentrations, the ligand and the G protein binding sites of β<sub>2</sub>AR fluctuate between wide and narrow states, while at high cholesterol concentrations the β<sub>2</sub>AR conformation (and the ligand and the G protein binding sites) are fixed to a single state. These trends are systematic and consistent as we increase cholesterol concentration from zero to 40 mol%. These data were consistent when we repeated the simulations for every cholesterol concentration many times.</p><p>Based on the above, we have done the following revisions:</p><p>We have clarified the concern as to the assumed non-monotonic behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>);</p><p>We have included two new videos (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> (related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)).</p><p><italic>6) While the focus here is on inactivation it would be nice to show also activation for completeness.</italic> </p><p>Studying activation, i.e., transition from the inactive to the active sate β<sub>2</sub>AR is beyond the present work given that the timescale of the activation process is likely milliseconds. Nonetheless, we followed the reviewers’ recommendation and carried out an additional extensive set of simulations for the active-state receptor.</p><p>We studied the effect of cholesterol on the conformation of the active state β<sub>2</sub>AR in apo form and in the absence of the G protein (Hanson et al., 2008). We conducted replicate unbiased atomistic MD simulations of the active state β<sub>2</sub>AR embedded in a DOPC bilayer with 0 and 40 mol% cholesterol (three independent 2.5 μs simulations for each system, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In the active form, the intracellular end of H6 is splayed outward from the helical bundle providing room for the G protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 5A</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of cholesterol (0 mol%), we observed inward swinging of H6 towards H3 (observed in 2 out of 3 replicas). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 5B, E</xref>, the intracellular end of H6 spontaneously approaches H3 with L<sub>G</sub> dropping from 18.97 Å in the starting active conformation to ~11.5 Å that matches the crystallographically observed inactive conformation of β<sub>2</sub>AR (L<sub>G</sub> ~11 Å). Such spontaneous deactivation of the receptor in the absence of the intracellular binding partner is in agreement with recent simulations (Rasmussen et al., 2011; Nygaard et al., 2013) and experimental studies (Dror et al., 2009).</p><p>In the presence of cholesterol (40 mol%), we observed that the active-like open conformation (without G protein) is stable during the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 5C, E</xref>,the L<sub>G</sub> value remains stable ~16.5 Å and no deactivation is observed unlike in cholesterol-free systems. Interestingly, we found a high cholesterol density at the IC2 interaction site located at the cleft between the intracellular segments of H5-H6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 5C, D, F</xref>). Cholesterol bound at IC2 acts as a spacer between H5-H6 and restricts the movement of H6, thereby stabilizing the open active-like conformation of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 5C, D</xref>).</p><p>These results for the active state β<sub>2</sub>AR support our previous conclusion that cholesterol restricts the conformational dynamics of the receptor by binding at specific interaction sites. Altogether, our results (based on both inactive and active-state β<sub>2</sub>AR conformations) suggest that specific interactions of cholesterol with β<sub>2</sub>AR govern changes between the receptor’s different conformational states, which in turn affect receptor activation. Moreover, the results highlight the importance of IC2: cholesterol binding at IC2 in both inactive and active conformational states of β<sub>2</sub>AR as found in our simulations indicates the significant biological relevance of this interaction site.</p><p>Based on the above, we have done the following revisions and additions:</p><p>We have discussed the above ideas in the paper (Sections: Cholesterol restricts β<sub>2</sub>AR conformation; Discussion) and shown as a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>;</p><p>We have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18432.030</object-id><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Cytosolic view of β<sub>2</sub>AR (<bold>A</bold>) in the beginning of simulation (active state) as well as in representative simulation snapshots in (<bold>B</bold>) a DOPC bilayer and (<bold>C</bold>) in the presence of 40 mol% cholesterol.</title><p>The dotted line represents the distance between the Cα atoms of R131<sup>3.50</sup>–E268<sup>6.30</sup> (defined as L<sub>G</sub>) used to measure the fluctuation at the G protein binding site.

The Introduction says that cholesterol likely interacts with GPCRs and 'has been shown to influence the ligand binding and signaling properties of β2AR'. This is a bit vague given this underlies the whole of the study presented here. Or perhaps not much is known experimentally, in which case to what extent can one formulate a clear hypothesis to be tested via simulation?</italic> </p><p>β<sub>2</sub>AR belongs to the family of class A GPCRs. GPCRs belonging to this class show a high structural similarity and functional diversity. The literature reporting on the specific functional role of cholesterol and other lipids is extensive (Ozcan et al., 2013; Dror et al., 2011). Reportedly cholesterol has been shown to affect the conformation (Oates and Watta, 2011; Lingwood and Simons, 2010) and function (Ozcan et al., 2013; Oates and Watta, 2011;Allen, Halverson-Tamboli and Resenick, 2007; Contreras et al., 2012; Coskun et al., 2011) of many GPCRs. Experimental data have been published that cholesterol binds specifically to β<sub>2</sub>AR (Gilchrist, 2010; Neale et al., 2015), and it has been experimentally shown that cholesterol binding to β<sub>2</sub>AR changes its structural properties (Gilchrist, 2010; Dawaliby et al., 2016). Since structure and function of GPCRs are closely related one may thus expect that cholesterol binding specifically to β<sub>2</sub>AR changes also the functional properties of the receptor. Indeed a few experimental papers have been published which indicate that cholesterol also has a functional role (Paila and Chattopadhyay, 2009; Gimpl, Burger and Fahrenholz, 1997). Thus, in our study we wanted to understand a molecular dynamics basis where and how cholesterol binds to β<sub>2</sub>AR and which are the possible structural and functional effects.</p><p>Based on the above, we have done the following revisions:</p><p>We have revised the Introduction accordingly, together with related new references.</p><p><italic>8) Introduction, last paragraph. The 'physiological' concentration of cholesterol is given as 10 mol%; Sampaio et al. says cholesterol concentration in e.g. epithelial cell membranes is more like 25 to 30 mol% (Sampaio et al., 2011, PNAS).</italic> </p><p>We have removed the term “physiological” and modified the manuscript accordingly.</p><p><italic>9) Subsection “Membrane-mediated interactions not the key”: the authors show quite conclusively that the effects of cholesterol on the conformational dynamics of the receptor and are not due simply to a change in the physical state of the surrounding bilayer. A clinching test would be to place cholesterol at the binding sites (perhaps by taking a snapshot from the high cholesterol simulation), then place the receptor/cholesterol complex in a cholesterol free membrane and see how the conformational dynamics of the protein change as the cholesterol is release. Has this been done? From the discussion of binding lifetimes (subsection “Binding lifetime depends on cholesterol”), the bound cholesterols might dissociate on a 0.1 µs timescale. Indeed, is this the simulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> (it is not clear – <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> is a bit impenetrable)? And if so, what is the time course for unbinding of the cholesterols? This needs to be explored/explained in more detail.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers correctly sensed that we have already done this test. Let us here explain this matter more clearly.</p><p>We performed simulations (3 replicas) where 8 cholesterol molecules were initially placed at the binding sites of β<sub>2</sub>AR that were predicted by our simulations (snapshot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>); then we placed the receptor/cholesterol complex in a cholesterol-free membrane (“Chol-Bound” trajectory in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The conformational distribution of β<sub>2</sub>AR is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>(earlier 1A, as correctly pointed out by the reviewer in a previous point). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the time profile of unbinding events of cholesterol. From a majority of the binding sites cholesterol leaves very quickly in a timescale of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), similarly to the short binding lifetime observed for cholesterol-poor systems (2 mol%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, there are also sites where cholesterol stays for the entire simulation time (IC1 in repeats 2 and 3, and IC2 in repeats 1 and 3) or where cholesterol is released from the receptor in μs timescale (IC3 and EC3 in repeat 1).</p><p>Although for these systems the average cholesterol concentration is low (1.9 mol%), due to the setup of the initial system configuration, the concentration of cholesterol in the annular region is high when the simulation is started. Then, as some cholesterol molecules are released from the receptor during the course of the simulations, the concentration of cholesterols bound to the receptor decreases gradually but systematically. Given this, the early-time behavior of these systems corresponds to cholesterol-rich conditions while at long times the behavior corresponds to cholesterol-poor conditions.</p><p>When we analyzed the “Chol-bound” simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), we found that the conformational behavior of β<sub>2</sub>AR changes from cholesterol-rich behavior (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) to cholesterol-poor behavior (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, presenting the time-dependence of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>is not particularly useful given that the sampling within each time window would be so limited that it would be hard to see the trends easily.</p><p>Based on the above, we have done the following revisions and additions to the paper:</p><p>We have discussed this data more concretely in the paper (Section: Cholesterol restricts β<sub>2</sub>AR conformation), where we also clarified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>;</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> has been clarified.</p><p><italic>10) Subsection “Cholesterol analogues interact with β2AR”.

The data presented in ref 19 on the influence of cholesterol manipulation on the signaling properties of β<sub>2</sub>AR show an inhibition of β<sub>2</sub>AR-associated signaling by increasing membrane cholesterol content. These are now briefly discussed in the article.</p><p><italic>11) The Discussion could perhaps be a bit tighter – to some extent it re-iterates what has been said earlier.</italic> </p><p>We have followed the advice and revised/cut the Discussion to be more solid. The total length has not decreased though, since due to the additional simulations for the active-state receptor, the further discussion on the role of cholesterol interactions with the active-state β<sub>2</sub>AR had to be included in the Discussion, too.</p></body></sub-article></article>
