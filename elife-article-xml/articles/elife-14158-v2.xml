How loader activity is appropriately controlled remains unclear. Here, we use structural and biochemical analyses to establish how an antimicrobial phage protein interferes with the function of the <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> replicative helicase loader, DnaI. The viral protein binds to the loader’s AAA+ ATPase domain, allowing binding of the host replicative helicase but impeding loader self-assembly and ATPase activity. Close inspection of the complex highlights an unexpected locus for the binding of an interdomain linker element in DnaI/DnaC-family proteins. We find that the inhibitor protein is genetically coupled to a phage-encoded homolog of the bacterial helicase loader, which we show binds to the host helicase but not to the inhibitor itself. These findings establish a new approach by which viruses can hijack host replication processes and explain how loader activity is internally regulated to prevent aberrant auto-association.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14158.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14158.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14158.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells must copy their DNA in order to grow and divide. DNA replication begins when a small region of the DNA double helix is unwound to expose single strands of DNA. A protein called a helicase is then shepherded onto the unwound DNA regions by other proteins known as loaders. Once loaded, the helicase can unwind long stretches of the chromosome in which the DNA is packaged, producing the template required by the replication machinery to duplicate the DNA. This process must be accurately executed to avoid generating errors that could damage the DNA and potentially cause cells to die.</p><p>DnaI is a helicase loader protein that is found in some types of bacteria. In the disease-causing bacterial species <italic>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus</italic>), an inhibitor protein from a virus that infects the bacteria can interact with DnaI and halt <italic>S. aureus</italic> DNA replication, leading to cell death. However, it has not been understood how this viral protein controls the activity of the loader molecules.</p><p>DnaI consists of three regions: one that binds to the helicase, a short 'linker' region, and a third element that harnesses chemical energy (in the form of a small high-energy molecule called ATP) to drive the loader’s activity. Using biochemical and structural techniques, Hood and Berger now show that the viral inhibitor protein interacts with the DnaI loader from <italic>S. aureus</italic> by binding to the loader's ATP-binding region. When the two proteins are bound together, the loader can still bind to its target helicase but it cannot interact with other loader molecules. This defect prevents the loaders from self-assembling into a structure that is required for them to load the replicative helicase.</p><p>Hood and Berger also found that the region of DnaI targeted by the inhibitor is important for normally ensuring that the loader molecules self-assemble at the correct place and time. A second unexpected discovery was that the virus encodes its own helicase loader, which binds to the bacterial helicase but not to the viral inhibitor protein. The next stage of work will be to determine whether the regions on the helicase loader that are targeted by the inhibitor and that are important for regulating self-assembly can be selectively disrupted by small molecules to interfere with DNA replication in bacteria.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14158.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14158.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd>helicase loader</kwd><kwd>AAA+ ATPase</kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd><kwd><italic>S. aureus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM071747</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>James M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A phage-encoded protein inhibits a bacterial replicative helicase loading factor by exploiting an internal site that auto-regulates loader self-assembly and ATPase activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All cells face the challenging task of copying and passing on genetic information to progeny in an error-free manner as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuchs and Fujii, 2013</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sutera and Lovett, 2006</xref>). DNA synthesis is carried out by large, multi-subunit assemblies, termed replisomes, which are assembled at replication origins in accord with cell cycle cues. Dedicated proteins known as initiators play an essential role in selecting replication start sites, remodeling origin DNA, and providing an appropriate platform for recruiting replicative helicases to origins prior to the onset of strand synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dutta and Bell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaguni, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leonard and Grimwade, 2011</xref>). Although specific helicase loading mechanisms vary across the three domains of life – archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes – all appear to rely on replication initiation factors belonging to the AAA+ (ATPases Associated with various cellular Activities) superfamily of nucleotide hydrolases.</p><p>The timely and accurate deposition of replicative helicases onto origin DNA is a highly coordinated and regulated process. In bacteria, replication initiation relies on the DnaA initiator, which recognizes and marks the bacterial replication origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bramhill and Kornberg, 1988a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">1988b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Funnell et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 1994</xref>).

In certain Gram-negative bacteria, a protein known as DnaC assists with loading of the helicase (known in these organisms as DnaB); many Gram-positive species retain a homolog of DnaC termed DnaI. Both DnaC and DnaI are composed of an N-terminal helicase binding domain that connects to a C-terminal AAA+ ATPase domain by a variable linker region of unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loscha et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Although bacterial DNA replication proteins are strikingly distinct from those found in eukaryotes and archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leipe et al., 1999</xref>), antibiotics currently on the market do not target replication components directly, suggesting that this system may be a valuable prospective drug target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McHenry, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2012</xref>). Along these lines, a small, 52 amino acid protein from phage strain 77, encoded by the <italic>ORF104</italic> gene, has been reported to interact directly with the <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> helicase loader, DnaI, and to inhibit host DNA replication in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2004</xref>).

We show that the phage protein binds directly to DnaI’s AAA+ ATPase domain, where it both remodels a region critical for loader self-assembly and sterically masks a known loader-loader interaction site. Inhibitor binding, which represses the helicase loader’s ATP hydrolysis activity, is found to exploit a surface region normally occupied by a portion of the linker region that connects the N- and C-terminal domains of DnaI. Together, our data not only establish a new means by which viruses can inhibit DNA replication, but also indicate that bacterial helicase loaders possess an unanticipated auto-regulatory element, located within their variable linker region, that serves to help restrict premature loader self-assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The phage 77 ORF104 protein binds the SaDnaI C-terminal AAA+ domain in a nucleotide-independent manner</title><p>To begin to probe the interaction between 77ORF104 and the helicase loader from <italic>S. aureus (Sa</italic>DnaI), we first cloned, expressed, and purified both full-length proteins. By performing amylose pull-down assays using the tagged inhibitor protein as bait and DnaI as prey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we confirmed that 77ORF104 associates with <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2004</xref>). We then conducted limited proteolysis studies of <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI in both the presence and absence of 77ORF104 to determine where the phage protein might bind. Inspection of the reactions using SDS-PAGE showed relatively rapid degradation of <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI when the phage protein was omitted. By contrast, when 77ORF104 was added to the full-length loader, a distinct 20kDa species remained protected from digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Having established that 77ORF104 appears to bind to and/or mask a defined portion of <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI, we next sought to define the interacting regions more precisely. We therefore expressed and purified individual domains of <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI, including the N-terminal domain (NTD) and linker, the AAA+ domain and linker (CTD), and the AAA+ domain alone. Turning again to pull-down assays with tagged 77ORF104, we found that the phage protein was capable of retaining both the isolated C-terminal AAA+ ATPase domain (with or without the preceding linker region) but not the N-terminal domain on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Given this finding, we next tested whether nucleotide was required for <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI’s association with 77ORF104; ATP was found to be dispensable for association with the full-length loader (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>).

AAA+ domain of <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI in a 1:1 manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI’s core AAA+ domain forms an αβα fold typical of the superfamily, and possesses all of the canonical motifs involved in nucleotide binding, such as the Walker-A, Walker-B and Sensor-I elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Walker et al., 1982</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Collectively, these motifs adopt a configuration similar to that seen in structures of other nucleotide-bound AAA+ ATPases (e.g., see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</xref>]), except that the last six C-terminal residues of the structure, which include the Sensor-II amino acid (Arg304), were unresolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Inspection of the electron density in the active site revealed clear density for nucleotide binding, permitting modeling of ADP, BeF<sub>3</sub>, and a single Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion and its associated waters. Interestingly, 77ORF104 can be seen to directly engage the bound nucleotide. In this regard, Lys39 of the phage inhibitor protein makes one of the more notable contacts, projecting into the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI<sup>AAA+</sup> active site to engage the BeF<sub>3</sub> moiety directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Structurally observed interactions are important for loader-inhibitor interactions</title><p>Upon inspection of the 77ORF104<italic>•Sa</italic>DnaI<sup>AAA+</sup> binding interface, it became evident that the interaction of these proteins can be divided into roughly three 'hotspots' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). One such locus involves the five most C-terminal residues of the protein, which form a β-strand that associates laterally with one edge of the β-sheet in <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI’s AAA+ domain core. The other two loci involve residues such as Tyr17 and Lys39, which make contacts to or around the nucleotide-binding site of <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI and the associated loader-inhibitor interaction surface.</p><p>To determine whether specific contacts observed in the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI<sup>AAA+</sup><italic>•</italic>77ORF104 complex are important for the inhibitor’s association with DnaI, we designed, cloned and purified several 77ORF104 mutants based on the structure and tested them for binding to <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI<sup>AAA+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Lys39 and Tyr17 were each mutated to glutamate in the full-length 77ORF104 protein, and the last six amino acids of the inhibitor’s C-terminus were also truncated (77ORF104<sup>Δ47–52</sup>). We then developed a competition-based fluorescence anisotropy assay to assess the ability of different mutant proteins to displace fluorescently labeled, wild-type 77ORF104 from the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI AAA+ domain. As expected, native 77ORF104 proved capable of competing away the dye-labeled 77ORF104 protein from binding to <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI<sup>AAA+</sup> (K<sub>i,app</sub>=1.625 μM ± 0.07 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), establishing the utility of the assay. Testing of the 77ORF104<sup>K39E</sup> mutant revealed only a modest reduction in potency relative to the wild-type protein, indicating that this amino acid serves a relatively peripheral role in stabilizing the inhibitor-loader interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). By comparison, removal of the C-terminal tail of 77ORF104 or mutation of Tyr17 to glutamate completely abrogated the ability of 77ORF104 to compete for binding by the labeled inhibitor protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Together, these data corroborate the structural interactions seen in the 77ORF104•<italic>Sa</italic>DnaI<sup>AAA+</sup> complex, demonstrating that both Tyr17 and the last five residues of the C-terminal tail of 77ORF104 are particularly critical for the activity of the phage inhibitor. The results with the 77ORF104<sup>K39E</sup> mutant additionally are consistent with our pull-down studies, which show that the 77ORF104-<italic>Sa</italic>DnaI interaction does not require nucleotide for stable association <underline>(</underline><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><underline>Figure 2A<underline>–</underline>B</underline></xref><underline>)</underline>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>77ORF104 blocks DnaI self-assembly by two mechanisms</title><p>Having established how the phage inhibitor engages <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI, we sought next to determine how 77ORF104 binding might interfere with specific loader functions.

This element, termed the <bold>I</bold>nitiator/loader-<bold>S</bold>pecific <bold>M</bold>otif (ISM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dueber et al., 2007</xref>), has been shown to be important for self-assembly and function in replicative helicase loaders and initiators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dueber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erzberger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duderstadt et al., 2011</xref>). In nucleotide-oligomerized DnaA and DnaC/I structures, the ISM introduces a significant out-of-plane displacement of adjacent ATPase folds, and appears responsible for pushing these assemblies into a helical, as opposed to closed-ring, formation. As anticipated, based on structural alignments with DnaC/I homologs, the ISM of 77ORF104-bound <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI<sup>AAA+</sup> forms a V-shaped projection from the central ATPase domain. Inspection of this region, however, revealed that one of the α-helices of the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI ISM is bent compared to the ISM region of other helicase loaders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Examination of the crystal contacts in our <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI<sup>AAA+</sup><italic>•</italic>77ORF104 structure indicates that the change in conformation of the ISM is not the result of packing interactions, indicating that binding of the 77ORF104 inhibitor is responsible for introducing this conformational change in <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI<sup>AAA+</sup>.</p><p>To determine whether the conformational change seen in the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI ISM corresponds to a natural state of <italic>S. aureus</italic> protein, or as a result of binding to phage 77 ORF104, we crystallized and determined the structure of the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI AAA+ domain in absence of the inhibitor protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Structural alignment of the apo and 77ORF104-bound <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI<sup>AAA+</sup> models shows that the ISM is straight in the absence of the inhibitor, as seen in other helicase loader structures, such as <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> DnaI (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This result indicates that the bent conformational change visualized for the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI ISM in the presence of the inhibitor is a consequence of 77ORF104 binding, rather than a species-specific state of the loader alone. Thus, in addition to sterically blocking partner binding, 77ORF104 remodels a critical self-assembly element in DnaI to further interfere with loader self-association.</p><p>Given that the N-terminal domain of DnaC/I-type helicase loaders contains the portion of the protein known to bind the replicative helicase, we reasoned that the 77ORF104 inhibitor might not disrupt the ability of DnaI to associate with its cognate target, DnaC (known as <italic>Sa</italic>DnaC, a DnaB-family helicase not to be confused with the <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaI homolog and helicase loader, <italic>Ec</italic>DnaC). To test this idea, we performed pull-down experiments using tagged 77ORF104 as bait to bind either untagged <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI or <italic>Sa</italic>DnaC-bound <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI as prey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Analysis of the reactions by SDS-PAGE revealed that both free <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI and 77ORF104-bound <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI were able to bind to the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaC helicase equally well. By contrast, 77ORF104 did not bind to the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaC helicase alone. Overall, this result is consistent with a model in which 77ORF104 inhibits <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI function not by blocking loader/helicase associations, but by preventing loader self-assembly. Both light-scattering and analytical size-exclusion chromotography data corrobate this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>77ORF104 inhibits ssDNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis by SaDnaI</title><p>If 77ORF104 targets the ability of <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI to self-associate, as opposed to an interaction with the host helicase, then the protein should be expected to affect functions of DnaI that rely on loader-loader interactions.

To test whether 77ORF104 might impact such a function, we carried out radioactive ATP hydrolysis assays using [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP and M13-ssDNA. Although <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI was found to exhibit relatively modest ATPase activity on its own, the presence of M13-ssDNA markedly stimulated nucleotide turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). By contrast, when incubated with the 77ORF104 inhibitor in the presence of M13-ssDNA, the observed stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by ssDNA was much reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B,C</xref>). To establish that the increase in ATPase activity we observed was derived from <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI and not from a potentially contaminating ATPase, we cloned, expressed and purified several active site mutants of <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI. Both a Walker A mutant (K170A) and an arginine finger mutant (R288A) showed reduced ATP hydrolysis activity in the presence of ssDNA, indicating that the ssDNA-stimulated activity seen in our assays was indeed specific to DnaI and did not arise from a contaminating ATPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Together, these findings indicate that the phage inhibitor protein’s association with <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI is specific for binding only to the helicase loader of a host bacterium targeted by the virus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we have set out to better understand not only the function of DnaI-family bacterial helicase loaders, but also how bacteriophage can interfere with helicase loader activity to block host DNA replication. We determined crystal structures of the AAA+ ATPase region of the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI helicase loader in a nucleotide-free state and bound to both the ATP mimic ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub> and a DnaI-binding protein (77ORF104) from phage 77 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A–B</xref>). The structures reveal that binding of the phage inhibitor not only remodels a region known to be critical for DnaI homo-oligomerization, the Initiator Specific Motif (ISM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), but that it also sterically occludes a principal subunit-subunit interaction surface on the helicase loader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Association studies between 77ORF104 and <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI show that productive interactions are not dependent on nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), but instead require the last five C-terminal residues of the phage inhibitor protein and a particular tyrosine residue (Tyr17) on the inhibitor protein that is buried in the binding interface with <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>).</p><p>The observed structural changes and regions masked by 77ORF104 binding would be expected to prevent DnaI self-association. This prediction is borne out by ATPase assays showing that this activity – which relies on DnaI-DnaI interactions to form a competent catalytic center – is repressed by the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, ORF104 was not found to disrupt the loader’s association with the replicative helicase <italic>Sa</italic>DnaC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This result indicates that 77ORF104 could in principle act at multiple stages during the DNA replication cycle where helicase-loading events are utilized, including both initiation and replication restart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Kaguni, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heller and Marians, 2006</xref>).</p><p>During the course of carrying out this work, we discovered that phage 77 encodes another protein, ORF013, which is homologous to other DnaC/I-family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). Binding studies revealed that this protein binds to the host’s replicative helicase, <italic>Sa</italic>DnaC, but not to the inhibitory 77ORF104 protein that is also produced by phage 77 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>). These observations suggest that the 77ORF013 and 77ORF104, which appear to both share a common operon, may serve as a two-pronged mechanism by which host replication can be inhibited and a portion of the cell’s replication machinery co-opted for promoting viral DNA duplication. Surveys of other <italic>S. aureus</italic> phage genomes, such as phages 80 and 80α, reveal the existence of homologs of both the phage 77 ORF013 protein and the ORF104 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kwan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tormo-Más et al., 2010</xref>), indicating that the phage 77 ORF013/ORF104 system may be widespread among <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> phages. The hijacking of a host replicative helicase for viral replication has been seen before with divergent viruses, including the phages λ, P2 and Mu, as well as influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kawaguchi and Nagata, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kruklitis and Nakai, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mallory et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Odegrip et al., 2000</xref>). However, the co-expression of a putative viral helicase loader with an inhibitor of a host helicase loader has only been seen thus far for phage 77 and its relatives. Although replication initiation has yet to be reconstituted for <italic>S. aureus</italic> using purified factors, the planned development of such a system will allow for future investigations into the effects of ORF013/ORF104 family proteins on helicase loading and phage replication in vitro.</p><p>A second unexpected finding obtained from this work derives from an analysis of where 77ORF104 binds to <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI in the context of other bacterial helicase loading proteins. Previous studies of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> DnaI and the related <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaC protein have shown that bacterial helicase loaders typically require helicase binding and/or ssDNA binding to promote ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ioannou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Learn et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davey et al., 2002</xref>), a function proposed to directly depend on loader self assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mott et al., 2008</xref>). Superposition of the 77ORF104-<italic>Sa</italic>DnaI complex with structures of other DnaI orthologs, particularly those that contain a portion of the helicase loaders’ linker regions, reveal that the C-terminal tail of the inhibitor actually occupies a pocket that corresponds to the observed binding site for a portion of the linker itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Moreover, inspection of these overlays shows that in associating with its own AAA+ ATPase domain, the inter-domain linker additionally blocks a portion of the surface where subunit-subunit interactions form during loader self-association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, see inset). This observation explains why DnaI ATPase domain constructs containing a portion of the linker crystallized as monomers even in the presence of nucleotide, and indicates that the linker likely serves as a switch that reports on relative status of the N- and C-terminal regions, repressing loader-loader interactions until the correct helicase and DNA targets are bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In this regard, the 77ORF104 protein exploits this binding locus, taking advantage of the linker-binding pocket to inactivate the host loader, an activity that would allow the cellular replicative helicase to be re-routed by the phage-encoded loader to promote viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This interaction, which occurs within a small hydrophobic pocket on the loader AAA+ ATPase domain, suggests that the linker-binding region of the DnaI AAA+ domain could serve as an attractive site for the development of chemical inhibitors to target helicase loading and DNA replication in bacteria. Future efforts will help test and establish these concepts further.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14158.012</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Insights into bacterial helicase loader mechanism and regulation derived from this study.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The N- and C-terminal domain linker of DnaC/I helicase loaders occupies a region bound by the phage 77 inhibitor protein.

The bacterial helicase loader linker region forms an intra-molecular interaction with its associated AAA+ domain to auto-repress inopportune loader/loader interactions; upon binding to the replicative helicase, the linker is proposed to undock from this region to allow self-assembly of the loader ATPase folds and subsequently assist with loading of the replicative helicase onto single-stranded origin DNA. The phage 77 ORF104 inhibitor protein binds to cognate loaders such as <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI, repressing loader self-association, ATPase activity, and presumably its ability to properly participate in the helicase loading reaction. Phage 77 is also found to encode a helicase loader homolog (<italic>ORF013</italic>) that directly binds to the host replicative helicase, likely as a means to re-direct the host’s replication machinery toward replication of the viral genome.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14158.012">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14158.012</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-14158-fig7-v2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, expression and protein purification</title><p>Coding sequences for full-length <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> DnaI, DnaI<sup>AAA+</sup> (residues 136–306), DnaI<sup>NTD</sup> (residues 1–117), <italic>Sa</italic>DnaC replicative helicase, and phage 77 ORF104 and ORF013 were cloned into a pET28b (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) derivative with a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease‐cleavable, N‐terminal hexahistidine-MBP tag and verified by sequencing (Elim Biopharmaceuticals, Hayward, CA).

When chilled on ice at elevated concentrations, <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI oligomerizes into visible microcrystals that can be sedimented after a brief centrifugation step. If the inhibitor were to directly disrupt DnaI-DnaI contacts, we reasoned that it should keep the loader in solution. <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI pelleting assays were performed in 60 µL of reaction buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>g and 6 mM ATP. The final reactions contained 90 µM <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI and 180 µM 77ORF104. Reactions were incubated for 20 min on ice before being spun down at 14,000 x g for 1 min. The starting material, pellet and supernatant were then assessed by SDS-PAGE. In line with our predictions, the loader remains in solution when incubated with the inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To better look at the propensity of DnaI to self-associate and of the ORF104 protein to affect this behavior, we next turned to dynamic light scattering (DLS, model DynaPro NanoStar from Wyatt Technology), which can report on the approximate radii of gyration, relative masses, and polydispersity of macromolecules in solution. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments were performed at 10˚C in 70 µL reaction buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, and 2 mM ATP. DLS reactions were prepared at a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI to 77ORF104 with final concentrations of 90 µM SaDnaI and 90 µM 77ORF104. The resultant data show that on its own, <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI forms a very broad, polydisperse mixture of species with a large average molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). By contrast, when measured in the presence of the inhibitor protein, a much smaller, less polydisperse species is formed. Interestingly, the average molecular weight calculated for the dominant species in the DnaI-ORF104 mixture is larger than expected for a 1:1 complex, suggesting that complex formation is incomplete under the conditions tested here and/or that the N-terminal domain of DnaI might self-associate through unsatisfied, exposed surfaces that would normally be used for binding to the helicase. Nonetheless, these findings corroborate the structural and biochemical data indicating that the phage inhibitor disrupts loader-loader interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>Analytical sizing of protein complexes</title><p>To further probe the interactions between <italic>Sa</italic>DnaC with the phage 77 ORF013 and ORF104 proteins and with <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI, we performed analytical sizing runs on a 5/150 GL Superdex 200 column equilibrated in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>g, 1 mM BME and 10 mM ATP. Protein samples were prepared at final concentrations of 7 µM SaDnaC helicase, 14 µM SaDnaI loader, 14 µM 77ORF013 and 30 µM 77ORF104. Peak fractions were collected and ran on 12% SDS-PAGE gels in 1X MOPS running buffer. Protein bands were detected by staining with Imperial Protein Stain (ThermoFischer Scientific).</p><p>The data from this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) show that: <bold>1</bold>) the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaC helicase associates with both the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI helicase loader and the phage helicase loader homolog 77ORF013 (albeit with a degree of instability, as the bands for the helicase and loader proteins do not perfectly overlap –the peak maxima for ORF013 alone occurs at fraction 44 and for ORF013 plus <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI at fraction 42, and at fractions 42 and 40 for <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI alone and with <italic>Sa</italic>DnaC, respectively), and <bold>2</bold>) that the inhibitor does not affect the migration of either the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI helicase loader or phage loader 77ORF013 or the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaC helicase. Interestingly, based on standards run on the same column (not shown), the helicase <italic>Sa</italic>DnaC does not appear to form a stable homo-hexameric ring but instead migrates as an apparent dimeric species.</p><p>Although tangential to the primary findings of the paper, these results turn out to weigh in on a paradox with respect to how bacterial replicative helicases are loaded.

Stable hexamers have been observed for Gram-positive DnaC helicases, but only when using thermophilic proteins (e.g. <italic>B. stearothermophilus</italic> and <italic>G. kaustophilus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ioannou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soultanas, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tsai et al., 2009b</xref>]), whose room-temperature behavior may differ from their mesophilic counterparts. It should be noted that dimers of DnaB-family helicases have been observed previously, wherein the dimer is stabilized by interactions between the N-terminal 'collar' domains of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey et al., 2007b</xref>). Our findings, which show that <italic>S. aureus</italic> helicase/loader interactions form but are somewhat unstable, and that the DnaC helicase does not readily assemble a pre-formed hexamer, are in accord with observations reported for the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> system.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to members of the Berger lab for insightful discussions during the progression of this work, with special thanks to Dr. Tim R Blower and Dr. Franziska Bleichert for their assistance with data collection.

Most significantly, the authors solve a high resolution structure of the AAA+ ATPase domain of <italic>S. aureus</italic> DnaI (the first structures of this protein) in complex with an inhibitory phage encoded peptide 77ORF104 and the ATP analog, ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub>, along with an apo structure of the same DnaI domain by itself. Interpretation of the structural data is supported by biochemical data using mutant proteins and domain constructs. The structures are well-determined at high resolution.</p><p>Interaction of DnaI with 77ORF104 is first confirmed, and its binding site on DnaI is shown to be the C-terminal AAA+ domain using pull-down and fluorescence polarization assays. These studies identified domain constructs suitable for crystallization. Comparison of the structure of the heterodimeric complex with the apo-DnaI structure and helicase loaders from other organisms revealed three features important for inhibition or potential regulation of helicase loading:</p><p>i) The binding site for 77ORF104 occludes the oligomerization interface for helical self-association of the AAA+ domains of DnaI thought to be required for helicase opening, based on the authors' previous structure of the DnaC helicase loader from <italic>Aquifex aoelicus</italic>. The assumption here is that helicase loading in Gram positive and negative organisms is similar, which is an unresolved question in the field (referring to earlier debates about ring-making vs. ring-breaking mechanisms, and the low-resolution Steitz X-ray structure of a Firmicute loader-helicase-primase complex).</p><p>ii) Comparison of the two new structures suggests the interactions of 77ORF104 leads to structural change in one helix in the ISM of DnaI (to a bent conformation); the ISM is a motif that drives helical assembly vs. ring assembly of the AAA+ domain of DnaA and DnaC. No argument is made that this rearrangement is not due to crystal contacts, and how it might affect helical assembly of DnaI (if it is required at all) is not explicitly discussed.</p><p>iii) A major site of interaction is in the C-terminus of 77ORF104, that forms a β strand that extends the sheet in DnaI (supported by deletion of this region abrogating the interaction). In the <italic>G. kaustophilus</italic> DnaI structure, this strand would occupy the same place as a strand from the interdomain linker (IDL) of DnaI. This suggests a regulatory role for the IDL in DnaI. What is not clear is why this interaction in the CTD of <italic>S. aureus</italic> DnaI (that contains the IDL as well as the AAA+ domain) apparently does not interfere with binding of 77ORF104.</p><p>These results raise the question of how the phage itself replicates when helicase loading is apparently prevented. It is suggested that the phage encodes an alternate loader (77ORF013). This protein is shown to interact with the helicase but not with 77ORF104, but it is not shown yet that it is actually an active helicase loader. A reasonable model is presented that accounts for all of these observations (with some speculation).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Drs Berger and Hood describe an elegant structural and biochemical characterization of a phage-encoded replication inhibitor and its interaction with the host helicase loader.

As a bare minimum, some simple gel filtration experiments could be performed to test this.</p><p>It is intriguing that inhibitor binding does not affect the ability of the loader to interact with the helicase. The manuscript would be strengthened by inclusion of experiments that directly test the helicase loading activity of DnaI. Is the helicase brought to DNA but not released?</p><p>Finally, the authors identify a potential helicase-loader ortholog encoded by the phage and show that this protein can interact with the host helicase. These preliminary data are enticing. However, no further experiments are shown to test further the activity of this candidate loader. Does it have ATPase activity, is it modulated by ssDNA, can the protein load the helicase? Is the gene essential for the viral life-cycle? The manuscript requires these additional supporting experiments to test the functionality of 77ORF013.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14158.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Only one major question needs to be resolved:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) While the structural work strongly supports the inhibitor-mediated ISM deformation and the inhibitor mediated attenuation of ATPase activity support the hypothesis of impaired oligomer formation, some direct proof that the inhibitor does alter the ability of DnaI to form higher order complexes is needed; e.g., simple gel filtration experiments could be performed to test this.

We initially considered using cross-linking and SDS-PAGE to examine self-self interactions between <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI protomers in the presence of both the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaC helicase and the phage 77 ORF104 protein. However, given the large number of possible interactions (loader-loader, loader-helicase, helicase-helicase), we realized that this experiment would likely be difficult to interpret cleanly (we do not have antibodies to any of the proteins in the study, which would have made such an approach more feasible). Instead, inspired by well-established studies of actin and microtubule self-assembly (1, 2), we have looked at loader interactions using a simple centrifugation assay. Based on studies that were initially not pertinent to the submitted manuscript (and hence not discussed), we have observed that, when chilled at elevated concentrations, <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI oligomerizes into visible microcrystals that can be sedimented after a brief centrifugation step. Were the phage inhibitor to disrupt DnaI-DnaI contacts, we reasoned that it should keep the loader in solution. As is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> of the revised manuscript, this is exactly what happens. In addition, we also looked at the behavior of <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI by dynamic light scattering. As can be seen and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, the loader forms a very broad, polydisperse mixture of species with a large average molecular weight. By contrast, when measured in the presence of the inhibitor protein, a much smaller, less polydisperse species is formed (N.B. – the average molecular weight calculated for the dominant species in the DnaI-ORF104 mixture is larger than expected for a 1:1 complex, suggesting that inhibitor/loader complex formation is incomplete under the conditions tested here and/or that the N-terminal domain of DnaI might self-associate through unsatisfied, exposed surfaces that would normally be used for binding to the helicase). Collectively, these findings corroborate our other structural and biochemical data indicating that the phage inhibitor sterically blocks loader-loader interactions, and have been added to the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the question as to the behavior of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> helicase/loader proteins and the phage inhibitor/loader homolog proteins by gel filtration, we have conducted such studies as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data indicate: 1) that the helicase <italic>Sa</italic>DnaC does not form a stable homo-hexameric ring but instead migrates as an apparent dimeric species (according to sizing standards run on the same column (not shown)),that the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaC helicase associates with both the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI helicase loader and 2)the phage helicase loader homolog 77ORF013 (albeit with a degree of instability, as the bands for the helicase and DnaI/77ORF013 proteins do not perfectly overlap), and 3) that the phage 77 ORF104 inhibitor protein does not affect the migration of the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI helicase loader, the phage 77ORF013 protein, or the <italic>Sa</italic>DnaC helicase.</p><p>Although at first glance the first two results may seem unsatisfying, they actually weigh in on a paradox in the field. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, helicase loading has been reported to occur not by a ring opening mechanism (as is thought to happen in <italic>E. coli)</italic> (3, 4), but rather by a DnaI-directed assembly process that additionally requires two co-chaperones not found in Gram-negative organisms, DnaB (which is unrelated to the <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaB helicase) and DnaD (5–7). Stable hexamers have been observed for Gram-positive DnaC helicases, but only in studies that analyze thermophilic proteins whose room-temperature behavior may differ from their mesophilic counterparts (e.g. <italic>B. stearothermophilus</italic> and <italic>G. kaustophilus</italic> (8–12)). It should be noted that dimers of DnaB-family helicases have been observed previously, wherein the dimer is stabilized by interactions between the N-terminal “collar” domains of the protein (13, 14).</p><p>Our findings, which show that <italic>S. aureus</italic> helicase/loader interactions form but are somewhat unstable, and that the DnaC helicase does not readily assemble a pre-formed hexamer, are in accord with observations reported for the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> system. We have added comments concerning how these data fit in with <italic>B. subtilis</italic> work to the Supplemental Information section of the revised paper. In the long term, we would like to attempt to reconstitute helicase loading in vitro for the <italic>S. aureus</italic> system, however, this will require also purifying <italic>S. aureus</italic> DnaA, DnaB and DnaD, and is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>This is a concise and thoughtfully written manuscript that provides important structural and mechanistic insights into the involvement of the DnaI helicase loader in loading of the hexameric replicative helicase in S. aureus. Most significantly, the authors solve a high resolution structure of the AAA+ ATPase domain of S. aureus DnaI (the first structures of this protein) in complex with an inhibitory phage encoded peptide 77ORF104 and the ATP analog, ADP•BeF<sub>3</sub>, along with an apo structure of the same DnaI domain by itself. Interpretation of the structural data is supported by biochemical data using mutant proteins and domain constructs. The structures are well-determined at high resolution.</italic></p><p><italic>Interaction of DnaI with 77ORF104 is first confirmed, and its binding site on DnaI is shown to be the C-terminal AAA+ domain using pull-down and fluorescence polarization assays. These studies identified domain constructs suitable for crystallization. Comparison of the structure of the heterodimeric complex with the apo-DnaI structure and helicase loaders from other organisms revealed three features important for inhibition or potential regulation of helicase loading:</italic></p><p><italic>i) The binding site for 77ORF104 occludes the oligomerization interface for helical self-association of the AAA+ domains of DnaI thought to be required for helicase opening, based on the authors' previous structure of the DnaC helicase loader from Aquifex aoelicus. The assumption here is that helicase loading in Gram positive and negative organisms is similar, which is an unresolved question in the field (referring to earlier debates about ring-making vs. ring-breaking mechanisms, and the low-resolution Steitz X-ray structure of a Firmicute loader-helicase-primase complex).</italic></p><p>Reviewer 1 brings up an excellent point here about the assumption “that helicase loading in Gram positive and negative organisms is similar”. Some aspects of this discussion are highlighted above in the response to the general comments. Based on our data and that in the literature, we feel it likely that some Gram-positive bacterial species, such as B. subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, may use a ring assembly mechanism (rather than a ring-opening mechanism) that nonetheless also relies on AAA+ domain-dependent loader oligomerization (perhaps to help template the formation of helicase ring/spiral around DNA). We hope to study this question further in the future.</p><p><italic>ii) Comparison of the two new structures suggests the interactions of 77ORF104 leads to structural change in one helix in the ISM of DnaI (to a bent conformation); the ISM is a motif that drives helical assembly vs. ring assembly of the AAA+ domain of DnaA and DnaC. No argument is made that this rearrangement is not due to crystal contacts, and how it might affect helical assembly of DnaI (if it is required at all) is not explicitly discussed.</italic></p><p>Inspection of the crystal contacts in our structure indicates that the change in conformation of the ISM is not the result of lattice interactions. The conformational change also is incompatible with supporting productive DnaI-DnaI interactions capable for forming a proper bipartite active site. We have noted these points to the revised text.</p><p><italic>iii) A major site of interaction is in the C-terminus of 77ORF104, that forms a β strand that extends the sheet in DnaI (supported by deletion of this region abrogating the interaction). In the G. kaustophilus DnaI structure, this strand would occupy the same place as a strand from the interdomain linker (IDL) of DnaI. This suggests a regulatory role for the IDL in DnaI. What is not clear is why this interaction in the CTD of S. aureus DnaI (that contains the IDL as well as the AAA+ domain) apparently does not interfere with binding of 77ORF104.</italic></p><p>We believe there are two likely possibilities that can account for this result. One is that the conformational state of macromolecules is typically in an equilibrium. This equilibrium maybe biased to strongly favor the formation of one state, but nonetheless, other states can also be sampled. Hence, it is possible that 77ORF104 may simply take advantage of an inherent “breathing” event in <italic>Sa</italic>DnaI and bind at a point when the C-terminal AAA+ domain and the interdomain linker transiently separate. Alternatively, (or in addition), it is possible that the interdomain linker of DnaI uncouples from its resting place on the AAA+ domain when the loader’s N-terminal domain binds to the DnaC helicase, exposing the site for ORF104 binding. In the future, we would like to address this question using a combination of SAXS and fluorescence-based (FRET) measurements with appropriately labeled proteins.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>While the structural work strongly supports the inhibitor-mediated ISM deformation and the inhibitor mediated attenuation of ATPase activity support the hypothesis of impaired oligomer formation, this referee would have liked to see some direct proof that the inhibitor does alter the ability of DnaI to form higher order complexes. As a bare minimum, some simple gel filtration experiments could be performed to test this.</italic></p><p>We agree that this is an important point. Please see above our new data and the response to the general comments section.</p><p> <italic>It is intriguing that inhibitor binding does not affect the ability of the loader to interact with the helicase. The manuscript would be strengthened by inclusion of experiments that directly test the helicase loading activity of DnaI. Is the helicase brought to DNA but not released?</italic></p><p>We agree that this is an important point. Please see above our new data and the response to the general comments section.</p><p><italic>Finally, the authors identify a potential helicase-loader ortholog encoded by the phage and show that this protein can interact with the host helicase. These preliminary data are enticing. However, no further experiments are shown to test further the activity of this candidate loader. Does it have ATPase activity, is it modulated by ssDNA, can the protein load the helicase? Is the gene essential for the viral life-cycle? The manuscript requires these additional supporting experiments to test the functionality of 77ORF013.</italic></p><p>We agree that these are all excellent experiments; however, it is our feeling that properly carrying out the aggregate of the requested experiments – 1) ORF013 ATPase activity (+/-DNA, +/- the DnaC helicase), 2) ORF013 DNA binding (+/- ATP, +/- the DnaC helicase), 3) origin-dependent helicase loading (which requires identifying the phage origin of replication and identifying/purifying any associated initiator), and 4) essentiality (which requires making the appropriate phage mutants, packaging them in S. aureus with the appropriate helper phage, and looking for infectivity defects) – is beyond the scope of the present study.
