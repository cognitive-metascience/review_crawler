related dioxygenases (PHD 1, 2 and 3) to signal oxygen levels by catalysing oxygen regulated prolyl hydroxylation of the transcription factor HIF. The discovery of the HIF prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD) enzymes as oxygen sensors raises a key question as to the existence and nature of non-HIF substrates, potentially transducing other biological responses to hypoxia. Over 20 such substrates are reported. We therefore sought to characterise their reactivity with recombinant PHD enzymes. Unexpectedly, we did not detect prolyl-hydroxylase activity on any reported non-HIF protein or peptide, using conditions supporting robust HIF-α hydroxylation. We cannot exclude PHD-catalysed prolyl hydroxylation occurring under conditions other than those we have examined. However, our findings using recombinant enzymes provide no support for the wide range of non-HIF PHD substrates that have been reported.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The HIF prolyl hydroxylases PHD1, 2 and 3 (or EGLN2, 1 and 3) are closely related isoforms of enzymes within the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family that signal oxygen levels in human and animals cells. The enzymes catalyse the post-translational hydroxylation of specific prolyl residues in the transcription factor Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF)-α subunits. Prolyl hydroxylation promotes the association of HIF-α with the von-Hippel-Lindau ubiquitin E3 ligase (pVHL) and subsequent degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. PHD-catalysed hydroxylation is highly sensitive to the availability of oxygen and provides an ‘oxygen-sensing’ mechanism that, via HIF, regulates a wide range of cellular and systemic responses to oxygen, including those (e.g. blood haematocrit) that operate precisely around the ‘set-point’ of physiological oxygen availability (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schofield and Ratcliffe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaelin and Ratcliffe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Myllyharju, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Semenza, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The discovery of the PHDs raised the question as to whether there are other dioxygenase-substrate combinations with analogous oxygen sensing roles in human cells, and the assignment of additional (non-HIF) substrates of the PHDs has been a major focus of research in the field.

If this were the case, it would be predicted: (i) that many non-HIF dependent biological systems would be regulated by oxygen, (ii) that PHD substrate competition might modulate the responses to hypoxia mediated by HIF, (iii) that inhibitors of the PHDs, including those in clinical trials (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maxwell and Eckardt, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gupta and Wish, 2017</xref>), would have multiple consequences unrelated to HIF. We therefore sought to test reported non-HIF peptide and polypeptide substrates of PHDs in assays of prolyl hydroxylation.</p><p>Proposed substrates were tested for their ability to support prolyl hydroxylation, using both synthetic peptides representing the proposed hydroxylation site, and using predominantly full-length polypeptides/proteins prepared by coupled in vitro transcription-translation (IVTT). Direct evidence of prolyl hydroxylation catalysed by recombinant PHD enzymes was sought using a range of mass spectrometry (MS) methods. These assays were complemented by assays for hydroxyproline production using a radiochemical method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koivunen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Juva and Prockop, 1966</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, we did not detect enzyme-catalysed prolyl hydroxylation for any of the reported non-HIF substrates under conditions in which robust HIF prolyl hydroxylation was observed. We did observe a large number of peptide and polypeptide oxidations, but found no evidence that these were dependent on the catalytic activity of PHDs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Assays of prolyl hydroxylation using peptide substrates</title><p>Following reports of non-HIF substrates of the HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), we sought to measure the hydroxylation of synthetic peptides representing the reported sites of hydroxylation using in vitro assays of PHD activity. Assays were initially performed in response to particular published reports, and deployed a range of recombinant enzyme preparations, comprising either the full-length polypeptide or the active catalytic domain of the relevant PHD enzyme. These assays did not reveal hydroxylation at detectable levels on a range of reported non-HIF substrates.</p><p>We therefore decided to perform a systematic analysis of PHD-catalysed hydroxylation across all reported non-HIF substrates for which target residue(s) had been defined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In this series of experiments, full-length recombinant proteins representing each of the PHD enzymes were used; PHD1 and PHD2 from an insect cell baculovirus expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirsilä et al., 2005</xref>) and PHD3 from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> or insect cells. The enzymes were reacted with HIF-α peptides and those representing each of the reported sites of hydroxylation. Peptide products were analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and electrospray-ionisation liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (ESI-LC-MS). Based on structural and kinetic data for the PHD-HIF interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hirsilä et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chowdhury et al., 2009</xref>), peptides were typically synthesised as 21–25 mers placing the target prolyl residues centrally within the sequence, except when hydroxylation of a specific isolated peptide had been reported, in which case this exact sequence was used instead, or in addition. In some cases, peptides representing different isoforms of the reported non-HIF substrates were also tested. Peptide sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table1sdata1">Table 1—source data 1</xref>.</p><p>A total of 44 non-HIF peptides representing putative sites of prolyl hydroxylation within 23 reported protein substrates were tested in this way. Reactions were conducted in batches, with each batch containing a parallel reaction with a HIF-1α peptide (human HIF-1α: 556–574) that is known to be hydroxylated by all three PHD enzymes. Reaction products were analysed initially by MALDI-TOF-MS and subsequently by ESI-LC-MS. Each PHD isoform catalysed near complete hydroxylation of the positive control HIF-1α peptide. By contrast, no PHD isoform catalysed detectable hydroxylation of any other peptide. Similar results were obtained by MALDI-TOF-MS and by ESI-LC-MS. The signal-to-noise ratio was generally better with ESI-LC-MS; the results for these assays are exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and presented in full in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. Inspection of the MS spectra revealed apparent oxidation (i.e. a +16 Da mass shift relative to the unmodified substrate) on certain peptides, for example ACTB/310–334 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, in no case was an increase in the apparent oxidation detectable in reactions containing PHD enzymes, when compared with control reactions without enzyme. These enzyme independent oxidations were not analysed further in this series of experiments. Thus, these peptide-based assays did not provide any evidence for PHD-catalysed prolyl hydroxylation, within the limits of detection, across a wide range of reported sites in non-HIF proteins.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46490.005</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Assays of peptide hydroxylation.</title><p>LC-MS spectra of peptides derived from HIF-1α (left) and selected non-HIF peptidyl substrates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for complete dataset) reacted with the indicated PHD isoform, or no PHD enzyme (control).

It therefore remained possible that more extensive sequences are required to support hydroxylation than had been presented by the peptides that we tested.</p><p>To address this, we proceeded to produce the reported PHD substrates as extended FLAG-tagged polypeptides, principally in full-length form using IVTT, and to react the IVTT products with recombinant PHD enzymes.

To ensure comparable enzyme/substrate ratios in the reactions, the soluble products of the IVTTs were quantified and normalised by FLAG-tag immunoblotting prior to reaction with the relevant PHD enzyme. The reacted IVTT products were purified by FLAG affinity chromatography, then subjected to digestion with trypsin or other proteases, as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, and analysed by LC-MSMS. To facilitate accurate quantitation of HIF-1α hydroxylation by MS, two methionine residues were mutated to alanine within the tryptic fragment that contains the target residue Pro564 (since methionine residues are prone to non-enzymatic oxidation); these substitutions being known not to substantially alter rates of HIF-1α hydroxylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tian et al., 2011</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46490.007</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Summary of oxidations observed on protein substrates produced by IVTT and reacted with the indicated PHD enzyme(s).</title><p>Mass spectrometry was performed on IVTT-derived substrates (column 1) reacted in the presence or absence of the indicated PHD isoform (column 2).

substrates were conducted in batches, in parallel with HIF-1α, to ensure activity of the PHDs under the test condition. In these assays, to increase potential hydroxylation of non-HIF substrates, the quantity of PHD enzyme was increased 2-fold or 5-fold relative to that used in the parallel HIF-1α reaction.</p><p>MS analyses were initially performed using an ESI-LC-MS platform (QExactive, Thermo Scientific) in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. Using this approach, we were able to detect substrate peptides containing the target prolyl residue(s) in non-hydroxylated form with high confidence. One drawback of DDA, however, is that only a subset of the most abundant precursor ions are isolated and fragmented by MSMS. The stochastic nature of precursor ion selection raised the possibility that low stoichiometry hydroxylation(s) of lesser abundance might not be selected for fragmentation. To address this limitation, we also measured the abundance of precursor ions in the raw data. Guided by previous work in which hydroxylation had a relatively modest effect on chromatographic behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Singleton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singleton et al., 2011</xref>), we considered precursor ions that eluted up to 5 min in advance of the non-hydroxylated ion under reverse-phase chromatography conditions. This window was subsequently guided by the elution characteristics of peptide standards.</p><p>The results are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>. MSMS assigned potential oxidations (+16 Da shifts) are indicated and displayed alongside manually-curated precursor ion quantitation, in which the oxidation is expressed as a percentage relative to the unmodified peptide. For each batch of analyses, quantification of hydroxylation on the control HIF-1α polypeptide was carried out. Since the lysates used in IVTT reactants contain endogenous PHD activity, significant levels of HIF-1α hydroxylation were observed in IVTTs without addition of recombinant PHDs. However, robust increases in HIF-1α hydroxylation were always observed following addition of a recombinant PHD, and are reported in columns 11–14 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; note that PHD1 and PHD2 catalysed hydroxylations at both P402 and P564, whereas PHD3 had little activity on P402, consistent with known HIF substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hirsilä et al., 2003</xref>). To provide a further positive control we also tested whether prolyl hydroxylation at the reported sites in all three HIF-α isoforms was supported in these assays. Therefore, in a further series of experiments, IVTTs of HIF-1α, HIF-2α and HIF-3α were reacted in parallel with each of the PHDs. These experiments confirmed robust prolyl hydroxylation at P402 and P564 in HIF-1α, P405 and P531 in HIF-2α and P492 in HIF-3α, with both PHD1 and PHD2 and robust hydroxylation of HIF-1α P564, HIF-2α P531 and HIF-3α P492, but not at the other two sites for PHD3, consistent with the known site specificity of PHD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and supplements).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46490.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Activity of PHD enzymes on full-length HIF substrates produced by IVTT.</title><p>HIF substrates (HIF-1α, HIF-2α and HIF-3α) were produced by IVTT and reacted in the absence (Control) or presence of the indicated recombinant PHD enzyme.

Although these oxidations appeared to arise independently of PHD activity, it is possible that co-elution of a prolyl hydroxylated species with a non-enzymatically oxidised ion could confound the quantification of PHD-dependent hydroxylation, that is a high level of non-enzymatic oxidation could obscure a low level of PHD-dependent prolyl hydroxylation. We therefore synthesised each peptide of interest (i.e., the trypsin, or other protease, generated fragment spanning the reported target prolyl residue) in unhydroxylated (prolyl) and <italic>trans</italic> C-4 hydroxylated (4(<italic>R</italic>)-hydroxyprolyl) forms. These peptide standards (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table2sdata1">Table 2—source data 1.</xref>) were first used to determine whether prolyl hydroxylation resulted in major changes in ionisation efficiency for any of the species. To account for any differences in solubility or purity, weighed aliquots of peptides were first quantified by comparison with an internal trimethylsilylpropanoic acid (TSP) standard using <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy. Equimolar quantities of prolyl- and hydroxyprolyl-peptides, as defined by NMR, were then analysed by MS on the same instrumentation, using identical acquisition conditions to those used for the IVTT hydroxylation assays. Accordingly, peptide intensities were quantified by peak area integration of extracted ion chromatograms and expressed as relative ratios. Related peptide sets displayed broadly comparable ion counts, as summarised in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table2sdata1">Table 2—source data 1</xref>. Although deviation from a 1:1 ratio was observed for certain pairs, this data does not support the possibility that failure to detect hydroxyprolyl peptides derived from IVTT products might be due to suppression of peptide ionisation.</p><p>The use of peptide standards also provided precise data on the effect of prolyl hydroxylation on chromatographic elution. A reproducible shift in chromatographic retention between related pairs of prolyl and hydroxyprolyl peptides was observed. This shift was variable across peptide pairs, ranging from −0.14 to −4.72 min for a given hydroxyprolyl modification resolved on a 60 min linear gradient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table2sdata1">Table 2—source data 1.</xref>). This indicated that manual searches for oxidised peptides within a retention time window of −5 min to 0 min of the unoxidised peptide had covered all potential prolyl hydroxylated ions. Re-examination of the data, together with the performance of additional IVTT reactions and LC-MS runs in which peptide standards were run immediately after the IVTT samples, indicated that in the large majority (all except two), any oxidised ions were chromatographically distinct from the putative prolyl hydroxylated species (see panel A of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s33">33</xref>). This procedure provides security that prolyl hydroxylated species are unlikely to have been obscured.</p><p>To further address the assignment of potentially oxidised species on the two peptides, where we considered that there was a possibility that co-elution might impair detection of low levels of prolyl hydroxylation, we performed additional reactions and analysed the products by parallel reaction monitoring using an ESI-LC-MS spectrometer (Fusion Lumos, Thermo Scientific) in order to measure diagnostic fragment ions that are specific to the hydroxylation site on the precursor peptide. This procedure enabled the dependence of any potentially oxidised species on reaction with PHD to be defined by reference to specific fragment ions, in addition to extracted ion chromatograms. These analyses are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Despite robust detection of diagnostic fragment ions derived from hydroxyprolyl peptide standards, no such ions were observed in the IVTT material either before or after reaction with the relevant PHD enzyme. Thus MS-based analyses of reported non-HIF PHD substrates did not support the catalysis of detectable levels of hydroxylation, at least under these conditions.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46490.049</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) of oxidised EEF2K(94-111) and NDRG3(287–301) peptide species by mass spectrometry.</title><p>Fragment ions (n = 5), including ions of discriminatory mass for proline and methionine oxidation (see inset for schematic representation of fragment ions; dashed lines: unoxidised, solid lines: oxidised) were selected for PRM acquisition, based on existing MSMS data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>: A167-169 and A207-209).

The presence of hydroxyproline was usually assigned either by MSMS or by use of anti-hydroxyprolyl antibodies, though in some cases the modification was not demonstrated directly. In some cases, in vitro reactions using isolated PHDs were performed to support the proposed assignment of PHD-catalysed prolyl hydroxylation. These approaches present challenges <italic>en route</italic> to the confident assignment of post-translational modifications; in particular, in the specificity of immunodetection using antibodies, in the accurate assignment of peptide oxidations, and in distinguishing between enzymatic and artefactual oxidation. Nevertheless, we were surprised by the discrepancy between the reported assignments of prolyl hydroxylation and the results of our study.</p><p>Using several different MS methods, including detailed manual analysis of the data guided by unmodified and hydroxyprolyl-modified peptide standards, we were unable to detect catalytic activity of the PHDs on any of the reported non-HIF substrates. We were also unable to detect such activity using radiochemical assays monitoring conversion of proline to hydroxyproline in the full-length target proteins.</p><p>In the course of the work we considered several reasons for this discrepancy. Firstly, it could be that, despite evidence that HIF-α peptides initially bind to PHD2 in a substantially unstructured conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chowdhury et al., 2009</xref>), longer polypeptides might be necessary for this interaction with non-HIF substrates, as is the case for some other 2OG dependent protein hydroxylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore performed extensive additional experiments using full-length polypeptide substrates. Secondly, it could be that despite high activity of the isolated catalytic domains of the PHDs on HIF-α, full-length enzymes may be necessary for activity on non-HIF substrates. We therefore performed assays using preparations of the full-length enzyme. Thirdly, we were concerned that our MS analyses might have overlooked hydroxylated species. To minimise this possibility, we used peptide standards to test whether <italic>trans</italic> C-4 prolyl-hydroxylation affected ionisation efficiency and to enable distinction from confounding oxidised species. We also carried out radiochemical assays for hydroxylation monitoring conversion of [<sup>3</sup>H]-proline to 4-hydroxy-[<sup>3</sup>H]-proline. As with the peptide work, these experiments included attempts to enhance the hydroxylation of non-HIF substrates using several times the quantity of PHD enzyme that was necessary to drive the hydroxylation of HIF substrates to near completion. None of these series of experiments revealed any evidence for catalytic hydroxylation activity on any of the reported non-HIF substrates.</p><p>The reasons for the discrepancy between our results and the published reports of non-HIF PHD substrates that prompted this survey are unclear. It is possible that the <italic>bona fide</italic> hydroxylation rates with isolated enzymes/substrates are much less than those for HIF-α peptides and were below the detection limits of our assays. It is also possible that PHD-catalysed hydroxylation might take place in cells but not in our assays. For instance, some or all reported non-HIF substrates might require one or more adaptor molecules, which are unnecessary for HIF substrates, to promote hydroxylation.</p><p>Several large ‘in depth’ MS based analyses of cellular proteomes are reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bekker-Jensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geiger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis et al., 2017</xref>). Although cells and culture conditions used in these experiments were not necessarily identical to those in the published reports of PHD-catalysed prolyl hydroxylation, this <italic>in cellulo</italic> data can be interrogated for evidence of prolyl hydroxylation on the proposed non-HIF substrates. We therefore analysed the deposited data using the same processing pipeline as that used in our analyses of the PHD-reacted polypeptides produced by IVTT. The results are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>. Among 12.8 million assigned spectra, we observed a total of 18,192 that corresponded to the trypsinolysis-derived peptides containing the proposed site(s) of prolyl hydroxylation in 17 of the non-HIF PHD substrates; in the remaining six substrates the target peptide was not identified. A total of 5038 putative singly oxidised peptides were assigned among 13 of these 17 identified sequences. Only 67 of these spectra were assigned as potential prolyl hydroxylations. However, inspection of the data revealed that all the computationally assigned putative prolyl oxidations were either at low fragment ion intensity and/or of low confidence with respect to the localisation of the oxidised residue. Most of these computer assignments of prolyl hydroxylation were on β-actin (ACTB) proline 322. These observations led us to consider the possibility that there are specific peptides that are prone to non-enzymatic oxidation and for which, because of the sequence context, PTM localisation is difficult. To this end, we applied a similar processing pipeline to spectra generated by the analyses of the synthetic unmodified (i.e. unhydroxylated) peptides used as standards for our earlier analyses of IVTT produced polypeptides. These analyses revealed a high prevalence of oxidation, some of which was computer assigned as hydroxyproline, on several of the peptides, including ACTB residues 316–326, AKT1 residues 308–328, and MAPK6 residues 20–45 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table3sdata1">Table 3—source data 1.</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46490.052</object-id><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Analysis of the cellular proteome for oxidised peptides encompassing reported sites of prolyl hydroxylation.</title><p>The number of unmodified and singly oxidised peptides containing reported sites of PHD-catalysed hydroxylation were counted over a range of stringency filters.

peptide.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Putative oxidations were also observed on residues close to the target prolyl residue in the in vitro assays and in some cases, low abundance oxidations were observed that could not be assigned robustly from simple analysis of the fragmentation pattern. The use of peptide standards provided a means to assign these species, or at least distinguish them from hydroxyprolyl containing species and accurately assess the dependence of the modification on PHD enzyme activity. Although shifts in chromatographic retention were reproducible for a given pair of prolyl- and hydroxyprolyl- bearing peptides, there were large differences in this shift across different peptide pairs. This means that chromatographic differences between prolyl-hydroxylated and other oxidised species cannot be predicted, increasing the risks of confusion if standards are not used.</p><p>Difficulties in confirming reported substrate repertoires have been highlighted for other enzymes, leading to guidelines on the need for more complete biochemical analysis of the enzyme dependence of the proposed protein modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kudithipudi and Jeltsch, 2016</xref>). Given the potential for artefactual oxidations to confound MS analyses of prolyl hydroxylation, that was apparent in this and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arsenault et al., 2015</xref>), care is also required in assigning new substrates to the PHD enzymes. This includes the need for accurate location of the proposed prolyl oxidation event, and a clear demonstration of its dependence on PHD-catalysis under conditions proposed to support hydroxylation. Our analyses clearly cannot disprove the presence of prolyl hydroxylation on reported non-HIF substrates under conditions other than those we have examined; they also do not exclude the possibility that the PHD enzymes have non-HIF substrates which have not yet been identified. However, they do suggest that the PHDs are relatively specific for their HIF-α substrates. This contrasts with the HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase, FIH (factor inhibiting HIF), which has been shown to catalyse hydroxylations at asparaginyl (and other) residues on a wide range of ankyrin repeat domain containing proteins, in addition to HIF-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chowdhury et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elkins et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with this, FIH-catalysed asparaginyl hydroxylation of both HIF-α and non-HIF substrates was readily observed using the assays described in our current work (data not shown). These differences raise a question as to the underlying reasons for the apparent difference in selectivity between the two classes of HIF hydroxylase. X-ray and NMR structural analyses of HIF-α peptide in complex with the PHD catalytic domain reveal that the bound peptide makes multiple contacts with the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chowdhury et al., 2009</xref>).There are also substantial conformational changes in the PHD structures on binding HIF-α substrates, including a loop which moves to tightly enclose the catalytic site and C-terminal region of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chowdhury et al., 2016</xref>). These observations contrast with FIH, which crystallographic studies imply has a much more accessible catalytic site and does not itself demonstrate a major conformational change upon substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elkins et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>These characteristics of PHDs likely contribute to their specificity for HIF-α substrates, but make it difficult predict other substrates from the primary sequence. Therefore, in an effort to better understand PHD substrate specificity, we compared both predicted and defined secondary structures across a range of HIF-α prolyl hydroxylation sites from different metazoan species and the reported non-HIF human substrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table1sdata2">Table 1—source data 2.</xref>). This revealed that despite considerable variation in primary sequence, most (possibly all) HIF-α peptides are predicted to form an α-helix to the N-terminal side of the target prolyl residue, as was observed in PHD2-HIF-α complex structures. In contrast, this feature was seen in few of the reported non-HIF substrates, where no clear pattern was evident. Although such an α-helix may therefore contribute to selectivity for HIF-α and/or guide future attempts to identify non-HIF substrates of the PHDs, a caveat is that the PHDs might have the capacity to generate major conformational changes in folded substrates, such as have been described for the PHD homologue in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> complexed with its EF-Tu (Elongation Factor Thermal unstable) substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scotti et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

The relationship between each HIF1A hydroxylation dataset and corresponding alternative substrate assay is indicated above each figure. Full-length HIF-1α protein produced by IVTT was incubated in the absence (Control) or presence of the indicated (PHD) enzyme and digested with trypsin. Endogenous PHD activity in HeLa cell lysate gave rise to a basal (control) level of hydroxylation that markedly increased upon addition of recombinant PHD. To facilitate quantitation of P564ox we used a variant of HIF1A in which adjacent methionine residues that are prone to de novo oxidation were substituted to alanine (HIF1A*: M561A, M568A). This modified form of HIF1A is more amenable to LC-MS based quantitation (peak intensities are not reduced as a consequence of methionine oxidation) and has no appreciable effect on the rate of PHD-dependent catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tian et al., 2011</xref>). Detection of P564 peptide ions was robust across replicate assays and relative quantitation data are presented for all HIF-1α hydroxylation assays. Detection of P402 peptide ions was more variable, requiring an additional (i.e., non-specific) cleavage by trypsin in order to monitor hydroxylation at this site. Relative quantitation of P564ox is presented in panel A, as XIC of m/z 1590.7540 and 1598.7515 corresponding to unoxidised (pink) and P564ox (blue) forms of HIF1A*(548-575). Where present, semi-tryptic peptides encompassing P402 were detected as either HIF1A*(392-403) or HIF1A*(392-411). Panel B shows XIC for precursor ion masses corresponding to unoxidised (pink; (i) m/z 619.8532, (ii) m/z 1005.0619) and P402ox (blue; (i) 627.8506, (ii) 1013.0592) forms of related (i) HIF1A*(392-403) or (ii) HIF1A*(392-411) peptides. Quantitative data for observed species are presented as pie charts with XIC data. Assignment and quantitation data are tabulated below each panel, table headers are as follows: (−10lgP) significance score of leading assignment at given (RT) with ambiguity score (AScore) for PTM localisation and reference to primary MSMS data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor.

More than 20 putative substrates have been published previously; however, the authors failed to detect enzymatic activity on any of these peptides or proteins under conditions readily detecting HIFα hydroxylation.

Moreover, the Discussion section would benefit from added text describing your hypotheses as to why the PHDs are so selective for HIFα subunits, given the noted flexibility of amino acids around their highly conserved prolyl hydroxylation sites.

The background for this important study is that the discovery of the HIF-PHDs as 'oxygen sensors' raised the critical question as to whether there are other prolyl hydroxylation substrates for the three HIF-PHDs (PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3) beyond HIF-α subunits (i.e. α1, α2, and α3). This was an appealing hypothesis, suggesting that non-HIF dependent pathways would similarly be regulated by oxygen availability based on the PHDs as central O<sub>2</sub> sensors. There are also important clinical implications at play here, in that highly specific PHD enzymatic activity inhibitors are making their way through multiple clinical trials: on target specificity of such drugs for non-HIF substrates could result in significant dose limiting toxicities for patient care. To date, &gt;20 non-HIF PHD substrates have been published. In order to more carefully examine each of these proteins as bone fide enzymatic targets of PHD1-3, the authors carried out exhaustive efforts to measure the prolyl hydroxylation of synthetic peptides (and even full-length purified proteins) representing the reported sites of hydroxylation.</p><p>Table 1 summarizes (a) 24 putative non-HIF targets, (b) proposed proline residues in these targets reported to be hydroxylated, (c) which PHD isoform is responsible, and (d) primary references in the literature. To their enormous credit, the authors considered every conceivable technical explanation for why they failed to detect target hydroxylation in their assays (while HIF-1α always served as an internal positive control): (1) length of peptide substrate being inadequate, (2) altered ionization/detection efficiencies in their experiments, (3) co-elution of prolyl hydroxylated species with non-enzymatically oxidized ions, and (4) prolyl hydroxylation that occurs below the limits of detection by their MS approaches (these were explored by independent radiochemical procedures), to name but a few. They also evaluated previously published MS based cellular proteomes for evidence of prolyl hydroxylation of the proposed non-HIF substrates, as an independent unbiased approach. Collectively, they observed no experimental support for the three PHDs having multiple non-HIF substrates, or at least those reported cannot be unequivocally shown to be bona fide PHD substrates.</p><p>The authors took great pains to report their findings objectively and comprehensively. As such, this study is a 'landmark' in the O<sub>2</sub> sensing field and highly worthy of publication expediently as possible, I have no real substantive revisions to suggest, other than expanding the legend for Table 2 to make it easier for the reader to digest without more extensive evaluation of the detailed methods provided in the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The discovery of PHD catalyzed hydroxylation of HIF as the key event in the transcriptional response to hypoxia raises the question of whether there are non-HIF substrates that could conceivably enlarge the scope of PHD-regulated hypoxic responses. Over that past decade, over 20 such substrates have been reported. These include protein kinases, transcription factors, metabolic enzymes, and cytoskeletal proteins, among others. The means by which prolyl hydroxylation has been identified in these publications has varied and has included mass spectrometry and anti-hydroxyproline antibodies. In order to independently assess hydroxylation of these reported substrates, the authors have performed an extensive analysis using recombinant PHD1-3, HIF-1α or HIF-2α as a positive control, and three in vitro assays: (1) Incubation of the PHDs with full length substrates from Hela cell extract using vitro transcription/translation (IVTT) reactions followed by immunopurification and mass spec; (2) incubation of the PHDs with substrate derived peptides followed by mass spec; (3) incubation of the PHDs with IVTT proteins in the presence of 3H-proline, followed by assessment of hydroxylation of 3H-proline. The surprising result is that under conditions in which HIF hydroxylation is readily detected, they did not find evidence of hydroxylation of any of the non-HIF substrates reported in the literature.</p><p>The experiments are well performed, systematic, and meticulously reported. The data are convincing. The use of independent assays and the inclusion of HIF positive controls in these assays lends substantial weight to the results. The author appropriately discuss limitations of their study, which include the possibility that hydroxylation might occur in a cellular environment but not in vitro. Their findings are at odds with a large number of publications that report non-HIF substrates, and as such, would represent a very important contribution to the literature. Undoubtedly, this will provoke further discussion and investigation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This article describes a very thorough investigation of the hydroxylation of essentially all of the reported non-HIF substrates of the PHD enzymes. The use of both peptides and full length proteins, exhaustive analysis by mass spectrometry, including determining of differences in ionisation efficiency between hydroxylated and non-hydroxylated peptides, and the complementary methodology of radiolabeled enzyme assays is a major strength of this study. The results are generally very well presented and described, although complex and not necessarily appreciated by a more general audience outside this specific field. The major conclusions drawn from the in vitro data are very well supported.</p><p>The results are unexpected, given the numerous publications presenting both cell-based and in vitro evidence by mass spectrometry for hydroxylation of these substrates. These findings make a very important contribution to this field, and raise doubt as to whether any of these are actually substrates in vivo, and if they are why they do not appear to be substrates in vitro. This, of course, has important implications for the therapeutic use of PHD-specific inhibitors.</p><p>However, with only the in vitro experiments included in this study, the key question of whether any of these are substrates in vivo is not addressed, at least experimentally. The authors do propose a number of potential reasons for this lack of hydroxylation in vitro compared to reports in cells, which are logical, from none of these being substrates of the PHDs (artefacts), through to the lack of necessary cellular components in the in vitro assay, or assay-specific differences.</p><p>What is lacking from this study is some attempt to rationalise this key issue, by attempting to replicate some of the published cell-based experiments using the more the intensive interrogation by mass spectrometry used in this study. This analysis could have been performed, for example, by hydroxylating substrates in vitro using whole cell extracts, with PHDs either inhibited, knocked down or knocked out, as used in other studies, to determine whether additional factors are required. Or by extracting and analysing endogenous proteins to determine whether it is more likely an issue with interpretation of the mass spectrometry such as misinterpretation of oxidation. Ultimately, we are left with a set of very provocative results, but uncertain whether this is an artefact of the in vitro system or of real physiological significance.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46490.072</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>During the review process, online discussions by the three reviewers have led to a recommendation that the paper include some discussion (in that section of the paper) on the likelihood that the other principle HIFα subunit dioxygenase hydroxylating a C-terminal asparagine residue (FIH) would also have non-HIF substrates, based on your own analyses and assessment of the literature at this time.

This question is indeed of interest, because, as the editor points out, many amino acid substitutions can be tolerated in HIF-α peptides without the total loss of activity that was observed with the non-HIF substrates tested in these experiments.</p><p>We are not yet sure of the precise reasons, which are the subject of on-going work. However, X-ray and NMR structural analyses of HIF-α peptides in complex with both human PHD2 protein and that of the simplest animal <italic>Trichoplax adhaerens</italic> reveal that the bound peptide makes multiple contacts with PHD2. There are also substantial conformational changes in the PHD structures on binding HIF-α substrates, including those involving at least one loop, which on substrate binding moves to enclose the catalytic site and the C-terminal region of the enzyme(1-3). Thus (so far), the complex nature of the protein-protein interactions between the PHDs and their HIF substrates means it is difficult to predict PHD substrates from primary sequences (as is the case for other 2-oxoglutarate dependent oxygenases (4).</p><p>In revision, we have added a brief discussion of this. We have also (as suggested by reviewer 2) added a supplementary table comparing both predicted and defined secondary structure in HIF-α peptides and the reported non-HIF substrates. This reveals that, despite substantial primary sequence variation, many (possibly all) HIF-α peptides are predicted to form a helix immediately adjacent to the target prolyl residue. This prediction is supported by crystal structures of PHD2 in complex with CODD and NODD. However, a <italic>caveat</italic> is that binding to the enzyme may impose other structural changes and constraints, which cannot be predicted from this type of bioinformatic analysis.</p><p>The reviewing editor also asks that we discuss the likelihood that the HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase, FIH has other substrates. We (and others) have reported that FIH hydroxylates asparaginyl (and other) residues in a wide range of ankyrin-repeat domain (ARD)-containing proteins, in addition to HIF-α. As an additional control for this study we tested these substrates in the IVTT assays with FIH and confirmed that both ARD-containing proteins and HIF-α are efficiently hydroxylated by FIH. Multiple X-ray structures of peptide substrates complexed to FIH imply a much more open binding site than PHD2/HIF-α, with less induced fit (at least from the enzyme perspective), with FIH substrate peptides binding in a largely extended configuration(5, 6). These results, together with the observation that suitably sited residues in the ankyrin fold other than asparagine may be hydroxylated(7), suggests that the substrate specificity of FIH may be much broader than the PHDs. However, FIH must unfold its ankyrin repeat substrates from their canonical structure and the extent to which this process constrains the FIH substrate repertoire is not understood. Nevertheless, we agree the subject is of interest and have added text covering this to the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>The authors took great pains to report their findings objectively and comprehensively.

We agree this is an interesting point; our response is as set out above.</p><p>Point 2: We were uncertain what was intended in this comment, as the effect of prolyl hydroxylation on the chromatographic behaviour of the peptide standards is summarised at the point of reference to the tabulated data (Table 2). This can be found towards the end of the Results section. It could that the reviewer was suggesting that we give this data earlier but overall we think that the flow of the manuscript is best with the text as written, which is in line with the order in which the work was performed.</p><p>Point 3: We have added further detail on the radiochemical assay. We have also revised Figure 5 in a way which we think more accurately portrays the data, in particular we have extended the scale below zero to indicate that values for the non-HIF substrates include negative values. These values cluster around zero, rather than the small positive value that might have been suggested by the way the figure was originally drawn. The IVTT reaction containing the translated [<sup>3</sup>H]-proline labeled substrate was divided into two aliquots and subjected to hydroxylation with and without the recombinant PHD. The data is now given as DPM [<sup>3</sup>H]-hydroxyproline formed during the reaction per 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> DPM total [<sup>3</sup>H]-proline. This is calculated by subtracting such DPM values for the control reaction carried out without the recombinant PHD from the test reaction. Wild-type and the P402A/P564G double mutant HIF-1α are included as positive and negative control substrates in each hydroxylation assay, to verify efficient hydroxylation of a known substrate and to display the background DPM range due to technical limitations of the assay, respectively. As requested, details are provided in the revised Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experiments are well performed, systematic, and meticulously reported.

First, based on existing evidence, are the proposed non-HIF substrates unstructured in the regions containing the proposed site of hydroxylation? Second, what is the extent of conservation across metazoans in the regions of HIF-α polypeptides that are targeted for prolyl hydroxylation.</p><p>These questions impinge on the editor’s suggestion that we discuss hypotheses as to the determinants of PHD selectivity towards HIF substrates. As outlined above our response to the editor, we have added a supplementary table comparing both predicted and defined secondary structure in HIF-α regions that are targeted for prolyl hydroxylation in different metazoan species, together with similar analyses on reported non-HIF substrates. This reveals that, despite substantial primary sequence variation, HIF-α peptides are predicted to form an α-helix close to the target prolyl residue. In contrast, we observed no common secondary structure (either observed or predicted) in the region of the proposed sites of prolyl hydroxylation in reported non-HIF substrates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This article describes a very thorough investigation of the hydroxylation of essentially all of the reported non-HIF substrates of the PHD enzymes.

In particular, it is suggested that we might attempt to hydroxylate substrates in vitro using whole cell extracts, or that we extract and analyse endogenous proteins.</p><p>First, we should point out that our IVTT experiments used substrates that were produced in Hela cell extracts. In all reactions conducted with HIF-α polypeptides as positive controls, we observed an increase in hydroxylation of the anticipated prolyl residues upon addition of the relevant recombinant PHD. However, we also observed clear evidence of prolyl hydroxylation at the HIF target sites in IVTT samples prior to these reactions. Thus, if endogenous PHD activity in whole cell extracts were sufficient to hydroxylate the reported non-HIF substrates then this should have been evident in the analyses that we report. We cannot exclude that some cell type difference (e.g. in PHD isoform expression) that was not captured in our experiments might nevertheless be capable of supporting hydroxylation, which is why we are careful to point out that we cannot exclude hydroxylation occurring under conditions other than those of our experiments.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that in theory it would be possible to extract and analyse endogenous proteins, at least those for which efficient immuno-precipitating antibodies exist. However, together with the necessary analytical controls, and interventions on enzyme activity, this would entail a very extensive further set of technically challenging experiments (especially at natural abundance levels), well beyond work which would be consistent with timely revision. We also think that it is important to publish at this stage in an unprejudiced manner, so that others are aware of the results in planning their research and have the opportunity to contribute further.</p><p>References</p><p>1) Chowdhury R, McDonough MA, Mecinovic J, Loenarz C, Flashman E, Hewitson KS, et al.
