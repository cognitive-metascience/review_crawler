(SGNs) transmit sound information to the brainstem. Recent single cell RNA-Seq studies have revealed heterogeneities within SGNs. Nonetheless, much remains unknown about the transcriptome of SGNs, especially which genes are specifically expressed in SGNs. To address these questions, we needed a deeper and broader gene coverage than that in previous studies. We performed bulk RNA-Seq on mouse SGNs at five ages, and on two reference cell types (hair cells and glia). Their transcriptome comparison identified genes previously unknown to be specifically expressed in SGNs. To validate our dataset and provide useful genetic tools for this research field, we generated two knockin mouse strains: <italic>Scrt2-P2A-tdTomato</italic> and <italic>Celf4-3xHA-P2A-iCreER-T2A-EGFP</italic>. Our comprehensive analysis confirmed the SGN-selective expression of the candidate genes, testifying to the quality of our transcriptome data. These two mouse strains can be used to temporally label SGNs or to sort them.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inner ear</kwd><kwd>spiral ganglion neuron</kwd><kwd>RNA-Seq</kwd><kwd>scrt2</kwd><kwd>celf4</kwd><kwd>cochlea</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFA0103901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDB32060100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81771012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003395</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Municipal Education Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018SHZDZX05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001003</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE811138149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RNA-Seq analysis and in vivo validation via genetic approach uncover that <italic>Scrt2</italic> and <italic>Celf4</italic> are expressed in inner ear auditory neurons throughout development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genome-wide profiling analyses such as RNA-Seq are being increasingly used for dissecting the mechanisms underlying cell-fate determination, development, and disease progression. RNA-Seq can be employed to address several developmental questions, including these two key questions: (1) Which genes are expressed specifically in one cell type but not others within one tissue and/or organ? (2) Which genes exhibit expression patterns that change dynamically at distinct developmental ages within the same cell type? RNA-Seq analyses fall within two main categories: the first is Bulk-Seq, where the data represent an average of gene-expression patterns from multiple cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ozsolak and Milos, 2011</xref>), and although this allows for vast sequencing coverage (or depth), the incurred cost is that variations among the pooled cells are obscured. The second is single-cell RNA-Seq, which enables assessment of gene expression at unprecedented single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tang et al., 2013</xref>), but the coverage and detection sensitivity here are typically lower than those in Bulk-Seq. Because the two approaches complement each other in their strengths, the optimal strategy would be to run both Bulk-Seq and single-cell RNA-Seq, thus obtaining both sequencing depth and single-cell-resolution data. Notably, this combined approach was used in two recent studies examining mouse inner ear auditory and utricle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamashita et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In mouse cochlea, two types of hair cells (HCs) coexist: outer hair cells (OHCs) and inner hair cells (IHCs) and they differ in function and innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kelley, 2006</xref>). Whereas OHCs act as sound amplifiers and are innervated by Type II cochlear spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), IHCs form synapses with Type I SGNs. Type I SGNs can be divided into three subtypes, Ia, Ib, and Ic, as revealed by three recent single-cell RNA-Seq studies of mouse SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Petitpré et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shrestha et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Multiple genes, such as <italic>Calb2</italic>, <italic>Pou4f1</italic>, and <italic>Lypd1</italic>, show markedly different expression patterns across the three subtypes. However, these studies focused on transcriptomic differences among distinct SGN subtypes: no comparisons were performed between the transcriptomes of SGNs and non-SGN cells (i.e. HCs or glia). Thus, the identity of the genes that are specifically expressed in SGNs but not in other cell types within the inner ear remains unclear, as does the temporal dynamics of these genes during SGN differentiation (i.e. it is not known which genes show notable expression differences at distinct developmental stages). However, cell-type specificity and temporal specificity are both critical features that should be presented by genes that regulate SGN fate determination and maturation. Therefore, identification of the genes that possess these properties represents a critical first step that will enable the function of these genes to be studied. In addition to advancing our understanding of SGN development, identifying these key regulators will also likely facilitate studies focusing on regenerating degenerated or damaged SGNs from other cells such as cochlear glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Noda et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we addressed the aforementioned two questions, on cell-type specificity and temporal specificity of SGN genes, by employing bulk RNA-Seq covering mRNAs and other types of RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). We manually picked SGNs at five distinct ages: embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5), postnatal day 1 (P1), P8, P14, and P30. To identify SGN-specific genes, we compared the transcriptomes of SGNs with those of inner ear HCs at P12 and cochlear glial cells at P8, which resulted in the discovery of multiple previously unknown SGN-specific genes. These SGN-specific genes were further divided into genes exhibiting constant or dynamic expression. Moreover, we analyzed the dynamics of genes expressed in SGNs, regardless of whether they are expressed in HCs and glia. To further validate our transcriptome analysis, 8 SGN-specific genes were analyzed using RNA in situ hybridization, and from these genes, <italic>Scrt2</italic> and <italic>Celf4</italic> were selected for generating, respectively, <italic>Scrt2-P2A-tdTomato</italic> and <italic>Celf4-3xHA-P2A-iCreER-T2A-EGFP</italic> knockin mice. Characterization of these two mouse strains showed that <italic>Scrt2</italic> and <italic>Celf4</italic> are expressed in SGNs and exhibit constant expression (from early embryonic to adult ages) and dynamic expression, respectively. Thus, this work provides a comprehensive transcriptome analysis, with high-quality data and deep sequencing coverage, of SGNs at five developmental ages. Furthermore, the two new mouse strains developed here will help future studies aimed at sorting SGNs or temporally manipulating gene expression in SGNs. Lastly, because <italic>Scrt2</italic> and <italic>Celf4</italic> are also expressed in the central nervous system, the two knockin mouse lines should also serve as useful tools for brain research in general.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Isolated and purified SGNs are highly enriched in neuronal genes and depleted in HC and glial genes</title><p>Cochlear SGNs transiently and specifically express <italic>Sonic Hedgehog</italic> (<italic>Shh)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tateya et al., 2013</xref>), and we used this gene to isolate SGNs.

E15.5 was the earliest age at which we could visualize a bright tdTomato signal and pick tdTomato+ SGNs confidently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Three replicates were performed per age, and each replicate contained ~100 SGNs. We hypothesized that these five ages should capture the main signatures of gene expression profiles during the process of SGN differentiation. SGNs are likely highly immature at E15.5 and P1, actively differentiating at P8, well differentiated at P14 as mice start detecting sound, and fully differentiated and functional at P30. Besides picking SGNs, we isolated, as reference cells, HCs (vestibular and cochlear) at P12 and cochlear glial cells at P8. The methods section contains detailed information regarding the HCs and glial cells. Briefly, gene-expression profiles of HCs and glia were used as a reference database for quality-check analyses and for revealing SGN-specific genes (showing constant or dynamic expression) within the inner ear, which was our primary goal in this study.</p><p>Before fragmenting full-length cDNA derived from SGNs at the different ages, qPCR analysis was performed to determine the purity of the collected cells. For a sample to pass this first quality check point (pre-sequencing stage), the sample had to be significantly enriched in the neuronal gene <italic>Mafb</italic> and depleted in both the glial gene <italic>Sox10</italic>, and HC gene Myosin-VI (<italic>Myo6</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avraham et al., 1995</xref>). For example, in SGNs at P8, <italic>Mafb</italic> expression was enriched 890.7 ± 150.2 fold, as compared to glia cells (n = 3 sample replicates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), whereas, <italic>Sox10</italic> expression was reduced by 2016.7 ± 174.1 fold (n = 3 sample replicates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Myosin-VI</italic> expression was 65.7 ± 3.1 fold lower in SGNs than in HCs (n = 3 sample replicates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Similar qPCR quality checks were performed for SGNs at other four ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest that the isolated SGN samples were pure and that the cDNA was of high quality. Only the samples that passed this qPCR quality control were proceeded into library construction and paired-end sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Acquiring high quality transcriptome data</title><p>On average, there were 21.5 million sequence reads per library, of which ~ 85% were mapped to the mm10 genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Per sample, approximately 15,000 genes were detected with a TPM (transcripts per million) threshold of 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and ~6000 of these genes featuring TPM values of &gt;10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis revealed that the general transcriptomes of SGNs were highly distinct from those of HCs and glial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Moreover, SGNs of different ages clustered into distinct groups, which supported the hypothesis that global gene profiles dynamically change throughout SGN differentiation.</p><p>Before searching for genes showing constant or dynamic expression, we performed a second quality check at this post-sequencing stage to further ensure the purity of the SGN samples. We used additional gene markers that together covered 10 different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, we also examined three house-keeping genes, <italic>Gapdh</italic>, <italic>Actg1</italic> and <italic>Actb</italic>, all of which were detected in all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Again, we found that SGNs were significantly enriched with neural genes <italic>Mafb, Slc17a6, Slc17a7</italic> and <italic>Lypd1</italic>, but dramatically depleted of genes of HC-specific (<italic>Myo6, Myo7a, Pou4f3</italic> and <italic>Gfi1</italic>) and glial-specific (<italic>Sox10, Foxd3</italic> and <italic>Plp1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We included both vestibular and cochlear HCs to cover most of the genes expressed in inner ear HCs. Vestibular HCs are known to express <italic>Sox2</italic>, which was accordingly detected here in the HC populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, the quality checks at the pre-sequencing stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and post-sequencing stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) ensured that the SGN samples were highly pure and that the RNA-Seq data were of high quality.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Identifying SGN-specific genes with constant and dynamic expression pattern</title><p>We first aimed to identify genes that are both highly and specifically expressed in SGNs but are not expressed in HCs or glia. For example, <italic>Parvalbumin</italic> and <italic>Calbindin</italic> are expressed in both HCs and SGNs, and are not our target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). We classified the SGN-specific genes into two categories based on their expression during development: constant and dynamic. Computational analysis revealed 21 SGN-specific genes showing constant expression patterns in SGNs at all timepoints examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and 68 SGN-specific genes showing dynamic expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Notably, <italic>Mafb</italic>, which showed dynamic expression and was included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, is known to decrease between E16.5 and P15 in SGNs and to be critical for SGN development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that although our bioinformatics analysis for defining SGN-specific genes was highly stringent, it was still sensitive. Because most of the identified genes were not previously known to be SGN-specific, we validated the following eight genes (four from each category) by using RNA in situ hybridization at P1: <italic>Elavl4</italic>, <italic>Esrrg</italic>, <italic>Scrt1</italic>, <italic>Scrt2</italic>, <italic>Stmn3</italic>, <italic>Shox2</italic>, <italic>Gabbr2</italic>, and <italic>Celf4.</italic> All eight genes were specifically expressed in SGN region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), which again validated the quality of our RNA-Seq data. Note that genes above were SGN-specific within the cochlea organ.

In agreement with this finding, channel related genes and cell adhesion genes were enriched in those 226 genes, as suggested by all three ontology annotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–M</xref>).

We expect these genes to represent promising candidate regulators of SGN cell-fate determination and/or differentiation. Accordingly, <italic>Mafb</italic> appeared in our list of dynamic genes, and this gene is known to be required for SGN to function properly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Because only HCs and glial cells were used as reference cells in this study, we cannot rule out the possibility that other cell types in the cochlea also transiently or permanently express the genes listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. In accord with this view, <italic>Celf4</italic> expression was also sporadically detected in mesenchymal cells in our lineage-tracing assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Comprehensive analysis in the future will be necessary to confirm the in situ expression of each of these genes.</p><p>Another distinguishing feature of our study as compared with other studies is that we did not limit our analysis to coding mRNAs. Whereas single-cell RNA-Seq can only capture mRNAs harboring poly-A tails, our approach uses both oligo-dT and random primers and thus captures both mRNAs and noncoding RNAs. For example, <italic>mir680-2</italic> (microRNA 680–2) was identified as an SGN dynamic gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Our method also allowed for greater depth of coverage than before because we pooled ~100 pure SGNs; this led to the detection of ~15,000 genes (TPM &gt;1), which is considerably deeper than the coverage in previous SGN single-cell RNA-Seq studies:~2000 genes with 10 × Genomics v2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun et al., 2018</xref>) or ~8000 genes with Smart-seq2 approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shrestha et al., 2018</xref>). It is reported that SGNs were easily contaminated by blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). We found that genes of blood cells, such as <italic>Hbb-bs</italic> and <italic>Hbb-bt</italic>, were depleted in our samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), which indicated that the three SGN washing steps in our procedure markedly diminished the RNAs released by blood cells. In summary, to our knowledge, this bulk RNA-Seq database represents the first report of SGN-specific genes showing constant or dynamic expression and it features a large and vast covering depth. A combination of our bulk RNA-Seq and previous single-cell RNA-Seq of SGNs will enable future investigation of SGN gene expression from multiple perspectives. Last, besides the aforementioned RNA-Seq data of SGNs, data are available from one microarray study of SGNs and VGNs covering ages from E12 to P15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, both the microarray data and our bulk RNA-Seq data show that immune-related genes are overrepresented in SGNs, and thus the functions of these genes warrant further investigation. Different from microarray data, our bulk RNA-Seq can reveal SGN-specific genes because we used HCs and glias as reference. In addition, relative to microarray analysis, RNA-Seq dataset can reveal wider range of gene expression level difference.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Applications of <italic>Scrt2-tdTomato/+</italic> knockin mouse model</title><p>We generated the knockin <italic>Scrt2-tdTomato/+</italic> mouse strain not only because we sought to validate our RNA-Seq data, but also to provide a useful genetic tool for future studies on SGN development and regeneration. For example, attempts to regenerate SGNs from neighboring glial cells are of increasing interest and importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Noda et al., 2018</xref>); but conducting functional patch-clamp studies to validate such attempts requires the precise identification of new SGNs without antibody staining. Therefore, use of a fluorescent protein whose expression is driven by an SGN-specific gene promoter/enhancer can facilitate such studies. For this purpose, <italic>Scrt2</italic> is more suitable than <italic>Parvalbumin</italic> and <italic>Calbindin</italic>, which are expressed both in HCs and SGNs. Previous single-cell RNA-Seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shrestha et al., 2018</xref>) and our own <italic>Scrt2</italic> analysis data showed that <italic>Scrt2</italic> is expressed in both Type I and Type II SGNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–A’’</xref>). Thus, regardless of whether new SGNs resemble the Type I or II SGN subtype, the <italic>Scrt2-tdTomato/+</italic> strain can be used as a readout.</p><p>Our <italic>Scrt2-tdTomato/+</italic> strain also offers advantages over <italic>Mapt (Tau)-EGFP/+</italic> mice (Jax#: 029219). First, <italic>Mapt-EGFP/+</italic> are knockout mice and EGFP expression replaces Mapt expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tucker et al., 2001</xref>). However, because we used the 2A-peptide approach to generate <italic>Scrt2-tdTomato/+</italic> mice, Scrt2 expression is intact even in the homozygous background for brighter tdTomato. Second, the EGFP pattern in <italic>Mapt-EGFP/+</italic> mice primarily recapitulates the <italic>Tuj1</italic> (β-tubulin III) pattern. Tuj1 is reported to be only strongly expressed in Type I SGNs at adult ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nishimura et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, if the goal is to label as many SGNs as possible with a bright fluorescent protein, particularly from the SGN regeneration perspective, the <italic>Scrt2-tdTomato/+</italic> strain is comparatively more powerful. Note that tdTomato signal was strong in cell body of SGNs but weak in their fiber terminals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Potential contributions of <italic>Celf4-iCreER/+</italic> knockin mouse strain to future SGN studies</title><p>The Cre/loxP system has been widely used in genetic studies in the inner ear field in the past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cox et al., 2012</xref>). Multiple Cre mouse strains are available, especially in the case of HCs. <italic>Gfi1Cre</italic> (knockout) and <italic>Gfi1-P2A-GFP-CreERT2 (Gfi1-GCE)</italic> knockin mice can be used to perform conditional loss-and-gain of function studies in HCs soon after HCs are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2010</xref>).

These powerful tools together allow temporal genetic manipulations to be performed on HCs or specific HC subtypes.</p><p>Comparatively fewer SGN-specific CreER tools are currently available. Besides <italic>ShhCre/+</italic> (used in this study), <italic>Neurog1-Cre/+</italic> and <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre/+</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Quiñones et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ross et al., 2010</xref>), are highly suitable tools for deleting or activating genes in embryonic SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Appler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). However, these are all straight Cre lines, and gene deletion or activation occurs soon after SGN formation without temporal control with tamoxifen. A <italic>Neurog1-CreERT2</italic> transgenic line (Jax#: 008529) is also available, and this can be used for embryonic tamoxifen-mediated temporal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koundakjian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Raft et al., 2007</xref>). However, in our RNA-Seq analysis, <italic>Neurog1</italic> expression was rarely detected in SGNs at E15.5 and the tested postnatal ages, which suggests that <italic>Neurog1</italic> is turned off after late embryonic ages. Therefore, none of the aforementioned lines can be used to manipulate gene functions starting at postnatal ages and particularly at adult ages.</p><p>Unlike the Cre lines mentioned above, <italic>Celf4-iCreER/+</italic> is not very sensitive to the time of tamoxifen injection, and can efficiently target SGNs when tamoxifen is injected at P1/P2, P8/P9, or P30/P31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We also observed tdTomato+ SGNs when tamoxifen was administered in <italic>Celf4-iCreER/+; Rosa26-CAG-loxp-stop-loxp-tdTomato/+</italic> mice during embryonic stages (E10.5). Thus, <italic>Celf4-iCreER/+</italic> holds the potential to emerge as a highly valuable tool for temporally manipulating SGN gene function at different ages. Besides <italic>Celf4-iCreER/+</italic>, a BAC transgenic <italic>Mafb-CreER+</italic> line is available that can be used for sparse labeling of SGNs with tdTomato at P25–P27, assuming that tamoxifen is injected around P20 or earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Meglio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shrestha et al., 2018</xref>). Mafb expression in Type I SGNs gradually decreased during postnatal ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Mafb</italic> expression in Type I SGNs was substantially lower than in Type II SGNs. Therefore, we expected the percentage of Type I SGNs labeled in the <italic>Mafb-CreER+</italic> strain to be smaller than that of Type II SGNs at adult ages. However, our data showed that Type II SGNs were frequently labeled by <italic>Celf4-iCreER/+</italic> at P30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–B’’</xref>). All of the Cre or CreER lines described above, except <italic>Prestin-CreER/+</italic>, are also active in the brain and other tissues. We are not aware of any SGN-specific Cre or CreER line that is exclusive for SGNs and shows no expression in any other mouse tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>What are the functions of SGN-specific genes showing constant or dynamic expression?</title><p>We noticed that many of the genes identified in our study were not previously known to be SGN-specific within cochlea. Both <italic>Scrt2</italic> and <italic>Celf4</italic> were expressed in both type I and II SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shrestha et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Mafb</italic>, one of the genes found here to show dynamic expression, is recognized to control SGN differentiation and normal synaptogenesis between SGNs and IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Apart from this example, the function of the majority of genes identified in SGNs remains unknown. One of our SGN-specific genes, <italic>Esrrg</italic>, which encodes estrogen-related receptor-γ, is reported to be involved in congenital hearing loss, but the detailed mechanisms underlying its function remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schilit et al., 2016</xref>). Another SGN-specific gene, <italic>Lrrc55</italic> (leucine-rich-repeat containing 55), is detected in SGNs as early as E15.5. Intriguingly, <italic>Lrrc52</italic> (leucine-rich-repeat containing 52) is selectively expressed in Type I SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shrestha et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Lrrc52</italic>, <italic>Lrrc55</italic>, and other members of this gene family (<italic>Lrrc26</italic> and <italic>Lrrc58</italic>) are involved in the regulation of BK channels (large-conductance calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channels) and in various acoustic information-processing steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pyott and Duncan, 2016</xref>). For detailed functional validation of these newly identified SGN-specific genes, in vivo genetic studies are necessary. This will be one of our future research directions, and it will be facilitated by our recently established high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9-mediated base-editing (loss-of-function) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have provided a comprehensive high-quality SGN transcriptome database covering five ages, from early embryonic stage (E15.5) to the adult stage (P30) in mice, with deep coverage of a large number of genes.

The picked cells were washed three times, to maximize sample purity, before loading into lysis buffer. We also used manual picking for one reference-cell population, P8 glial cells. We initially attempted to use FACS to obtain glial cells, but the purity of these cells did not meet our quality criteria.

To classify gene dynamics, they are designated as up-regulated (u), down-regulated (d) or unchanged (-), between one age and the next age (e.g. SGN_E15.5 to SGN_P1).

Note that the dynamics here were focused on changes between two neighboring ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–J</xref>). This differs from the dynamics in the context of SGN-specific genes showing dynamic expression patterns, which were defined as genes that exhibited significantly different expression between any of the two compared ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

For each slice obtained from the same mouse, we determined, per cochlear turn, the number of dual tdTomato+/Tuj1+ (or Map2+ or Mafb+) SGNs, and then normalized these numbers against the total number of Tuj1+ (or Map2+ or Mafb+) SGNs to obtain an averaged percentage of tdTomato+ SGNs.

There is a need for some further experimental work and data analysis, together with some significant rewriting of the text.

This strategy, while unable to distinguish Type I from Type II SGNs, permitted a much greater sequencing depth, and thus a more comprehensive transcriptome profile for what are presumably Type I cells than that obtained in other studies. This allowed identification of SGN-specific genes not found previously. This information is a valuable contribution to the inner ear field, but could be strengthened by additional computational analyses to illuminate whether there is enrichment for particular GO terms or biological processes that characterize the &quot;constant&quot; vs. &quot;variable&quot; gene groups and additional ISH validation. The authors targeted two of the newly identified genes for reporter or inducible Cre/reporter expression. Preliminary characterization of these mouse strains suggests that they may be useful to the field for marking SGNs or manipulating gene expression in SGNs, but some additional characterization of the lines (particularly the inducible Cre line) is needed.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Judging from the Figure 2 legend, the 21 SGN-specific genes referred to paragraph one of subsection “Identifying new SGN genes with constant and time-varying expression pattern” are genes in the &quot;constant&quot; category, i.e. expressed in all SGN samples. This is not clear from the paragraph. Also, it is a bit disingenuous to state that those 21 genes were not reported in previous scRNA-seq studies because those studies were not aimed at discovering SGN-specific genes and the 21 genes may be expressed at levels too low for detection by scRNA-seq.</p><p>2) Given the relatively small number of genes on each list, it seems not unreasonable to conduct ISH (or immunostaining) validation of a few of the most highly expressed constant genes (e.g. <italic>Elavl4, Tagln3</italic> and <italic>Esrrg</italic>, or whatever the authors are most interested in) and a few of the most highly differentially expressed &quot;variable&quot; genes. Since the heat map in Figure 2B is normalized, one can't easily suggest which ones to test. A limited amount of ISH validation would increase confidence in the constant vs. variable categorization.</p><p>3) The Srct2-EGFP data in Figure 4 should be made supplemental because while it is interesting, it is not essential to the manuscript, and Supplementary Figure 3 should be merged with the current Figure 5, to show two time points at once in a main figure. Also, the authors need to determine whether <italic>Scrt2</italic> is expressed in all SGNs or only in Type I. This could be done with the HA-tag and SGN type-specific markers. The results would have implications for using this line to mark or purify cells, or when considering generation of an inducible Cre line.</p><p>4) To make the summary statement at the end of subsection “<italic>Celf4</italic> is dynamically expressed in both embryonic and adult SGNs”, varying expression over time needs to be shown for the <italic>Celf4-iCreER</italic> strain. This could be done by qRT-PCR or western botting. Also, the P30 data that are currently supplemental should be included in Figure 7.</p><p>5) The fate mapping experiment needs an additional control – <italic>Celf4-iCreER/+;Rosa26-CAG-loxp-stop-loxp-tdTomato</italic> (Ai9)/+ inner ears need to be checked for tdTomato in the absence of tamoxifen treatment to be sure that the iCre is not leaky. It would be very useful for the inner ear field to know more about the early expression of <italic>Celf4</italic>. When does it turn on in SGNs and at least for the E10.5 lineage induction, what proportion of SGNs are labeled?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript reports a new dataset for gene expression in developing and mature spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), the primary sensory neurons for the sense of hearing, as well as two new knock-in mouse strains for visualizing and manipulating inner ear neurons. Gene expression was assessed by bulk RNA-sequencing of pools of ~100 manually picked SGNs at five time points (E15.5, P1, P8, P14, P30) and then compared to gene expression in hair cells and glia to define SGN-enriched genes. The purity and quality of the samples was validated by qPCR for housekeeping, neuronal, glial, and hair cell genes (as well as some other categories), followed by characterization of reporter expression in two knock-in strains: <italic>Scrt2</italic>, which is expressed &quot;constantly&quot; in SGNs, and <italic>Celf4</italic>, which is expressed dynamically.</p><p>Overall, there is a clear value in such a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of SGNs, but there a number of minor issues limit the likely impact of this particular data set. There is no doubt that having access to information about the cell type specificity and dynamics of expression of genes in SGNs is helpful for thinking about candidate genes or choosing markers. The main strength of this project is the breadth of the dataset, which covers many time points as well as cell types. With this resource, it will be relatively simple to see if genes of interest are likely to be expressed in other cell types and whether it is developmentally regulated. The data are generally high quality, in that there are 3 replicates for each sample and the qPCR validation suggests that the starting material was fairly pure, aside from hints of glial contamination in the later postnatal timepoints (Mbp expression in Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><p>That said, I am not entirely convinced that the data will have as broad an impact as intended. For instance, it might actually be easier for most people to simply check genes for expression by in situ hybridization, since in the end, only about 100 genes are identified as &quot;SGN-specific.&quot; The mice also seem a bit less useful, but having another strain at your disposal is certainly nice, especially if there is a chance of avoiding pesky expression in the CNS. Finally, there are some misleading statements in the text that need to be corrected. More specific comments and requests for additional experiments/revisions follow.</p><p>1) Although the data are useful in principle, I was surprised to see how few genes ended up on the final lists of SGN-constant (21 genes) or dynamic (68 genes). The authors note that the list could be longer if the criteria were relaxed, but that raises the question of whether relaxing the criteria would diminish the value of the data, setting up a Catch-22. With so few genes, the value becomes lower and in the end, it might be easier for someone to just do some in situs for their gene of interest. I think it would also be worthwhile to define genes whose expression changes over time in SGNs even if they are also expressed in other cells. By screening out all genes that are expressed in HCs or glia, one loses many genes that are probably interesting and important for SGNs. Additionally, it looks like there may be some glial contamination from P8 on; more glial markers should be assessed at each time point.</p><p>2) There also needs to be more information regarding the contribution of Type II SGNs to the data. Presumably, the pool of SGNs contained mostly Type I SGNs but a few Type II SGNs. Since there are datasets highlighting Type II-specific genes, such as TH, the authors should show whether these genes are detected in the pools or whether the data are really dominated by Type I SGNs. This doesn't take away from the value; I would simply want to know how to interpret anything I see. This also highlights the fact that the currently available single cell RNA-seq data, when combined, likely cover the same 15,000 genes that are covered by the bulk RNA-seq, but without losing SGN subtype information. Thus, only the developmental stages provide truly new information.</p><p>3) With regards to the new mouse strains, these might be useful but they need further validation. Most importantly, there are already useful Cre lines for labeling and manipulating SGNs, such as <italic>Neurog1-Cre, Shh-CreGFP, Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> and <italic>Mafb-CreERT2</italic>, as well as a Mapt-GFP strain that can be used to specifically label SGNs at any stage. The authors state erroneously that <italic>Mafb-CreERT2</italic> only labels Type II SGNs in adults. While Mafb expression is indeed higher in Type IIs, it is also present in Type Is, as evidenced by the labeling shown in Shrestha et al., 2018, for instance. Additionally, the new strains here are also active in VGNs, unlike <italic>Mafb-CreERT2</italic>. The main issue with the lines out there is that they also label neurons in the CNS, which can be a big problem for tracing central projections or doing any kind of functional analysis. With that in mind, the <italic>Scrt2</italic> strain might be problematic, given the hints of expression in the hindbrain at E10.5. For both strains, the authors should also document expression patterns in the CNS, at least in the mature auditory brainstem.</p><p>4) The expression pattern in the <italic>Scrt2-tdTomato</italic> mice looks strange at E13.5. The authors should explain what all of the Map/tdTomato+ around the perimeter of the cochlea are (in Figure 2) as well as the section angle in Figure 4D, which I found hard to interpret.</p><p>5) The <italic>Celf4</italic> mouse strain could be useful if there is in fact little expression in the brainstem or elsewhere in the nervous system. The expression in the mesenchyme could raise problems in some cases, though (minor point). One question I had is whether there are conditions where all of the SGNs are labeled. It is surprising that only half of the neurons are labeled after 2 days of tamoxifen induction. It would be important to know if this is a random subset and whether there are conditions where in fact all neurons can be labeled. The inclusion of the HA-tag is a nice addition, but the results should really be validated by analyzing <italic>Celf4</italic> protein distribution using an independent method, such as antibody stain (minor – at least point out the caveat).</p><p>6) The presentation of the results stands to be improved in several ways. First, since this is a resource paper, more experimental information should be provided in the main text, including the number of SGNs per pool, the length of time from euthanasia to preservation in lysis buffer, and the criteria for SGN-constant vs dynamic. Second, there are some misstatements that gave me pause. Aside from the incorrect assertion that <italic>Mafb-CreERT2</italic> is Type II-specific in adults, the authors also intimate that the recent single cell RNA-seq datasets show changes in gene expression &quot;underlying their different functions&quot; (Abstract) but this is not accurate. No subtype-specific gene has been shown to endow subtype-specific functions, to my knowledge. Third, the authors cite the recent paper on <italic>Pou4f1</italic> (Sherrill et al., 2019) as evidence that <italic>Pou4f1</italic> regulates &quot;IHC presynaptic calcium signaling&quot;. This is misleading: that paper showed changes in presynaptic calcium signaling in the IHCs of <italic>Pou4f1</italic> CKO mice, but since <italic>Pou4f1</italic> is expressed in the SGNs, the origins of this phenotype must be secondary. Fourth, it seems inappropriate to discuss results from an unpublished study (subsection “Applications of <italic>Scrt2-tdTomato/+</italic> knock-in mouse model”) as evidence that a new mouse strain is useful, as the reader can't independently assess the validity of the statements. Fifth, the authors mention several genes that were &quot;not identified&quot; by single cell RNA-seq, but then immediately cite those studies as evidence that the gene were expressed, for instance in both Type I and Type II SGNs. I think the authors mean that the genes were not emphasized as being subtype-specific, which is very different from saying they were not identified at all. Sixth, the authors missed the opportunity to emphasize an advantage of this new dataset over previous data, in that old microarray comparisons of SGNs and VGNs at multiple time points were almost certainly affected by the presence of glia in the samples (that is, if the SGN samples are indeed as pure as suggested – see point 1).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Comprehensive transcriptome analysis of cochlear spiral ganglion neurons at multiple ages&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors answered each point and have improved the study's utility to the inner ear field. It would still be desirable to know more about Cre activity from the new lines in the auditory/vestibular centers in the brain, but I understand that this sort of detailed characterization will take future time and effort from the authors as well as the community of those who want to use the lines.</p><p>I remain somewhat disappointed by the writing, which detracts from the impact. Nevertheless, given that this is a resources paper, it presents very useful data to the inner ear field and describes two new SGN Cre lines that will be made available through JAX. These complement available lines and are likely to be useful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors have done an excellent job of addressing my concerns. They have added interesting new data that a) confirm expression of 8 genes by in situ hybridization; b) identify groups of developmentally regulated genes in SGNs; c) show expression of both new mouse lines in Type I and Type II SGNs; and d) show that the two mouse lines also drive expression elsewhere in the nervous system, with an expanded discussion of advantages in the Discussion. I particularly appreciate the addition of Figure 2—figure supplement 4, which highlights many other groups of genes uncovered by this analysis. As a result, the value of the data and of the new mouse lines is significantly enhanced. I have only a few criticisms.</p><p>1) The authors often use the term &quot;SGN-specific&quot; when in fact, at least some of the genes are also expressed in vestibular ganglion neurons. To avoid confusion, the authors should explain up front that some genes may also be expressed in VGNs. Also, I think it is confusing to use the term &quot;VNs&quot;. VGNs parallels the SGN nomenclature more accurately.</p><p>2) Subsection “Isolated and purified SGNs are highly enriched in neuronal genes and depleted in HC and glial genes”: we &quot;totally used&quot; should be &quot;used a total of&quot;.</p><p>3) Subsection “Identifying SGN specific genes with constant and dynamic expression pattern”: &quot;at all SGNs&quot; isn't proper English. Also, I don't think these data can resolve whether expression is in all SGNs. Perhaps the authors meant &quot;at all timepoints examined&quot;?</p><p>4) Figure 2—figure supplement 3 is an excellent addition. However, the images are poor quality. New images should be taken.</p><p>5) Though the data in Figure 8 look convincing, Gata3 is not a reliable Type II SGN marker. If possible, the authors should show wholemounts with tdTomato-labeled processes. This will definitively indicate whether both Type I and Type II SGNs are labeled, as they can be reliably distinguished by their projection patterns.</p><p>6) Figure 2—figure supplement 4 is very interesting and increases the value of the study. I feel this figure should not be supplemental. The diagrams of the modified gene loci plus Southern blots and PCRs, on the other hand, could be supplemental. My suggestion is to just show the modified locus as a panel in the first figure showing expression from the relevant mouse line, and to move the targeting strategy and Southern blot/PCR validation to supplemental.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50491.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript presents a new RNA-seq dataset generated by collecting individual genetically labelled spiral ganglion neurons at 5 different ages.

Also, it is a bit disingenuous to state that those 21 genes were not reported in previous scRNA-seq studies because those studies were not aimed at discovering SGN-specific genes and the 21 genes may be expressed at levels too low for detection by scRNA-seq.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out and we have re-written this paragraph. Moreover, throughout the manuscript, we deleted the sentences “….those 21 genes were not reported in previous scRNA-seq studies…”. Instead,we stated that previously unknown SGN specific genes were identified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given the relatively small number of genes on each list, it seems not unreasonable to conduct ISH (or immunostaining) validation of a few of the most highly expressed constant genes (e.g. Elavl4, Tagln3 and Esrrg, or whatever the authors are most interested in) and a few of the most highly differentially expressed &quot;variable&quot; genes. Since the heat map in Figure 2B is normalized, one can't easily suggest which ones to test. A limited amount of ISH validation would increase confidence in the constant vs. variable categorization.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion. We have selected 8 genes (4 are SGN specific showing constant pattern, 4 are SGN specific showing dynamic pattern) to perform RNA in situ hybridization. All of the 8 genes were specifically expressed in SGN region. Please refer to subsection “Identifying SGN specific genes with constant and dynamic expression pattern” and Figure 2—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Srct2-EGFP data in Figure 4 should be made supplemental because while it is interesting, it is not essential to the manuscript, and Supplementary Figure 3 should be merged with the current Figure 5, to show two time points at once in a main figure. Also, the authors need to determine whether Scrt2 is expressed in all SGNs or only in Type I. This could be done with the HA-tag and SGN type-specific markers. The results would have implications for using this line to mark or purify cells, or when considering generation of an inducible Cre line.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for these suggestions above. We have re-organized those figures and please refer to the Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1. Furthermore, we confirmed that <italic>Scrt2</italic> and <italic>Celf4</italic> are expressed in both Type I and II SGNs at adult ages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) To make the summary statement at the end of subsection “Celf4 is dynamically expressed in both embryonic and adult SGNs”, varying expression over time needs to be shown for the Celf4-iCreER strain. This could be done by qRT-PCR or western botting. Also, the P30 data that are currently supplemental should be included in Figure 7.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for these suggestions and we performed qPCR of <italic>Celf4</italic>. Please refer to subsection “<italic>Celf4</italic> is dynamically expressed in both embryonic and adult SGNs” and Figure 2D. In addition, P30 data (together with E15.5 and P1) of <italic>Celf4-iCreER</italic> strain were presented in the Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The fate mapping experiment needs an additional control – Celf4-iCreER/+;Rosa26-CAG-loxp-stop-loxp-tdTomato (Ai9)/+ inner ears need to be checked for tdTomato in the absence of tamoxifen treatment to be sure that the iCre is not leaky. It would be very useful for the inner ear field to know more about the early expression of Celf4. When does it turn on in SGNs and at least for the E10.5 lineage induction, what proportion of SGNs are labeled?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for these suggestions. We have performed the additional control (no tamoxifen) in <italic>Celf4-iCreER/+; Rosa26-CAG-loxp-stop-loxp-tdTomato/+</italic> mice. No tdTomato+ SGNs were observed at P1. This confirmed that <italic>Celf4-iCreER</italic> was not leaky. In contrast, when tamoxifen was administered to <italic>Celf4-iCreER/+; Rosa26-CAG-loxp-stop-loxp-tdTomato/+</italic> mice at E10.5, numerous tdTomato+ SGNs were observed at E18.5. Please refer to subsection “Fate mapping analysis by using <italic>Celf4 iCreER/+</italic> mouse strain” and Figure 7—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) Although the data are useful in principle, I was surprised to see how few genes ended up on the final lists of SGN-constant (21 genes) or dynamic (68 genes). The authors note that the list could be longer if the criteria were relaxed, but that raises the question of whether relaxing the criteria would diminish the value of the data, setting up a Catch-22. With so few genes, the value becomes lower and in the end, it might be easier for someone to just do some in situs for their gene of interest. I think it would also be worthwhile to define genes whose expression changes over time in SGNs even if they are also expressed in other cells. By screening out all genes that are expressed in HCs or glia, one loses many genes that are probably interesting and important for SGNs. Additionally, it looks like there may be some glial contamination from P8 on; more glial markers should be assessed at each time point.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciated this suggestion. We have performed additional computational analysis of SGN genes without considering whether they are expressed in HCs and glias. GO enrichment analyses were performed, too. Please refer to subsection “Classifying dynamics of genes expressed in SGNs” and Figure 2—figure supplement 4K-M. In terms of the glia contamination, we totally checked four known glial markers <italic>Sox2</italic> (also in vestibular HCs), Sox10, Foxd3 and Plp1 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Currently, much less glial markers are known than those of SGNs or HCs. Future RNA-Seq of glial cells at multiple ages will reveal more glia specific genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There also needs to be more information regarding the contribution of Type II SGNs to the data. Presumably, the pool of SGNs contained mostly Type I SGNs but a few Type II SGNs. Since there are datasets highlighting Type II-specific genes, such as TH, the authors should show whether these genes are detected in the pools or whether the data are really dominated by Type I SGNs. This doesn't take away from the value; I would simply want to know how to interpret anything I see. This also highlights the fact that the currently available single cell RNA-seq data, when combined, likely cover the same 15,000 genes that are covered by the bulk RNA-seq, but without losing SGN subtype information. Thus, only the developmental stages provide truly new information.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciated this suggestion. We checked several Type II markers: Mafb, Gata3, Th, and <italic>Calca/Cgrpα</italic> expression in SGN_P30 replicates. Their averaged TPM was 21, 8, 1.9 and 1.8, respectively. Due to ~5% distribution of Type II SGNs at adult ages, we on average may only picked ~5 type II SGNs in each replicate (with each replicate ~100 cells). In this situation (Type II SGN genes are diluted a lot), Type II SGNs are very likely to be included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) With regards to the new mouse strains, these might be useful but they need further validation. Most importantly, there are already useful Cre lines for labeling and manipulating SGNs, such as Neurog1-Cre, Shh-CreGFP, Bhlhe22-Cre and Mafb-CreERT2, as well as a Mapt-GFP strain that can be used to specifically label SGNs at any stage. The authors state erroneously that Mafb-CreERT2 only labels Type II SGNs in adults. While Mafb expression is indeed higher in Type IIs, it is also present in Type Is, as evidenced by the labeling shown in Shrestha et al., 2018, for instance. Additionally, the new strains here are also active in VGNs, unlike Mafb-CreERT2. The main issue with the lines out there is that they also label neurons in the CNS, which can be a big problem for tracing central projections or doing any kind of functional analysis. With that in mind, the Scrt2 strain might be problematic, given the hints of expression in the hindbrain at E10.5. For both strains, the authors should also document expression patterns in the CNS, at least in the mature auditory brainstem.</p></disp-quote><p>We have further characterized the expression of <italic>Scrt2</italic> and <italic>Celf4</italic> in adult central nervous system. Please refer to subsection “<italic>Scrt2</italic> and <italic>Celf4</italic> are expressed in adult brain tissues” and the Figure 8—figure supplement 1. We also discussed the differences among our two lines and available ones. We will characterize expression of <italic>Scrt2</italic> and <italic>Celf4</italic> in adult auditory brainstem in future studies. Our laboratory did not have any previous experience about adult auditory brainstem and it will take a while for us to be familiar with the histology and how to precisely handle auditory brainstem tissues out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The expression pattern in the Scrt2-tdTomato mice looks strange at E13.5. The authors should explain what all of the Map/tdTomato+ around the perimeter of the cochlea are (in Figure 2) as well as the section angle in Figure 4D, which I found hard to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for confusing.Those are the autofluorescence of the blood cells in vessels in cochlea, as labeled by asterisks in the Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1. Please also refer to text in the corresponding figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The Celf4 mouse strain could be useful if there is in fact little expression in the brainstem or elsewhere in the nervous system. The expression in the mesenchyme could raise problems in some cases, though (minor point). One question I had is whether there are conditions where all of the SGNs are labeled. It is surprising that only half of the neurons are labeled after 2 days of tamoxifen induction. It would be important to know if this is a random subset and whether there are conditions where in fact all neurons can be labeled. The inclusion of the HA-tag is a nice addition, but the results should really be validated by analyzing Celf4 protein distribution using an independent method, such as antibody stain (minor – at least point out the caveat).</p></disp-quote><p>Because <italic>Celf4-iCreER</italic> is an inducible Cre, it will be difficult to label all SGNs. But if more than two tamoxifen administering was given, more SGNs should be labeled. In addition, according to RNA in situ data (Figure 2—figure supplement 3), <italic>Celf4</italic> expression level is relatively lower than other SGN specific genes. Currently, there is no good <italic>Celf4</italic> antibody suitable for immunostaining, and that is why we added HA tag to make future studies more convenient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The presentation of the results stands to be improved in several ways. First, since this is a resource paper, more experimental information should be provided in the main text, including the number of SGNs per pool, the length of time from euthanasia to preservation in lysis buffer.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciated this suggestion. We added relevant information above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also intimate that the recent single cell RNA-seq datasets show changes in gene expression &quot;underlying their different functions&quot; (Abstract) but this is not accurate. No subtype-specific gene has been shown to endow subtype-specific functions, to my knowledge.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have edited this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, the authors cite the recent paper on Pou4f1 (Sherrill et al., 2019) as evidence that Pou4f1 regulates &quot;IHC presynaptic calcium signaling&quot;. This is misleading: that paper showed changes in presynaptic calcium signaling in the IHCs of Pou4f1 CKO mice, but since Pou4f1 is expressed in the SGNs, the origins of this phenotype must be secondary.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have deleted discussion of <italic>Pou4f1</italic> in SGNs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fourth, it seems inappropriate to discuss results from an unpublished study (subsection “Applications of Scrt2-tdTomato/+ knock-in mouse model”) as evidence that a new mouse strain is useful, as the reader can't independently assess the validity of the statements.</p></disp-quote><p>We have deleted information about our ongoing studies of SGN induction. This is also raised by reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fifth, the authors mention several genes that were &quot;not identified&quot; by single cell RNA-seq, but then immediately cite those studies as evidence that the gene were expressed, for instance in both Type I and Type II SGNs. I think the authors mean that the genes were not emphasized as being subtype-specific, which is very different from saying they were not identified at all.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for that. Reviewer 2 also pointed this out. Thank you very much. Throughout the revised manuscript, we deleted the sentences saying like “….those SGN specific genes were not reported in previous scRNA-seq studies…”.Instead,we stated that previously unknown SGN specific genes were identified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sixth, the authors missed the opportunity to emphasize an advantage of this new dataset over previous data, in that old microarray comparisons of SGNs and VGNs at multiple time points were almost certainly affected by the presence of glia in the samples (that is, if the SGN samples are indeed as pure as suggested – see point 1).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion. In addition, GO analysis of both our dataset and microarray data showed the enrichment of immune-related genes, which in turn can support the purity of our SGNs.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I am more or less satisfied with the responses to the reviews. The authors answered each point and have improved the study's utility to the inner ear field. It would still be desirable to know more about Cre activity from the new lines in the auditory/vestibular centers in the brain, but I understand that this sort of detailed characterization will take future time and effort from the authors as well as the community of those who want to use the lines.</p><p>I remain somewhat disappointed by the writing, which detracts from the impact. Nevertheless, given that this is a resources paper, it presents very useful data to the inner ear field and describes two new SGN Cre lines that will be made available through JAX. These complement available lines and are likely to be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciated the encouraging comments of our revision. In near future, we will start to learn the histology of auditory/vestibular centers in the brain and we will report detailed patterns of <italic>Scrt2</italic> and <italic>Celf4</italic> in auditory/vestibular centers in our next manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) The authors often use the term &quot;SGN-specific&quot; when in fact, at least some of the genes are also expressed in vestibular ganglion neurons. To avoid confusion, the authors should explain up front that some genes may also be expressed in VGNs. Also, I think it is confusing to use the term &quot;VNs&quot;. VGNs parallels the SGN nomenclature more accurately.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have added the sentence to clearly say that although those genes were “SGN-specific” within cochlea organ, they were also expressed in vestibular neurons and neurons in central nervous system. In addition, we have changed VNs to VGNs throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Isolated and purified SGNs are highly enriched in neuronal genes and depleted in HC and glial genes”: we &quot;totally used&quot; should be &quot;used a total of&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>“totally used” was changed to &quot;used a total of&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Identifying SGN specific genes with constant and dynamic expression pattern”: &quot;at all SGNs&quot; isn't proper English. Also, I don't think these data can resolve whether expression is in all SGNs. Perhaps the authors meant &quot;at all timepoints examined&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have changed “at all SGNs” to “in SGNs at all timepoints examined”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2—figure supplement 3 is an excellent addition. However, the images are poor quality. New images should be taken.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-taken the images at 20x magnification, please see the updated Figure 2—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Though the data in Figure 8 look convincing, Gata3 is not a reliable Type II SGN marker. If possible, the authors should show wholemounts with tdTomato-labeled processes. This will definitively indicate whether both Type I and Type II SGNs are labeled, as they can be reliably distinguished by their projection patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have additionally performed whole mount double staining of Gata3 and tdTomato, and please see the new Figure 7. We agreed that, besides in SGNs, Gata3 is also expressed in many other cells in cochlea such as hair cells and supporting cells (Figure. 7C). We did not present whole mount staining of Gata3 and tdTomato in <italic>Scrt2-P2A-tdTomato/+</italic> samples at P30, because the tdTomato is not bright enough to visualize neuronal fiber terminals.</p><p>In addition, we pointed out that possibility that some of the tdTomato+ fibers might be cochlear efferent fibers (Figure 7D-D’), if <italic>Celf4</italic> is also expressed in brainstem. Future detailed work is needed to clarify it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 2—figure supplement 4 is very interesting and increases the value of the study. I feel this figure should not be supplemental. The diagrams of the modified gene loci plus Southern blots and PCRs, on the other hand, could be supplemental. My suggestion is to just show the modified locus as a panel in the first figure showing expression from the relevant mouse line, and to move the targeting strategy and Southern blot/PCR validation to supplemental.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for these suggestions and we have accepted them. The previous Figure 2—figure supplement 4 were Figure 3 in the revised manuscript. In addition, we changed previous main figures of Southern blot and PCR (for both <italic>Scrt2</italic> and <italic>Celf4</italic> strains) into supplemental figures.</p></body></sub-article></article>
