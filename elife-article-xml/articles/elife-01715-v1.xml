post-tetanic potentiation (PTP). Diacylglycerol (DAG) and Protein-kinase C (PKC) signaling in the nerve terminal have been widely implicated in the short-term modulation of transmitter release, but the target protein of PKC phosphorylation during short-term enhancement has remained unknown. Here, we use a gene-replacement strategy at the calyx of Held, a large CNS model synapse that expresses robust PTP, to study the molecular mechanisms of PTP. We find that two PKC phosphorylation sites of Munc18-1 are critically important for PTP, which identifies the presynaptic target protein for the action of PKC during PTP. Pharmacological experiments show that a phosphatase normally limits the duration of PTP, and that PTP is initiated by the action of a ‘conventional’ PKC isoform. Thus, a dynamic PKC phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation cycle of Munc18-1 drives short-term enhancement of transmitter release during PTP.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01715.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01715.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01715.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Brain function depends on the rapid transfer of information from one brain cell to the next at junctions known as synapses. Small packages called vesicles play an important role in this process. The arrival of an electrical action potential at the nerve terminal of the first cell causes some vesicles in the cell to fuse with the cell membrane, and this leads to the neurotransmitters inside the vesicles being released into the synapse. The neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the second cell, which leads to an electrical signal in the second cell. A protein called Munc18-1 has a central role in the fusion of the vesicle at the cell membrane.</p><p>The strength of a synapse—that is, how easily the first brain cell can impact the electrical behaviour of the second—can change, and this ‘synaptic plasticity’ is thought to underlie learning and memory. Long-term changes in synaptic strength require additional receptors to be inserted into the membrane of the second cell. However, synapses can also be temporarily strengthened: the arrival of a burst of action potentials—a tetanus—causes some synapses to increase the amount of neurotransmitter they release in response to any subsequent, single, action potential.</p><p>This temporary increase in synaptic strength, which is known as post-tetanic potentiation, requires an enzyme called protein kinase C; the role of this enzyme is to phosphorylate specific target proteins (i.e., to add phosphate groups to them). Now, Genç et al. have genetically modified a mouse synapse in vivo and shown that protein kinase C brings about post-tetanic potentiation by phosphorylating Munc18-1. Furthermore, pharmacological experiments show that proteins called phosphatases, which de-phosphorylate proteins, normally terminate the post-tetanic potentiation after about one minute. Taken together, the study identifies a target protein which is phosphorylated by protein kinase C during post-tetanic potentiation. The study also suggests that in addition to its fundamental role in vesicle fusion, the phosphorylation state of Munc18-1 can change the probability of vesicle fusion in a more subtle way, thereby contributing to synaptic plasticity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01715.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01715.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>transmitter release</kwd><kwd>protein kinase C</kwd><kwd>protein phosphatase</kwd><kwd>calyx of Held</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_122496</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schneggenburger</surname><given-names>Ralf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_138320/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schneggenburger</surname><given-names>Ralf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Protein kinase C brings about post-tetanic potentiation - a temporary increase in synaptic strength due to increased transmitter release - via phosphorylation of a target protein, Munc18-1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vesicle fusion and transmitter release at synapses is a fundamentally important signaling mechanism that guarantees fast information transfer between neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Südhof, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, transmitter release is not static, but the amount of quanta released with each presynaptic action potential (AP) can vary dynamically, depending on the recent history of presynaptic activity. During high-frequency activity, short-term depression leads to a decrease of release in many synapses, but following recovery from depression, transmitter release can overshoot, giving rise to short-term enhancement of release. Various forms of short-term enhancement, like facilitation, augmentation and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), have been observed and discriminated based on their duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Magleby and Zengel, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>). There is good evidence that the longer-lasting of these, augmentation and PTP, depend on the activation of intracellular second messengers in the nerve terminal, which in turn influence the release machinery.</p><p>A second messenger with a centrally important role in presynaptic plasticity is diacylglycerol (DAG), which can activate both protein kinase-C and Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lackner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wierda et al., 2007</xref>). During augmentation, activation of the presynaptic protein Munc13-1 either by DAG or by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Calmodulin results in increased vesicle priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenmund et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Junge et al., 2004</xref>). The other common form of short-term enhancement, PTP, has been observed at excitatory synapses in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McNaughton, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2007</xref>), cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beierlein et al., 2007</xref>), calyx of Held brainstem synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Habets and Borst, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korogod et al., 2005</xref>) and at the neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Magleby and Zengel, 1975</xref>). PTP has been shown to be sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brager et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korogod et al., 2007</xref>), and deletion of the PKC α and β genes in mice suppressed PTP at the calyx synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fioravante et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, PTP is likely caused by a presynaptic PKC phosphorylation step, but the target protein of PKC during PTP has remained unknown.</p><p>Munc18-1 is a member of the Sec1/Munc18 family of proteins essential for membrane fusion from yeast to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Verhage et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>). Munc18-1 has two consensus sites for PKC phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujita et al., 1996</xref>) which become phosphorylated during depolarization of synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Vries et al., 2000</xref>), and which are necessary for phorbol ester potentiation of transmitter release in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wierda et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, Munc18-1 is a candidate for PKC phosphorylation during PTP. Nevertheless, there are other presynaptic proteins which might act as PKC targets. First, SNAP-25 and Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) have PKC consensus sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shimazaki et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hilfiker et al., 1999</xref>). However, no evidence was found for an involvement of SNAP-25 in the phorbol ester potentiation of synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Finley et al., 2003</xref>), and the PKC/CaM kinase consensus site in Syt1 is not conserved in Syt2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nagy et al., 2006</xref>). Since robust PTP is also observed at synapses which express Syt2 as their main Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, like the calyx of Held and neuromuscular synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pang et al., 2006</xref>), Syt1 is unlikely a general phosphorylation target for the induction of PTP. Second, ion channels like voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are targets of PKC phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zamponi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2005</xref>). However, studies at the calyx synapse have shown only marginal changes in the presynaptic AP waveform or presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during PTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Habets and Borst, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korogod et al., 2007</xref>), or during phorbol ester mediated potentiation of transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lou et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2008</xref>). These findings argue against a major role of ion channel phosphorylation during PKC-dependent short-term enhancement of release. Therefore, it is attractive to hypothesize that a protein of the release machinery is a PKC target during short-term enhancement, and Munc18-1 is an interesting candidate for this role.</p><p>Here, we wished to study the role of Munc18-1 phosphorylation during PTP. Since PTP has been observed mainly at synapses of acute preparations but not in cultured synapses, we developed an in vivo gene replacement strategy at the calyx of Held synapse, a large CNS model synapse at which PTP measurements are well established (see references above). We used a floxed mouse line in which exon 2 of the Munc18-1 coding gene <italic>Stxbp1</italic> is flanked by loxP sites (called <italic>Munc18-1</italic><sup><italic>lox/lox</italic></sup> mice; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heeroma et al., 2004</xref>), combined with in vivo virus-mediated protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wimmer et al., 2004</xref>) to recombine the floxed allele, and to re-express mutant or wild-type Munc18-1 protein. Using these approaches, we show that a transient PKC phosphorylation of Munc18-1 causes the increased transmitter release that underlies PTP. These results identify Munc18-1 as a PKC target protein during PTP, and suggest that Munc18-1, besides its essential role in catalyzing membrane fusion, can mediate a second-messenger modulation of the release machinery during presynaptic plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A phosphatase determines the duration of PTP</title><p>Previous studies have found evidence for a role of PKC during PTP, a form of short-term enhancement of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brager et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korogod et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fioravante et al., 2011</xref>). However, it remains possible that the requirement for PKC merely represents a background PKC activity <italic>permissive</italic> for the induction of PTP (see discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korogod et al., 2007</xref>). We hypothesized that if PTP is caused by a dynamic phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation cycle of a presynaptic protein, phosphatase blockers should prolong the duration of PTP.</p><p>We studied PTP at the calyx of Held synapse in a slice preparation, by first testing baseline synaptic strength with double stimuli (interval, 10 ms) repeated every 10 s. PTP was induced every 5–7 min using 4 s 100 Hz trains of afferent fiber stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, arrowheads). PTP induction trains under control conditions led to ∼twofold PTP which decayed nearly completely over the next 3 min, similarly as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korogod et al., 2005</xref>). Acute application of calyculin (1 µM), an inhibitor of phosphatases PP1 and PP2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishihara et al., 1989</xref>), strongly prolonged the decay of PTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We estimated the decay rate of PTP by line fits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, grey and red line), and found that the PTP decay rate was slowed from 16.0 ± 2.6%/min to 4.04 ± 1.7%/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; n = 7 cells; p&lt;0.01). Calyculin acted without changing the baseline synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>; p=0.96), nor the peak PTP amplitude (219 ± 17% and 227 ± 17%, in control and calyculin respectively; p=0.7).

To distinguish between pre- and postsynaptic sites of action of calyculin, we first analyzed the paired-pulse ratio (EPSC<sub>2</sub>/EPSC<sub>1</sub>). Under control conditions, the paired-pulse ratio was decreased during the peak of PTP, and then recovered when PTP decayed back to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, black data points). The decreased paired-pulse ratio confirms the view that PTP is presynaptic in origin, and mediated by an increased transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Habets and Borst, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korogod et al., 2005</xref>). In the presence of calyculin both the decay of PTP as well as the recovery of the paired pulse ratio were slowed, revealing a parallel regulation of both the synaptic strength and the paired-pulse ratio by calyculin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; red data points; n = 7 cells). Thus, in the presence of a phosphatase inhibitor, the increased transmitter release during PTP decays more slowly.</p><p>We further analyzed the quantal mechanism of PTP in the absence and presence of calyculin by analyzing the spontaneous (miniature) EPSCs (mEPSCs), sampled in 10 s intervals in-between evoked EPSCs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> shows plots of the evoked EPSC amplitude (<italic>top</italic>), and of the individual mEPSC amplitudes and time-averaged mEPSC frequency (<italic>bottom</italic>), both in control conditions, and following application of calyculin (1 µM). Following the PTP induction trains, we found that the mEPSC frequency was increased and then relaxed back to baseline value over several tens of seconds, as shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korogod et al., 2005</xref>). Under control conditions, the mEPSC amplitude was increased during the first 10 s interval following PTP induction (by 23% on average; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; p&lt;0.05). However, the increase in mEPSC amplitudes did not reach statistical significance in the other data sets of this study (see below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings are consistent with the view that PTP largely represents an increase in the amount of released quanta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korogod et al., 2005</xref>), and that a significant increase in mEPSC amplitude, maybe caused by compound fusion, is only observed with stronger PTP induction stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xue and Wu, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, in the presence of calyculin, the elevated mEPSC frequency following PTP induction trains did not recover completely, but rather, persisted at 2–3-fold elevated levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, bottom). This effect was observed in all cells in which mEPSC frequency was analyzed (n = 5; p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Thus, the persistently enhanced transmitter release following PTP induction trains under phosphatase block is mirrored by an enhanced spontaneous release rate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pharmacological evidence for a role of conventional PKCs</title><p>Phosphatases reverse the action of many serine–threonine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hunter, 1995</xref>). We therefore wanted to find further evidence that the action of a phosphatase is related to an initial PKC phosphorylation step. Furthermore, we wanted to distinguish pharmacologically whether ‘novel’ or ‘conventional’ PKCs initiate PTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Newton, 2001</xref>). For this purpose, we made use of cell-permeable inhibitory peptides directed either against the conventional PKC isoforms α and βΙ−ΙΙ (called PKCi), or against protein kinase A in a control experiment (called PKAi). We measured PTP in slices pre-incubated either with PKAi or with PKCi at 10 µM each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’ for procedures of drug application). PKCi strongly suppressed PTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; p&lt;0.001), whereas PTP was normal in the presence of PKAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The baseline synaptic strength was similar under both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; p=0.92). Since large EPSCs usually show smaller (relative) PTP at the calyx synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korogod et al., 2005</xref>), we plotted the amount of PTP vs EPSC amplitude to control for a possible sampling bias with respect to baseline EPSC amplitudes. This revealed that PKCi also reduced PTP in recordings with small baseline EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Therefore, the smaller average PTP in the presence of PKCi was not caused by a sampling bias towards large baseline EPSCs.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01715.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Conventional PKCs but not phospholipase-C initiate PTP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average time courses of normalized EPSC amplitude (PTP plots) in the presence of PKC inhibitory peptide (PKCi; red symbols, n = 8 cells) or PKA inhibitory peptide (PKAi; black symbols, n = 9 cells).

Munc18-1 is an essential protein for vesicle fusion and membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>), which has two PKC phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujita et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Vries et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wierda et al., 2007</xref>). To investigate the role of Munc18-1 in PTP, it was necessary to develop a gene replacement strategy in which endogenous Munc18-1 protein is replaced with a PKC-insensitive mutant. Since constitutive genetic deletion of Munc18-1 in mice is lethal at the late embryo stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Verhage et al., 2000</xref>), we used <italic>Munc18-1</italic><sup><italic>lox/lox</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heeroma et al., 2004</xref>) and recombined the loxP sites using virus-mediated Cre expression. In addition, we wished to re-express phosphorylation-deficient Munc18-1, or wild-type Munc18-1 using the same viral construct. This required the simultaneous expression of three proteins: (i) Munc18-1, in the wild-type or mutant form, (ii) Cre-recombinase, and (iii) GFP to label successfully transduced calyces of Held.

This identifies Munc18-1 as a presynaptic PKC target during PTP. Pharmacological experiments suggested that the PKC action during PTP is dynamic, since blocking phosphatases led to a marked prolongation of PTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Together, these results show that a dynamic phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation cycle of Munc18-1, initiated by PKC activity, causes PTP.</p><p>A membrane-permeable peptide inhibitor of conventional PKC isoforms α and β suppressed PTP, whereas a similar PKA inhibitor had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The peptide inhibitors have a more defined PKC isoform specificity than the synthetic PKC inhibitors used earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brager et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korogod et al., 2007</xref>). This, together with recent findings from knock-out mouse lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fioravante et al., 2011</xref>), allows us to conclude that during PTP induction stimuli, conventional PKC isoforms are activated. A previous study evaluated the effects of BIS-like PKC inhibitors on PTP as non-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). However, the genetic evidence for an involvement of conventional PKCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fioravante et al., 2011</xref>) and for the PKC phosphorylation sites of Munc18-1 in PTP (present study), as well as our pharmacological evidence with specific peptide inhibitors, firmly establishes the role of PKC and Munc18-1 phosphorylation in PTP. An earlier study found that phorbol esters translocates PKCε at the calyx of Held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saitoh et al., 2001</xref>). Although we cannot exclude that PKCε contributes to phorbol ester potentiation of release, it seems unlikely that novel PKCs, including PKCε, play a major role during PTP, a conclusion which agrees with the inefficiency of PLC inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The inefficiency of PLC blockers in PTP further contrasts this form of short-term enhancement with augmentation, since the latter is sensitive to PLC blockers, but not affected by PKC inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenmund et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>We developed a novel gene replacement approach for the calyx of Held synapse, which makes use of a floxed mouse line, combined with virus-mediated expression of three proteins: (i) Cre-recombinase; (ii) the protein of interest in mutated, or wild-type form, and (iii) the reporter gene GFP. We used adenoviral vectors, which have a high cloning capacity and which allow the use of two expression cassettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Young and Neher, 2009</xref>). The additional use of an IRES site allowed us to drive the expression of a third protein; the Cre-recombinase placed downstream of the IRES site was expressed efficiently as shown in control experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A2,B2</xref>). Using this approach, we showed that replacing the endogenous (floxed) Munc18-1 with a Munc18-1 mutant resistant to PKC phosphorylation strongly suppressed PTP. These genetic experiments at the calyx of Held show that Munc18-1 is a necessary target for PKC during short-term enhancement of release.</p><p>Perturbing presynaptic PKC signaling with various methods, including PKC inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korogod et al., 2007</xref>), phosphatase block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and introducing a PKC insensitive Munc18-1 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), did not lead to changes of the baseline synaptic strength. This indicates that Munc18-1 is not phosphorylated in the nerve terminal under baseline conditions; a conclusion which agrees with previous work using a synaptosome preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Vries et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, it seems likely that during, or shortly after high-frequency activity, Munc18-1 is phosphorylated by a conventional PKC isoform, which induces short-term enhancement of release. About a minute later, a phosphatase de-phosphorylates Munc18-1, which terminates the enhanced evoked release during PTP. Thus, a dynamic regulation of the PKC phosphorylation state of Munc18-1 underlies the rise and decay of PTP.</p><p>Using the gene replacement approach, we also studied the potentiation of transmitter release by phorbol esters. We found that the Munc18-1 phosphorylation sites were necessary for ∼half of the phorbol ester-mediated potentiation of evoked and spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Phorbol esters, analogues of the membrane lipid product DAG, can activate several proteins including novel and conventional PKCs, Munc13-1, and other C1 domain containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Newton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brose and Rosenmund, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, it is expected that phorbol ester activation extends beyond the conventional, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PKCs that are activated during PTP (see Discussion above). Indeed, we have shown previously that ∼half of the phorbol ester potentiation of spontaneous release at the calyx synapse depended on an intact DAG binding site of Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lou et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, phorbol ester activates at least two parallel signaling pathways at the release machinery: on the one hand, Munc13-1 via direct binding to its C1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Betz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lou et al., 2008</xref>), and on the other hand PKC which then phosphorylates Munc18-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wierda et al., 2007</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The specificity of activation of conventional PKCs and phosphatases during PTP likely indicates the existence of signaling subcompartments in the presynaptic nerve terminal. Indeed, a recent proteomics study showed that various protein phosphatases and conventional PKCs are enriched at short distances to P/Q-type and N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2010</xref>), indicating a PKC–protein phosphatase signaling complex at the active zone.</p><p>How might phosphorylated Munc18-1 increase transmitter release during PTP? Munc18-1 was first described as a protein which tightly binds to Syntaxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pevsner et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dulubova et al., 1999</xref>). The binding of Munc18-1 to Syntaxin is thought to maintain the latter in a closed state not amenable to SNARE complex formation. An early study showed that the phosphorylated Munc18-1 has a reduced binding affinity for Syntaxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujita et al., 1996</xref>); thus, PKC phosphorylation could aid in the transition from a binary Munc18-1/Syntaxin complex to incorporation into SNARE complexes. However, it was shown later that Munc18-1 also binds to the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dulubova et al., 2007</xref>), and stimulates SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion in a reconstituted system, by binding to the partially assembled SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shen et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, Munc18-1 likely remains present at the partially formed SNARE complexes of docked and readily releasable vesicles; interestingly, Munc13-1 is also present in this complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). In this model, PKC phosphorylation of Munc18-1 would then increase the release probability of readily releasable vesicles, in what appears a ‘post-priming’ regulatory step of vesicle fusion (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>A ‘post-priming’ regulation of the fusion competence of docked vesicles during PTP is consistent with previous Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging data at the calyx synapse. It was shown that phorbol esters induce a shift and a decreased slope in the dose–response curve between transmitter release rate and presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lou et al., 2005</xref>); this modulation was reduced by PKC inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korogod et al., 2007</xref>). We could not apply Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging to study PTP, since PTP is not observed during presynaptic whole-cell recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korogod et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). To gain further insights into the mechanism of release modulation following Munc18-1 phosphorylation, we made use of a <italic>phosphomimetic</italic> mutation of Munc18-1, in which the S306 and S313 sites were changed to aspartate residues (called M18<sup>SD</sup> mutant). With this mutation, however, functionally rescued synapses were difficult to obtain, and synapses which were rescued showed significantly smaller EPSCs as compared to synapses rescued with M18<sup>WT</sup> and M18<sup>SA</sup> constructs (p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The M18<sup>SD</sup> mutant led to a block of PTP consistent with the role of PKC phosphorylation in PTP, but the paired-pulse ratio was not changed significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, while phosphorylation of Munc18-1 is required for PTP, mimicking its phosphorylation is not sufficient to cause a constitutive increase in release probability. We cannot rule out alternative explanations, like homeostatic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis, 2013</xref>) which could have reverted the increased release probability, or incorrect folding of the M18<sup>SD</sup> mutant protein; the latter might also be the reason for the lower rescue efficiency. Taken together, the M18<sup>SD</sup> mutant data do not allow us to further extend our model of how Munc18-1 phosphorylation by PKC leads to an increased transmitter release.</p><p>Munc18-1 is essential for vesicle fusion at synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Verhage et al., 2000</xref>), and Munc18-1 is expressed widely in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Website, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lein et al., 2007</xref>). However, PTP is probably not observed at all synapses in the brain, and target-cell specific differences in PTP mechanisms have been observed for hippocampal mossy fiber synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). A long-lasting residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, caused by mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and release mechanisms, is important for short-term enhancement of release including PTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamiya and Zucker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Regehr et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tang and Zucker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Habets and Borst, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korogod et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). It is possible that differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion mechanisms, as well as differential subcellular localization of members of the signaling complex downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, like conventional PKCs, determine the expression of PTP at a given synaptic connection.</p><p>Together with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wierda et al., 2007</xref>), our study implies that besides having an essential function for vesicle fusion, Munc18-1 can also modulate the release process following PKC phosphorylation. Our study identifies an important physiological context, post-tetanic potentiation, for this presynaptic regulatory pathway. We hypothesize that Munc18-1 is present at the partially formed SNARE complex of readily releasable vesicles, where it would exert a modulatory role on the fusion process, depending on its phosphorylation state. Future studies could investigate the role of Munc18-1 dependent presynaptic plasticity for information processing in neuronal networks, by making use of the PKC-insensitive mutation in transgenic mouse approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse breeding and stereotactic surgery</title><p>Protocols of animal experiments with mice and rats were approved by the Veterinary Office of the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland.

In these initial experiments, slices were made at 7–8 days following injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>).</p><p>The stereotactic coordinates were adjusted from the previously established VCN injections at P6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kochubey and Schneggenburger, 2011</xref>). Lambda was located through the skin, still transparent at P1, and the mouse head was aligned in a model 900 stereotactic instrument (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) for the lambda, and the point 3.7 mm anterior from lambda, being in one horizontal plane and lying on the longitudinal axis of the instrument. The skin and the skull were co-punctured at two points which were 0.3 and 0.9 mm posterior, and 1.57 mm lateral from lambda. The virus (0.2 µl per site) was injected with a 35G stainless steel needle (Coopers Needle Works, Birmingham, UK) inserted through the punctures, at three sites vertically spaced at 150 µm from each other (maximal depth, 4.0 mm from surface). The injection rate was 80 nl/min, using a SP120PZ syringe pump (WPI, Berlin, Germany) and a 10 µl syringe (Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland). The mice recovered from anesthesia in 10–20 min and were brought back to the mother.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>In vivo gene replacement strategy of Munc18-1</title><p>In order to replace the endogenous Munc18-1 protein of <italic>Munc18-1</italic><sup><italic>lox/lox</italic></sup> mice, we developed adenovirus vectors which, for the final experiments, were capable to drive the expression of three proteins: Munc18-1 (either in wild-type, or mutated form); Cre-recombinase; and GFP to label calyces of successfully transduced presynaptic neurons in the VCN (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A1–A3</xref>). The constructs were designed as follows. We used an open reading frame of a codon-optimized Cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gradinaru et al., 2010</xref>) which was placed downstream of an IRES sequence. The IRES sequence was preceded either by the GFP sequence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A2</xref>), or by the Munc18-1 sequence (splice variant b), in wild-type or mutated form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In the phosphorylation deficient mutant (M18<sup>SA</sup>), three serine residues 306, 312 and 313 were changed to alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wierda et al., 2007</xref>). In the phosphomimetic mutant, the serine residues S306 and S313 were changed to aspartate (called M18<sup>SD</sup> mutant; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; ‘Discussion’). All expression cassettes were under control of the neuron-specific human synapsin1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kügler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Young and Neher, 2009</xref>), were preceded by the Kozak sequence GCCACC, and followed by the SV40 polyadenylation signal.</p><p>A second-generation serotype 5 adenovirus system was used to deliver and drive the expression of the constructs in vivo. A shuttle vector pDC511 (Microbix Biosystems, Ontario, Canada) encoding eGFP-IRES-CreT cassette was used in combination with a custom-modified pBHGfrtΔ1, 3FLP adenovirus backbone (Microbix Biosystems) in which the gene 2a was also deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou and Beaudet, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Young and Neher, 2009</xref>). To enable simultaneous eGFP expression in rescue experiments, the shuttle vectors encoding for Munc18<sup>WT/SA</sup>-IRES-Cre cassettes were combined with a backbone carrying an additional hsyn:eGFP expression cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Young and Neher, 2009</xref>).

Final purification was done from the total lysate of 5 × 15 cm cell culture plates using Adenopack 100 RT kit (Sartorius, Aubagne, France) with the final buffer containing (in mM) 250 sucrose, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4, which typically resulted in ∼750 µl of injection-ready virus stock with 1–2·10<sup>12</sup> particles/ml titer (OD<sub>260</sub>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Slice electrophysiology</title><p>For the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref>, transverse slices of brainstem (200 µm) containing the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) were prepared from Wistar rats at P8–P10. For the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5">Figures 3–5</xref>, <italic>Munc18-1</italic><sup><italic>lox/lox</italic></sup> mice that had undergone stereotaxic surgery at P1, to express one of the above described expression constructs in the VCN, were used at P9–P12. We used the eGFP-fluorescence of calyces of Held to select for presynaptically transduced neurons using a monochromator (TILL Photonics; Gräfelfing, Germany) at an excitation wavelength of 470 nm, a filter set with a 470/30 bandpass excitation filter, Q495LP dichroic mirror, and dual-band eGFP+IR emission filters (AHF Analysentechnik, Tübingen, Germany). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from MNTB neurons, or from pairs of calyces of Held and MNTB neurons were made at room temperature (21–24°C) using an EPC-9/2 double patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). The microscope set-up was a BX-51WI upright microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), equipped with a 60×/0.9 NA water-immersion objective (Olympus), IR-DIC illumination system (Olympus) and an Andor iXon 885 EM-CCD camera (Andor Technology, Belfast, UK). In case of fiber stimulation experiments, afferent axonal fibers were stimulated with a custom-made platinum-iridium bipolar electrode, which was placed close to the midline of the brainstem slice. In these cases, MNTB neurons that were amenable to successful midline stimulation were pre-selected, by measuring the action current generated at the calyx of Held synapse in response to afferent stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borst et al., 1995</xref>). It is possible that by this procedure, we also selected for calyces of Held in which Munc18-1 function was rescued successfully, since calyces with little rescue might not respond to the afferent fiber test. During whole-cell recordings of postsynaptic MNTB neurons, the series resistance (R<sub>s</sub>; 3–10 MΩ) was compensated by up to 90%; the remaining R<sub>s</sub> error in postsynaptic currents was corrected offline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meyer et al., 2001</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) Both reviewers found that your work is of high interest and novel. It advances our understanding on the mechanisms of PTP, and identifies in Munc18 a downstream target of PKC in generating PTP. Both reviewers however also felt that knowledge about the effects of a phosphomimetic mutant would further strengthen your conclusion, and in addition being useful to distinguish whether phosphorylation of Munc18 is not only required but also sufficient to trigger the high release probability state. While we felt that additional experiments in this direction would be very desirable, they may take considerable additional time that would prevent you from timely publication. We would therefore leave it up to you whether you want to add these data that you may already have obtained, or discuss the limitations that are related to the lack of data on the phosphomimetic mutants.</p><p>2) You also compared calcium currents and found no significant difference when Munc18 was intact, removed or rescued in the Calyx of Held in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. While the unaltered EPSC amplitude suggests that, the result should be displayed, given that calcium current triggers transmitter release.</p><p>3) PTP was induced by brief pulses at 100 Hz for 4 s. This stimulus induces ∼15% increase in the mEPSC amplitude in rat and mouse calyx, as reported by Wu's group (2009) and Regehr's group (2011). Consequently, compound fusion is suggested to contribute to PTP. Please report the mEPSC amplitude in every group of data in this manuscript, and discuss your results in case they differ to previously published work in context of putative mechanisms (e.g., compound fusion).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01715.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>1) We would like to thank the editors and reviewers for their appreciation of our study. We have added the results of a phosphomimetic Munc18-1 mutation, in which the two PKC phosphorylation sites (Munc18-1 S306, S313) were changed to aspartate (called M18SD mutant). While the phosphomimetic mutation again interfered with PTP, it did not produce an increased release probability, as measured by paired-pulse ratio. This data is now added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>, and discussed in the text. While this data could indicate that Munc18-1 phosphorylation is necessary, but <italic>not sufficient</italic> to induce a high release probability state, we also observed that the rescue efficiency with this mutant was much lower than with the M18SA mutant, or the M18WT form. Therefore, we would like to restrain from drawing additional mechanistic conclusions based on this mutation, as discussed in more detail in the paper.</p><p>2) We think the Ca<sup>2+</sup> current results were already displayed in the previous version (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B1-B3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, now the same subpanels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, we now report the average values of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in the results text.</p><p>3) As requested, we now analyzed all PTP data sets for a possible increase of the mEPSC amplitude following the PTP induction trains. Except for the very first data set (control group of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the increase in mEPSC amplitudes following PTP induction trains did not reach statistical significance in all data sets of our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, while there might be a tendency for an increased mEPSC amplitude, this was not substantial with PTP induction trains of 100 Hz 4 s durations. This conclusion agrees with our original paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korogod et al., 2005</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and with the paper by Xue et al. (2010) showing that a substantial increase in mEPSC amplitude, probably caused by compound fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2009</xref>), occurs primarily with stronger PTP induction protocols (e.g., 100 Hz for 10 s).</p><p>We added the analysis of mEPSC frequency and mEPSC amplitude before and after PTP, under control conditions and in the presence of calyculin (new panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E-G</xref>). This analysis also reveals a persistent increase in the mEPSC frequency after PTP in the presence of calyculin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We moved the data previously contained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F-I</xref> (effect of the PKCi inhibitory peptide) to the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which now also displays the results with the phospholipase C blocker U73122 (previously shown as a supplementary v). We think that these changes have significantly improved the paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
