A subset of CGIs act as polycomb response elements (PREs) and are recognized by the polycomb silencing systems to regulate expression of genes involved in early development. How CGIs function mechanistically as nucleation sites for polycomb repressive complexes remains unknown. Here we discover that KDM2B (FBXL10) specifically recognizes non-methylated DNA in CGIs and recruits the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). This contributes to histone H2A lysine 119 ubiquitylation (H2AK119ub1) and gene repression. Unexpectedly, we also find that CGIs are occupied by low levels of PRC1 throughout the genome, suggesting that the KDM2B-PRC1 complex may sample CGI-associated genes for susceptibility to polycomb-mediated silencing. These observations demonstrate an unexpected and direct link between recognition of CGIs by KDM2B and targeting of the polycomb repressive system. This provides the basis for a new model describing the functionality of CGIs as mammalian PREs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00205.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00205.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00205.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Gene expression in eukaryotic cells can be controlled in a number of different ways, including various epigenetic mechanisms that do not involve making changes to DNA sequences that define the genes themselves. A well-known epigenetic mechanism for silencing genes in vertebrates is DNA methylation—the addition of a methyl group (CH<sub>3</sub>) to cytosine, which is one of the four bases found in the DNA. Methylation is thought to silence genes by preventing transcription factors from binding to the DNA, and also by recruiting proteins that inhibit the transcription of DNA.</p><p>DNA methylation occurs naturally throughout the genome, mostly at positions where cytosine is bonded to guanine to form a CpG dinucleotide. While the cytosine bases in most CpG dinucleotides are methylated, there are short stretches of DNA known as CpG islands that contain a high proportion of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides. These islands contain a large number of cytosine and guanine bases, and they are often found at or near transcription start sites.</p><p>The lack of methylation at CpG islands has long been assumed to have a passive role in gene expression, leaving the DNA easily accessible and available for transcription factors to bind and initiate transcription. However, recent work suggests that CpG islands may have a more active role. In particular, it has been shown that specific proteins bind to CpG islands to create chromatin environments that are more favourable for the initiation of gene expression. Moreover, a subset of CpG islands can also bind polycomb-group proteins, including the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) that silence gene expression. These complexes have an important role in the regulation of genes during early development in animals, but the mechanism by which PRC1 recognizes CpG islands in mammals has remained enigmatic.</p><p>Farcas et al. now reveal that a protein, KDM2B (FBXL10), can recognize CpG islands and recruit PRC1 to them. To achieve this, KDM2B encodes a DNA binding domain that specifically recognizes non-methylated CpG dinucleotides. By interacting biochemically with a variant PRC1 complex, KDM2B then nucleates PRC1 at CpG islands, and PRC1 activity silences certain polycomb target genes in embryonic stem cells. Surprisingly, Farcas et al. also find low but appreciable levels of PRC1 at most CpG islands genome-wide, in addition to the high levels of PRC1 at selected islands: this suggests that KDM2B may sample the whole genome to find CpG islands where PRC1 can establish silencing. An improved understanding of the polycomb repressive system, and the role of CpG islands within it, could lead to new insights into the role of epigenetic mechanisms in mammalian development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00205.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00205.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>CpG island</kwd><kwd>Chromatin</kwd><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>Transcription</kwd><kwd>Methylation</kwd><kwd>Demethylase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT0834922</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blackledge</surname><given-names>Neil P</given-names></name><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>Hannah K</given-names></name><name><surname>Klose</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UK Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sudbery</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name><name><surname>Sims</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Ponting</surname><given-names>Chris P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C28585/A10839</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farcas</surname><given-names>Anca M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lister institute of Preventive Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farcas</surname><given-names>Anca M</given-names></name><name><surname>Blackledge</surname><given-names>Neil P</given-names></name><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>Hannah</given-names></name><name><surname>Rose</surname><given-names>Nathan R</given-names></name><name><surname>Sheahan</surname><given-names>Thomas W</given-names></name><name><surname>Klose</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>RIKEN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koseki</surname><given-names>Haruhiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR), Oxford, UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McGouran</surname><given-names>Joanna F</given-names></name><name><surname>Kessler</surname><given-names>Benedikt M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT081385</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cerase</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name><name><surname>Brockdorff</surname><given-names>Neil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>St John's College, Oxford</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rose</surname><given-names>Nathan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A protein that can recognize regions of DNA with a high proportion of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, and then recruit polycomb group proteins to these CpG islands, has been identified.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The capacity to segregate and functionalize regulatory elements within large and complex vertebrate genomes relies on the activity of chromatin modifying and epigenetic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, it remains very poorly understood how the enzymes responsible for initiating these functional chromatin states are targeted to and recognize defined regions of the genome. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underpin these processes is becoming increasingly important given the mounting genetic evidence implicating misregulation of chromatin modifying activities in human disease and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Greer and Shi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Butler et al., 2012</xref>). In mammals, the majority of CpG dinucleotides are methylated on the 5 position of cytosine and this epigenetic modification can be stably transmitted across cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klose and Bird, 2006</xref>). DNA methylation is thought to be a highly stable modification that helps maintain intergenic and heterochromatic regions in a transcriptionally inert chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bird, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klose and Bird, 2006</xref>). A major exception to this pervasive methylation is short contiguous regions of the genome, called CpG islands (CGIs), which lack DNA methylation and are associated with roughly two-thirds of human gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Illingworth and Bird, 2009</xref>). It is thought that CGIs function to buffer gene regulatory elements from the repressive effects of surrounding DNA methylation and therefore play a central role in the regulatory capacity of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackledge and Klose, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although for the past two decades CGIs were considered to play a largely passive role in promoter and regulatory element function, we and others recently discovered that the non-methylated CpG dinucleotides found within CGIs act as a binding site for proteins that contain the ZF-CxxC DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackledge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thomson et al., 2010</xref>). ZF-CxxC domain-containing proteins are found in chromatin modifying complexes and therefore play an unexpected and proactive role in specifying unique chromatin modification architecture at CGI associated gene promoters. For example, the ZF-CxxC domain containing protein CFP1 is a core component of the SET1 histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee and Skalnik, 2005</xref>) and targets this transcriptionally permissive modification to CGIs genome-wide. Similarly, the KDM2A histone H3K36 demethylase enzyme contains a ZF-CxxC domain that targets the enzyme directly to CGIs where it removes histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) dimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackledge et al., 2010</xref>). In mammals H3K36me1/me2 is found broadly across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peters et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackledge et al., 2010</xref>) and may be inhibitory to transcriptional initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Strahl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carrozza et al., 2005</xref>). Specific targeting of KDM2A to CGIs appears to remove H3K36me2 at CGIs as part of a mechanism to mark these regions with transcriptionally permissive chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackledge et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, the targeting of these modifications to CGI associated gene promoters generally occurs independently of the transcriptional state of the associated gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackledge et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that ZF-CxxC mediated chromatin modifications function upstream of transcription to create a permissive chromatin environment at gene promoters and demarcate these regions from surrounding non-regulatory regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackledge and Klose, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deaton and Bird, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the majority of CGIs which are marked with a permissive chromatin architecture controlled by the ZF-CxxC dependent chromatin modification system, a subset of CGIs can exist in an alternative more repressed chromatin state. This is dictated by the action of the two central polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) in mammals, called PRC1 and PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Simon and Kingston, 2009</xref>). PRC1 complexes have E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that mono-ubiquitylates H2A on position 119 (H2AK119ub1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Napoles et al., 2004</xref>) and PRC2 complexes have histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Czermin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kuzmichev et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Müller et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast to the permissive and accessible chromatin state found at most CGIs, polycomb mediated chromatin modifications are thought to generate a more compact and inhibitory chromatin environment, limiting transcription of associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lavigne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Francis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eskeland et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which lack CGIs, polycomb repressive complexes are targeted to regions of the genome called polycomb response elements (PREs) through the action of transcription factors (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schuettengruber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ringrose and Paro, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Simon and Kingston, 2009</xref>)). Interestingly, in mammals this situation is very different in that PREs predominantly correspond to CGIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ku et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Woo et al., 2010</xref>) and there is mounting evidence that chromatin features specific to CGIs may play an important role in guiding PRC complexes to these particular regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mendenhall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kanhere et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lynch et al., 2012</xref>). At the mechanistic level, how CGIs can function as mammalian PREs remains unknown, constituting a major gap in our understanding of how CGIs are functionally linked to the polycomb repressive systems in mammals.</p><p>In addressing this question, here we demonstrate that KDM2B, a paralogue of KDM2A, plays an important role in targeting the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) to CGIs and regulating gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). This provides the first evidence linking direct recognition of CGIs with recruitment of a polycomb repressive complex in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KDM2B binds specifically to non-methylated CpG dinucleotides and associates with CGIs genome-wide</title><p>We recently demonstrated that the KDM2A protein binds to CpG islands genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackledge et al., 2010</xref>). However, its paralogue, KDM2B, was reported to be concentrated in the nucleolus. Therefore, to examine the properties of endogenous KDM2B and understand how it functions in comparison to KDM2A, an antibody against KDM2B was raised. In contrast to previous reports, we observe that KDM2B is distributed throughout the nucleus and excluded from nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on these observations, and considering that KDM2B also encodes a ZF-CxxC domain, we set out to examine whether KDM2B had a similar role to KDM2A in binding non-methylated DNA and CGIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackledge et al., 2010</xref>). In agreement with previous work, recombinant KDM2B was found to bind non-methylated DNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koyama-Nasu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamagishi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackledge et al., 2012</xref>) in a manner that is comparable to that of KDM2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). This suggests that KDM2B, like KDM2A, may recognize non-methylated DNA in vivo and bind CGI elements. To examine this possibility a chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis was carried out to determine the binding profiles of KDM2A and KDM2B genome-wide in mouse ESCs. A visual inspection of these profiles suggests that both KDM2A and KDM2B localize to promoter associated CGIs and are excluded from non-CGI associated promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). When KDM2A and KDM2B ChIP-seq signal was plotted over all transcription start sites (TSSs) that had been segregated based on their classification as CGI or non-CGI associated there was a very specific enrichment of both KDM2A and KDM2B at the CGI associated class of transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, when KDM2A and KDM2B signal was plotted over all CGIs, including those away from gene promoters, there was a very specific spatial localization of both proteins at CGIs with signal intensity peaking at the centre of the island (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Together these observations demonstrate in vivo that KDM2A and B are both bound to CGIs genome-wide.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00205.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>KDM2B binds to non-methylated CpG DNA and localises to CGIs genome-wide.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrating that the recombinant KDM2B ZF-CxxC domain binds to a DNA probe containing non-methylated CpGs (left panel) in a concentration-dependent manner.

In mammals, there are two general polycomb repressive complexes (PRC) called PRC1 and PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Czermin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kuzmichev et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Müller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Levine et al., 2002</xref>). Previously, ChIP-seq based analysis has been used extensively to examine the location of PRC1 (via RING1B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>) and PRC2 (via EZH2) genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peng et al., 2009</xref>). Using this information, KDM2A and KDM2B ChIP-seq was compared to the polycomb repressive complexes in mouse ESCs by examining the signal intensity around all CGI associated gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). From the heat maps it was immediately apparent that KDM2A and KDM2B bind in a seemingly equal manner to most CGI associated genes, but a subset of genes are specifically enriched for KDM2B and depleted of KDM2A. In keeping with the gene ontology analysis, the KDM2B enriched target genes segregate almost exclusively with genes enriched for polycomb repressive complex members RING1B and EZH2. Perhaps more surprisingly, the profile of the PRC1/2 components over CGI-associated target genes did not map precisely to the gene TSS but instead tracked with KDM2B binding and the underlying non-methylated DNA signal at these same regions. This striking spatial relationship is apparent at individual genes and also more generally when PRC1/2 components are examined at all polycomb bound genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together these observations suggest that KDM2B, unlike KDM2A and CFP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thomson et al., 2010</xref>), is enriched at polycomb associated CGIs. Furthermore, the clear spatial relationship between polycomb repressive proteins, KDM2B, and non-methylated DNA indicates there may be a mechanistic relationship between recognition of non-methylated DNA at CGIs and polycomb repressive complex nucleation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>KDM2B forms a variant PRC1 complex characterized by the PCGF1 subunit</title><p>Based on the clear enrichment of KDM2B at polycomb associated CGIs in ESCs in vivo, we sought to understand if KDM2B is part of a protein complex in ESCs that might contribute to this localization. To achieve this we isolated stable ESC lines expressing epitope-tagged KDM2B and carried out affinity purification from nuclear extract followed by mass spectrometry to identify associated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). To ensure that any identified interactions were not mediated through DNA or non-specific interactions with the affinity matrix, we also carried out parallel purifications in which the extract had been pre-treated with nuclease to remove any DNA contamination and from a cell line containing only the empty expression vector. In the purifications from extracts containing epitope-tagged KDM2B a series of proteins in addition to KDM2B were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). These included RING1B, YAF2, RYBP, PCGF1, BCOR, and BCORL1. Importantly RING1B is the E3 ubiquitin ligase that functions as the catalytic core of the PRC1 complex and is responsible for mono-ubiquitylation of H2A at position 119 (H2AK119ub1). To verify that endogenous KDM2B interacts with RING1B, KDM2B was immunoprecipitated from ESC nuclear extract and the presence of RING1B in the immunoprecipitates verified by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Therefore, KDM2B exists as part of a variant PRC1 complex in mouse embryonic stem cells. This observation is in agreement with recent work in cancer cell lines that identified KDM2B as part of a similar variant PRC1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gearhart et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sánchez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2012</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00205.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>KDM2B forms a variant PRC1 complex in mouse ESCs containing RING1B and PCGF1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) To purify KDM2B and associated proteins, a mouse ESC cell line stably expressing Flag-2XStrepII-tagged KDM2B was generated.

Nuclear extracts were prepared from each cell line, epitope-tagged factors were affinity purified, and the associated proteins identified by mass spectrometry. Importantly KDM2B was identified in all purifications validating the association between KDM2B and these PRC1 components. Recently it has become apparent that different PRC1 complexes form in a manner that is dependent on a central dimerization partner that interacts with the RING1A/B catalytic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). These dimerization partners, called polycomb group ring fingers (PCGFs), act as bridging molecules that convey unique subunit composition to RING1B containing complexes and are required for H2AK119ub1 catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Saadon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchwald et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). There are six characterized RING1B dimerization partners PCGF1 (NSPC1), PCGF2 (MEL18), PCGF3 (DONG1), PCGF4 (BMI1), PCGF5 (RNF159), and PCGF6 (MBLR). In purifying RING1B complexes we identified five of the six known PCGF subunits and most of the major auxiliary factors known to interact with these complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This supports previous observations that RING1B is the central enzymatic component of most PRC1 complexes in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Illingworth et al., 2012</xref>). Although YAF2 and RYBP were both identified in our KDM2B purification, when these proteins were purified independently it became apparent that they are also found in multiple other PCGF containing PRC1 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This indicates that both YAF2 and RYBP can form part of the KDM2B-PRC1 variant complex, but also function as part of other PRC1 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). YAF2 and RYBP are thought to interact directly with RING1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) suggesting that they are likely to be recruited to the KDM2B-PRC1 complex via RING1B. In the KDM2B purification the only PCGF identified was PCGF1, suggesting that this factor is unique to the KDM2B-PRC1 variant complex. When the PCGF1 complex was purified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) its composition was almost identical to the KDM2B complex, with the exception that it also included RING1A, an alternative catalytic core of PRC1 that is highly sequence-similar to RING1B but is expressed at greatly reduced levels in ESCs. Therefore, based on our detailed reciprocal complex purifications, KDM2B forms a PRC1 variant complex that includes BCOR, BCORL1, PCGF1, RING1, and YAF2 or RYBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Interestingly, in agreement with PRC1 purifications from cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2012</xref>), the PCGF1-containing complex associates with RYBP or YAF2 but fails to integrate chromobox domain-containing (CBX) proteins that recognize H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2004a</xref>). CBX proteins and RYBP/YAF2 are thought to interact with RING1B in a mutually exclusive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that PCGF1 may play an important role in specifying the capacity of RYBP and YAF2 to associate with RING1B in the KDM2B variant PRC1 complex. Importantly, the inclusion of KDM2B in a PRC1 complex in ESCs suggest that the relationship between KDM2B and polycomb repressed CGIs may be mediated through its direct interaction with PRC1 components.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>KDM2B relies on its ZF-CxxC domain and not its interaction with PRC1 to bind polycomb repressed CGIs</title><p>Both KDM2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and CFP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thomson et al., 2010</xref>) are inhibited from binding to polycomb repressed CGIs in vivo despite the presence of non-methylated CpG at these sites. This may be related to the compact nature of polycomb-repressed regions and the distinct requirement for the ZF-CxxC domain to bind accessible linker DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). However, KDM2B differs from KDM2A and CFP1 in that it is enriched at polycomb repressed CGIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Based on our biochemical purifications that indicate KDM2B in ESCs is part of a variant PRC1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), it remained possible that KDM2B was enriched at polycomb repressed CGIs via a ZF-CxxC domain independent mechanism relying on PRC1. To test this hypothesis we obtained mouse ESCs which lack RING1A and have a floxed allele of RING1B that can be conditionally removed by addition of the drug tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Endoh et al., 2008</xref>).

Therefore, we first isolated chromatin from wild type and RING1A/B deleted ESC cells and carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation for RING1B and KDM2B. As would be expected, there were high levels of RING1B at polycomb repressed CGI containing genes and the RING1B signal was lost following tamoxifen treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We then analysed the levels of KDM2B at a series of polycomb repressed and non-polycomb repressed CGI associated genes by ChIP and observed only small or no changes in KDM2B binding in the absence of RING1A/B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This suggests that an intact PRC1 complex is not required to target KDM2B to polycomb repressed sites in vivo.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00205.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>KDM2B ZF-CxxC DNA binding domain is required for CGI binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation showing removal of RING1B in ESC Ring1a<sup>−/−</sup> Ring1b<sup>fl/fl</sup> cells by tamoxifen treatment.

To test this hypothesis we generated stable ESC lines expressing either epitope tagged wild type KDM2B or a version of KDM2B containing a point mutation in the ZF-CxxC domain that ablates binding to CpG dinucleotides. We then isolated chromatin from these cell lines and analysed binding of exogenous KDM2B to CGI targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Importantly, WT KDM2B localized specifically to CGIs but a ZF-CxxC mutant failed to bind any class of CGI. This demonstrates that although KDM2B is part of a PRC1 complex its localisation to regular and polycomb repressed CGIs requires the recognition of non-methylated DNA via the ZF-CxxC domain. The capacity of KDM2B to target CGIs in the absence of PRC1 components suggests that KDM2B could function as targeting module for PRC1 and may contribute to polycomb mediated repression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Depletion of KDM2B leads to up-regulation of a subset of polycomb repressed target genes</title><p>Based on the clear enrichment of KDM2B at polycomb repressed genes and the inclusion of KDM2B in a PRC1 complex we examined whether depletion of KDM2B would affect the expression of polycomb repressed gene targets in mouse ESCs. To achieve this we stably knocked down KDM2B in ESCs using a lentiviral mediated shRNA approach. Knockdown was approximately by 80% at the RNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and there was a clear reduction of KDM2B at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Importantly, depletion of KMD2B did not result in destabilization of either the PRC1 or PRC2 complexes allowing us to specifically examine defects resulting from reduced KDM2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Microarray based gene expression profiling was then carried out to compare gene expression in the scrambled and KDM2B shRNA lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Gene expression profiling revealed a substantial number of expression changes with genes being both down-regulated and up-regulated. In total 653 genes changed expression by more than 1.5-fold: 329 had reduced gene expression and 324 had increased gene expression. Based on the association of KDM2B with polycomb repressed genes we then focussed in on the set of 324 genes that are up-regulated in the KDM2B depletion line. Interestingly 24% of these genes are characterized by RING1B occupancy. This is significantly greater than would be expected by chance (1.9-fold enrichment, hypergeometric p=1.3 × 10<sup>−8</sup>) and is similar to the percentage of up-regulated genes in the RING1B null ESC cells that are PRC1 targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leeb et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, when all gene expression changes are depicted in a volcano plot there is a clear propensity for RING1B occupied genes to have increased gene expression when KDM2B is depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In order to validate the observed up-regulation of polycomb targets in the KDM2B depletion cell lines we analysed a panel of 12 genes determined to be up-regulated based on the microarray using quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In this analysis we observed corresponding increases in transcription in the KDM2B depletion line at these polycomb targets. Together these findings indicate that as with the removal of RING1B, depletion of KDM2B leads to up regulation of a subset of polycomb repressed target genes in mouse embryonic stem cells.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00205.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>KDM2B depletion in ESCs results in the up-regulation of a subset of polycomb repressed target genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RT-PCR showing reduction of KDM2B at the mRNA level in the knockdown (KD) but not control cell line.

To examine this possibility we carried out ChIP-seq analysis for RING1B and KDM2B in the control and KDM2B knockdown cell lines. As expected KDM2B occupancy was greatly reduced in the knockdown cell line, in fitting with the global reduction of KDM2B at the RNA and protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Next we examined RING1B occupancy in the control cell line. We confirmed high levels of RING1B at previously identified RING1B sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> e.g. <italic>Atf3</italic> gene). Interestingly however, based on our highly optimized RING1B ChIP protocol we also observed a large number of lower magnitude binding events (‘novel’ sites) that did not correspond to sites previously characterized as being occupied by RING1B (‘established’ sites) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To verify that these are bona fide RING1B binding events we carried out conventional ChIP followed by quantitative PCR on a series of these novel peaks in cells where we can conditionally delete RING1B and observed a clear loss of RING1B signal following deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates these lower magnitude peaks correspond to novel RING1B binding events. Interestingly, 68% of the 15,740 newly identified RING1B binding sites overlapped with CGIs, and 77% of these were coupled to transcription start sites. Importantly, a minority of these novel RING1B occupied CGI sites showed detectable EZH2 (23%) or H3K27me3 (20%), indicating that these sites are largely devoid of appreciable PRC2. Including the already characterized RING1B associated CGIs, this means that clear RING1B peaks are detectable at nearly 70% of the 22,849 mouse CGIs genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Illingworth et al., 2010</xref>), and 88% of RING1B occupied CGIs also are bound by detectable levels of KDM2B.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00205.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Depletion of KDM2B causes a reduction in RING1B occupancy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) KDM2B ChIP-seq signal was plotted at CGIs in the control (solid blue line) and knockdown cell line (dotted blue line).

This revealed a specific reduction in RING1B signal at these sites following KDM2B knockdown in fitting with a role for KDM2B in RING1B targeting. This reduction in RING1B binding was evident when the ChIP-seq signal was visualized at individual target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) and similar changes in RING1B occupancy were observed by conventional ChIP q-PCR analysis at selected RING1B bound CGIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, at sites where RING1B occupancy was affected, loss of binding correlated with the underlying non-methylated DNA signal and KDM2B occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These observations indicate that depletion of KDM2B causes a loss of normal RING1B targeting at polycomb occupied CGI regions of the genome, in accordance with the observed reactivation of a subset of polycomb repressed genes in the KDM2B knockdown line.</p><p>Based on the observation that RING1B is more widely associated with CGI elements than previously appreciated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), we next examined whether KDM2B contributes to RING1B binding at these novel sites by plotting RING1B signal in the control and KDM2B knockdown cell lines over these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,F</xref>). Interestingly, depletion of KDM2B resulted in an even more dramatic effect on RING1B occupancy at these novel low magnitude sites, suggesting that these RING1B binding events are more dependent on KDM2B. Importantly, the observed reduction in RING1B occupancy at high and low magnitude sites was not due to destabilization of polycomb repressive systems, as the protein levels of both PRC1 and PRC2 components were similar in the wild type and KD cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Together these observations indicate that KDM2B plays a widespread role in targeting RING1B in vivo both at previously identified established polycomb-repressed CGI-associated genes and a novel class of lower magnitude RING1B occupied CGI sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>KDM2B is required for normal H2AK119ub1 levels</title><p>A major function of the PRC1 complexes is to mono-ubiquitylate histone H2A on position 119 (H2AK119ub1) and this activity is essential for PRC1 mediated gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Endoh et al., 2012</xref>). A monoclonal antibody for H2AK119ub1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vassilev et al., 1995</xref>) has been widely used to evaluate H2AK119ub1 in vivo. Unfortunately, this antibody performs poorly under some experimental conditions, notably chromatin immunoprecipitation.

Interestingly reductions in H2AK119ub1 appeared to be restricted to the polycomb target CGIs that were up-regulated in the absence of KMD2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This also correlated with a more subtle reduction in H3K27me3 but largely unchanged levels of H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This suggests that although KDM2B plays a role in the nucleation of RING1B at most polycomb associated CGIs, the level of RING1B reduction at individual genes likely dictates the effects on H2AK119ub1 and gene expression. This is in accordance with the recent observation that H2AK119ub1 is important for gene repression mediated by PRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Endoh et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the level of H2AK119ub1 reduction at individual loci did not appear as dramatic as the global reductions observed by western blotting. One possibility for this difference may be that pervasive KDM2B dependent targeting of PRC1 to CGIs leads to low level deposition of H2AK119ub1 away from established polycomb sites. One can envisage how loss of KDM2B would more dramatically affect this additional pool of H2AK119ub1 resulting in significant global reduction in its abundance. Together these observations suggest that some polycomb repressed sites rely more specifically on KDM2B mediated RING1B occupancy for normal H2AK119ub1 and polycomb mediated gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Endoh et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we demonstrate that KDM2B recognizes CGI elements via its ZF-CxxC domain and in contrast to its paralogue, KDM2A, is preferentially enriched at polycomb-repressed CGIs in mouse ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). By virtue of its physical association with a variant PRC1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and through the functionality of its ZF-CxxC domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), KDM2B is required for normal targeting of the catalytic component of the PRC1 complex, RING1B, to CGI elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Depletion of KDM2B results in a reduction of RING1B at polycomb repressed CGIs and leads to diminished global H2AK119ub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This causes reactivation of a subset of polycomb repressed target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Surprisingly, we also uncover a more widespread association of RING1B with CGIs that is also dependent on KDM2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Together these observations provide an unexpected and direct link between CGIs, recognition of non-methylated DNA by KDM2B, and binding of the PRC1 complex to target sites in vivo.</p><p>The mechanisms underpinning how polycomb repressive complexes are recruited to target sites in mammals have remained largely elusive, with the exception that CGIs appear to function as the mammalian equivalent of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> polycomb response element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Simon and Kingston, 2009</xref>). In most species PRC1 is thought to be mechanistically recruited in a hierarchical manner through chromo-domain mediated recognition of H3K27 methylation at pre-existing PRC2 modified sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Min et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2004b</xref>). This largely places PRC1 as a subservient reader of silencing events initiated by PRC2. However, the singularity of the hierarchal recruitment mechanism has recently been challenged by a series of elegant experiments in mammals demonstrating that although genetic perturbation of the PRC2 complexes reduces PRC1 localization to polycomb repressed CGIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>), H3K27 independent PRC1 targeting mechanisms are sufficient to maintain H2AK119ub1 and repression at many PRC1 bound targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schoeftner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pasini et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leeb et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>). The specific molecular mechanisms underpinning H3K27me3 independent PRC1 targeting nevertheless remain unclear. For example, a PRC1 variant complex containing RYBP and lacking chromobox domain-containing proteins appears to be involved in this process but it is unclear how RYBP would achieve specificity for polycomb targets as it has no inherent chromatin or DNA binding specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrigoni et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neira et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hisada et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore RYBP depletion appears to destabilize the RING1B protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>), reducing the effective pool of the enzyme and making it difficult to determine the specific contribution of RYBP to targeting.</p><p>Based on our observations that KDM2B is important for RING1B binding to CGI elements, the KDM2B-PRC1 complex provides an alternative mechanism for PRC1 recognition of polycomb repressed CGIs in mammals. KDM2B forms a variant PRC1 complex lacking CBX proteins but interestingly contains RYBP or the related YAF2 protein. In contrast to depletion of RYBP, reduction of KDM2B did not destabilize RING1B, allowing us to demonstrate that KDM2B contributes to the localization of RING1B to target sites in vivo. This targeting event appears to play an important role in the repression of a subset of polycomb target genes through H2AK119 ubiquitylation. Together these observations provide the first mechanistic evidence for the existence of a PRC1 targeting pathway that does not rely on recognition of H3K27me3 but instead interrogates the underlying non-methylated DNA sequence present at CGIs. Based on this work we propose an alternative to the hierarchical model of PRC1 targeting whereby CGIs are recognized by a variant PRC1 complex containing KDM2B through direct binding to non-methylated DNA. Other direct recognition mechanisms based on interactions between site specific DNA binding transcription factors and PRC1 have recently been identified further supporting the concept that DNA information at polycomb repressed sites is important for PRC1 targeting in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ren and Kerppola, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dietrich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Together, the hierarchical recruitment system and alternative direct targeting mechanisms likely function in a complementary and in some cases redundant fashion at many polycomb targets in vivo. This is supported by the observation that KDM2B depletion in embryonic stem cells results in up-regulation of only a subset of PRC1 target genes. Therefore, one can envision that polycomb repression, which must be maintained over cell divisions and developmental time scales, may rely on the combined activity of these separate pathways as an important stability component for maintenance of the silenced state.</p><p>KDM2B is enriched at polycomb repressed sites in vivo, but genome-wide analysis revealed it is also more broadly associated with CGIs. Based on this observation, an interesting question remains regarding how KDM2B specifically contributes to PRC1 recognition of polycomb targets, while also binding to CGIs throughout the genome. Our surprising observation that RING1B is detectable at nearly 70% of all CGIs is supportive of a model whereby KDM2B may act as a sampling module allowing PRC1 to be recruited at very low levels to most or all CGIs by virtue of its capacity to recognize CGIs. This would then imply that productive PRC1 enrichment and polycomb mediated silencing is in turn only achieved at a subset of these sampled targets. Fittingly, novel RING1B associated CGIs do not differ in expression from the average gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), whereas established polycomb CGIs show reduced expression. This is largely in agreement with recent mechanistic work in mammalian systems studying the capacity of CGIs to attract polycomb mediated repression, where it has been suggested that the default state for CGIs is indeed to acquire polycomb mediated silencing but local chromatin features and other activating marks appear to function to counteract this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mendenhall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lynch et al., 2012</xref>). Conceptually this parallels the long held view from genetic and molecular studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that indicate a continual antagonism exists between the function of positively acting trithorax chromatin modifying systems and repressive polycomb systems at PREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Poux et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klymenko and Müller, 2004</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, ultimately this balance is resolved by the local activity of transcriptional regulators. In analogy to the situation at <italic>Drosophila</italic> PREs, the KDM2B-PRC1 complex may therefore function to continually recruit PRC1 to CGIs at low levels but ultimately only establish the fully PRC1/PRC2 occupied and polycomb repressed state if the appropriate local chromatin and transcriptional environment is met. It is tempting to speculate that PRC1, and perhaps even PRC2 via its poorly characterized DNA binding components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2010</xref>), may be continually interfacing CGIs in a dynamic manner in order to constantly sample their susceptibility to polycomb repression. Once the conditions are met for polycomb mediated silencing, one can envision a simple feed forward loop may exist where the combined activities of PRC1 and PRC2 stabilize each other through canonical PRC1 complexes that contain CBX proteins recognising H3K27me3 placed by PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2004b</xref>) and PRC2 activity favouring the increasingly compacted chromatin state associated with PRC1 occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Francis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eskeland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>). This could account for the remarkable spatial correlation between mammalian polycomb repression domains and CGIs at established polycomb repressed sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ku et al., 2008</xref>). This speculative model is appealing as it would in part explain the co-occupancy of PRC1 and PRC2 at most established polycomb sites in vivo and could reconcile why only certain CGIs are susceptible to acquiring full polycomb complex nucleation and silencing in vivo.</p><p>In order to fully realize the complexities and interplay between polycomb silencing activities, more detailed molecular and biochemical understanding of this system is clearly required. For example, our study has focussed on ESCs where polycomb factors are highly abundant, so it will be imperative to understand if similar KDM2B dependent PRC1 targeting mechanisms function in more committed cell types. Also, it is known that H3K27me3 and CBX dependent PRC1 targeting activities play an important role in RING1B occupancy. Therefore, KDM2B dependent targeting of the PCGF1-PRC1 complex on its own is insufficient to account for the functionality of PRC1 in vivo. This suggests that a complex set of PRC1 targeting mechanisms, perhaps utilizing specific PRC1 complexes, and based on both direct and indirect recognition of CGI associated sites is required for normal PRC1 function. In agreement with this idea, knockdown of KDM2B leads to reactivation of only a subset of polycomb repressed genes. Although this may be due to incomplete removal of KDM2B by RNAi, it may also be related to compensatory function of other PRC1 complexes. Nevertheless, our demonstration that KDM2B links PRC1 to recognition of CGIs provides an important new piece of the puzzle and demonstrates for the first time a direct mechanism for polycomb recognition of CGIs elements in vivo. Importantly, it also provides a novel conceptual framework on which to consider initiation of polycomb mediated silencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA constructs</title><p>The full length human KDM2B, mouse RING1B, mouse YAF2 (IMAGE clone 3488691), human PCGF1 (IMAGE clone 3621400), mouse RYBP (IMAGE clone 8861345) were PCR-amplified and inserted via ligation independent cloning (LIC) into a pCAG-IRES-puro eukaryotic expression vector that has been modified to express a N-terminal Flag and 2XStrep2 tag and contain LIC cloning sites.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Kevin Struhl, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports.</p><p>Repression by polycomb complexes is of high biological importance yet is not well understood mechanistically. An important question, particularly in mammalian cells, is how Pc complexes are recruited to specific sites. Here, the authors provide evidence that the histone demethylase KDM2B recruits the PRC1 complex to CpG islands. The reviewers agree that the work is interesting and the manuscript is acceptable in principle for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. No new experiments are needed. However, it is essential to address the following comments in the text:</p><p>* What are H3K36 demethylases doing at sites not expected to contain H3K36 methylation?</p><p>* Is this recruitment mechanism typical or is it specific for ESC cells?</p><p>* What excludes KDM2A from Polycomb target CGIs?</p><p>* What PRC1 protein(s) does KDM2B interact with? With what protein domain? Why does it not recruit CBX-containing complexes?</p><p>* Only a small subset of KDM2B binding sites are also occupied by RING1B so other features or factors must be involved in the recruitment of PRC1. Please discuss them.</p><p>* How is PRC2 recruited to KDM2B/RING1B sites? It seems to be there according to Figure 2, for example. Is a CBX protein associated with these sites? Is there H3K27me3 associated with KDM2B/RING1B binding sites?</p><p>* It is unclear why, if KDM2B is required for all Ring1b binding sites, loss of KDM2B only derepresses a very small subset. If Ring1b is found at 70% of all genomic CpG islands, it must be found also at sites that bind KDM2A. Does RING1B antagonize binding of KDM2A? Does KDM2A now bind to these CpG islands when no PRC1 is present?</p><p>* Without a mechanism to recruit PRC2 to the same sites, the model is not very explanatory. Furthermore, nothing was said about recruitment of CBX-containing PRC1. Evidently these are not recruited by KDM2B. So there are several links missing in the causal chain in the scenario proposed, which should be accounted for.</p><p>* How are Polycomb-repressed target genes identified? By the binding of Ring1b? By H3K27me3?</p><p>* The loss of H2Aub even from those genes that are supposed to be derepressed after KDM2B knockdown is not impressive: in most cases it is no more than 20% lower. That means that the 40% loss in global H2Aub is not concentrated in these genes and suggests that KDM2B plays a minor role in recruiting some kind of PRC1. Things are even worse at PcG target CGIs that do not become derepressed.</p><p>* There continues to be a misguided insistence on the assumption that binding PRC1 automatically compacts chromatin, although in ES cells it is clear that many binding sites are the typical bivalent sites that also have methylated H3K4 and bind RNA polymerase.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00205.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>In responding to the reviewers’ comments about some of the overlaps between CpG islands (CGIs) and PRC1/2 intervals we noticed that the published CGI dataset (Illingworth et al 2010) used throughout our study had a small number of CGI intervals (172 out 23021) that overlapped. Therefore these overlapping intervals should have been considered as one individual interval, effectively reducing the total number of CGIs in the dataset from 23021 to 22849. For the sake of accuracy we have merged these overlapping CGI intervals in the resubmission. This does not affect our interpretation or observations, but this did necessitate redrawing Figure 2A and B. The changes in Figure 2A are not visible by eye but we wanted to make you aware that this figure had been redrawn since the original submission.</p><p><italic>* What are H3K36 demethylases doing at sites not expected to contain H3K36 methylation</italic>?</p><p>KDM2A and B are histone demethylases that remove the H3K36me1/me2 modifications. In mammals our ChIP analysis (Blackledge NP et al 2010) indicates that the H3K36me1/me2 modifications cover most of the genome and global mass spectrometry suggests H3K36me1/me2 is found on up to ∼60% of all histone H3 (Peters AH et al 2003 and Robin P et al 2007). Interestingly, there is a specific reduction in H3K36me1/me2 at CpG island regions and we recently showed that demethylation by KDM2A contributes to this depletion (Blackledge NP et al 2010). This suggests that a certain amount of H3K36me1/me2 is placed at CGIs but is then actively removed by targeting of demethylase activity. This may function as a way of protecting these CGI associated gene promoter regions from the inhibitory effects of H3K36me1/me2, which is proposed to counteract transcription (Strahl BD et al 2002 and Carrozza MJ et all 2005). We have now included a section in the introduction to clarify this point as follows:</p><p>‘In mammals H3K36me1/me2 is found broadly across the genome […] and may be inhibitory to transcriptional initiation […]. Specific targeting of KDM2A to CGIs appears to remove H3K36me2 at CGIs as part of a mechanism to mark these regions with transcriptionally permissive chromatin.’</p><p><italic>* Is this recruitment mechanism typical or is it specific for ESC cells</italic>?</p><p>We think that this recruitment mechanism will also function in other cell types as KDM2B has been identified in purifications of PRC1 from human and mouse cancer cell lines. However, we have not formally tested this possibility. Therefore, we have added a section to the discussion that brings attention to this point:</p><p>‘In order to fully realize the complexities and interplay between polycomb silencing activities, more detailed molecular and biochemical understanding of this system is clearly required. For example, our study has focussed on ESCs where polycomb factors are highly abundant, so it will be imperative to understand if similar KDM2B dependent PRC1 targeting mechanisms function in more committed cell types.’</p><p><italic>* What excludes KDM2A from Polycomb target CGIs</italic>?</p><p>Our recent work demonstrated that KDM2A requires accessible linker DNA to associate with chromatin in vitro and in vivo (Zhou et al 2012). Based on these observations, one possibility may be that linker DNA is more occluded at CGIs with high levels of polycomb occupancy. We discuss this in the results section titled ‘KDM2B relies on its ZF-CxxC domain and not its interaction with PRC1 to bind polycomb repressed CGIs’. In future studies we aim to understand in detail the molecular nature of this exclusion.</p><p><italic>* What PRC1 protein(s) does KDM2B interact with? With what protein domain? Why does it not recruit CBX-containing complexes</italic>?</p><p>Future work is planned to map in detail the protein interactions within the KDM2B-PRC1 variant complex, but this is outside the scope of the current manuscript. Our work in mouse ES cells and recently published work from the Reinberg lab using human cancer cell lines indicate that individual PCGF factors may dictate the capacity of the RING1B subunit in PRC1 complexes to associate with either the RYBP/YAF2 or CBX factors. The molecular/structural explanation for these differences remains unknown. To highlight the lack of CBX proteins in the KDM2B variant PRC1 complex in embryonic stem cells and to draw attention to the potential role of PCGF1 in specifying this, we have added the following statement to the results section describing Figure 3:</p><p>‘Interestingly, in agreement with PRC1 purifications from cancer cell lines […], the PCGF1-containing complex associates with RYBP or YAF2 but fails to integrate chromobox domain-containing (CBX) proteins that recognize H3K27me3 […]. CBX proteins and RYBP/YAF2 are thought to interact with RING1B in a mutually exclusive manner. This suggests that PCGF1 may play an important role in specifying the capacity of RYBP and YAF2 to associate with RING1B in the KDM2B variant PRC1 complex.’</p><p><italic>* Only a small subset of KDM2B binding sites are also occupied by RING1B so other features or factors must be involved in the recruitment of PRC1. Please discuss them</italic>.</p><p>Some CGIs appear to have high levels of PRC1 occupancy (‘established’ polycomb targets). Interestingly, we discover that there is also low but appreciable levels of RING1B at over 70% of CGIs, and we refer to these as ‘novel’ low magnitude PRC1 occupied sites. Therefore most KDM2B bound CGIs also show PRC1 occupancy (i.e., not a small subset). This is in fitting with the physical association between KDM2B and the PRC1 variant complex. As suggested by the reviewers, there are other mechanisms that contribute to PRC1 targeting and we cover these extensively in the discussion including; (1) The hierarchal recruitment mechanism based on CBX protein dependent recognition of H3K27me3, (2) The potential involvement of RYBP through poorly defined molecular mechanisms, and (3) the direct targeting of PRC1 by transcription factors like REST and GATA1.</p><p><italic>* How is PRC2 recruited to KDM2B/RING1B sites? It seems to be there according to Figure 2, for example. Is a CBX protein associated with these sites? Is there H3K27me3 associated with KDM2B/RING1B binding sites</italic>?</p><p>It is still unclear how PRC2 is recruited to polycomb targets and CGIs, and we don’t attempt to address this question in this study. We have now analysed a published CBX7 ChIP-seq data in ES cells and observe very little overlap of CBX7 with novel RING1B occupied CGIs. Although this suggests that CBX7 is largely absent, we have not included this analysis, as the signal to noise in these published ChIP-seq experiments is not sufficient in our opinion to accurately identify intervals. We have however analysed the overlap with EZH2 with novel RING1B CGIs (which are mostly occupied by KDM2B) and observe that only 23% of these novel sites are occupied by detectable levels of EZH2 and 20% with H3K27me3. We have now stated this in the results section as follows:</p><p>‘Importantly, a minority of these novel RING1B occupied CGI sites showed detectable EZH2 (23%) or H3K27me3 (20%), indicating that these sites are largely devoid of appreciable PRC2.’</p><p><italic>* It is unclear why, if KDM2B is required for all Ring1b binding sites, loss of KDM2B only derepresses a very small subset</italic>.</p><p>This is a very interesting point. One possibility that would explain the reactivation of only a small number of polycomb target genes is that the shRNA based knockdown of KDM2B results in a hypomorphic situation. This may lead to a reactivation of a subset of genes that are most sensitive to PRC1 levels. Another possibility is that silencing at ‘established’ polycomb repressed genes is only partially sensitive to the loss of KDM2B due to the compensatory effects of other PRC1 complexes. In future work, null alleles for KDM2B will aid in answering these questions more definitively. Nevertheless we have added a section to the discussion to address this point more directly:</p><p>‘[…] knockdown of KDM2B leads to reactivation of only a subset of polycomb repressed genes. Although this may be due to incomplete removal of KDM2B by RNAi, it may also be related to compensatory function of other PRC1 complexes.‘</p><p><italic>If Ring1b is found at 70% of all genomic CpG islands, it must be found also at sites that bind KDM2A. Does RING1B antagonize binding of KDM2A? Does KDM2A now bind to these CpG islands when no PRC1 is present</italic>?</p><p>ChIP-seq analysis indicates that enrichment of KDM2A, KDM2B, and PRC1 can be detected at many CGIs. We are unsure if RING1B directly antagonizes KDM2A binding to CGIs. We agree this is an interesting question and future work is planned to examine in more detail the relationship between KDM2A and PRC1 (RING1B), particularly at the molecular and biochemical level.</p><p><italic>* Without a mechanism to recruit PRC2 to the same sites, the model is not very explanatory. Furthermore, nothing was said about recruitment of CBX-containing PRC1. Evidently these are not recruited by KDM2B. So there are several links missing in the causal chain in the scenario proposed, which should be accounted for</italic>.</p><p>We agree that KDM2B dependent targeting of PRC1 is on its own not sufficient to explain the full functionality of PRC1 complexes in vivo and the over all activity of PRC1/2 at ‘established’ polycomb repressed sites as indicated by the reviewers. We attempted to make this clear in the initial submission by discussing the CBX dependent hierarchical mode of targeting which highlights the fact that other mechanisms exist to target PRC1. To make this point more clear in the resubmission, and specifically draw attention to the fact that KDM2B is insufficient to account for the ‘causal chain’ of events required for PRC1 dependent activity in vivo, we have now added a section to the discussion covering this important point more succinctly:</p><p>‘Also, it is known that H3K27me3 and CBX dependent PRC1 targeting activities play an important role in RING1B occupancy. Therefore, KDM2B dependent targeting of the PCGF1-PRC1 complex on its own is insufficient to account for the functionality of PRC1 in vivo. This suggests that a complex set of PRC1 targeting mechanisms, perhaps utilizing specific PRC1 complexes, and based on both direct and indirect recognition of CGI associated sites is required for normal PRC1 function.’</p><p><italic>* How are Polycomb-repressed target genes identified? By the binding of Ring1b? By H3K27me3</italic>?</p><p>This is a very important question and is not resolved by our study. Therefore, we speculate in our discussion that KDM2B may contribute a sampling mechanism that brings PRC1 to CGIs and the local balance of activators/repressors may define whether polycomb can ‘establish’ silencing. This general principle is in agreement with the suggested function of PREs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which are regulated by a balance between trithorax and polycomb activities.</p><p><italic>* The loss of H2Aub even from those genes that are supposed to be derepressed after KDM2B knockdown is not impressive: in most cases it is no more than 20% lower. That means that the 40% loss in global H2Aub is not concentrated in these genes and suggests that KDM2B plays a minor role in recruiting some kind of PRC1. Things are even worse at PcG target CGIs that do not become derepressed</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the effects of KDM2B depletion on uH2A levels at ‘established’ polycomb repressed CGIs are modest and that the largest changes occur at reactivated genes. As the reviewers point out, this is interesting as the global levels of uH2A reduction seem to be much more dramatic (40%). We speculate that this may be related to uH2A being placed at low but significant levels at PRC1 associated CGIs that don’t have ‘established’ polycomb repression (i.e., ‘novel’ RING1B sites). We have now added a statement to clarify this in the results section:</p><p>‘Interestingly, the level of uH2A reduction at individual loci did not appear as dramatic as the global reductions observed by western blotting. One possibility for this difference may be that pervasive KDM2B dependent targeting of PRC1 to CGIs leads to low level deposition of uH2A away from established polycomb sites. One can envisage how loss of KDM2B would more dramatically affect this additional pool of uH2A resulting in significant global reduction in its abundance.’</p><p><italic>* There continues to be a misguided insistence on the assumption that binding PRC1 automatically compacts chromatin, although in ES cells it is clear that many binding sites are the typical bivalent sites that also have methylated H3K4 and bind RNA polymerase</italic>.</p><p>We use the term compact(ed) three times in the manuscript. In the first two instances it is to describe the published observations that PRC1 occupied chromatin is compact. This is supported by in vivo work using DNA based fluorescent in site hybridization (Eskeland R et al 2010) and in vitro observations that PRC1 compacts chromatin (Francis NJ et al 2004). The third instance, which is found in the discussion, has now been reworded. Previously we said in discussing a speculative model for polycomb activity that, PRC2 might favour ‘the increasingly compacted chromatin state <italic>created by</italic> PRC1 occupancy’. We have now revised this to read: ‘favouring the increasingly compacted chromatin state <italic>associated with</italic> PRC1 occupancy’. We believe it is important and reasonable to discuss the concept that chromatin compaction may be related to PRC1 function at CGIs, but agree with the reviewers that the published literature indicates that a compacted state is ‘associated with’ as opposed to ‘created by’ PRC1 occupancy.</p></body></sub-article></article>
