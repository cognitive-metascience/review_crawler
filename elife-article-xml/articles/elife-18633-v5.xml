Although most integrins contain β1, canonical activation mechanisms are based on studies of the platelet integrin, αIIbβ3. Its inactive conformation is characterized by the association of the αIIb transmembrane and cytosolic domain (TM/CT) with a tilted β3 TM/CT that leads to activation when disrupted. We show significant structural differences between β1 and β3 TM/CT in bicelles. Moreover, the ‘snorkeling’ lysine at the TM/CT interface of β subunits, previously proposed to regulate αIIbβ3 activation by ion pairing with nearby lipids, plays opposite roles in β1 and β3 integrin function and in neither case is responsible for TM tilt. A range of affinities from almost no interaction to the relatively high avidity that characterizes αIIbβ3 is seen between various α subunits and β1 TM/CTs. The αIIbβ3-based canonical model for the roles of the TM/CT in integrin activation and function clearly does not extend to all mammalian integrins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18633.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18633.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18633.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins called integrins span the membranes of most human cells, and help our cells to interact with their surroundings, enabling them to organise, communicate and to form a variety of structures. Cells in different parts of the body typically produce different integrins so that they can specifically connect with other cells and proteins in their local environment. There are many different kinds of integrin proteins found in cell membranes and they consist of one alpha and one beta subunit.</p><p>Different integrin pairs can have different effects based on their environment and the other molecules that they encounter. Much of the research into how integrins work has involved one specific integrin found in platelets – cells in blood that aid clotting and wound repair. Yet, it is unknown if all integrins actually operate in the same way as the platelet integrin.</p><p>Lu, Mathew, Chen et al. studied the part of integrins that are located inside cells (referred to as the cytoplasmic tail) and the part that crosses the membrane (the transmembrane domain). Three-dimensional structures of these parts of the proteins showed that they varied between different beta integrin proteins. Further experiments revealed that the strength of the association between different alpha and beta integrins also varied. Finally Lu, Mathew, Chen et al. demonstrated that components shared by several beta integrins actually have different purposes in different contexts.</p><p>The diversity of structures and interactions within the group of integrin proteins suggests that integrins are likely to behave very differently in different cells. This means that platelet integrins cannot be used to fully understand the activity of all other types of integrin. More work is now needed to understand how the differences between integrins affect the roles that they fulfil and the molecules that they interact with. A deeper understanding of the differences between integrins could ultimately shape the development of strategies to specifically target them to treat a range of diseases – such as cancer and diseases in which there is a build-up of fibrous connective tissue.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

principal receptors of cells for the extracellular matrix (ECM) and are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins consisting of α and β subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hynes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mathew et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pozzi and Zent, 2013</xref>). The 18 α and 8 β integrin subunits associate non-covalently to form 24 heterodimeric integrins, which are expressed in different combinations on all cell types throughout the body. All integrin subunits, except β4, have a large extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane domain (TM) that spans the cell membrane and a short cytosolic C-terminal domain (CT) that regulates integrin function by binding with cytoskeletal and signaling proteins. β1 integrins, in which the β1 subunit can be paired with any one of 12 different α isoforms, are the principal integrins found in solid organs.</p><p>For integrins to mediate cell adhesion to the ECM and transduce signals from the outside to the inside of the cell and vice-versa they must be able to respond to ligand binding and must also be modulatable in terms of ligand binding affinity. The paradigm for regulation of integrin affinity is set by the platelet-specific integrin αIIbβ3 found in the inactive state under normal conditions and activated to mediate platelet adhesion to fibrinogen following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xiao et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coller and Shattil, 2008</xref>). In the low affinity ‘inactive’ state integrin αIIbβ3 has a bent conformation that is stabilized by an outer clasp involving contacts between αIIb and β3 located near the middle and ectoplasmic ends of their TMs and an inner clasp involving αIIb/β3 contacts located in the cytosolic juxtamembrane domains, the latter of which includes a critical salt bridge. Within the inactive state heterodimer, the αIIb transmembrane helix is thought be reasonably well-aligned with the bilayer, while the long TM helix of β3 is thought to have a pronounced (25°) tilt angle that is required to maintain simultaneous formation of the outer and inner clasps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>It has been proposed that the tilt of the β3 TM in the inactive state is promoted by a ‘snorkeling’ interaction of the side chain ε-NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> moiety of the membrane-buried lysine-716 with a negatively charged lipid phosphodiester group located at the adjacent membrane-water interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Following platelet activation, integrin αIIbβ3 is converted to a high affinity state that is mediated by the binding of intracellular cytoplasmic proteins to the CT of β3. The best studied of these interactions is the binding of the cytoskeletal protein talin to the β CT. Talin is a key regulator of integrin activation and is comprised of head and rod domains. The head has an atypical FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, and moesin) domain containing four subdomains: F0-F3. F3 contains a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) signature that binds to the NPxY motif shared by both integrin β1 and β3 CT, while F0-F2 enhances binding through favorable electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids in the vicinity of the integrin on the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saltel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anthis et al., 2010</xref>). This leads to a reduction of the tilt angle of the β3 TM and destabilization of the inner membrane clasp between the β3 and αIIb subunits, promoting dissociation of the transmembrane domains and integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ye et al., 2014</xref>). Whether kindlins, a second FERM domain containing protein family with key roles in integrin activation, also contribute to the TM dissociation is an area of active investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ye et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Theodosiou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moretti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lefort et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montanez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moser et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2008</xref>).</p><p>Despite extensive knowledge about the structural basis of αIIbβ3 integrin activation, data is limited as to whether the widely expressed β1 containing integrins also adopt both inactive and affinity-modulated active states and, if so, how this happens. While there is evidence that the fibronectin α5β1 integrin may resemble αIIbβ3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takagi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2004</xref>), it is unclear whether all the 12 possible αβ1 integrin combinations are activated similarly to αIIbβ3, or whether there is mechanistic heterogeneity underlying their various adhesive functions. That the paradigm of integrin activation established by αIIbβ3 might extend to β1 integrins is suggested by fairly high sequence homology between the β1 and β3 integrin TMs and CTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, the putative snorkeling lysine K752 of β1 integrin was shown to regulate activation of integrin α5β1 in the same manner as proposed for K716 of β3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). By contrast, disruption of the inner membrane clasp in β1 integrin did not cause any phenotype in knockin mice, nor did it alter integrin activation as assessed by activation-dependent antibodies or cell adhesion and migration on fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Czuchra et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, contrary to the canonical model, ligand (i.e. collagen) binding to the integrins α1β1 and α2β1 has been reported to occur in the absence of integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abair et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nissinen et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, our understanding of the role of the TM interactions between α and β1 integrin subunits in regulating integrin activation and function remains incomplete.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18633.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The β1-K752E mutation decreases collecting duct cell adhesion to collagens.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The sequences of the β1 and β3 TM/CTs are annotated.

We wished to assess whether this mechanistic component of integrin regulation is conserved in β1 integrins, specifically for the collagen binding integrins α1β1 and α2β1. Integrin β1-K752 corresponds to β3-K716 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We therefore generated populations of integrin β1 null renal collecting duct (CD) polarized epithelial cells expressing comparable levels of human integrin β1-WT, β1-K752R and β1-K752E. The CD cells were sorted for equal levels of expression of β1 integrin and endogenous integrin α1 or α2 subunits. The different cell populations were then subjected to adhesion on collagens I or IV, which are the preferred ligands for integrins α2β1 and α1β1, respectively. The β1-K752R mutation (which maintained the positive amino acid charge) did not significantly change CD cell adhesion to collagen I (0.5 μg/ml) in the absence or presence of an integrin α1 blocking antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similar results were found over a concentration range of collagen I from 0.125–20 μg/ml (data not shown). However, under the same conditions, CD cells expressing the β1-K752E mutation (which changed the amino acid charge from positive to negative) exhibited little adhesion to collagen I in the absence or presence of an integrin α1 blocking antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Comparable results were found for CD cell adhesion to collagen IV (0.25 μg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) in the presence or absence of an integrin α2 blocking antibody as well as over a concentration of collagen IV from 0.0625–10 μg/ml (data not shown). Due to the severe collagen adhesion defect of CD cells expressing the K752E-β1 mutant, we investigated the effect of this mutation on cell spreading on collagen I and collagen IV over short periods of time. CD cells expressing the β1-K752E mutation spread significantly less on collagen I than CD cells expressing wild type β1 integrin at 15, 30 and 45 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Similar results were seen when the cells were plated on collagen IV, although the difference was no longer statistically different at 45 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>). These results were completely contrary to expectations based on the activating nature of the K716E-β3 mutation described for αIIbβ3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We next investigated whether this unexpected major decrease in cell adhesion to the collagens by the β1-K752E mutant was due to alterations in β1 integrin activation as assessed by the amount of the β1 integrin activation epitope-reporting 12G10 antibody binding relative to the total amount of β1 integrin (as measured by AIIB2) in CD cells that adhered to collagen I. The intensity of 12G10/AIIB2 antibody binding was significantly less in the β1-K752E mutant compared to WT CD cells. This difference was no longer present when the cells were adhered in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, which is known to artificially activate integrins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). Thus, reversing the basic charge of the snorkeling lysine near the TM domain of the β1 integrin significantly decreased integrin α1β1 and α2β1-dependent adhesion to and spreading on collagens by polarized CD epithelial cells. In addition, it resulted in a lower affinity state of β1 integrin in the context of CD cells adherent on collagen I.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The β1 and β3 TM/CT have different structures</title><p>We next performed structural studies to probe the basis for the discrepancies between our results and those found when the snorkeling lysine K716 was mutated in β3. We carried out two different sets of experiments in which the buffer and bicelle model membranes were varied. The first experiment involved 0.5 mM (0.57 mol%) integrin TM/CT in q = 0.3 D6PC/DMPC bicelles and a buffer containing 250 mM imidazole, pH 6.5. DMPC/D6PC bicelles were selected as optimal relative to POPC/D6PC, DMPC/D7PC, and DMPC/cyclofos6 based on comparing the <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-TROSY NMR spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) from each composition. D6PC/DMPC bicelles yielded the most optimal β1 TM/CT spectrum in terms of the total number of peaks, evidence for conformational homogeneity, and the relative intensities of peaks from the TM to those of peaks from the cytosolic domain. The second experiment employed bicelle conditions that matched those used in critical prior studies of the isolated TM of the platelet integrin αIIb/β3 heterodimer and constituent monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lau et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lau et al., 2009</xref>): 0.3 mM (0.34 mol%) integrin TM/CT, 20% q = 0.3 D6PC/POPC/POPS bicelles (where POPC:POPS = 2:1 mol:mol) in a buffer composed of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. For a number of key experiments (below) both sets of conditions were employed and usually yielded similar results.</p><p>TROSY-based 3-D NMR experiments were carried out to assign the backbone amide <sup>1</sup>H, amide <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>13</sup>CA, <sup>13</sup>CO, and (when possible) <sup>13</sup>CB NMR resonances for the integrin β1 TM/CT in bicelles, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. While peaks have previously been assigned for the isolated β3 TM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lau et al., 2009</xref>), this is not the case for the combined TM/CT in bicelles. We therefore completed assignments for this protein as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For both the β1 and β3 TM/CT the assigned chemical shifts have been deposited into the BMRB database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ulrich et al., 2008</xref>) (access codes: 26623 and 26624). Using the CA, CO, and CB chemical shifts for the assigned resonances, the secondary structures of both the β1 and β3 integrin TM/CT were determined using chemical shift index and TALOS-N analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). For β1, there is an α-helix extending from the N-terminal I732 at the beginning of the TM to K765 located in the cytosol, roughly eight sites beyond the end of the TM. For the β3 TM/CT, this helix also starts at the beginning of the TM (at I693), but extends roughly 16 residues into the cytosol, terminating only at A737. Beyond the TM/CT helix, the remaining intracellular domains of both integrin β1 and integrin β3 are unstructured. The degree to which the TM helix of the β3 integrin extends further into the CT relative to β1 (nine residues longer for β3) is striking. The stability of this helix was probed by examining backbone amide/water hydrogen exchange rates using the CLEANEX-PM NMR experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hwang et al., 1998</xref>) and by measuring backbone amide <sup>15</sup>N NMR relaxation rates. Results from these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) show that the transmembrane helix is rigid and, not surprisingly, exchange-resistant. The CT segments identified as helical by analysis of the chemical shifts are seen to exhibit a gradient of low exchange/low motion to significantly higher exchange and motion going from the end of the TM to the end of the chemical-shift identified CT helical segments. There is also a modest spike in exchange and motion observed at the TM/CT interface. These data are consistent both with the notion that the CT helices are prone to significant fraying and also that there is a modest degree of hinge motion at the TM/CT helix interface. It is very clear from the topological analysis presented in the following sections that the CT helix is extended away from the membrane into the cytosol and that any hinge motions at the TM/CT interface are not of sufficient magnitude to enable significant interactions of the CT helix with the membrane surface.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18633.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The β1 and β3 transmembrane and cytosolic domains have distinct structures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 800 MHz <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY spectrum of the WT integrin β1 TM/CT with peak assignments shown.

The plateau in peak ratios observed when Gd(III)-DTPA was used, combined with the corresponding trough in the ratio when 16-DSA was used indicates that the beginning and ends of the TM are near sites I732 and I757, respectively. Both the extracellular segment and the cytosolic domains are largely exposed to the hydrophilic Gd(III)-DTPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>), although the modest degree of protection to Gd(III)-DTPA near the P<sub>781</sub>IY segment (see spike in right side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) suggests that this segment undergoes transient interactions with the bicelle surface. Importantly, these results show that, similar to integrin β3, the β1 TM includes both the putative ‘snorkeling’ Lys site (752 in β1, 716 in β3) and the five hydrophobic residues following it. The β1 TM is terminated by the HDRRE<sub>762</sub> motif, where D759 corresponds to D723 in β3, which forms a critical salt bridge with R995 in the αIIb subunit as part of the ‘inner clasp’ that stabilizes the inactive integrin heterodimeric state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lau et al., 2009</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18633.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Examination of the bilayer topology of integrin WT β1 TM/CT and two mutants (K752E, K752R) in bicelles using NMR and paramagnetic probes.</title><p>Peak intensity changes in the 600MHz <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY spectra are reported for the integrin WT β1 TM/CT and two mutants (K752E, K752R) as induced either by 4 mol% 16-DSA as the hydrophobic paramagnet or by 10 mM Gd-DTPA as the water soluble paramagnet.

Specifically, a pronounced tilt of the TM for the WT β3 protein was reported to be largely reversed by the K-&gt;E mutation to yield a TM that is much more closely aligned with the bilayer normal. It was proposed in that work that the tilt of the β3 TM is stabilized by a ‘snorkeling’ interaction between the side chain amino moiety of the membrane-buried K716 site and oxyanions in the nearby lipid head groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Because of the surprising discord between the β1 results of this work versus the prior β3 results we repeated the Mn(II)-EDDA probe experiment for the isolated β3 TM using the same methods as originally used by Kim, Schmidt, et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, our β3-WT vs. β3-K716E results are very similar to the previously reported results. Use of the hydrophilic Gd-DTPA probe led to a similar result as for Mn-EDDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), yielding results consistent with a major change in tilt for the TM domain due to the β3-K716E mutation. However, a discordant result was obtained when the lipophilic 16-DSA was used as the paramagnetic probe (note that an apolar probe was not employed in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2012</xref>) of the isolated β3 TM): for 16-DSA, little difference was observed between the membrane topology and tilt of β3-WT and the β3-K716E mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This led us to recall literature showing that chelate probes such as Mn(II)-EDDA and Gd(III)-DTPA sometimes have an exposed ligand site that can transiently associate with anions such as Glu and Asp side chain carboxylates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hocking et al., 2013</xref>). To test this possibility, we repeated the Gd(III)-DTPA probe experiment under conditions in which excess (10 mM) free EDTA was added to the solution to cap any free ligand sites in Gd(III)-DTPA, thereby suppressing any direct binding of protein carboxyl sides to the open ligand site in the lanthanide ion chelate. Under these conditions the β3-WT and β3-K716E mutant exhibited the same probe accessibility patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), fully consistent with the 16-DSA results. These results indicate that the previously reported differences seen for the isolated β3 TM using Mn(II)-EDDA reflected an experimental artifact based on the tendency of free carboxyl groups in proteins (i.e., the introduced Glu716 side chain carboxyl) to transiently serve as ligands to available metal ion coordination sites in chelate complexes.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18633.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Examination of the bilayer topology of isolated WT integrin β3 TM and of β3 K716E TM in bicelles using NMR and paramagnetic probes.</title><p>Paramagnetic probe-induced intensity changes are reported for the peaks in 900 MHz <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY spectra of WT integrin β3 TM and β3 K716E TM at 45°C: (<bold>A</bold>) 1 mM Mn-EDDA, (<bold>B</bold>) 10 mM Gd-DTPA, (<bold>C</bold>) 10 mM Gd-DTPA plus 10 mM EDTA, (<bold>D</bold>) 4 mol % 16-DSA.

Binding of integrin α5 to either the WT or K752E β1 TM/CT and binding of integrin αIIb to either WT or K716E β3 resulted in the disappearance of the β subunit TROSY NMR peaks rather than shifts, indicating ‘slow exchange’ between free and complexed subunits on the NMR time scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

NMR titrations of wild type and mutant β1 TM/CT with the wild type α1 and α2 subunits were carried out and it was observed that the β1 peaks shifted during the titration instead of disappearing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicative of rapid exchange on the NMR time between free and complexed species. Global fitting a 1:1 binding model to the concentration dependence of peaks seen to shift the most in each titration yielded good fits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–H</xref>) but revealed that binding did not approach saturation over the concentration range accessible by NMR, such that only lower limits for the Kd could be determined. It is interesting that, for a given concentration, titration with α1 TM/CT generated significantly larger resonance shifts in certain peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>) than α2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>). It is also notable the largest shifts seen in the titration of K752E β1 TM/CT by α1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) are significantly larger than the corresponding α1-induced shifts seen for the WT β1 TM/CT. Finally, it was surprising that the largest shifts seen in titrations of both WT and mutant forms of β1 are for peaks from sites on the distal cytosolic end of the CT. However, the exact interpretation of these observations and whether they are truly significant in terms informing on integrin activation is difficult to assess in light of the fact that heterodimerization in all four cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–H</xref>) was too weak to quantify.</p><p>That the NMR titration results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> report primarily on the formation of stoichiometric complex formation between α and β TM/CT subunits is supported by the results of corresponding fluorescent anisotropy titrations in which fluorescently-labeled α TM/CT subunits were titrated by unlabeled β TM/CT subunits, followed by fitting of the data by a 1:1 binding model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

CD cells with equal surface expression of the α5, β1 and β1-K752E mutation were generated. Both the wild type and β1K752E CD cells adhered equally to fibronectin (0.5 μg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). As these cells express integrin αv, the same experiment was carried out in the presence of an integrin αv blocking antibody. Under these conditions CD cell adhesion was decreased, albeit less than the adhesion defect observed with the CD cells adhering to collagen I or IV. No differences in cell adhesion were seen when the cells adhered to fibronectin in the presence of an anti-β1 antibody, suggesting that the β1-K752E mutation decreased integrin α5β1-dependent adhesion of CD cells to fibronectin.

Similar to when the cells adhered to collagen I there was decreased intensity of 12 G10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>), which correlated with the adhesion and spreading defects.

We probed whether affinity of the interactions of the isolated talin F3 domain with the β1 and β3 TM/CT are altered by the β1-K752E and β3-K716E mutations. NMR was used to monitor titrations of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled integrin TM/CT subunits with unlabeled talin F3 in bicelles containing POPS, an anionic lipid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). During the course of the titrations it was observed that certain peaks disappeared, indicating that binding between the two proteins is slow on the NMR time scale, as is typical when Kd ≤ 100 μM. Binding was therefore quantitated based on monitoring the F3 domain concentration-dependence of peak intensity reductions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, the talin F3 bound to both β1-WT and β1-K752E TM/CT in POPC/POPS/D6PC bicelles with similar (moderate) affinity (K<sub>d</sub> of 27 ± 4 µM and 18 ± 3 µM for WT and K752E β1 TM/CT, respectively). In contrast, the β3-K716E mutation results in a 6-fold increase in the K<sub>d</sub> for talin-1 binding from 5 ± 2 µM to 30 ± 8 µM, suggesting the β3-K716E mutation alters the structure and/or dynamics of bicelle-associated β3 TM/CT to reduce talin-1 F3 binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). These results indicate that mutation of the snorkeling lysine of β3, but not of β1, significantly reduces the affinity of the talin F3 domain for the isolated integrin subunit. The affinity of F3 for both the β1 and β3 TM/CT is higher by over an order of magnitude than the affinity of F3 for the isolated CT of these integrins in buffer minus either membranes or a membrane-mimetic (K<sub>d</sub> of 490 µM and 270–600 µM for β1 and β3, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saltel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anthis et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, it should be acknowledged that the full affinity of the complex between talin and the integrin β3 CT in membranes containing an anionic lipid (Kd ca. 0.9 μM) requires the presence of a linked talin F2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moore et al., 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18633.021</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>NMR-monitored titrations of integrin β1 TM/CT by the talin-F3 domain.</title><p><sup>15</sup>N-labeled WT and K752E mutant integrin β1 TM/CT samples were titrated with unlabeled talin1-F3.

We show that the structures of the β1 and β3 CT/TM in bicelles are distinct. Also, the highly conserved ‘snorkeling lysine’ that plays a key role in regulating αIIβ3 activation plays an opposite role in β1 integrin function and does not play a role in defining the tilt of either β1 or β3. Very different affinities exist between β1 and some α subunits relative to those observed between αIIb and β3. We therefore conclude that the diverse biophysical properties of β1 and β3 integrin TM and CT domains in combination with varying α subunit properties result in distinct mechanisms of integrin activation and function.</p><p>In this study, we show that, in contrast to integrin αIIbβ3 expressed in a CHO cell, the β1-K752E mutation does not promote integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2012</xref>) but actually decreases integrin α1β1, α2β1 and α5β1 epithelial cell adhesion to their respective ligands, with little effect on cell spreading. Consistent with this, β3 tail mutations that resulted in normal integrin activation and talin binding but decreased cell spreading, were recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pinon et al., 2014</xref>). A previous study showed that expression of β1-K752L in integrin β1-null fibroblasts did not alter the integrin activation status or the ability of the cells to adhere to fibronectin and laminin-111; however this mutation did inhibit cell spreading and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armulik et al., 2004</xref>). The mechanism for the altered integrin β1-K752L-mediated cell function was proposed to be due to altered phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation that impacted FAK-independent integrin signaling without altering integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armulik et al., 2004</xref>). We did not test the effect of a β1-K752L mutation in CD cells. Nevertheless, a possible reason for the differences in integrin activation in cell systems that are null for β1 and those in CHO cells is that in the former, the mutant integrin is transduced into a β1-null CD cell, while in the CHO cell system the mutated β integrin is expressed into a cell that already has endogenous integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Alternatively, it could simply reflect differences in cell type. Another important point is that the only effect of the mutation of the ‘snorkeling lysine’ tested in CHO cells was on integrin activation, and not cell functions that rely on ligand-dependent integrin signaling such as adhesion, migration or spreading.</p><p>Another key observation is that the β1-K752 and β3-K716 mutations do not seem to play an important role in defining the topology of the TM in the free subunits. β3-K716 was previously believed to stabilize the integrin αIIbβ3 inactive state by forming a salt bridge between its amino side chain and anionic phosphodiester linkages in the phospholipid head groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). This interaction has been proposed to be a key determinant of the TM tilt that is required for optimal outer and inner clasp interactions between the αIIb and β3 subunits, which are present only in the inactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). This led us to conduct Mn(II)-induced paramagnetic relaxation NMR experiments (PRE) on WT and β1-K752E to determine whether K752 also promotes tilt of the TM. To our surprise, we observed that β1-WT and β1-K752E integrin exhibit the same PRE patterns, indicating that the tilt of the β1 integrin TM is independent of the charge of residue 752. Paradoxically, we made the exact same observation for the β3-K716E mutation indicating that neither β1 nor β3 integrins form a lysine/phospholipid ion pair critical for promoting TM tilt. Our studies revealed that previously reported PRE results to the contrary had been subject to an experimental artifact, as detailed in the Results section. Hence, the previous work had mistakenly concluded that the different PRE patterns observed for β3-WT and β3-K716E reflected very different membrane topologies for WT and mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we repeated the original experiment, but took pains to eliminate the artifactual interaction, revealing that both WT and the K-to-E mutant forms of both β3 and β1 have membrane topologies that are similar in all four cases. We confirmed these observations by reciprocal NMR PRE experiments using a lipophilic paramagnetic probe. Thus, not only does β1-K752 promote functional output that is opposite to that promoted by β3-K716, but even in the case of β3 the mechanism by which β3-K716 promotes the inactive signaling state must now again be regarded as unknown. Our results are consistent with another study that used a biotin maleimide chemical modification of engineered Cys side chains to show that the K716P mutation in β3 did not result in any change in membrane topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kurtz et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Given that the functional consequences of mutating β3-K716 and β1-K752 seem to arise from different mechanisms than originally thought, we tested whether the K-to-E mutations alter association of the integrin β tails with talin, an interaction that promotes integrin activation. Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anthis et al., 2010</xref>), we found that the talin F3 domain binds to the WT β3 TM/CT significantly more tightly than to WT β1 TM/CT (Kd for β3 lower by a factor of 5). Interestingly, the β3-K716E mutation increased Kd for talin binding by a factor of 6, a finding that that does not correlate well with the proposed activation-promoting nature of this mutation. On the other hand, the β1-K752E mutation alters Kd by less than 2-fold and does so in favor of tighter binding. While possible roles for the F0-F2 talin domains in possible coupling between the TM lysine site and talin binding were not tested in this study, at face value these results suggest that the impact of the TM K-to-E mutation on talin binding is not the basis for how this mutation alters integrin function, once again suggesting a mechanism whereby the TM K-to-E mutation alters integrin function by altering integrin-dependent signaling and not activation. It is interesting that talin binds to both integrin TM/CT domains in bicelles more tightly than to CT-only domains in buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anthis et al., 2010</xref>). Bicelles most likely promote a more native-like conformational state of the CT in the context of its attached and bicelle-anchored TM than for the isolated CT in solution.</p><p>This work also reveals significant differences in the secondary structures of the β1 and β3 TM/CT, which were here examined under identical bicellar conditions. The β1 TM ends after I758 while the β3 TM ends after I721, in reasonably good accord with previous NMR, EPR, and biochemical studies. The TM helix of both β1 and β3 was seen to extend into the cytosol and through the juxtamembrane residues that form the inner clasp, albeit with some fraying. However, unlike β1, where the helix ends with the clasp at K765, the helix in the β3 extends a full 10 residues further into the subunit, ending only at A737 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This result is reminiscent of the observations that a continuous β3 TM/CT extends to D740 as part of the αIIbβ3 TM/CT heterodimer in an organic solvent mixture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2009</xref>), while in the corresponding complex for the CT-only heterodimer the β3 helix ends at K738 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vinogradova et al., 2002</xref>). A previous cross-linking/computational study of the αIIbβ3 complex in cell membranes also indicated the β3 helix extends from the TM far out into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>). Our results are also generally consistent with a previous NMR study of the β3 TM/CT domain in DPC micelles, where an extended CT helix was observed, but was connected to the TM by a flexible linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2002</xref>). Our data also support the presence of hinge motion centered at the TM/CT interface, although our data suggest that hinge formation is transient, not a stable structural feature. Other NMR or EPR structural studies of the β1 or β3 TM in isolation or of the αIIβ3 TM complex did not include the full CT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lau et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). The combined structural and membrane topological studies of our work also offer clear evidence that, on the average, the CT helix for both β1 and β3 TM/CT extends away from the membrane surface into the aqueous phase. Our results are not consistent with the notion that the CT has significant membrane surface affinity, as suggested based on a previous NMR study of crosslinked αIIb and β3 CT in DPC micelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Metcalf et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The studies of this work were conducted in <italic>model</italic> membranes and using excised TM/CT domains rather than full length integrins in cellular membranes. Both of these facts hinder the extrapolation of the observations to full length integrins in native membrane conditions. Nevertheless, they do suggest that some of the functional differences between β1 and β3 are linked to the different intrinsic conformational preferences of their CT, which likely impacts their selectivity and affinity in engaging their cytosolic effector proteins. It is interesting to note that while we observed the β3 helix to extend through site A737, in an NMR structure of the complex of the β3 CT with the talin F3 domain the helix terminates at amino acid 732 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wegener et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting destabilization of the C terminal end of the helix by talin. Conversely, for bicelle-associated β1 the helix was seen to terminate at K765, while in a crystal structure of the β1 CT with the talin F2F3 domains this helix does not terminate till A773 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anthis et al., 2009</xref>). These results suggest that the end of the β3 TM/CT helix is not very stable but is readily disrupted by events such as engagement by talin. This is consistent with the fraying of the CT helix seen in the results of this paper. At the same time the disordered segment C-terminal to the β1 TM/CT helix does have helical propensity that is manifested upon complex formation with talin. The metastability of secondary structure in both β1 and β3 CT seems well suited to enable optimal interactions to cytosolic binding partners.</p><p>Finally, the data demonstrated that the interactions of different α subunit TM/CT with the β1 TM/CT are characterized by very different affinities, ranging from very weak interactions between α1 or α2 and β1 to much higher affinity interaction between α5 and β1, similar to that found between αIIb and β3. Based mostly on studies of the αIIbβ3 integrin it has been widely assumed that the TM/CT of β integrins have an intrinsic affinity for the corresponding domains of their cognate α subunits, such that they will form constitutively inactive heterodimers. Many studies have shown the isolated αIIb and β3 TM associate to form heterodimers in model membranes or as fusion proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> or model cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Partridge et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider and Engelman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lokappa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). We observed similar results for heterodimerization of the α5 and β1 TM/CT, an observation consistent with evidence that this particular β1 integrin is activated according to the canonical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takagi et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, we found that α1 and β1 as well as α2 and β1 TM/CT interactions were too weak to be quantified in bicelles, even at the high protein concentrations required for NMR spectroscopy. This is surprising in light of studies suggesting that the fusion proteins containing the TM-only domain of these integrin subunits can form heterodimers in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider and Engelman, 2004</xref>). However, these latter studies were conducted in the absence of the β1, α1, and α2 CT, which almost certainly profoundly impact heterodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Briesewitz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Our results suggest that the α1 and α2 CT may actually inhibit formation of α1β1 and α2β1 TM/CT heterodimers, at least in bicelles. The stark contrast between the collagen α1β1 and α2β1 integrins and the fibronectin α5β1 integrin suggests that the role of TM/CT domain heterodimerization in regulating integrin function may vary considerably among different β1 integrins, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nissinen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abair et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bazzoni et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pepinsky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bodeau et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Our results for integrins α1β1 and α2β1 suggest the intriguing possibility that these receptors may remain constitutively in their unclasped α/β-TM/CT-dissociated forms, implying their signaling functions are modulated via mechanisms other than the canonical model of switching between TM/CT-clasped and unclasped forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abair et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nissinen et al., 2012</xref>). That some integrins may be constitutively active or unclasped has long been postulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bazzoni and Hemler, 1998</xref>). Determining whether this is actually the case will require additional studies. However, even considering that the energetics of heterodimerization of isolated TM/CT will not be the same as local TM/CT heterodimerization in the context of full length integrin subunits, these results indicate that the energetics of TM/CT heterodimerization vary dramatically from integrin to integrin.</p><p>In conclusion, we present evidence that while integrin αIIbβ3 is found in both active and inactive conformations, a subclass of β1 integrins (α1β1 and α2β1) may adopt a constitutively active conformation. Thus β1 and β3 integrins appear to have distinct mechanisms of action wherein different modes of integrin regulation likely occur within the β1 integrin class based on which α subunit is involved, as well as which cell type. Such cell type-specific mechanisms of integrin function need to be explored if we are to understand how different integrins function in distinct biological settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell adhesion</title><p>Cell adhesion assays were performed in 96-well plates as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2004</xref>).

The plate was incubated overnight at 37°C. As tetracycline is light sensitive, the plate and all the media flasks were covered with aluminum foil. A single colony was used to inoculate 5 ml LB media with those three antibiotics. After overnight growth at 37°C, 1 ml of LB cell culture was used to inoculate 1 L M9 media at room temperature with the addition of 0.5 g of each of the eight acids deficient in the CT16 auxotroph. After OD600 reached 0.8 the cells were spun down at 3000 rpm for 15 min and transferred to the final medium at room temperature which contained 0.2g of the desired <sup>15</sup>N-labeled amino acid and 0.5 g unlabeled each for other 7. The cells were then induced by adding IPTG to 1 mM and harvested after overnight growth.

Insoluble debris was then removed by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and incubated with Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) (1 ml per liter of cell culture) at 4°C for 1 hr.

The NMR spectra were measured in the presence of 0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 μM of unlabeled talin1-F3. The total detergent+lipid content was fixed at 5% (w/v) at a q-value of 0.3 (POPC/POPS/D6PC). The final solutions contained 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4% and 10% D<sub>2</sub>O.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistics</title><p>The Student's t-test was used for comparisons between two groups, and analysis of variance using Sigma Stat software was used for statistical differences between multiple groups. p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors declare no competing or financial interests.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Implications of the differing roles of the β1 and β3 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains for integrin function&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Bernhard Wehrle-Haller (Reviewer #2).</p><p>All reviewers agreed that your study provides insight into an important and long-standing question in the field. However, there were a few points raised that, following discussion, we felt required addressing either experimentally or through more discussion of the data and approaches you use to recognise some potential caveats or alternative explanations. The Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission, and details of the points we would like you to address are below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The images of 12G10 staining alone are not sufficient to conclude anything at present – some form of formal quantification of intensity across multiple cells and experiments would be important to provide to support the conclusions from this data.</p><p>2) Analysis of spread cell area in the K752E mutant expressing cells across the different ligands would be important to show to determine whether the current results tally with those previously seen in CHO cells.</p><p>3) The lysine residue should be marked on the structural models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, also the position of the membrane would help guide the reader better.</p><p>4) The dynamics data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> again does not add a lot, without direct comparison to B3 it does not provide new insight and could be deleted.</p><p>5) Discussion, end of third paragraph: Yang et al. (Yang et al., 2009) shows R995 interacting with D723, not K716, so this statement saying that the data in that publication needs revisiting is not correct.</p><p>6) Please remove mention of 'structure' in the second paragraph of the subsection “The β1 and β3 TMD/CTD have different structures” as this refers to a structural model only.</p><p>7) The secondary structure outside the bicelle is surprising as helices do not usually form spontaneously without additional interactions; one interpretation might be that the helix is actually be binding back on to lipids. Please include some distance restraints, or residual dipolar coupling angle restraints to actually demonstrate that these secondary structure elements form in the absence of binding partners (or whether they are low propensity events as the fraying suggests). It seems unlikely that a single stranded β sheet would ever exist as is currently suggested; please include further discussion around this point.</p><p>8) The Anisotropy scale on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> is either incorrect (the change in anisotropy is 0.005 which is an incredibly small amount) or is not actually measuring a change in binding. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> is the only panel that gives a reasonable change in anisotropy (0.6) even though it shows the binding is weak. This is particularly important, as this is the only data that supports a major finding of this paper (constitutive activation of a1B1 and a2B1) and therefore the findings and potential caveats requires further discussion. Please also discuss why the Bmax of the anisotropy for the KE mutant higher: if it binds less well and has not reached saturation then one would expect less anisotropy?</p><p>9) The fluorescence anisotropy of the α1 and α2 might be due to an issue with the α tail peptide accessing the vesicle, or entering incorrectly. Just because the binding is weak with isolated peptides they may well interact (albeit weaker) in the context of the whole integrin with the result being that it might be more easily activated, however, that is not the same as being constitutively active. The authors should include discussion of this point in the revised study.</p><p>10) Given the concerns over the anisotropy data being insufficient to support the notion of differential activation, we request that additional chemical shift experiments are performed using β3+αIIb and β1+α1/α2/α5 tails to permit more transparent and direct comparison across the different heterodimers and help support the key conclusions relating to activation status of each integrin.</p><p>11) The probe accessibility measurements show no change with mutation which is surprising if the lysine is buried in the membrane. This data also does not give any readout on membrane tilt; no effect is seen but it is not clear if this is due to the experiment or the mutant. Without the α tail present it is not possible to judge the overall effect of this mutation as the lysine is positioned with the potential to make a number of contacts to phenylalanines on the α tail. It is possible that the lysine makes a cation-pi bond to the delocalized electrons of the phenylalanine ring and thus in a more physiologically relevant context the mutant might be more significant. The authors should discuss this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18633.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The images of 12G10 staining alone are not sufficient to conclude anything at present – some form of formal quantification of intensity across multiple cells and experiments would be important to provide to support the conclusions from this data.</italic> </p><p>We have quantified the 12G10 staining and it is present in the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>.

We show that the K752E mutant causes a moderate but significant decrease in spreading of collecting duct cells.

The experimentally determined positions of the transmembrane spans for these two proteins are indicated by blue color coding in this figure panel. However, we are reluctant to show these two proteins sitting in a membrane, as this would require us to depict the transmembrane segments as being either titled or un-tilted with respect to the bilayer normal. We hesitate to do this because the degree of tilt (or lack thereof) is not confidently determined by the data of our studies or, we would argue, by previous studies. We prefer to present these structural models conservatively rather than risk presenting a model that is not backed up by data.</p><p><italic>4) The dynamics data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> again does not add a lot, without direct comparison to B3 it does not provide new insight and could be deleted.</italic> </p><p>We have now collected transverse relaxation rates (R2) for the B3 integrin subunit that enables an illuminating comparison to the corresponding data from B3.

First, we present new site-specific amide/water hydrogen exchange measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> that support the continuation of the helices for both B1 and B3 in to the cytosol, but do indicate some fraying of these helices. This is supported by the R2 relaxation data mentioned earlier that is presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>. We also now present the output of the TALOS-N chemical shift analysis that was the original basis for the secondary structure in the models as the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>. In the text we acknowledge the presence of fraying in both the B1 and B3 CT helices as well as the presence of a model degree of hinge-like motion at the TM/CT interface, which is supported by both the amide/water hydrogen exchange data and the R2 relaxation data.</p><p>We wish to make a few other points in response to this reviewer concern. The extensive paramagnetic probe data presented in this paper for the non-truncated combined TM/CT domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) makes it very clear that the cytosolic segments observed to be helical based on TALOS analysis of the NMR backbone chemical shifts for both B1 and B3 are <italic>not</italic> interacting with the membrane surface, but extend into the aqueous phase. While it is true that monomeric water soluble polypeptides usually do not form stable helices in solution, we argue that the fact that the cytoplasmic domain helices are extensions of highly stable membrane-embedded helices makes them much more stable than they would be as excised peptides in solution. That this is energetically reasonable is supported by crystal structures of many membrane proteins in which TM helices are extended well beyond the membrane. Indeed in the structure of the αIIb/β3 integrin TM/CT structure determined by the Qin lab (Armulik, Velling and Johansson, 2004) in a water/organic solvent mixture, they observed the beta3 TM helix to extend even further into the cytosol than we do even though it does not make any tertiary structure interactions with the α subunit beyond the juxtamembrane clasp. Others also have proposed structures for B3 or for the αIIb/B3 complex (based on a variety of data or modeling that include an extended B3 helix into the cytosol that is contiguous with the transmembrane domain (c.f. Zhu, Luo, Barth et al. Molecular Cell, 33, 234-249, 2009; Wegener, Partridge et al. Cell 128, 171-182 2007; Anthis, Wegener et al. EMBO J 28, 3623-3632, 2009; Metclaf, Moore et al. PNAS, 107, 22481-22486, 2010). We also emphasize that what is most interesting about results of our studies is the fact that the B1 helix is much shorter than that of B3, extending much less far into the cytosol.</p><p><italic>8) The Anisotropy scale on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> is either incorrect (the change in anisotropy is 0.005 which is an incredibly small amount) or is not actually measuring a change in binding. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> is the only panel that gives a reasonable change in anisotropy (0.6) even though it shows the binding is weak. This is particularly important, as this is the only data that supports a major finding of this paper (constitutive activation of a1B1 and a2B1) and therefore the findings and potential caveats requires further discussion. Please also discuss why the Bmax of the anisotropy for the KE mutant higher: if it binds less well and has not reached saturation then one would expect less anisotropy?</italic> </p><p><italic>9) The fluorescence anisotropy of the α1 and α2 might be due to an issue with the α tail peptide accessing the vesicle, or entering incorrectly. Just because the binding is weak with isolated peptides they may well interact (albeit weaker) in the context of the whole integrin with the result being that it might be more easily activated, however, that is not the same as being constitutively active. The authors should include discussion of this point in the revised study.</italic> </p><p><italic>10) Given the concerns over the anisotropy data being insufficient to support the notion of differential activation, we request that additional chemical shift experiments are performed using β3+αIIb and β1+α1/α2/α5 tails to permit more transparent and direct comparison across the different heterodimers and help support the key conclusions relating to activation status of each integrin.</italic> </p><p>In response to these concerns we have completed and analyzed a complete set of NMR titrations for wild type α1, α2, and α5 binding to β1 (both wild type and K752E mutant) and wild type αIIb binding to β3 (both wild type and K716E mutant). The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, the NMR results are in all cases in reasonably good agreement with the fluorescence anisotropy results, particularly when different experimental temperatures are taken into account (NMR: 45 °C, fluorescence anisotropy: 35 °C). To address the reviewer’s question about why the changes in anisotropy were often very small, we note that these experiments involved titrations of on integrin subunit in bicelles with another integrin subunit in bicelles, such that the change in tumbling rate for the fluorescently labeled subunit upon heterodimer formation in bicelles was not large.</p><p><italic>11) The probe accessibility measurements show no change with mutation which is surprising if the lysine is buried in the membrane. This data also does not give any readout on membrane tilt; no effect is seen but it is not clear if this is due to the experiment or the mutant. Without the α tail present it is not possible to judge the overall effect of this mutation as the lysine is positioned with the potential to make a number of contacts to phenylalanines on the α tail. It is possible that the lysine makes a cation-pi bond to the delocalized electrons of the phenylalanine ring and thus in a more physiologically relevant context the mutant might be more significant. The authors should discuss this point.</italic> </p><p>It is well established by the classical Weiner and White neutron diffraction measurements and other previous work that the concentration of water at the bilayer interface, even in the glycerol backbone region is significant. Thus, we think that the hydrogen bonding potential of either a lysine side chain or of a glutamate side chain (both of which would orient their relatively long side chains toward the aqueous phase) could be satisfied by interaction with interfacial water even though these sites are located in the membrane.</p><p>We acknowledge that our methods do not provide a readout of the tilt of the transmembrane domains, but note that this is a ubiquitous problem in the integrin field. We agree with the reviewer that cation-pi interactions between the key lysine amino group and the Phe side chains located in the adjacent α subunit could be key interactions that stabilize integrin heterodimers. However, the presence of such interactions is not established by our work and invoking this interaction cannot explain the very different functional consequences of the Lys-to-Glu mutation in β1 vs. β3 integrins. For this reason and because the manuscript is already rather long we do not take up the reviewer’s suggestion to discuss possible cation-pi interactions in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
