and tactile information to form an internal representation of their mechanical properties for cognitive perception and for preventing their slippage using predictive control of grip force. A major challenge in understanding the dissociable contributions of tactile and kinesthetic information to perception and action is the natural coupling between them. Unlike previous studies that addressed this question either by focusing on impaired sensory processing in patients or using local anesthesia, we used a behavioral study with a programmable mechatronic device that stretches the skin of the fingertips to address this issue in the intact sensorimotor system. We found that artificial skin-stretch increases the predictive grip force modulation in anticipation of the load force. Moreover, the stretch causes an immediate illusion of touching a harder object that does not depend on the gradual development of the predictive modulation of grip force.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stiffness perception</kwd><kwd>artificial skin-stretch</kwd><kwd>sensory augmentation</kwd><kwd>predictive control</kwd><kwd>grip force control</kwd><kwd>reactive control</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>823/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nisky</surname><given-names>Ilana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1632259</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mussa-Ivaldi</surname><given-names>Ferdinando A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001742</institution-id><institution>United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016850</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nisky</surname><given-names>Ilana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005005</institution-id><institution>Ben-Gurion University of the Negev</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ABC Robotics Initiative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nisky</surname><given-names>Ilana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006245</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Israel</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Israel-Italy virtual lab on 'Artificial Somatosensation for Humans and Humanoids'</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nisky</surname><given-names>Ilana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005005</institution-id><institution>Ben-Gurion University of the Negev</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tzin Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farajian</surname><given-names>Mor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005005</institution-id><institution>Ben-Gurion University of the Negev</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lachish Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kossowsky</surname><given-names>Hanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Elucidating the contribution of augmented artificial skin-stretch stimulation to the fingertips to the immediate illusion of a higher stiffness and to an increased predictive grip force control.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During everyday interactions with objects, we control and sense the position of these objects and the forces they exert on us. This occurs in perceptual tasks, such as when assessing the stiffness of an object using a tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LaMotte, 2000</xref>), and in actions, such as when manipulating the same tool during probing of the object while adjusting the grip force â the perpendicular force between the digits and the object. There is a constant interaction between the perceptual and the motor systems. For example, perception of the mechanical properties of the environment is important for planning future actions. At the same time, we actively explore the environment, obtaining haptic perceptual information by moving and probing our surroundings. Since we do not possess sensors for mechanical impedance, the perception of the impedance of objects, such as their stiffness, damping, and inertia, is based on the integration of motion and force signals, which are sensed during contact with the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jones and Hunter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nisky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kuschel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nisky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gurari et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our body has two major types of force sensors â kinesthetic and tactile. When holding a pen or a scalpel, kinesthetic position and force information are generated by muscle spindles (length and shortening velocity of the muscles) and Golgi tendon organs (tension in the tendon), respectively. Tactile information arises from several types of cutaneous mechanoreceptors that respond to skin deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kandel, 2000</xref>). Individuals with impaired tactile sensitivity are deprived of important information required for planning and controlling object manipulation, such as the magnitude and direction of contact forces, the shape of contact surfaces, and friction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johansson and Flanagan, 2009</xref>). Using anesthesia and passive stimulation via robots, the unique role of tactile information in the discrimination of subtle differences in softness has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Srinivasan and LaMotte, 1995</xref>). However, passive or anesthetized touch is different from active touch with intact tactile sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gwilliam et al., 2014</xref>), and the combination of kinesthetic and tactile information in perception and action is still poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate how these information modalities are combined in the formation of stiffness perception and control of grip force during intact active touch.</p><p>There have been significant advances in the development of mechatronic devices for tactile stimulation of the finger pads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Provancher and Sylvester, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prattichizzo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Quek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quek et al., 2014</xref>). In most of these devices, a tactor (a pin or a platform with a flat high-friction top) moves against the skin; the movement of the tactor deforms the skin. This artificial stretching of the skin emulates the deformation that occurs during interaction with real objects. Previous studies have made use of these devices to investigate the combination of tactile and kinesthetic information in a variety of scenarios. For example, tactor-induced skin-stretch has successfully conveyed direction information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gleeson et al., 2009</xref>), navigation cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Quek et al., 2015a</xref>) and stiffness information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schorr et al., 2015</xref>) in sensory substitution studies. Additionally, adding artificial skin-stretch to kinesthetic force has been shown to augment the perceived friction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Provancher and Sylvester, 2009</xref>) and perceived stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quek et al., 2014</xref>). Meaning, stretching the skin more than it would be during natural interactions, causes the object to feel stiffer than it really is. These studies, however, do not provide any information about the time-course of the formation of the perceptual illusions caused by the skin-stretch, or about the role of skin-stretch in grip force control.</p><p>During tool-mediated interactions with objects, humans apply grip force perpendicularly between their fingers and an object to prevent its slippage. When interacting with an object, three known components contribute to our grip force: a predictive feedforward component, which consists of a baseline grip force and a modulation of grip force in anticipation of the load force; and a reactive feedback component that responds to slippage. Feedforward control is used to adjust our grip force in accordance with the expected slipperiness and weight (or load force) of the object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flanagan and Wing, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flanagan and Wing, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flanagan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Danion and Sarlegna, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Danion et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leib et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leib et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">White et al., 2018</xref>). This adjustment often starts in anticipation to the change in load force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Forssberg et al., 1992</xref>), and several recent studies revealed that the intended peak grip force can be predicted from the grip force and the rate of its change at the time of initial contact with the object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">White et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kuling et al., 2019</xref>). Baseline grip force is maintained to create a safety margin, and is increased when one experiences uncertainty regarding the load force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gibo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hadjiosif and Smith, 2015</xref>). Predictive modulation is calculated based on an internal representation of the object dynamics, which is learned by the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johansson and Cole, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kawato, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davidson and Wolpert, 2004</xref>) and is updated during repeated interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donchin et al., 2003</xref>). Finally, if cutaneous receptors detect that slippage is occurring, the grip force is increased through rapid feedback control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kandel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johansson and Flanagan, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Tactile information can be completely removed by digital anesthesia, and by doing so, has been shown to be necessary for scaling the grip force strength. Additionally, a recent rTMS study suggested that the left supplementary motor area, known to be involved in processing tactile information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Romo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2015</xref>), is involved in the scaling of grip force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">White et al., 2013</xref>). The timing, on the other hand, can be predictively regulated by kinesthetic information alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nowak et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Witney et al., 2004</xref>). In the complete absence of force information, grip force is not modulated in accordance with the load force, and the baseline grip force is increased to prevent slippage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gibo et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Skin-stretch devices partially disrupt the natural coupling between tactile and kinesthetic information, and can therefore be used to investigate the contribution of tactile and kinesthetic information to grip force control, while all sensory and motor components are intact. Two recent studies using this technology yielded conflicting results regarding the effects of skin-stretch on grip force, reporting an increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Quek et al., 2015a</xref>) and unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Quek et al., 2015b</xref>) mean grip force, respectively. However, it is unknown how artificial skin-stretch affects the predictive modulation of grip force in anticipation of load force. Our first goal was therefore to understand the contribution of tactile information to theÂ predictive grip force control.</p><p>There are many examples of the dissociation of sensory information processing for perception and action during grasping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aglioti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haffenden et al., 2001</xref>) and lifting of objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flanagan and Beltzner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bringoux et al., 2012</xref>). For example, the size-weight illusion affects the scaling of grip force in the first trials of a lifting task, but with repeated lifting movements the motor effect fades away, while the perceptual illusion persists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flanagan and Beltzner, 2000</xref>). During interactions with linear elastic force fields, a delay in the force feedback produces the illusion of touching a softer spring, but the participants' grip force is predictively adjusted to the correct stiffness level and timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leib et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leib et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, introducing a delay in visual feedback led to a persistent alteration of grip force control due to an illusory change in object dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sarlegna et al., 2010</xref>). As there is a lack of consistency regarding the question of dissociation between perception and action, it remains to be determined whether the perceptual augmentation of stiffness due to the addition of artificial skin-stretch would affect the predictive grip force adjustment. If so, it remains to be determined whether the perceptual augmentation of stiffness is a direct result of the tactile stimulation, or if it develops with the internal representation that is used for the predictive modulation of grip force in anticipation of load force. Therefore, our second goal in this study was to understand the time-course of developing the perceptual illusion of touching a harder object due to artificial skin-stretch stimulation.</p><p>We therefore designed two experiments to test the effect of artificial skin-stretch applied together with kinesthetic force, on the two different components of the predictive control of grip force, and on the formation of stiffness perception. In both experiments, participants were asked to judge the stiffness of virtual objects. These objects were elastic force fields with different levels of stiffness, achieved with a kinesthetic haptic device, and augmented with additional stretch stimuli to the skin of the fingertips. We first focused on how the additional stretch of the fingertips affects the feedforward grip force control. If perception and the predictive control of grip force share similar (or even mutual) stiffness estimation mechanisms, we would expect to find a greater anticipatory modulation of grip force with the load force after repeated interactions with the force field. In addition, the skin-stretch may also increase participantsâ uncertainty regarding the load force, in which case we would expect to find an increase in the baseline grip force dueÂ to an increase in the safety margin. Our second experiment was designed to understand whether our perception of stiffness is influenced by the artificial stretch stimulation immediately, or after the development of the modulation of grip force in anticipation of load force.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Skin-stretch immediately increased the baseline grip force and gradually increased the feedforward modulation of the grip force with the anticipated load force</title><p>In this experiment, we examined the effect of adding artificial skin-stretch to kinesthetic load force on the predictive control of grip force. Participants (NÂ =Â 10) sat in front of a virtual reality setup and interacted with virtual elastic force fields which were created by a haptic device. In each trial, participants used structured probing movements to evaluate the stiffness of two different force fields, designated <italic>standard</italic> and <italic>comparison</italic>, and decided which had a higher level of stiffness. When interacting with the <italic>standard</italic> force field, in addition to the load force feedback, which had a constant stiffness value of 85 N/m, the skin of the thumb and index finger was stretched using a skin-stretch device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The stiffness of the <italic>comparison</italic> force field in each trial was chosen to be one of three different stiffness values (40, 85, and 130 N/m). The magnitude of both the stretch and the load force was proportional to the penetration depth into the virtual elastic force field. The gain of the skin-stretch stimulation (i.e. the amount of skin-stretch relative to the penetration depth) in each trial was chosen from four possible values (0, 33, 66, and 100 mm/m). In each trial, participants made eight discrete movements into each of the two force fields.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental system.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The participants sat in front of a virtual reality rig, and held the skin-stretch device, which was mounted on the end of a haptic device.

In these stretch-catch probes, we maintained the load force but omitted the skin-stretch. The purpose of the stretch-catch probes was to allow us to investigate the predictive component of grip force control.

Additionally, we used the applied grip force in the stretch-catch probes to fit a model that predicts the <italic>intended peak grip force</italic> (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">White et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kuling et al., 2019</xref>).

We observed a rising trend in the applied grip force with higher values of the expected tactor displacement gain, for both the second (gentle rise) and seventh (steep rise) probing movements.

Moreover, they found this perceptual augmentation to be linearly related to the tactor displacement gain (thatÂ is, the amount of skin-stretch per movement). In Experiment one, we showed that the addition of the skin-stretch led to an increase in the magnitude of the predictive grip force, which developed over different time scales with repeated interactions: the grip force baseline increased immediately after one probing movement whereas the modulation of the grip force in anticipation of the load force developed gradually over approximately four probing movements. Similar to the perceptual augmentation, the increase in the grip force was also linearly dependent on the expected tactor displacement gain. These two findings presented evidence of artificial skin-stretch leading to both a perceptual augmentation and an increase in the predictive grip force. It remained unclear, however, whether the increase in the perceived stiffness was induced by the tactile stimulus as a high-level cognitive illusion, or a low-level effect that developed following the build-up of the increased feedforward grip force due to repeated interactions with the tactile stimulation. If the first were to be the case, we would expect the perceptual illusion to be created immediately following exposure to the skin-stretch stimulus. In the event of the latter, on the other hand, the perceptual illusion would develop with subsequent probing movements, similar to the increase in the modulation of grip force. To investigate this matter, we examined the timescale for the creation of the perceptual augmentation. We did this by using a stiffness discrimination task, and examining the dependence of the effect of adding artificial skin-stretch to kinesthetic load force on the number of serial interactions with the elastic force field. Participants (NÂ =Â 20) probed pairs of elastic force fields and determined which one had a higher level of stiffness. The <italic>standard</italic> force field had a constant stiffness value (85 N/m), and was augmented by one of four different tactor displacement gains (0, 33, 66, and 100 mm/m). The stiffness of the <italic>comparison</italic> force field was chosen from a range of ten values, evenly spaced between 40â130 N/m. The participants were divided into two groups: Group 1 (NÂ =Â 10) could probe each force field only once, and Group 2 (NÂ =Â 10) used free exploration, meaning they could probe each force field as many times as they desired.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>Skin-stretch caused perceptual overestimation of stiffness</title><p>Adding artificial skin-stretch to kinesthetic load force caused participants to overestimate the stiffness of the <italic>standard</italic> force field.

Our results show that the augmentation in the perceived stiffness increased linearly as a function of the tactor displacement gain in both groups. The psychometric curves of typical participants from Group 1 and Group 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a and d</xref>, respectively) show that artificial skin-stretch caused the illusion of touching a harder object, thatÂ is, overestimation of the perceived stiffness. As shown in the psychometric curves, in trials lacking artificial skin-stretch (tactor displacement gain of 0 mm/m), the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE, a measure of bias in the perceived stiffness) was close to zero, and the slope of the psychometric curve was steep, indicating that the participant could accurately distinguish between the stiffness levels of the two force fields. Stretching the finger-pad skin of these participants during their interactions with the <italic>standard</italic> force field led to a rightward shift of the psychometric curves representing these trials, and a positive PSE, indicating that these participants overestimated the stiffness of the <italic>standard</italic> force field. A larger increase in the tactor displacement gain caused an additional rightward shift of the PSE. These shifts of the PSE values occurred without practically any change in the slopes of the psychometric curve, indicating that stretching the finger-pad skin did not affect the stiffness discrimination ability.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The effect of artificial skin-stretch on perception.</title><p>Example of psychometric curves of typical participants for different levels of tactor displacement gain from (<bold>a</bold>)Â Groups 1 and (<bold>d</bold>)Â GroupÂ 2.

Therefore, this participant was excluded from the figures and the statistical analyses (which did not affect the statistical significance or any other conclusion). Similar to Group 1, this group also exhibited no difference in the discrimination sensitivity with an increase in the tactor displacement gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>, rm-regression, main effect of âgainâ: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1,8</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>060</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi mathvariant="normal"/> <mml:mi mathvariant="normal"/><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.1890</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>).

Is the increase in the perceived stiffness caused immediately after experiencing the tactile stimulation, or does it depend on the development of the increased predictive modulation of grip force that builds up with repeated interaction with the exposure to the skin-stretch? A direct comparison between the two groups revealed no differences in the bias in stiffness perception (as quantified by the PSE) or in the discrimination sensitivity (as quantified by the JND) of the two groups.

We can therefore conclude that the perceptual illusion was formed immediately, after a single probing movement into the force field, and before the increase in the predictive modulation of grip force in anticipation of load force that we identified in Experiment 1 was formed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-5"><title>Skin-stretch caused an increase in the applied grip force</title><p>The main goal of this experiment was to determine the timescale for the creation of the perceptual illusion. However, we also recorded the grip force applied throughout the probing interactions, and investigated the possibility of reproducing some of our findings in Experiment 1 in the more natural probing setting of Experiment 2, concurrently with pinpointing the number of probing interactions required to form the illusion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> presents examples of grip force, load force, and tactor displacement trajectories of a participant from the free exploration group (Group 2). As in Experiment 1, a visual examination of the trajectories revealed a non-uniform peak pattern that appeared predominantly in trials in which skin-stretch was applied. For example, the grip force signals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c and d</xref> show that increasing the tactor displacement gain caused several grip force peaks around the load force peaks. In addition, the grip force trajectories give the impression of the presence of phase shifts between grip force responses and the load force due to the added tactor displacement. However, we suggest that in reality participantsâ grip force in Experiments 1 and 2 were similar. In Experiment 1, participants made discrete probing movements into the force field, leading to the clear grip force trajectories seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. In Experiment 2, however, participants used free exploration and the probing movements lacked the separation that existed in Experiment 1. In Experiment 1, we observed two peaks in the grip force trajectories when high tactor displacement gains were applied. We hypothesized that this pattern was due to the reactive grip force component and an artifact specific to our skin-stretch device (see Appendix 1Â for more information). We therefore posit that the free exploration used in Experiment 2 caused the second peak of each probe to fuse with the first peak of the subsequent probe. Importantly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> also shows that when high tactor displacement gains were applied, there was a rising trend in the magnitude of the applied grip force as the participant made subsequent probing movements. This phenomenon is illustrated by comparing the 0 and 100 mm/m gain plots; unlike the 0Â mm/m plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>), a rise in the grip force magnitude can be seen with subsequent probing movements in the 100 mm/m plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Examples of load force (black dotted line), grip force (red solid line), and tactor displacement (different shades of blue) trajectories of a typical participant from the free exploration group (Group 2).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Tactor displacement gain of 0 mm/m.

We investigated the timescale of the formation of the perceptual effect and found that it was formed immediately upon the exposure to the skin-stretch stimulus. Additionally, we examined the effect of the skin-stretch on the overall grip force when participants were free to probe the force fields as many times as they wished, unlike the structured probing movements they were instructed to make in Experiment 1. This analysis confirmed that, here too, the skin-stretch led to an increase in the overall grip force that developed with subsequent probing interactions with the same elastic force field.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we examined the effect of artificial tactile feedback on the predictive control of grip force and the perception of stiffness. Previous findings have reported that adding artificial skin-stretch to kinesthetic force feedback causes the perceptual illusion of touching a harder object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Quek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quek et al., 2014</xref>). Our results suggest that artificial skin-stretch also affected the prediction of the load force applied by the object, and consequentially led to a gradual increase in the predictive modulation of grip force in anticipation of the load force. Additionally, we discovered that the perceptual illusion was formed immediately upon first contact with the object, and did not depend on the slower development of the predictive control of grip force. Previous studies have investigated the contribution of tactile information to the predictive grip force control. Many of these studies focused on patients with impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nowak and HermsdÃ¶rfer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nowak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Witney et al., 2004</xref>) or used digital anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nowak et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augurelle et al., 2003</xref>), and concluded that impaired cutaneous feedback increased the overall grip force, but did not affect the modulation of grip force in anticipation of load force. Our study is the first to address this issue in an intact motor system, using artificial cutaneous information. Our results showed that artificial skin-stretch increased the predictive grip force by increasing both the baseline grip force and the modulation in anticipation of the predicted load force. In addition, we determined that the size of this effect was linear with the amount of stretch. Interestingly, the timescales of the evolution of these two components were different â the baseline grip force increased immediately together with the perceptual illusion, and the modulation evolved gradually.</p><p>Which aspect of the internal representation caused the increase in the predictive modulation of grip force? This current study cannot provide an answer to this question, but we can raise several possible explanations. Previous studies have determined that artificial skin-stretch causes an increase in the perceived load force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gleeson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matsui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quek et al., 2014</xref>). One possibility is therefore that a similar increase in estimated load force can affect the predictive modulation. Alternatively, the estimation of the force field stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leib et al., 2016</xref>) could have been updated directly. Another possible explanation is that the participants may have interpreted the additional tactile stimuli as indicative of a more slippery contact surface at the interface with the fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johansson and Westling, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flanagan and Wing, 1990</xref>), hence leading to an increase in the grip force which is entirely unrelated to the perceptual illusion of a harder object. Moreover, we observed a reactive reduction of the grip force around the peak load force in response to the stretch stimulation (which we interpret with caution - see Appendix 1). This reduction increases the risk of slippage which could be compensated for by increasing both components of the predictive grip force (thatÂ is, the baseline and the modulation) that are entirely unrelated to the mechanical properties of the interface with the finger.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that to reduce the risk of slippage, participants initially apply excessive grip force by applying a safety margin beyond the sufficient amount of grip force. However, with repeated interactions with the environment, the baseline grip force lessens and adjusts to the expected load force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leib et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leib et al., 2018</xref>). Surprisingly, we did not observe this type of decrease in the baseline grip force between the second and seventh probes when stretch was applied, suggesting that the participants did not reduce their safety margin, even after the predictive modulation was updated. A possible explanation is that the stretch stimulation may have increased uncertainty about the cutaneous information, and the larger was the stretch the larger was the uncertainty. This is consistent with the increased JND that we observed for some of the participants with higher levels of tactor displacement gain. Moreover, a recent study showed that grip forces are increased due to variability in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hadjiosif and Smith, 2015</xref>). Additionally, uncertainty favors increase in impedance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franklin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tee et al., 2010</xref>) which may also be associated with a rapid increase in grip force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsuji et al., 1995</xref>). Therefore, increased uncertainty could have prevented the participants from reducing their baseline grip force.</p><p>Consistently with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vega-Bermudez and Johnson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Quek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park et al., 2018</xref>), we found that adding artificial tactile feedback augmented the perceived stiffness, and that the augmentation was a linear function of the tactor displacement gain. Our findings show that this perceptual illusion is immediate, and does not depend on repeated interactions with the force field. This suggests that the perceptual illusion is a result of a high-level cognitive process, independent of the gradual development of the increase in the predictive modulation of grip force. This is consistent with recent findings regarding the fast timescales of explicit cognitive strategies in motor adaptation, compared to the slower implicit adaptation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McDougle et al., 2015</xref>). In fact, the immediate perceptual effect observed in Experiment 2 was evident after the participants were exposed to exactly the same amount of information as the participants in Experiment 1 had when they planned their control of grip force in the second stretch-catch probe. In the second stretch-catch probe, only the baseline grip force component, which reflects uncertainty, increased due to the skin-stretch, whereas the modulation, which reflects the planning of the grip force in anticipation of the predicted load force, changed gradually. Conversely, the perceptual effect after one probe was similar to the perceptual effect after free exploration, and was linearly related to the amount of stretch.</p><p>There were two groups in Experiment 2; one which probed each force field a single time, and one that made as many probing movements as they wished (free exploration). Both the effect size (represented by the PSE value) and the sensitivity (represented by the JND value) were similar in both groups of Experiment 2. We expected to observe larger PSE values in the free exploration group, as serial interactions are often combined as a weighted average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Metzger et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, we also expected that as multiple interactions with the force field supply more information, this would lower the variability of the estimations of stiffness, and therefore lead to smaller JND values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ernst and Banks, 2002</xref>). Our findings, which are in contrast with these expectations, suggest that the skin-stretch stimulus is very strong, and is well above the discrimination thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gescheider, 2013</xref>). This offers an explanation for the many compelling effects of tactile stimulation found in a variety of applications.</p><p>Our results indicate that the perceptual illusion and the update of the predictive modulation of grip force in anticipation of the load force did not share a similar timescale. However, we cannot determine whether they shared a different stiffness estimation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leib et al., 2016</xref>). Many studies have reported that the motor system is robust to perceptual illusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodale and Milner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aglioti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flanagan and Beltzner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ganel and Goodale, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leib et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leib et al., 2018</xref>), but other studies found a lack of dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Franz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jackson and Shaw, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruno, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckingham and Goodale, 2010</xref>). Our findings are similar to those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flanagan and Beltzner (2000)</xref> in terms of timescales â they found that the perceptual size-weight illusion was immediate and persistent, whereas the grip force control changed over repeated grasping of the objects. However, the nature of the change in the grip force was different - in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flanagan and Beltzner (2000)</xref> the grip force matched the perception in the first grasping, and was then adjusted to the correct weight. In our case, on the other hand, the predictive modulation of grip force slowly increased over repeated interactions. In general, the debate regarding the existence of dissociation between perception and action remains open.</p><p>Understanding the dissociable effects of kinesthetic and tactile cues on grip force control and the integration between these modalities is critical for enhancing feedforward and feedback models, and for multisensory integration. In this study, we conducted two experiments which allowed for the characterization of the effect of artificial skin-stretch on the predictive component of grip force control and the timescale of the formation of perceptual effects throughout subsequent probing movements. Our findings suggest that skin-stretch contributed to an increase in the amplitude of the predictive grip force adjustment in anticipation of the load force. Additionally, the perceptual illusion appears to have been formed immediately upon the first contact with the object, independently of the gradual development of the predictive grip force control. These results are important for understanding the remarkable human ability to gracefully manipulate a variety of objects manually without breaking or dropping them, and for developing new technologies for simulating the human sense of touch.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All the participants of the experiments signed a written informed consent form.

To achieve this goal, we disengaged the natural relationship between kinesthetic and tactile information sources using a custom-built 1 DoF skin-stretch device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) which allowed us to apply different levels of skin-stretch to the user's fingers. Participants placed their thumb and index fingers on the designated locations, and the device stretched the skin of the finger pads by tactor displacement. Our device was based on the design in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quek et al. (2014)</xref>, with several modifications. The device was equipped with a DC micro motor (Faulhaber, series 1516-SR), a spur gearhead (Faulhaber, series 15/8 with gear ratio of 76:1), an encoder (Faulhaber, series IE2-1024), and an analog motion controller (Faulhaber, series MCDC 3002). We integrated a force sensor (ATI, Nano17) to measure the applied grip force, which was mounted on the lower end of the device so that participants did not place their fingers directly above the force sensor. The left side of the outer shell consisted of a 'door' with an axis on its upper end, and a cylindrical protrusion facing the force sensor. When the device was held with the index finger and thumb on the aperture, the protrusion pressed the force sensor and the relative grip force was measured. Because of the colocation of the tactor movement mechanism and the ideal placement of the force sensor, we could not measure the grip force directly. However, the division of the grip force between the tactor and the aperture, and the placement of the force sensor at a distant location allowed, through the law of conservation of angular momentum, to measure a downscaled version of the grip force that the participants applied on the aperture of the skin-stretch device. This means that we measured trends in the grip force that were linearly related to the actual grip force that the participants appliedÂ (see Appendix 2). The weight of the skin-stretch device was approximately 200g and was compensated by a weight that was mounted on the haptic device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Taati et al., 2008</xref>). The purpose of the weight compensation was to reduce the effect of gravity on the load force. We also examined the magnitude of the inertia force on the load force. Meaning, the participants moved the tactile device at a certain acceleration rate, and we were interested in ensuring that this did not cause them to feel additional forces. We calculated the inertia force and found it to be negligible in comparison to the load force. The average maximum acceleration value was <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:mn>0.2392</mml:mn><mml:mfrac bevelled="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula>, with a standard deviation of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf36"><mml:mn>0.0924</mml:mn><mml:mfrac bevelled="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Each force field was indicated to the participants as a screen color that was either red or blue, which we defined randomly prior to the experiment. After interaction with the force fields and after choosing which one had a higher level of stiffness, participants pressed a keyboard key that corresponded to the screen color of the stiffer force field. For each trial, the stiffness of the <italic>comparison</italic> force field was also pseudo-randomly chosen prior to the experiment. During interaction with the <italic>comparison</italic> force field, only kinesthetic force was applied. Interaction with the <italic>standard</italic> force field was augmented with one of four different levels of tactor displacement gain (0, 33, 66, and 100 mm/m), in addition to the applied load force. After choosing the force field that was perceived as stiffer, the screen became grey, andÂ participants initiated the next trial by raising the end of the robotic device. There was no visual feedback along the vertical axis during the experiment. To avoid force saturation of the robotic device, we used an auditory alert if the penetration into the force field exceeded 40 mm. To avoid saturation of the skin-stretch device, we limited the range of the tactor-displacement gains that we investigated to 100 mm/m. This ensured that during typical interactions with the force fields, the tactor did not reach the aperture of the device body, and caused as few saturation cases as possible. To become familiarized with the experimental setup and to ensure that participants understood how to grasp the device, a training session was carried out at the beginning of each experiment. During training, we provided feedback to participants about their responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Experiment 1</title><p>Ten participants (seven females, 22â26 years old) participated in the experiment after signing an informed consent form as approved by the Human Subject Research Committee of Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beâer-Sheva, Israel.</p><p>The experiment focused on the predictive components of grip force control due to the skin-stretch stimulus. The <italic>standard</italic> force field had a constant stiffness value of 85 N/m, and during interaction with this force field, the tactor displacement gain was either 0, 33, 66, or 100 mm/m. We asked participants to distinguish between pairs of force fields, but because in this experiment we were not analyzing stiffness perception, we only used three stiffness values for the <italic>comparison</italic> force field (40, 85, and 130 N/m). We asked participants to perform eight discrete movements into each of the two force fields. We only counted successful movements, namely those that started and ended outside the elastic field and extended at least 20 mm into the force field, and that were completed within 300 msec. We presented a counter of successful movements to the user. After eight probing movements with the first force field, the field automatically switched to the second force field. When participants had performed eight probing movements into the second force field, the screen automatically became white and participants had to choose the force field that they perceived as stiffer.</p><p>The experiment consisted of 132 trials, 24 training trials and 108 test trials, and was divided into two sessions of 66 trials that were completed in two days. Training consisted of four repetitions of the three levels of stiffness for the <italic>comparison</italic> force field, and a 0 mm/m tactor displacement gain for the <italic>standard</italic> force field (participants performed a training set at the beginning of each day). The protocol for the test study consisted of nine repetitions of trials with 12 pairs of force fields (three levels of stiffness for the <italic>comparison</italic> force field and four levels of tactor displacement gain for the standard force field). To dissociate the contribution of the feedforward grip force adjustments, we incorporated stretch-catch probes where we maintained the load force but unexpectedly omitted the skin-stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">HermsdÃ¶rfer and Blankenfeld, 2008</xref>). In these probing movements, participants expected to feel the skin-stretch, as they did in the previous probing movement into the same force field. They therefore predictively adjusted their grip force in anticipation of this stimulus. As it was a stretch-catch probe, there was no skin-stretch to apply a reactive grip force to. In six of the nine trials, we introduced stretch-catch probes in either the second or in the seventh movement, in which we maintained the load force but unexpectedly omitted the skin-stretch. In three of the six trials, the stretch-catch probe was the second probing movement of the total of eight probes, and in the other three, it was the seventh probing movement. Overall, 3.125% of the probes were stretch-catch probes. The idea was to use the predictive grip force adjustment to assess the effect of the added tactile stimulation on the anticipated elastic force field during early and late interaction with each force field. For early interaction, we chose to introduce stretch-catch probes in the second and not the first probing movement since it would have been meaningless to omit the tactile stimulus before participants felt it at least once. All the different conditions were presented in a pseudorandom predetermined order.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Experiment 2</title><p>We designed the second experiment to understand whether the previously reported bias in stiffness perception is due to high-level cognitive processing of the artificial stretch stimulations and occurs immediately, or if it develops with the accumulation of a change in the predictive modulation of the grip force, and potentially as a result of this updated representation.

We chose the <italic>comparison</italic> force field stiffness from a range of values between 40â130 N/m spaced at intervals of 10 N/m. To switch between the two force fields, participants had to exceed at least 30 mm beyond the boundary of the force field by raising the robotic device vertically. Training consisted of two repetitions of the 10 levels of stiffness for the <italic>comparison</italic> force field, and a 0 mm/m tactor displacement gain for the <italic>standard</italic> force field. During training, skin-stretch was never applied, thatÂ is, all the <italic>standard</italic> and <italic>comparison</italic> fields of the training trials had a gain of 0 mm/m.

In the analysis of the stretch-catch probes, the number of movements in each model was N<sub>m</sub>Â =Â 3 for the zero gain case (probing movements 1,2, and 7) and N<sub>m</sub>Â =Â 2 for the other gains (probing movements 2 and 7). In the analysis of the evolution of grip force during all the probing movements within a trial the number of movements was N<sub>m</sub>Â =Â 7 (all the probing movements were included in the model except from the last one). In the analysis of the perception (separately for PSE and JND), we used repeated measures regression with the tactor displacement gain as the independent variable (dfÂ =Â 1), participants as a random factor (dfÂ =Â N<sub>p</sub>-1), and their interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Experiment 1</title><p>We recorded the grip force data and filtered it using the MATLAB function <italic>filtfilt</italic> with a second-order Butterworth low-pass filter, with a cutoff frequency of 12 Hz, resulting in a fourth-order filter, with a cutoff frequency of 9.62 Hz. For each trial, we examined the trajectories of the load force that were generated by the robotic device, the grip force that participants applied, and the tactor displacement. We separated the probing movements and analyzed the grip force trajectories associated with the applied load force and tactor displacement. We identified the start and the end of each probing movement using the load force signal. The load force was equal to zero when the verticalÂ position of the end of the haptic device was greater than zero, and increased as a function of the penetration onceÂ the participants crossed the boundary of the elastic force field. Analyses were only run on data collected during interactions with the <italic>standard</italic> force field because it had a constant stiffness level. Rare cases in which participants did not hold the device adequately and released their grip were excluded from the analysis since we could not measure the appliedÂ grip force in these trials.</p><p>To isolate the predictive component of grip force control due to the skin-stretch stimulus, we performed three analyses. In the first two we only examined the applied grip force from probing movements with stretch-catch probes (second and seventh probes). These two enabled the analysis of only the second and seventh probes. Therefore, to examine the evolution of the predictive grip force over repeated interaction with the elastic force field, we used the approach described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">White et al. (2011)</xref>Â and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kuling et al.Â (2019)</xref> to analyze all the probing movements. This approach makes use of theÂ grip force that participants applied before the movement initiationÂ to calculate the grip force baseline andÂ to estimate the maximumÂ gripÂ force.</p><p>In the first two analyses, for a given trial, we examined the load force applied during interactions with the force field, and the applied grip force. We were interested in evaluating the change in grip force control between the initial and final probing movements of each interaction. To do so, in trials without skin-stretch we compared the first, second, and seventh probing movements. In trials with skin-stretch, we analyzed the second and seventh stretch-catch probes separately, and compared between them. To quantify the control of grip force during repeated exposure to the elastic force field with and without artificial skin-stretch, we performed two analyses: (1) <italic>peak grip force-peak load force ratio</italic> and (2) <italic>grip force-load force regression</italic>.</p><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Peak grip force-peak load force ratio analysis</title><p>We calculated the peak grip force-peak load force ratio of the second and seventh probing movements for each level of tactor displacement gain. We hypothesized that during the second probing movement, participants would have little information about the tactor displacement gain that was used for the <italic>standard</italic> force field, whereas in the seventh probing movement, participants would already have information about the stimulus and likely have formed an estimation of it. To test the significance of the change in the applied grip force due to tactor displacement gain and between probing movements, we used a repeated-measures General Linear Model using the <italic>anovan</italic> MATLAB function. The independent variables were the tactor displacement gain (continuous, dfÂ =Â 1), the probing movement (categorical, two levels - second or seventh, dfÂ =Â 1), and participants (random, dfÂ =Â 9). The model also included interactions between the independent variables.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Grip force-load force regression analysis</title><p>To separate the modulation of grip force in anticipation of the load force from the baseline grip force control, we analyzed the grip force-load force regression, similar to the analysis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flanagan and Wing (1990)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nowak et al. (2002)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leib et al. (2015)</xref>. We fit a two degrees-of-freedom regression line (slope and intercept) to the trajectory in the grip force-load force plane for each of the stretch-catch probes (second and seventh probing movements), as well as for trials with a tactor displacement gain of 0 mm/m. The intercept represents the grip force baseline; thatÂ is, the amount of grip force that participants applied when no external load force was applied by the haptic device. The slope of the regression represents the modulation of the grip force in anticipation of the load force. Rare cases in which the slope was negative (indicating a large phase shift between the load forceÂ and the grip force) were excluded from the analysis.Â We fit a repeated-measures General Linear Model to each the slope and the intercept as the dependent variables in two separate statistical analyses, using the anovan MATLAB function. The independent variables were the tactor displacement gain (continuous, dfÂ =Â 1), the probing movement (categorical, two levels - second or seventh, dfÂ =Â 1), and participants (random, dfÂ =Â 9). The model also included interactions betweenÂ the independent variables.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>Grip force baseline and prediction of the intended peak grip force in all the probing movements in each trial</title><p>We were interested in quantifying the evolution of the different components of the predictive grip force control in all the successful probing movements within a trial, rather than in just the stretch-catch probes. To accomplish this, we followed the approach proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">White et al. (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kuling et al. (2019)</xref>.</p><p>The <italic>grip force baseline</italic> was calculated as the grip force between two consecutive probing movements. We found the time between probing movements (not in contact with the elastic force field) at which the change in the grip force was minimal: we calculated the grip force derivative and detected when it was close to zero (less than 0.1 [N/s]). We then calculated the average grip force value along 200 ms before this time as the <italic>grip force baseline</italic>. We calculated the <italic>grip force baseline</italic> for each participant, for all four tactor displacement gains (0, 33, 66, and 100 mm/m), for each of the first seven probing movements. We omitted the last probing movement from the analysis because in this movement the participants were getting ready to finish the trial and performed irregular probing movements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-4"><title>A multivariate regression model for the intended peak grip force</title><p>We adopted the analysis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">White et al. (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kuling et al.Â (2019)</xref>, where grip force signals were mechanically disturbed by the impact loads following collisions. Similarly, in our study, the grip force measurement is distorted because of the movement of the tactors during the interaction with the force field (see Appendix 1). It is well-documented that an increase in the grip force and itsÂ rate of change precede an increase in theÂ load force during contact with dynamic objects, and therefore, a multivariate linear regression model can be used to predict the intended peak grip force from the grip force and the grip force rate at the initial contact with the object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">White et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kuling et al., 2019</xref>). Such analysis allows for extracting the predictive component of grip force control from probing movements in which skin-stretch was applied by only using information before the stretch stimulation.</p><p>We used data from all the stretch-catch probes to train a multiple regression model that predicts the peak grip force based on the grip force and the grip force rate at contact. The <italic>grip force at contact</italic> was calculated as the grip force at the first sample in contact with the elastic force field. The grip force rate at contact was calculated with a backward difference approximation of the derivative of the grip force signal with respect to time.

(2011)</xref>, and varied only minimally when we fitted the model separately for the second and seventh probing movements or across different tactor displacement gains. Then we used this model to estimate the <italic>intended peak grip force</italic> for all the probing movements.</p><p>The <italic>intended peak grip force</italic> is determined by the <italic>grip force baseline</italic> as well as the modulation of grip force in anticipation of load force. To get a better assessment of the evolution of these two very different components of predictive grip force control, and to compare the results of this analysis to the <italic>grip force-load force regression</italic> analysis that we performed in the stretch-catch probes, we further separated this analysis to <italic>grip force at contact</italic> and <italic>grip force modulation.</italic> We calculated the <italic>grip force modulation</italic> by subtracting the <italic>grip force at contact</italic> from the <italic>intended peak grip force</italic>. For the ideal case of a grip force that linearly depends on load force, the <italic>grip force at contact</italic> is identical to the <italic>intercept</italic> of the <italic>grip force-load force regression</italic>. The <italic>grip force modulation</italic> is related to the <italic>slope</italic> of the regression, but would have to be divided by the <italic>peak load force</italic> to have identical units and meaning. However, this would require the use of a value that occurred during the movement, once the skin-stretch was applied, which we were interested in avoiding. Therefore, we analyzed the <italic>grip force modulation</italic> without information about the amount of load force in each interaction, with a metric that has units of grip force instead of arbitrary units. While it would generally be difficult to interpret this metric based on interactions with elastic objects,Â in our case the extent of all the probing movements was similar. Nevertheless, some qualitative differences between the slope and the <italic>grip force modulation</italic> measurements are likely.</p><p>We fitted a repeated-measures General Linear Model to each the <italic>grip force baseline, intended peak grip force, grip force at contact,</italic> and <italic>grip force modulation</italic> as the dependent variables in four separate statistical analyses, using the anovan MATLAB function. The independent variables were the tactor displacement gain (continuous, dfÂ =Â 1), the probing movement (categorical, seven levels, dfÂ =Â 6), and participants (random, dfÂ =Â 9). The model also included interactions between the independent variables.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Experiment 2</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Perception</title><p>For each participant, we fitted psychometric curves for the probability of responding that the comparison force field was stiffer as a function of the difference between the stiffness of the comparison and the standard force field using the Psignifit toolbox 2.5.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wichmann and Hill, 2001</xref>). We repeated this procedure for every level of tactor displacement gain. To assess the effect of artificial skin-stretch on perception of stiffness, we computed the point of subjective equality (PSE) and the just noticeable difference (JND) of each psychometric curve. The PSE indicates the difference in stiffness levels at which the probability of responding that the comparison force field had a higher level of stiffness was 0.5. A positive PSE value; thatÂ is a rightward shift of the psychometric curve, represents overestimation of the standard force field, and a negative PSE value; thatÂ is a leftward shift indicates an underestimation. The JND was defined to be half the difference between the comparison stiffness levels corresponding to the 0.75 and the 0.25 probabilities of responding that theÂ comparison force field had a higher level of stiffness. The JND indicates the sensitivity of the participant to small differences between the stiffness levels of the two force fields.</p><p>For each of the groups separately, after extracting four PSE and four JND values for each participant (for each level of tactor displacement gain), we fitted regression lines to these values. To test the significance of the change in PSE and JND values due to tactor displacement gain, we used a repeated-measures regression with the <italic>anovan</italic> MATLAB function. The independent variables were the tactor displacement gain (continuous, dfÂ =Â 1), and participants (random, group 1: dfÂ =Â 9, group 2: dfÂ =Â 8). The model also included interactions between the independentÂ variables. In addition, to test if there was a difference between the effect ofÂ the tactor displacement gain onÂ the two groups, we used a nestedÂ repeated-measures General Linear Model. The independent variables were the tactor displacement gain (continuous, dfÂ =Â 1), the group number (categorical, two groups â first or second, dfÂ =Â 1), and participants (random, dfÂ =Â 18).

Unlike in Experiment 1, in which we only analyzed the grip force-load force trajectories of the stretch-catch probes, in Experiment 2 we examined the effect of the additional skin-stretch on the overall grip force trajectories. The grip force trajectories had a non-uniform peaked pattern that appeared predominantly in trials in which skin-stretch was applied. Therefore, we used the MATLAB function <italic>findpeaks</italic> to identify the grip force and load force peaks, and then manually corrected them by visual examination. Trials in which participants probed the force field only once were excluded from the analysis since we could not compare between the first and the last probes. To test the significance of the change in the applied grip force due to tactor displacement gain and between the first and the last probing movements, we used a repeated-measures General Linear Model using the <italic>anovan</italic> MATLAB function.

However, because of the close proximity between the moving tactor and the measurement of grip force, we suspected that there may be an artifact of the tactor movement in our grip force measurements that could affect calculation of the reactive response in both experiments.

First, we identified the onset and end of the second and seventh probes by finding the first and theÂ last sample duringÂ the interactions with the force field. Next, we isolated each trajectory from 50 samples before the onset and 50 samples after the end of the interaction. This measure was taken to ensure that we capture all the grip force data. We then divided each grip force trajectory by the peak load force in the same probe, and time-normalized and aligned each trajectory such that 0 and 1 were the onset and end of the contact with the load force,Â respectively. The next step was to separate the trials according to the tactor displacement gain and average the grip force trajectories from the second and seventh probes (from both regular and stretch-catch probes). To eliminate variability due to baseline grip force level, we subtracted the onset grip force value from each averaged trajectory. Finally, we subtracted the averageÂ grip force trajectoryiesÂ appliedÂ during stretch-catch probes from the averageÂ grip force trajectoriesÂ appliedÂ during regular probes. The resultingÂ trajectoriesÂ representthe reactiveÂ gripÂ force responses to the stretch stimulus from early and late exposure.Â We calculated the early and late reactive responses of each of the participants to each level of tactor displacement gain and averaged them to obtain the average early and late responses across all the participants. </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1âfigure 1</xref> presents these reactive grip force responses from the second (a) and seventh (b) probes for different tactor displacement gains.

The purpose of this manual interaction was to ensure that we used a human-like probing trajectory similar to the ones that the participants employed during Experiment 1, and that the trajectories of the movement of the tactor would be similar to those that were applied during Experiment 1. The analysis of grip force trajectories was identical to that in Reactive Experiment 1, including time-normalization and alignment of the signals, division by the peak load force, and averaging across repetitions.

At the beginning of an interaction, a tactile stimulus is similar to any mechanical perturbation. It is well-established in the literature that during unexpected load force perturbations, the grip force is automatically adjusted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cole and Abbs, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johansson and Cole, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cole and Johansson, 1993</xref>). Recordings from tactile afferents during trapezoidal load force perturbations to the digit with different rates of loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Macefield et al., 1996</xref>) revealed that the mean firing rate was scaled by the slope of the loading ramp. This prompted our initial prediction that the reactive response would be an increase in the grip force. Furthermore, we posited that the size of this effect would increase linearly with increasing tactor displacement gain, and would appear more than 90 ms after stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dimitriou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pruszynski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crevecoeur et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crevecoeur et al., 2017</xref>). Instead, in response to the artificial stretch, participants first strongly decreased their grip force and only then increased it, resulting in an overall moderate increase that depended linearly on the tactor displacement gain. The peak of the decrease was roughly in the middle of the probe, close to the peak of the stretch and the load force, and about 150 ms from the onset of the stretch. The peak of the increase was after the stretch, and theÂ load force returned to zero about 300 ms from the onset of the stretch.</p><p>In both reactive experiments, the magnitude of the initial decrease and the subsequent increase of the grip force was greater with larger tactor displacement gain. In addition, the results of Reactive Experiment 2 indicates that the response is more pronounced when the baseline grip force is larger. This can explain the increase in the differences between the peak decrease and peak increase in the second and seventh reactive responses in Reactive Experiment 1. The predictive grip force increased between the second and seventh probing movements. Therefore, with a larger underlying grip force, the magnitude of the reactive response is also expected to increase.</p><p>The trajectory of the reactive grip force control was similar between active interaction with the elastic force field (Reactive Experiment 1), and maintenance of constant grip force (Reactive Experiment 2). In the former, participants could anticipate the stretch based on their planned movement trajectories, especially during the seventh probes. Conversely, in the latter, the trajectory of the tactor displacement was surprising. Nevertheless, while it is impossible to compare these responses directly due to different units, the trajectories are qualitatively similar.</p><p>We do not have a conclusive explanation as to why the reaction to skin-stretch would be an initial release of grip. One possibility is that the release was the result of an unpleasant or painful interaction, however none of our participants indicated any discomfort, nor did they report any when asked about their experience at the end of the experiment. Another possibility is the attempt to reduce the contact impedance between the fingers and the device due to possible contact instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">White et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that the reactive grip force response we report here may be a specific response to our skin-stretch device, and not a general response to any artificial tactile stimulation. In addition, these results should be considered with caution because of the resemblance between the reactive grip force trajectories and the trajectories of the artifact of tactor movement, which we characterized in the two control experiments. However, the participantsâ reactive response was much greater than the artifact, suggesting that the artifact is not a plausible explanation for the entire response. Future studies, using other designs of tactile stimulation devices, are needed to pinpoint the origin of this surprising reactive pattern.</p></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="appendix-2"><title>Appendix 2</title><boxed-text><sec id="s15" sec-type="appendix"><title>The mapping between the actual grip force and the downscaled measurement of the grip force</title><p>Due to the placement of the force sensor that we embedded in our skin-stretch device, a downscaled version of the grip force was measured.

We disconnected the skin-stretch device from the haptic device, and asked each of five participants to exert normal force on the device five times (without tactor displacement movement). We asked five different users to participate in this calibration experiment because the dimensions of the finger and other factors influence the mapping between the actual applied forces and the forces that are measured with our embedded force sensor. The recorded grip forces in this control experiment were in the range observed in our experiments.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2âfigure 2a</xref> presents the grip force recorded by each of the two force sensors as a function of time of a typical participant, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2âfigure 2b</xref> depicts all the datapoints of all the participants (color-coded).

Nevertheless, our experimental design is entirely within-participants, and therefore, the interpretation of all the trends that we observed in this study is not affected by this choice.</p></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52653.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Vaadia</surname><given-names>Eilon</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>The Hebrew University of Jerusalem</institution><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Vaadia</surname><given-names>Eilon</given-names> </name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>The Hebrew University of Jerusalem</institution><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>LefÃ¨vre</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names> </name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>UniversitÃ© Catholique de Louvain</institution><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The revisions have really helped clarify the significance of the paper. The study examines the control of the grip force (for example picking a cup of coffee), an action that requires accurate modulation of the grip to ensure the force is appropriate and well-timed to prevent the cup from slipping, and at the same time manipulate the cup in space. This problem is quite general for sensorimotor control. The major challenge is not just to control the immediate action, but also to anticipate the future.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Stretching the skin of the fingertip creates a perceptual and motor illusion of touching a harder spring&quot; for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Eilon Vaadia as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>Three reviewers read the manuscript. All three agree that the experiments address a fundamental question. On the positive side, we conclude that the researchers use a neat system to investigate the effect of stretching the skin of the fingertip while performing movements in a force field. The force field simulated the stiffness of a spring in the virtual environment. The goal was to determine how the tactile and kinesthetic feedbacks are combined and influence both stiffness perception and grip force control. They monitored the actions of the subjects as well as the reported perception of stiffness in different conditions and two versions of experiments.</p><p>As a whole, this seems to be a detailed set of experiments. Answering the research questions may be quite important and significant as a demonstration of the notion that perception and sensorimotor learning do not evolve merely by some higher level of sensory processing, but by an active and adaptive process of integrative nature, involving estimation of the consequences of actions and adaptation of sensorimotor internal model.</p><p>However, the only truly innovative part comes from Experiment 2, while the results of Experiment 1 are not new (credit is given to the PI of the current paper for the previous publication). The results of Experiment 2 include a robust and original data showing a negative reactive response of Grip Force to skin stretching, but Experiment 2 requires a more serious treatment (see comments below).</p><p>In general, the three reviewers had several major concerns. Some of these concerns could possibly be addressed by extensive revisions. But we regret that some more critical concerns, raised by two of the reviewers led to our decision to reject the paper.</p><p>While we agree that the topic is interesting, we estimate that the necessary revisions are far too extensive to allow in a reasonable time frame a resubmission of a revised manuscript. We therefore reject your manuscript in the present form. If you decide to conduct additional control experiments, add and clarify some analyses, edit the figures, clarify interpretations, and re-write the paper using a more explicable and comprehensive approach, which facilitates understanding the message, on one hand, and help the general reader following the technical details on the other, we would consider evaluating such an improved manuscript as an entirely new submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the study is the impact of skin stretch on perception and action. But this is not new (Experiment 1). We have known for some time that skin conformance biases tactile judgement (Vega Bermudez and Johnson, 2004). The group has studied the effects of the skin stretch device on the perception of stiffness and motor control, as previously published in IEEE (e.g. Quek et al., 2014). From my understanding of the manuscript, the current contribution to this interesting phenomenon is only incremental with regards to such previous work published by the group. This concern does not address research question of Experiment 2, but unfortunately, the results of the experimenters are not fully understood and require some more control experiments (see below).</p><p>2) While the experiments, especially Experiment 2 are in some way elegant, they did neither lead to conclusive and reliable answers nor a comprehensive notion of the neuronal process that explains the so-called &quot;illusion&quot;. As listed below, some more analyses and control experiments are needed to reach a clear a convincing conclusion.</p><p>3) The three reviewers complain that the paper is quite hard to read. We believe that more efforts are necessary to communicate the results and interpretations to the general reader who is less of an expert in the details of the specific technology and methodologies used here. A substantial revision of the manuscript structure and style is required. Some technical issues (like the artefact problem) could be moved to supplementary materials. Some of the analyses (like the regression to find the intercept in Experiment 2) could be better explained to help the reader follow the rationale and convince that the goal of Experiment 2 is indeed achieved reliably.</p><p>In general, the manuscript suffers unclear and complex wording; the introduction is inflated, providing many dissociated ideas and concepts without a clear narrative. The results section is overly long and detailed, while some analyses are missing and some could be moved to supplementary section (for the benefit of experts).</p><p>4) One of the reviewers felt that the impact of the study in designing prosthetic limbs and surgical devices is overstated, as the current study doesn't provide any new tools or opportunities for these developments with regards to the state of the art. If the authors wish to promote the usage of skin stretching to improve e.g. control of prosthetic limbs, they should study that.</p><p>5) The authors are advised to better describe and justify their statistical tests and presentation of the data. See some derails below.</p><p>6) Why did the authors choose ANCOVA (and not ANOVA), what do the degrees of freedom represent? How exactly was the interaction of interest constructed?</p><p>7) Description of Experiment 1 in the results section is unclear: &quot;In some of the force fields, they also received skin- stretch feedback via a custom-build tactile stimulation device&quot; In which of the force fields?</p><p>8) The labelling of the axes is sometimes unclear e.g. Fig 2A - the 'probability of responding comparison' is not well defined.</p><p>9) Authors claim that increasing the skin-stretch gain causes more grip force peaks to appear. This is not evident from the presented figure (Figure 3). How was it quantified? By visual inspection?</p><p>10) The explanation of how the reactive component of grip force control was isolated in Experiment 2 should be made more clearly.</p><p>11) Why do we only see the phase differences between grip force and load force in Experiment 1 (Figure 3), but not in Experiment 2 (Figure 5)? Similarly, why is the 'irregular pattern of decrease accompanied by increase' only apparent in Experiment 2? Weren't those experiments performed in the exact same way, except for the controlled number of probing movements and presence of the stretch-catch trials?</p><p>12) The quantitative analysis of the peak grip force to peak load force ratio is very problematic in this paper because the tactile stimulation generates major time shifts between Grip Force and Load Force (and multiple peaks for the Grip Force). Therefore, the interpretation of this ratio is very hard at this stage. The reported effects could be due to the predictive feedforward component or to the reactive feedback component or to their interaction. This is why the panel b of Figure 6, for instance, is probably misleading, because there is an asynchrony between Grip Force and Load force in the data (see also comments below). The authors overlook this problem of asynchrony in the paper (see Discussion section: this major issue of asynchrony and multiple peaks in the Grip Force response is ignored).</p><p>13) The last panel of Figure 5 is a very important result from this study: the 7th stretch-catch probe shows that the feedforward predictive component of the Grip Force (in anticipation of a skin stretch that does not occur) is characterized by a single peak (and is larger than if no skin stretch is expected). It also shows that the reactive tactile feedback response reduces the Grip Force response (see double peaks in other trials, same panel). This reduction of the Grip Force was not expected and the authors should better convince the reader that it is not an artefact of their stimulus. I suggest for instance to test the response to the skin stretching when maintaining a STABLE Grip Force, at different typical values, within the Grip Force range tested in the study. Is the Grip Force response also a reduction in this case?</p><p>14) The authors mention in the discussion section that: &quot;The reactive grip force pattern was very surprising&quot;. Indeed, they expected an increase in Grip Force instead of a decrease in reaction to the tactile stimulus. The authors should consider the possibility that the tactile reactive feedback (reduction of Grip Force) might be due to a general mechanism that could be some kind of response to a nociceptive input when there is a mismatch between what you expect from prediction and what you feel at your fingertips (think about a bug that you hold between your fingers and that tries to escape). This response could be specific to the situation when the Grip Force varies (active movement) and not during static holding (see control experiment suggested above) or could alternatively be present in both conditions.</p><p>15) The authors also mention in the discussion section: &quot;This prompted our initial prediction that the reactive response would be an increase in grip force 50-90 msec after the stimulation&quot;. This prediction is not correct on the basis of existing literature (Dimitriou et al., 2012; Pruszynski et al., 2016, Crevecoeur et al., 2017). Indeed, the measured EMG response to a tactile stimulus is around 90ms. Therefore, a change in Grip Force is not expected before 120 to 150ms, which is compatible with the reported data for the peak of decrease: &quot;The peak of the decrease was roughly in the middle of the probe, close to the peak of the stretch and the load force, and about 150 msec from the onset of the stretch.&quot;.</p><p>16) What is puzzling in the data is that the subjects are exposed to a repetition of tactile stimuli but lack adapting their motor response efficiently. Indeed, they cannot inhibit the reduction in Grip Force due to the tactile feedback and consequently show a local minimum of Grip Force when the Load Force is maximum. This is clearly a very bad strategy that is repeated by the subjects who fail to adapt in an efficient way (they react to the increased uncertainty due to the tactile stimulus by boosting the feedforward component). It can only be partially compensated by increasing the feedforward predictive Grip Force component (to compensate for the expected and inefficient reduction of Grip Force after the tactile stimulus) (subsection âSkin-stretch increased the feedforward component of grip forceâ).</p><p>17) In Experiment 1, the subjects performed several probing movements for each stimulus. When there was a tactile stimulus, they adapted their strategy across repetitions (see Figure 3 last panel and Figure 4B for a comparison between first and last ratio). Therefore, it is not clear what induced the change in PSE. Is it the tactile stimulus or is it the build-up of increased feedforward Grip Force across repetitions with the tactile stimulus? A control experiment involving a test with a single probing movement is necessary from my point of view. It would allow disambiguating the role of the tactile stimulus versus feedforward component in assessing stiffness. An alternative idea would be to test perception of stiffness specifically during catch trials (it remains to be determined how this could be done in a protocol). It would also allow separating the feedforward component (that is increased in catch trials) from the feedback reactive response to the tactile stimulus.</p><p>18) In the discussion section the authors mention that: &quot;another possible explanation for the increased grip force is that the motor system of the participants could have interpreted the additional tactile stimuli as indication of a more slippery contact surface, which would have thus been entirely unrelated to the perceptual illusion of a harder spring.&quot; This is a very interesting idea. I encourage the authors to add analyses related to the correlation between the Grip Force and Load Force (phase diagram) during the first open-loop phase of the probing movements (Johansson and Westling, 1984). The correlation between the derivative of GF and LF should also be very informative. This would allow assessing the feedforward predictive component of Grip Force even during standard probing movements (Experiment 1) and not only during catch trials (Experiment 2).</p><p>19) In the discussion section, the authors mention that: &quot;Future studies, probably with other designs of tactile stimulation devices, are needed to pinpoint the origin of this surprising reactive pattern.&quot; Given that the same group already reported the finding of the change in the perception of stiffness following a tactile stimulus (papers by Quek et al.), I wonder whether better characterizing and understanding the nature of the reactive pattern is not necessary to make the present study truly new, interesting and innovating.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Stretching the skin immediately increases perceived stiffness and slowly increases the predictive control of grip force&quot; for further consideration by eLife. Your revised article has been evaluated by Richard Ivry (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, including Eilon Vaadia (the Reviewing Editor).</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors address a specific question, related to control of the grip force that all of us use with no difficulty when we grasp an object like a paper-cup of coffee. This action requires accurate modulation of the grip, at an accurate and well-timed force, to prevent the cup slippage, (spilling the coffee), and at the same time avoiding crushing the paper cup. Investigation of this question is related to many aspects of action-perception behaviors and beyond. The major challenge in all cases is not just the action itself but in the prediction of the future, given the present (and past) concepts and actions. Therefore, the potential projection of this study to more general science fields is part of the general significance of this study.</p><p>Here, the authors investigated the effect of stretching the skin of the fingertip while performing movements in a force field. The force field simulated the stiffness of a spring in a virtual environment. The goal was to determine how the tactile and kinesthetic feedbacks are combined and influence both stiffness perception and grip force control. The authors also used catch trials to try and separate the three components of the Grip Force response: predictive feedforward baseline, predictive feedforward modulation and reactive feedback. The authors address an interesting and very important question related to the role of tactile inputs on perception and motor control. Experiment 2 based on stretch-catch probes reports very robust and original data showing a negative reactive response of Grip Force to skin stretching. The authors also performed several control experiments to better assess the limitations of their finger stimulation device. The results on the influence of tactile stimulation on the perception of stiffness are very robust and confirm earlier reports from the same group. The demonstration that higher levels of artificial skin-stretch increased the predictive grip force modulation in anticipation of the load force and the finding that the increase developed throughout each trial are important. Thus, it is also important to improve and quantify the temporal aspects of the measurements.</p><p>The manuscript has been greatly improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance.</p><p>1) We ask that you provide a better characterization of the evolution of grip force over time.</p><p>2) The results on the influence of tactile stimulation on the perception of stiffness are very robust and confirm earlier reports from the same group. In contrast, the results on the influence of tactile stimulation on Grip Force control remain very difficult to interpret despite the additional control experiments performed by the authors. This could be partly improved by conducting additional analyses as suggested below.</p><p>a) In their analyses, the authors try to separate the baseline and modulation of Grip Force (Results section): &quot;To separate between the effect on each of these two components, we performed a linear regression analysis in the grip force-load force plane.&quot; This is illustrated in Figure 4 with phase plots of Grip Force versus Load Force. However, this figure shows that the relationship between Grip Force and Load Force is not very linear. This is also clear in Figure 2 because the Load Force profile is very stereotyped and short in time in comparison with the Grip Force profile that starts increasing well before the increase in Load Force in anticipation of the contact with the virtual object. This observation is classical in all studies investigating collisions between (virtual) objects. In that case, it is much more appropriate to measure the baseline Grip Force as the average Grip Force level between two consecutive trials (when Grip Force does not vary much over time, see Figure 2D). It is also more appropriate to measure the modulation when both Grip Force and Load Force vary quickly during the early part of the contact. This kind of analysis was recently used in the recent paper of Kuling et al., (2019). In the same paper, these authors also propose a method to compute an estimate of the predictive component of the feedforward Grip Force on the basis of a regression analysis taking into account Grip Force at contact (with the virtual object) and the derivative of Grip Force at contact. This method was validated on catch trials when there was no contact with a virtual object. This method is interesting in the context of the present study because it would allow further investigating the gradual build-up of Grip Force feedforward component across the repetition of trials with tactor displacement. The following reference could also be cited (Grip Force during collisions in a virtual reality setup): White et al., (2011).</p><p>b) In the Materials and methods section and throughout the paper, the authors acknowledge that their &quot;device only measures a downscaled version of the grip force&quot;. Of course, this introduces a major limitation in the interpretation of the experimental data related to the measure of Grip Force. At this stage, there is no quantification of the relationship between actual Grip Force and the measured downscaled version of Grip Force. We do not even know if the relationship will be linear or non-linear given the complex mechanics of the object / finger pad interaction (pressure is not constant in the contact area). In their paper, the authors tried to address this important issue but in a way that is not satisfactory given the importance of Grip Force measurement. I strongly recommend performing the following very simple control experiment to clarify this issue. The authors should simply disconnect their manipulandum device from the haptic robot and put it flat on an extra (1D) force sensor. They should then instruct a few human subjects to exert a pure normal (vertical) force on the device over the range of recorded Grip Force in the experiments. They should then compare the Grip Force measure with the device with the true total normal force measured by the additional force sensor to assess the &quot;downscaling&quot; of the measured Grip Force with the device. This could be done with or without tactor displacement for a more thorough control measurement.</p><p>3) The experiment does not show directly any &quot;internal representations&quot; of the well-demonstrated illusion. In general, the term It is an over-used, and means very little. Of course, the authors can see it their way, and I do not demand the elimination of terms. I counted 28 times (twice in the Abstract!) I do recommend to reduce this number or abandoning this term, leaving the issue of neuronal basis to speculation/interpretation alone. For example, the text of the authors:</p><p>&quot;This suggests that the perceptual illusion is a result of a high-level cognitive process, independent of the gradual development of the internal representation that causes an increase in the predictive grip force control.</p><p>Could be simpler... like:</p><p>&quot;This suggests that the perceptual illusion is a result of an adaptive predictive process, independent of the gradual development of grip force control during the action&quot;.</p><p>4) The results on the influence of tactile stimulation on the perception of stiffness are very robust and confirm earlier reports from the same group. In contrast, the results on the influence of tactile stimulation on Grip Force control remain very difficult to interpret despite the additional control experiments performed by the authors. This could be partly improved by conducting additional analyses as suggested below.</p><p>5) The authors report (Results section) that &quot;participants applied more grip force per amount of kinesthetic load force when interacting with force fields with higher levels of tactor displacement gain.&quot; This observation makes sense because the skin stretch induces a large decrease of Grip Force around the peak of Load Force. It is particularly clear for large tactor displacement (100 mm/m, Figure 2D) where there is a clear dip in Grip Force around the peak of Load Force (see comparison between trial 6 and 7 in Figure 2D: difference in Grip Force of 2 N around the peak Load Force). Therefore, this dip in Grip Force around the peak of Load Force increases the risk of slippage which is compensated by an increase of baseline and feedforward Grip Force components (see comments below).</p><p>6) Very interestingly, the authors mention in the same paragraph (Results section) that &quot;This trend is significantly higher in the seventh probing compared to the second&quot;. This is a very important observation because it shows that the increase in baseline and feedforward Grip Force components is clearly decoupled from the perception of increased stiffness that is shown in the manuscript to take place after a single trial as demonstrated in Experiment 2 and Figure 5 (subsection âSkin-stretch caused perceptual overestimation of stiffnessâ): &quot;We can therefore conclude that the perceptual illusion was formed immediately, after a single probing movement into the force field, and before the internal representation that we identified in Experiment 1 was formed. &quot;</p><p>7) Results section: &quot;This suggests that following repeated exposure to the artificial skin-stretch stimulation, the participants either increased their internal representation of the expected force (likely due to increase in the representation of the stiffness of the field) or of the slipperiness of the device.&quot; Again, see comments above: the fact that the perception of stiffness occurs much faster and that the measured effects on catch trials 2 and 7 (Figure 4F) are very different seems to demonstrate that the reported effect is not due to gradual increase in the internal representation of the expected force but more likely to a slower adaptation of Grip Force potentially due to an increased risk of slippage (&quot;reactive&quot; dip in Grip Force).</p><p>8) One key experiment for the interpretation of the Grip Force data of the current study is the Reactive Experiment 2 reported in the Supplementary File. I believe that it is crucial to fully exploit this data set to better understand the effect of tactor displacement on the &quot;reflex&quot; Grip Force response reported in the main experiment. I even think that a better controlled experiment based on the analyses of this Reactive Experiment should be published as an independent study before publishing the current set of experiments that cannot be satisfactorily interpreted in terms of Grip Force control at this stage. I am convinced that it could be a major contribution to our understanding of the very important question related to the role of proprioceptive versus tactile feedbacks in motor control (Crevecoeur et al., 2017). The device used by the authors allows investigating the impact of a pure tactile stimulation on the motor response (Grip Force reaction). I recommend redoing this reactive experiment and recording EMG signals together with the measurement of the Grip Force reaction. This will allow measuring the delay of the motor response and better characterizing the timing of the reaction which is crucial to understand the results of the current study (the delay seems very short in Figure 10: shorter than 20ms?).</p><p>9) Figure 7 shows the ratio between peak Grip Force and peak Load Force. It is not clear what this analysis means because in Figure 6 the peaks of Grip Force and Load Force are not synchronized! In the current version of the manuscript (and reported analyses) the interpretation of Grip Force data is very weak (see also Materials and methods section).</p><p>10) In the Discussion section, the authors mention that &quot;in our case, increasing the grip force reached the perceptual illusion over repeated interactions&quot;. I am not sure that the interpretation of the authors is correct (see also comments above) because there is an illusion in terms of stiffness but not in terms of tactile sensation: there is an actual stretch of the skin, a &quot;reflex&quot; dip in Grip Force, and therefore a sensation of partial slip or strain in the fingertip. Moreover, the time course of the two phenomena is very different: immediate illusion in comparison with progressive build-up of Grip Force anticipation, pointing to very likely different mechanisms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52653.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As a whole, this seems to be a detailed set of experiments.

In the original submission, we failed to highlight that while the perceptual augmentation was well documented in (Quek et al., 2014), the effect of artificial skin-stretch on grip force was only addressed at the level of an increase in the average grip force (Quek et al., 2015a, 2015b), whereas the modulation of grip force with load force and stretch was not studied. Our original Experiment 1 addressed this modulation in a setting in which participants used free exploration to assess the stiffness of the force fields. Meaning, participants were free to probe the force field as many times as they wished. The results of this experiment led to the design of the original Experiment 2, which addressed this question in further detail by investigating the effect of the skin-stretch on each of the components of grip force control separately. Based on these analyses, we uncovered the effect of skin-stretch on the internal representation that is used in grip force control. In this new submission, we reorganized the paper, such that this novel result is presented first. Additionally, we added a new group to the original Experiment 1 such that we were able characterize the time scale of the formation of the perceptual effects of artificial skin-stretch during subsequent probing.</p><p>The main findings of the new revised submission are as follows:</p><p>1) High levels of artificial skin-stretch increased the predictive grip force modulation in anticipation of the load force. The increase developed throughout each trial with repeated probing interactions with the same elastic force field.</p><p>2) Artificial skin-stretch caused participants to not reduce their safety margin, even after an internal representation was formed. This result is in contrast to the well-known (and reproduced in our study) result that, without artificial stretch of the skin of the fingertips, during repeated interactions with the same elastic force field, the safety margin is reduced.</p><p>3) The perceptual augmentation of stiffness (the illusion of touching a harder spring) is formed immediately upon the initial contact with the object, and does not depend on the build-up of the internal representation that is used for the predictive control of grip force.</p><p>4) The reaction to stretch of the skin of the fingertips is a release of the grip. However, in spite of running several control experiments, we are still unsure if this response is specific to our device or a general response to artificial stretch. As such, this result leaves more open questions than answers, and we have moved the entire analysis and discussion about this result to the Supplementary file.</p><p>We completely reorganized the paper and added clarifications of the contribution to the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the experiments, especially experiment-2 are in some way elegant, they did neither lead to conclusive and reliable answers nor a comprehensive notion of the neuronal process that explains the so-called &quot;illusion&quot;. As listed below, some more analyses and control experiments are needed to reach a clear a convincing conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point, and agree that our behavioral approach cannot pinpoint the neuronal processes that explain the perceptual illusion. However, the new perceptual experiment (new Experiment 2, Group 1) sheds light on the forming of the illusion. We found that it is built almost entirely after a single probing movement into the elastic force field, and does not depend on the slower formation of the internal representation that is reflected in the predictive grip force control. These findings lead to important questions for future work on identifying the specific neural pathways that allow for such fast formation of the perceptual illusion that is, at least partially, dissociated from the slower effect on grip force. We clarified this point in the revised discussion section:</p><p>âConsistently with previous studies (Vega-Bermudez and Johnson, 2004; Quek et al., 2013, 2014; Park, Oh and Tan, 2018), we found that adding artificial tactile feedback augmented the perceived stiffness, and that the augmentation was a linear function of the tactor displacement gain. Our findings show that this perceptual illusion is immediate, and does not depend on repeated interactions with the force field. This suggests that the perceptual illusion is a result of a high-level cognitive process, independent of the gradual development of the internal representation that causes an increase in the predictive grip force control. This is consistent with recent findings regarding the fast timescales of explicit cognitive strategies in motor adaptation, compared to the slower implicit adaptation mechanisms (McDougle, Bond and Taylor, 2015). In fact, the immediate perceptual effect observed in Experiment 2 was evident after the participants were exposed to exactly the same amount of information as the participants in Experiment 1 had when they planned their control of grip force in the second stretch catch probe. In the second stretch catch probe, only the baseline grip force component, which reflects uncertainty, increased due to the skin-stretch, and the modulation, which reflects the internal representation, was independent of the amount of stretch. Conversely, the perceptual effect after one probe was similar to the perceptual effect after free exploration, and was linearly related to the amount of stretch.&quot;</p><p>We also added the requested control experiments (see response to comment 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The three reviewers complain that the paper is quite hard to read. We believe that more efforts are necessary to communicate the results and interpretations to the general reader who is less of an expert in the details of the specific technology and methodologies used here. A substantial revision of the manuscript structure and style is required. Some technical issues (like the artefact problem) could be moved to supplementary materials. Some of the analyses (like the regression to find the intercept in Experiment 2) could be better explained to help the reader follow the rationale and convince that the goal of Experiment 2 is indeed achieved reliably.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified the rationale behind this regression analysis in the Introduction and the results section:</p><p>âFeedforward control is used to adjust our grip force in accordance with the expected slipperiness and weight (or load force) of the object (Flanagan and Wing, 1990, 1997; Flanagan et al., 2003; Danion and Sarlegna, 2007; Danion, Descoins and Bootsma, 2009; Leib, Karniel and Nisky, 2015; Leib, Rubin and Nisky, 2018; White et al., 2018). Baseline grip force is maintained to create a safety margin, and is increased when one experiences uncertainty regarding the load force (Gibo, Bastian and Okamura, 2013; Hadjiosif and Smith, 2015). Predictive modulation is calculated based on an internal representation of the object dynamics, which is learned by the nervous system (Johansson and Cole, 1992; Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi, 1994; Kawato, 1999; Davidson and Wolpert, 2004) and is updated during repeated interactions (Donchin, Francis and Shadmehr, 2003).â</p><p>âThe intercept of this regression represents the baseline grip force; i.e. the amount of grip force that was applied by the participants when no external load force was applied by the haptic device. The slope of the regression represents the modulation of the grip force that anticipates the load force. In typical manipulation tasks of grasping and lifting, the slope is linked to the âslip ratioâ of an object (Flanagan and Wing, 1990), and when interacting with elastic objects, to a combined effect of the slip ratio and the internal representation of the load force (Flanagan and Wing, 1990; Leib et al., 2018, 2015).</p><p>In addition, we highlighted the calculation of the slope and the intercept of the grip force load force regression in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>âTo separate the modulation of grip force in anticipation of the load force from the baseline grip force control, we analyzed the grip force-load force regression, similar to the analysis in (Flanagan and Wing, 1990; Leib et al., 2015; Nowak et al., 2002). We fit a two degrees-offreedom regression line (slope and intercept) to the trajectory in the grip force-load force plane for each of the stretch catch probes (second and seventh probing movements), as well as for trials with a tactor displacement gain of 0 mm/m. The intercept represents the baseline grip force; i.e. the amount of grip force that participants applied when no external load force was applied by the haptic device. The slope of the regression represents the modulation of the grip force in anticipation of the load force.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, the manuscript suffers unclear and complex wording; the introduction is inflated, providing many dissociated ideas and concepts without a clear narrative.

How exactly was the interaction of interest constructed?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for using potentially confusing terminology. The analyses that were originally performed were generalized linear model (with continuous, categorical, and random factors) or regression with repeated measures (with continuous and random factors). We added a clarification in the subsection âData analysisâ:</p><p>âIn the following analyses of grip force control, for each of the dependent variables separately, we used a generalized linear model with a continuous factor (tactor displacement gain, df=1), a categorical factor (initial and late probing, df=1), a random factor (participants, df=N-1, where N is the number of the participants in each experimental group), and their respective interactions.

The model also included interactions between independent variables.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Description of Experiment 1 in the results section is unclear: &quot;In some of the force fields, they also received skin- stretch feedback via a custom-build tactile stimulation device&quot; In which of the force fields?</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the text to clarify this point:</p><p>âIn each trial, participants interacted with two different force fields, designated standard and comparison, and decided which force field had a higher level of stiffness. In addition to the load force feedback, when interacting with the standard force field (which had a constant stiffness value of 85 N/m), the skin of the thumb and index finger was stretched using a skinstretch device [Fig. 1]. The stiffness of the comparison force field was chosen from three stiffness values (40, 85, and 130 N/m). The magnitude of both the stretch and the load force was proportional to the penetration depth into the virtual elastic force field. The gain of the skin-stretch stimulation (i.e. the amount of skin-stretch relative to the penetration depth) was chosen from four possible values (0, 33, 66, and 100 mm/m). In each trial, participants made eight discrete movements into each of the two force fields. In some of the trials, either the second or the seventh probing movements into the standard force field, were stretchcatch probes. In these stretch-catch probes, we maintained the load force but omitted the skin-stretch. The purpose of the stretch-catch probes was to allow us to investigate the predictive component of grip force control. To identify the predictive component, which develops with repeated stretch stimulation, we compared between the grip force that was applied throughout the second and the seventh stretch-catch probe in a given trial.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The labelling of the axes is sometimes unclear e.g. Fig 2A - the 'probability of responding comparison' is not well defined.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the label to:</p><p>âp (answer comparison&gt;standard)â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Authors claim that increasing the skin-stretch gain causes more grip force peaks to appear. This is not evident from the presented figure (Figure 3). How was it quantified? By visual inspection?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this lack of clarity. Indeed, this observation was qualitative rather than quantitative, and was supported by a visual examination. It was impossible to quantify this effect because we suspected that in the free exploration probing, the peaks that belonged to subsequent probing movements were fused. This was one of the observations that led to the design of the more structured experiment (now Experiment 1), with sufficient separation time between subsequent peaks and the use of stretch-catch probes. We revised the relevant paragraph to clarify this point:</p><p>âFig. 6 presents examples of grip force, load force, and tactor displacement trajectories of a participant from the free exploration group (Group 2). As in Experiment 1, a visual examination of the trajectories revealed a non-uniform peak pattern that appeared predominantly in trials in which skin-stretch was applied. For example, the grip force signals in Fig. 6(c) and 6(d) show that increasing the tactor displacement gain caused several grip force peaks around the load force peaks. In addition, the grip force trajectories give the impression of the presence of phase shifts between grip force responses and the load force due to added tactor displacement. However, we suggest that in reality participantsâ grip force in Experiments 1 and 2 were similar. In Experiment 1, participants made discrete probing movements into the force field, leading to the clear grip force trajectories seen in Fig. 2. In Experiment 2, however, participants used free exploration and the probing movements lacked the separation that existed in Experiment 1. In Experiment 1, we observed two peaks in the grip force trajectories when high tactor displacement gains were applied. We hypothesized that this pattern was due to the reactive grip force component and an artifact specific to our skin-stretch device (see SF for more information). We therefore posit that the free exploration used in Experiment 2 caused the second peak of each probing to fuse with the first peak of the subsequent probing.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The explanation of how the reactive component of grip force control was isolated in Experiment 2 should be made more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the explanation of how the reactive component was isolated. In addition, following restructuring and focusing of the paper, we moved this entire analysis and interpretation of the reactive component to the Supplementary file. The new explanation of the analysis is as follows:</p><p>âFirst, we identified the onset and end of the second and seventh probing movements by finding the first and last sample in the second and seventh interactions with the force field. Next, we isolated each trajectory from 50 samples before the onset and 50 samples after the end of the interaction. This measure was taken to ensure that we capture all the grip force data. We then divided each grip force trajectory by the peak load force in the same probe, and time-normalized and aligned each trajectory such that 0 and 1 were the onset and end of the contact with the load force. The next step was to separate the trials according to the tactor displacement gain and average the grip force trajectories from the second and seventh probing movements (from both regular and stretch-catch probe trials). To eliminate variability due to baseline grip force level, we subtracted the onset grip force value from each averaged trajectory. Finally, we subtracted the average stretch-catch probes grip force trajectory from the average normal probes grip force trajectory. The remaining signal was the reactive effect of the stretch stimulus on grip force from the early and the late exposure to each tactor displacement gain.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Why do we only see the phase differences between grip force and load force in Experiment 1 (Figure 3), but not in Experiment 2 (Figure 5)? Similarly, why is the 'irregular pattern of decrease accompanied by increase' only apparent in Experiment 2? Weren't those experiments performed in the exact same way, except for the controlled number of probing movements and presence of the stretch-catch trials?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that these two observations (the apparent phase shift and the irregular pattern of decrease accompanied by an increase) are in fact both a result of the same phenomenon. The lower panels in Figure 2 depict a double peaked grip force pattern in the cases of applied skinstretch. We believe that in Fig. 6, what seems as an apparent phase shift is in fact the same picture as in Fig. 2, but the second peak of each probing is fused with the first peak of the subsequent probing. We revised the text describing these phenomena such that the link between them is clearer. The entire Supplementary file deals with the reactive and control experiments, and specifically, the following paragraph discusses the double peaked pattern:</p><p>âFig. 6 presents examples of grip force, load force, and tactor displacement trajectories of a participant from the free exploration group (Group 2). As in Experiment 1, a visual examination of the trajectories revealed a non-uniform peak pattern that appeared predominantly in trials in which skin-stretch was applied. For example, the grip force signals in Fig. 6(c) and 6(d) show that increasing the tactor displacement gain caused several grip force peaks around the load force peaks.

Therefore, the interpretation of this ratio is very hard at this stage. The reported effects could be due to the predictive feedforward component or to the reactive feedback component or to their interaction. This is why the panel b of Figure 6, for instance, is probably misleading, because there is an asynchrony between Grip Force and Load force in the data (see also comments below). The authors overlook this problem of asynchrony in the paper (see Discussion section: this major issue of asynchrony and multiple peaks in the Grip Force response is ignored).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very important point.</p><p>In Experiment 1 (original Experiment 2) we conducted the peak grip force-peak load force ratio analysis only on stretch catch probes (probes without artificial skin-stretch) and therefore we did not have the problems of time shift or multiple peaks. This analysis tested only the effect of the stretch in the preceding probing movements on the predictive component of grip force control in a given stretch-catch probing movement. We highlighted this point in our report of the results:</p><p>âTo quantify these effects, we analyzed the grip force-load force ratio (Fig. 3). The next analyses refer only to the predictive component of grip force control.â</p><p>And in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>âTo dissociate the contribution of the feedforward grip force adjustments, we incorporated stretch-catch probes where we maintained the load force but unexpectedly omitted the skinstretch (HermsdÃ¶rfer and Blankenfeld, 2008). In these probing movements, participants expected to feel the skin-stretch, as they did in the previous probing movement into the same force field. They therefore predictively adjusted their grip force in anticipation of this stimulus. As it was a stretch-catch probe, there was no skin-stretch to apply a reactive grip force to.â</p><p>In Experiment 2 (original Experiment 1) we did this analysis on regular probes and therefore we indeed had to deal with time shift and multiple peaks. It is important to note that we did the analysis of peaks ratio in Experiment 2 only to test if we can reproduce some of the results of Experiment 1 in a more natural task. We clarified that the results of this analysis include the contribution of both the predictive and reactive responses:</p><p>&quot;Unlike Experiment 1, in which we separated the predictive component into the baseline grip force and the modulation, and analyzed each individually, in this experiment we analyzed the overall grip force. The overall grip force is comprised of a predictive and a reactive component.â</p><p>We also highlight the relation between the patterns that were observed in the two experiments:</p><p>âFig. 6 presents examples of grip force, load force, and tactor displacement trajectories of a participant from the free exploration group (Group 2). As in Experiment 1, a visual examination of the trajectories revealed a non-uniform peak pattern that appeared predominantly in trials in which skin-stretch was applied.

We therefore posit that the free exploration used in Experiment 2 caused the second peak of each probing to fuse with the first peak of the subsequent probing.â</p><p>Technically, to deal the problems of time shift and multiple peaks we used the MATLAB function findpeaks to identify the grip force and load force peaks and then manually corrected by visual examination. The visual examination enables us to make sure we analyzed only grip force peaks which preceded or were synchronized with the load force peaks. This was clarified in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>âTo reproduce the results of the change in the predictive grip force between early and late interactions with the elastic force field (observed in Experiment 1) we computed the peak grip force-peak load force ratio in Group 2 of Experiment 2. Unlike in Experiment 1, in which we only analyzed the grip force-load force trajectories of the stretch-catch probes, in Experiment 2, we examined the effect of the additional skin-stretch on the overall grip force trajectories. The grip force trajectories had a non-uniform peaked pattern that appeared predominantly in trials in which skin-stretch was applied. Therefore, we used the MATLAB function findpeaks to identify the grip force and load force peaks, and then manually corrected them by visual examination.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The last panel of Figure 5 is a very important result from this study: the 7th stretch-catch probe shows that the feedforward predictive component of the Grip Force (in anticipation of a skin stretch that does not occur) is characterized by a single peak (and is larger than if no skin stretch is expected). It also shows that the reactive tactile feedback response reduces the Grip Force response (see double peaks in other trials, same panel). This reduction of the Grip Force was not expected and the authors should better convince the reader that it is not an artefact of their stimulus. I suggest for instance to test the response to the skin stretching when maintaining a STABLE Grip Force, at different typical values, within the Grip Force range tested in the study. Is the Grip Force response also a reduction in this case?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Indeed, we agree with both points made by the reviewer, and we clarified the conclusion about the predictive component of the grip force.</p><p>âIt is also evident from Fig. 2 that in the event of large tactor displacement gains (66 and 100 mm/m), repeated interactions with the force field led to an increase in the predictive grip force control. The grip force trajectories in the stretch-catch probes in panels (b)-(d) show that the feedforward predictive component of the grip force (in anticipation of a skin-stretch stimulus that does not occur) is characterized by a single peak. Moreover, in the seventh probing movement, this peak grip force is larger than it would be if no skin-stretch was expected (compare the seventh movements of panel (a) and (d)).â</p><p>Our original intent was to understand both the predictive and the reactive responses, and indeed, we were also surprised by the reduction in the reactive grip force component. We added the proposed experiment of quantifying the response to stretch while maintaining a constant target grip force at two typical baseline values from our original experiment, 1.2N and 1.6N. The methods and results are described in the Supplementary file, under âReactive Experiment 2â, and the reactive grip force trajectories of the participants in this stable maintenance task is consistent with the reactive trajectory that we isolated from Experiment 1.</p><p>âAs in the active experiment, we observed a pattern of a decrease in the grip force followed by an increase toward the end of the stretch. Additionally, we found a similar dependence on the tactor displacement gain â both the decrease and the subsequent increase were greater for larger tactor displacement gains. In addition, a larger target grip force led to a bigger decrease (rm-General Linear Model, main effect of âgainâ: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,9)</sub> = 18.54, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001, main effect of âtarget grip forceâ: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,9)</sub> = 8.54, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0053). Both reactive experiments taken together suggest that the pattern of the reactive response was not specific to the control of grip force during probing movements, but rather a more general response to the tactile stimulation that we applied in this study.â</p><p>However, even after these new observations, we were still unsure that this is not an artifact of our stimulation. Therefore, we also added the control experiments (Control Experiments 1 and 2), which revealed qualitatively similar patterns of grip force trajectory changes, but that were smaller by factors of four (Control Experiment 1) and eight (Control Experiment 2). With these results, we concluded that:</p><p>âIt is important to note that the reactive grip force response we report here may be a specific response to our skin-stretch device, and not a general response to any artificial tactile stimulation. In addition, these results should be considered with caution because of the resemblance between the reactive grip force trajectories and the trajectories of the artifact of tactor movement, which we characterized in the two control experiments. However, the participantsâ reactive response was much greater than the artifact, suggesting that the artifact is not a plausible explanation for the entire response.â</p><p>Finally, because of this ambiguity and to better focus the message, we focus the message of the main paper on the predictive control of grip force in anticipation of the stretch, the effect of the stretch on perception, and the link between the two. Therefore, we moved the entire story of the reactive grip force control to the Supplementary file. If the reviewers and the editor are of the opinion that the parts describing Reactive Experiments 1 and 2, and their conclusions, better fit within the main text, we will be happy to make this change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The authors mention in the discussion section that: &quot;The reactive grip force pattern was very surprising&quot;. Indeed, they expected an increase in Grip Force instead of a decrease in reaction to the tactile stimulus. The authors should consider the possibility that the tactile reactive feedback (reduction of Grip Force) might be due to a general mechanism that could be some kind of response to a nociceptive input when there is a mismatch between what you expect from prediction and what you feel at your fingertips (think about a bug that you hold between your fingers and that tries to escape). This response could be specific to the situation when the Grip Force varies (active movement) and not during static holding (see control experiment suggested above) or could alternatively be present in both conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and added the experiment to address this point. Please refer to our response to the previous comment. We also added two potential explanations to this response:</p><p>âWe do not have a conclusive explanation as to why the reaction to skin-stretch would be an initial release of grip. One possibility is that the release was the result of an unpleasant or painful interaction, however none of our participants indicated any discomfort, nor did they report any when asked about their experience at the end of the experiment. Another possibility is the attempt to reduce the contact impedance between the fingers and the device due to possible contact instability (White et al., 2018).â</p><p>In addition, we highlight that:</p><p>âIt is important to note that the reactive grip force response we report here may be a specific response to our skin-stretch device, and not a general response to any artificial tactile stimulation.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) The authors also mention in the discussion section: &quot;This prompted our initial prediction that the reactive response would be an increase in grip force 50-90 msec after the stimulation&quot;. This prediction is not correct on the basis of existing literature (Dimitriou et al., 2012; Pruszynski et al., 2016, Crevecoeur et al., 2017). Indeed, the measured EMG response to a tactile stimulus is around 90ms. Therefore, a change in Grip Force is not expected before 120 to 150ms, which is compatible with the reported data for the peak of decrease: &quot;The peak of the decrease was roughly in the middle of the probe, close to the peak of the stretch and the load force, and about 150 msec from the onset of the stretch.&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this mistake to our attention. We corrected it and revised the paragraph.</p><p>âThe reactive grip force pattern was very surprising. At the beginning of an interaction, before an internal representation was formed, a tactile stimulus is similar to any mechanical perturbation. It is well-established in the literature that during unexpected load force perturbations, the grip force is automatically adjusted (Cole and Abbs, 1988; Johansson and Cole, 1992; Cole and Johansson, 1993). Recordings from tactile afferents during trapezoidal load force perturbations to the digit with different rates of loading (Macefield, HÃ¤ger-Ross and Johansson, 1996) revealed that the mean firing rate was scaled by the slope of the loading ramp. This prompted our initial prediction that the reactive response would be an increase in grip force, which would that increases linearly with increasing tactor displacement gain, and would appear more than 90 msec after stimulation (Dimitriou, Franklin and Wolpert, 2011; Pruszynski, Johansson and Flanagan, 2016; Crevecoeur et al., 2016, 2017). Instead, in response to the artificial stretch, participants first strongly decreased their grip force and only then increased it, resulting in an overall moderate increase that depended linearly on the tactor displacement gain. The peak of the decrease was roughly in the middle of the probe, close to the peak of the stretch and the load force, and about 150 msec from the onset of the stretch. The peak of the increase was after the stretch, and load force returned to zero about 300 msec from the onset of the stretch.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) What is puzzling in the data is that the subjects are exposed to a repetition of tactile stimuli but lack adapting their motor response efficiently. Indeed, they cannot inhibit the reduction in Grip Force due to the tactile feedback and consequently show a local minimum of Grip Force when the Load Force is maximum. This is clearly a very bad strategy that is repeated by the subjects who fail to adapt in an efficient way (they react to the increased uncertainty due to the tactile stimulus by boosting the feedforward component). It can only be partially compensated by increasing the feedforward predictive Grip Force component (to compensate for the expected and inefficient reduction of Grip Force after the tactile stimulus) (subsection âSkin-stretch increased the feedforward component of grip forceâ).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting idea, but it is important to note that we interpret the reactive grip force results with caution because the reactive response may be specific to our device and needs to be further investigated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) In Experiment 1, the subjects performed several probing movements for each stimulus. When there was a tactile stimulus, they adapted their strategy across repetitions (see Figure 3 last panel and Figure 4B for a comparison between first and last ratio). Therefore, it is not clear what induced the change in PSE. Is it the tactile stimulus or is it the build-up of increased feedforward Grip Force across repetitions with the tactile stimulus? A control experiment involving a test with a single probing movement is necessary from my point of view. It would allow disambiguating the role of the tactile stimulus versus feedforward component in assessing stiffness. An alternative idea would be to test perception of stiffness specifically during catch trials (it remains to be determined how this could be done in a protocol). It would also allow separating the feedforward component (that is increased in catch trials) from the feedback reactive response to the tactile stimulus.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the idea for this new control experiment. We added the new control experiment (Experiment 2, Group1), in which participants could touch each force field only once, and compared it to a group which used free exploration (Experiment 2, Group 2). We found that the bias in stiffness perception (as quantified by the PSE) and the discrimination sensitivity (as quantified by the JND) did not depend on the number of probing movements. Therefore, we concluded that the perceptual illusion is formed immediately, and does not depend on the buildup of the internal representation that is used for the predictive control of grip force.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) In the discussion section the authors mention that: &quot;another possible explanation for the increased grip force is that the motor system of the participants could have interpreted the additional tactile stimuli as indication of a more slippery contact surface, which would have thus been entirely unrelated to the perceptual illusion of a harder spring.&quot; This is a very interesting idea. I encourage the authors to add analyses related to the correlation between the Grip Force and Load Force (phase diagram) during the first open-loop phase of the probing movements (Johansson and Westling, 1984).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this positive feedback. In our original submission, we analyzed the grip force load force phase diagram and fitted a regression line to these trajectories (similar to the analysis in (Flanagan and Wing, 1990; Leib et al., 2018, 2015)). This analysis enables us to differentiate between the two components of the predictive grip force control: (1) the baseline, which provides a safety margin against slippage and does not use a specific representation of the force field, and (2) the modulation in anticipation of the load force, which requires an internal representation of the load force and the slipperiness. We clarified this analysis in the Introduction and the results section:</p><p>âFeedforward control is used to adjust our grip force in accordance with the expected slipperiness and weight (or load force) of the object (Flanagan and Wing, 1990, 1997; Flanagan et al., 2003; Danion and Sarlegna, 2007; Danion, Descoins and Bootsma, 2009; Leib, Karniel and Nisky, 2015; Leib, Rubin and Nisky, 2018; White et al., 2018). Baseline grip force is maintained to create a safety margin, and is increased when one experiences uncertainty regarding the load force (Gibo, Bastian and Okamura, 2013; Hadjiosif and Smith, 2015). Predictive modulation is calculated based on an internal representation of the object dynamics, which is learned by the nervous system (Johansson and Cole, 1992; Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi, 1994; Kawato, 1999; Davidson and Wolpert, 2004) and is updated during repeated interactions (Donchin, Francis and Shadmehr, 2003).â</p><p>âThe intercept of this regression represents the baseline grip force; i.e. the amount of grip force that was applied by the participants when no external load force was applied by the haptic device. The slope of the regression represents the modulation of the grip force that anticipates the load force. In typical manipulation tasks of grasping and lifting, the slope is linked to the âslip ratioâ of an object (Flanagan and Wing, 1990), and when interacting with elastic objects, to a combined effect of the slip ratio and the internal representation of the load force (Flanagan and Wing, 1990; Leib et al., 2018, 2015).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The correlation between the derivative of GF and LF should also be very informative. This would allow assessing the feedforward predictive component of Grip Force even during standard probing movements (Experiment 1) and not only during catch trials (Experiment 2).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, in many of the classical and recent studies of the modulation of grip force with load force the relationship between GF rate and LF rate is informative, see e.g. (White et al., 2011). However, these studies focus on lifting tasks where there is a clear onset of load force at the lift-off inception. When the load force is elastic, like in our case, a correlation between grip force and load force is also used (Descoins et al., 2006), but so does the analysis of regression in the grip force load force plane (Flanagan and Wing, 1990). We tried to perform an analysis of GF-LF rate on the standard probing movements, but in these movements, it was impossible to associate the specific local peaks of the grip force rate, tactor movement rate, and load force rate due to artifacts that are related to the movement of the tactor during these probing movements, so eventually, this analysis was not informative. Therefore, we chose to focus on the information that can be reliably inferred from the grip force load force regression during the stretch-catch trials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) In the discussion section, the authors mention that: &quot;Future studies, probably with other designs of tactile stimulation devices, are needed to pinpoint the origin of this surprising reactive pattern.&quot; Given that the same group already reported the finding of the change in the perception of stiffness following a tactile stimulus (papers by Quek et al.), I wonder whether better characterizing and understanding the nature of the reactive pattern is not necessary to make the present study truly new, interesting and innovating.</p></disp-quote><p>In this new submission we present novel results about the predictive component of grip force control and the timescale of forming stiffness perception during subsequent probing movements. We remain careful about the interpretation of the meaning of the reactive component, and therefore, following restructuring and focusing of the paper, we moved the entire analysis of the reactive component of grip force control to the Supplementary file.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors address a specific question, related to control of the grip force that all of us use with no difficulty when we grasp an object like a paper-cup of coffee. This action requires accurate modulation of the grip, at an accurate and well-timed force, to prevent the cup slippage, (spilling the coffee), and at the same time avoiding crash the paper cup. Investigation of this question is related to many aspects of action-perception behaviors and beyond. The major challenge in all cases is not just the action itself but in the prediction of the future, given the present (and past) concepts and actions. Therefore, the potential projection of this study to more general science fields is part the general significance of this study.</p><p>Here, the authors investigated the effect of stretching the skin of the fingertip while performing movements in a force field. The force field simulated the stiffness of a spring in a virtual environment. The goal was to determine how the tactile and kinesthetic feedbacks are combined and influence both stiffness perception and grip force control. The authors also used catch trials to try and separate the three components of the Grip Force response: predictive feedforward baseline, predictive feedforward modulation and reactive feedback. The authors address an interesting and very important question related to the role of tactile inputs on perception and motor control. Experiment 2 based on stretch-catch probes reports very robust and original data showing a negative reactive response of Grip Force to skin stretching. The authors also performed several control experiments to better assess the limitations of their finger stimulation device. The results on the influence of tactile stimulation on the perception of stiffness are very robust and confirm earlier reports from the same group. The demonstration that higher levels of artificial skin-stretch increased the predictive grip force modulation in anticipation of the load force and the finding that the increase developed throughout each trial are important. Thus, it is also important to improve and quantify the temporal aspects of the measurements.</p><p>The manuscript has been greatly improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for having considered our work and inviting us to submit the revised manuscript. We have carefully evaluated the recommended revisions and made the necessary changes: we added the requested analyses, conducted new control experiments, and thoroughly edited all the sections of the paper. We believe that our paper has been considerably improved as a result of these revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) We ask that you provide a better characterization of the evolution of grip force over time.</p></disp-quote><p>We adopted the analyses in Kuling et al., 2019 with very minor modifications, as specified in the methods section. These new analyses enable us to characterize the evolution of the predictive (baseline and modulation) grip force control over repeated probing movements within each trial. The results of this analyses corroborated our original assertion that: âartificial skin-stretch increased the predictive grip force by increasing both the baseline grip force and the modulation in anticipation of the predicted load forceâ.</p><p>Importantly, with these new analyses we can now assert with greater confidence what we could only hypothesize in the previous version of our submission â that:</p><p>âthe timescales of the evolution of these two components were different â the baseline grip force increased immediately together with the perceptual illusion, and the modulation evolved gradually.â</p><p>We added new subsections describing these new analyses and their results:</p><p>Subsection: âBaseline grip force and prediction of the intended peak grip force in all the probing movements in each trialâ.</p><p>and subsection âThe evolution of the predictive grip force over repeated probing movementsâ.</p><p>We also added two new figures: Figure 5 and Figure 6.</p><p>We modified the conclusions throughout the text such that the gradual nature of the development of the predictive modulation is highlighted, and modified the title to: âStretching the Skin Immediately Enhances Perceived Stiffness and Gradually Enhances the Predictive Control of Grip Forceâ</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The results on the influence of tactile stimulation on the perception of stiffness are very robust and confirm earlier reports from the same group. In contrast, the results on the influence of tactile stimulation on Grip Force control remain very difficult to interpret despite the additional control experiments performed by the authors. This could be partly improved by conducting additional analyses as suggested below.</p><p>a) In their analyses, the authors try to separate the baseline and modulation of Grip Force (Results section): &quot;To separate between the effect on each of these two components, we performed a linear regression analysis in the grip force-load force plane.&quot; This is illustrated in Figure 4 with phase plots of Grip Force versus Load Force. However, this figure shows that the relationship between Grip Force and Load Force is not very linear. This is also clear in Figure 2 because the Load Force profile is very stereotyped and short in time in comparison with the Grip Force profile that starts increasing well before the increase in Load Force in anticipation of the contact with the virtual object. This observation is classical in all studies investigating collisions between (virtual) objects. In that case, it is much more appropriate to measure the baseline Grip Force as the average Grip Force level between two consecutive trials (when Grip Force does not vary much over time, see Figure 2D). It is also more appropriate to measure the modulation when both Grip Force and Load Force vary quickly during the early part of the contact. This kind of analysis was recently used in the recent paper of Kuling et al., (2019). In the same paper, these authors also propose a method to compute an estimate of the predictive component of the feedforward Grip Force on the basis of a regression analysis taking into account Grip Force at contact (with the virtual object) and the derivative of Grip Force at contact. This method was validated on catch trials when there was no contact with a virtual object. This method is interesting in the context of the present study because it would allow further investigating the gradual build-up of Grip Force feedforward component across the repetition of trials with tactor displacement. The following reference could also be cited (Grip Force during collisions in a virtual reality setup): White et al., (2011).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions, which we fully took on board.</p><p>We added a new subsection âThe evolution of the predictive grip force over repeated probing movementsâ to the results of Experiment 1:</p><p>This section quantifies the evolution of both the baseline grip force and the intended peak grip force between consecutive probes. The intended peak grip force was predicted using a multivariate regression with the grip force at contact and its rate of change as the independent variables. Additionally, we quantified the development of the grip force modulation, which was defined as the difference between the intended peak grip force and the grip force at contact, as well as the grip force at contact over subsequent trials.</p><p>The new analyses not only corroborated our original conclusions but also allowed us to determine that the development of the predictive modulation of grip force in anticipation of load force was gradual. The following conclusion was clarified in the Discussion section:</p><p>âOur results showed that artificial skin-stretch increased the predictive grip force by increasing both the baseline grip force and the modulation in anticipation of the predicted load force. In addition, we determined that the size of this effect was linear with the amount of stretch. Interestingly, the timescales of the evolution of these two components were different â the baseline grip force increased immediately together with the perceptual illusion, and the modulation evolved gradually.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In the Materials and methods section and throughout the paper, the authors acknowledge that their &quot;device only measures a downscaled version of the grip force&quot;. Of course, this introduces a major limitation in the interpretation of the experimental data related to the measure of Grip Force. At this stage, there is no quantification of the relationship between actual Grip Force and the measured downscaled version of Grip Force. We do not even know if the relationship will be linear or non-linear given the complex mechanics of the object / finger pad interaction (pressure is not constant in the contact area). In their paper, the authors tried to address this important issue but in a way that is not satisfactory given the importance of Grip Force measurement. I strongly recommend performing the following very simple control experiment to clarify this issue. The authors should simply disconnect their manipulandum device from the haptic robot and put it flat on an extra (1D) force sensor. They should then instruct a few human subjects to exert a pure normal (vertical) force on the device over the range of recorded Grip Force in the experiments. They should then compare the Grip Force measure with the device with the true total normal force measured by the additional force sensor to assess the &quot;downscaling&quot; of the measured Grip Force with the device. This could be done with or without tactor displacement for a more thorough control measurement.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the new proposed experiment and verified that indeed the mapping between the actual grip force and the downscaled measurement of the grip force is close to linear. The movement of the tactors leads to a reactive response and an artifact [as characterized in Supplementary file section (1)]. Therefore, the majority of the grip force analyses in our paper were performed using portions of the interaction without tactor movement. Due to these reasons, this experiment was conducted without tactor movement.</p><p>We described this experiment and its results in the Supplementary file subsection (2) âThe mapping between the actual grip force and the downscaled measurement of the grip forceâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The experiment does not show directly any &quot;internal representations&quot; of the well-demonstrated illusion. In general, the term It is an over-used, and means very little. Of course, the authors can see it their way, and I do not demand the elimination of terms. I counted 28 times (twice in the Abstract!) I do recommend to reduce this number or abandoning this term, leaving the issue of neuronal basis to speculation/interpretation alone. For example, the text of the authors:</p><p>&quot;This suggests that the perceptual illusion is a result of a high-level cognitive process, independent of the gradual development of the internal representation that causes an increase in the predictive grip force control.</p><p>Could be simpler... like:</p><p>&quot;This suggests that the perceptual illusion is a result of an adaptive predictive process, independent of the gradual development of grip force control during the action&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We reduced significantly the number of uses of this term and rephrased many of our statements to be less speculative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The results on the influence of tactile stimulation on the perception of stiffness are very robust and confirm earlier reports from the same group. In contrast, the results on the influence of tactile stimulation on Grip Force control remain very difficult to interpret despite the additional control experiments performed by the authors. This could be partly improved by conducting additional analyses as suggested below.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the suggested analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors report (Results section) that &quot;participants applied more grip force per amount of kinesthetic load force when interacting with force fields with higher levels of tactor displacement gain.&quot; This observation makes sense because the skin stretch induces a large decrease of Grip Force around the peak of Load Force. It is particularly clear for large tactor displacement (100 mm/m, Figure 2D) where there is a clear dip in Grip Force around the peak of Load Force (see comparison between trial 6 and 7 in Figure 2D: difference in Grip Force of 2 N around the peak Load Force). Therefore, this dip in Grip Force around the peak of Load Force increases the risk of slippage which is compensated by an increase of baseline and feedforward Grip Force components (see comments below).</p></disp-quote><p>We added this additional interpretation to the discussion section:</p><p>âMoreover, we observed a reactive reduction of the grip force around the peak load force in response to the stretch stimulation (which we interpret with caution - see SF). This reduction increases the risk of slippage which could be compensated for by increasing both components of the predictive grip force (i.e., the baseline and the modulation) that are entirely unrelated to the mechanical properties of the interface with the finger.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Very interestingly, the authors mention in the same paragraph (Results section) that &quot;This trend is significantly higher in the seventh probing compared to the second&quot;. This is a very important observation because it shows that the increase in baseline and feedforward Grip Force components is clearly decoupled from the perception of increased stiffness that is shown in the manuscript to take place after a single trial as demonstrated in Experiment 2 and Figure 5 (subsection âSkin-stretch caused perceptual overestimation of stiffnessâ): &quot;We can therefore conclude that the perceptual illusion was formed immediately, after a single probing movement into the force field, and before the internal representation that we identified in Experiment 1 was formed. &quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We highlighted this observation, which was characterized still further with the new analyses proposed by the reviewers.</p><p>In the Results section:</p><p>âTo summarize, we found that following exposure to high levels of artificial skin-stretch participants immediately increased their safety margin and maintained it even after many interactions. They also increased the predictive grip force modulation in anticipation of the load force. This increase developed gradually with subsequent probing interactions with the same elastic force field.â</p><p>In the Discussion section:</p><p>âOur results suggest that artificial skin-stretch also affected the prediction of the load force applied by the object, and consequentially led to a gradual increase in the predictive modulation of grip force in anticipation of the load force. Additionally, we discovered that the perceptual illusion was formed immediately upon first contact with the object, and did not depend on the slower development of the predictive control of grip force.â</p><p>âOur results showed that artificial skin-stretch increased the predictive grip force by increasing both the baseline grip force and the modulation in anticipation of the predicted load force. In addition, we determined that the size of this effect was linear with the amount of stretch. Interestingly, the timescales of the evolution of these two components were different â the baseline grip force increased immediately together with the perceptual illusion, and the modulation evolved gradually.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Results section: &quot;This suggests that following repeated exposure to the artificial skin-stretch stimulation, the participants either increased their internal representation of the expected force (likely due to increase in the representation of the stiffness of the field) or of the slipperiness of the device.&quot; Again, see comments above: the fact that the perception of stiffness occurs much faster and that the measured effects on catch trials 2 and 7 (Figure 4F) are very different seems to demonstrate that the reported effect is not due to gradual increase in the internal representation of the expected force but more likely to a slower adaptation of Grip Force potentially due to an increased risk of slippage (&quot;reactive&quot; dip in Grip Force).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a possible interpretation and added it to the Discussion section:</p><p>âMoreover, we observed a reactive reduction of the grip force around the peak load force in response to the stretch stimulation (which we interpret with caution - see SF). This reduction increases the risk of slippage which could be compensated for by increasing both components of the predictive grip force (i.e., the baseline and the modulation) that are entirely unrelated to the mechanical properties of the interface with the finger.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) One key experiment for the interpretation of the Grip Force data of the current study is the Reactive Experiment 2 reported in the Supplementary File. I believe that it is crucial to fully exploit this data set to better understand the effect of tactor displacement on the &quot;reflex&quot; Grip Force response reported in the main experiment. I even think that a better controlled experiment based on the analyses of this Reactive Experiment should be published as an independent study before publishing the current set of experiments that cannot be satisfactorily interpreted in terms of Grip Force control at this stage. I am convinced that it could be a major contribution to our understanding of the very important question related to the role of proprioceptive versus tactile feedbacks in motor control (Crevecoeur et al., 2017). The device used by the authors allows investigating the impact of a pure tactile stimulation on the motor response (Grip Force reaction). I recommend redoing this reactive experiment and recording EMG signals together with the measurement of the Grip Force reaction. This will allow measuring the delay of the motor response and better characterizing the timing of the reaction which is crucial to understand the results of the current study (the delay seems very short in Figure 10: shorter than 20ms?).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this very interesting suggestion. Going forward with our research program, we indeed intend to measure EMG in experiments conducted with our skin-stretch device. We are confident that once the setup is established and validated in our lab, this direction will lead to new discoveries. However, we feel that adding such an experiment would be unrealistic in the review timeline as it would require developing a completely new set of tools and analyses. We therefore look forward to investigating this topic in the continuation of our research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 7 shows the ratio between peak Grip Force and peak Load Force. It is not clear what this analysis means because in Figure 6 the peaks of Grip Force and Load Force are not synchronized! In the current version of the manuscript (and reported analyses) the interpretation of Grip Force data is very weak (see also Materials and methods section).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this analysis of grip force in Experiment 2 is potentially affected by interfering reactive responses and potential artifacts of tactor movement [see Supplementary file section (1)]. Our major conclusions about the control of grip force in this manuscript are based on Experiment 1 (original Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, and new Figure 5 and Figure 6). We chose to keep this analysis because it corroborates our conclusions from Experiment 1.</p><p>If you prefer not to include this analysis in the paper, itâs all right by us to remove it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In the Discussion section, the authors mention that &quot;in our case, increasing the grip force reached the perceptual illusion over repeated interactions&quot;. I am not sure that the interpretation of the authors is correct (see also comments above) because there is an illusion in terms of stiffness but not in terms of tactile sensation: there is an actual stretch of the skin, a &quot;reflex&quot; dip in Grip Force, and therefore a sensation of partial slip or strain in the fingertip. Moreover, the time course of the two phenomena is very different: immediate illusion in comparison with progressive build-up of Grip Force anticipation, pointing to very likely different mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>This phrasing was indeed confusing; the reviewer is indeed correct in the interpretation of the timescales. The original sentence was there to highlight the difference between our findings and the process reported in Flanagan and Beltzner, 2000. We rephrased this sentence and it now reads:</p><p>âHowever, the nature of the change in the grip force was different - in (Flanagan and Beltzner, 2000) the grip force matched the perception in the first grasping, and was then adjusted to the correct weight. In our case, on the other hand, the predictive modulation of grip force slowly increased over repeated interactions.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
