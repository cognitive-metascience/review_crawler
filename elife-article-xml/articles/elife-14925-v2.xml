The antenna, the main olfactory organ, is covered with four types of sensilla: basiconic, trichoid, intermediate and coeloconic. These four sensillum types house olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) types responding to different kinds of chemical stimuli and thus serve distinct chemosensory functions. In contrast, the palp has only three different subtypes of basiconic sensilla, each housing two MP-OSNs. Because of the overlapping response spectra between MP- and antennal OSNs (Ant-OSNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Bruyne et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2001</xref>) as well as the location of the maxillary palp in close vicinity to the labellum, the main taste organ in flies, a function connected to taste enhancement has been suggested for the MP-OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shiraiwa et al., 2008</xref>). However, taste enhancement would be a very general function for six types of MP-OSNs expressing seven different odorant receptors (Ors). In our previous work we presented data on the importance of Or71a, which is expressed in the maxillary palp sensillum pb1B, in proxy detection of dietary antioxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dweck et al., 2015</xref>). It is not yet known whether the other MP-OSNs are also dedicated to detect specific ecologically relevant chemical compounds, and if so, what the ecological importance of these compounds is.</p><p>In several other insects, MP-OSNs are involved in detection of specific chemical compounds that are not covered within the receptive range of Ant-OSNs. For example, in both the hawk moth <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> and the African malaria mosquito <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, CO<sub>2</sub> detection is primarily mediated via maxillary and/or labial palp OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thom et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu et al., 2007</xref>). Mammals are also known to possess several peripheral olfactory organs. In mouse, e.g., the main olfactory epithelium is complemented with the vomeronasal organ, the septal organ and the Grueneberg ganglion, each having distinct functions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knaden and Hansson, 2014</xref>). The presence of specific functions in different olfactory organs in other insects and in mammals suggests that the maxillary palp may also be involved in the detection of specific chemicals in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>In the present study, we present a systematic electrophysiological examination of MP-OSNs of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> using 52 different complex odor sources containing more than 11,300 chemical compounds. We find that each MP-OSN is either the sole or the primary detector of a specific chemical compound and that the maxillary palp contains independent and important olfactory channels that mediate both short- and long-range attraction. Finally, we find that the organization, detection and Or genes of MP-OSNs are conserved in the agricultural pest <italic>D. suzukii</italic>, and identify novel short and long-range attractants that could potentially be used in IPM programs of this pest species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Screen for novel natural ligands for MP-OSNs</title><p>Although extensive work has been done on the olfactory sense of the vinegar fly, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, none (e.g. for pb3A-OR59c, Pb2A-Or33c) or very few ligands have been identified for the different MP-OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Bruyne et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marshall et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, the previously identified ligands activate Ant-OSNs as well as MP-OSNs and have been shown to be much better ligands for Ant-OSNs (i.e. require high concentrations to activate MP-OSNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Bruyne et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>). This suggests that the best ligands of the different MP-OSNs have not yet been identified. Towards this end, we screened each of the six MP-OSNs with headspace collections from 52 different complex, ecologically relevant odor sources using GC-SSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). These odor sources included 34 fruits, seven microbes, and eleven types of mammal feces. Our GC-SSR measurements revealed that each of the tested headspace collections triggered a response from at least one palp OSN type. Fecal, fruit and microbial volatiles elicited responses from six, five and two palp OSN types, respectively. The pb2B MP-OSN was activated exclusively by fecal volatiles, whereas the other five types were activated by fruit, microbial, and fecal volatiles.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14925.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Screen for novel natural ligands for MP-OSNs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative gas chromatography-linked single sensillum measurement (GC-SSR) from pb3B (green trace) stimulated with headspace extract of pear (black trace).

are separated in the neural space of the maxillary palp. We performed a nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) based on a presence/absence matrix for the SSR active peaks across the tested samples using Bray-Courtis dissimilarity. This analysis indicated that the 52 headspace collections were separated into three distinct groups; one group for fruit samples, another group for microbial samples and the last group for fecal samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The significance of the differences between these three groups was assessed by the analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) score (R = 0.61, p&lt;0.0001). These results suggest that the information provided by the different MP-OSNs is sufficient to categorize fruits, microbes, and feces.</p><p>The physiologically active peaks from each extract were then identified via GC-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and co-injection with synthetic standards, which were purchased except for 5-hexen-3-one and butyl-3-hydroxy butyrate, which were synthesized in house (see Materials and methods). The total number of distinguishable flame ionization detection (FID) peaks in the samples was 11326, of which only 328 FID peaks elicited responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>). 225 of these peaks corresponded to 20 different compounds (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The remaining peaks corresponded to eight different compounds, which remain unidentified because their mass spectra did not match that of any reference compound.

In this odor space, odors with similar descriptors mapped close to each other, whereas odors with diverse descriptors distributed widely. Indeed, compounds that activated different MP-OSNs differed in their descriptors and, hence, distributed widely in the two-dimensional odor space. Compounds, however, that activated the same MP-OSN clustered together except for the ligands recognized by pb2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Three out of four identified ligands for pb2A grouped close to each other, whereas the fourth ligand (furaneol methylether) spaced very widely. This could be explained by the fact that pb2A is the only MP-OSN that expresses two olfactory receptors, Or33c and Or85e (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldmann et al., 2005</xref>). In order to predict which of these two receptors could detect which of the pb2A ligands, we included (-)-fenchone, a previously identified best ligand for Or85e (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldman et al., 2005</xref>), in our PCA. (-)-fenchone distributed widely from furaneol methylether and instead clustered with the other three ligands of pb2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). This result suggests that the responsiveness of pb2A to furaneol methylether was due to the expression of Or33c, while the responsiveness of pb2A to (-)-camphor, alpha- and beta-ionone was due to the expression of Or85e.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Each MP-OSN is either the sole or the primary detector for specific chemical compounds</title><p>To determine which of the identified ligands is the best activator for each MP-OSN, we examined the dose-response relationships in SSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) and GC-SSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) experiments.

Three of the compounds were primarily detected by the MP-OSNs as the 10<sup>–5</sup> detection threshold for these Ant-OSNs was two orders of magnitude higher than the 10<sup>–7</sup> detection threshold for MP-OSNs. In addition, the number of spikes elicited by these three compounds at any tested concentration from MP-OSNs is significantly higher from Ant-OSNs except for phenethyl propionate at 10<sup>–5</sup> concentration from pb3B and ab10A. The fourth activator, butyl 3-hydroxy butyrate, was primarily detected by the Ant-OSN ab2B. The detection threshold of ab2B to this compound was one order of magnitude (10<sup>–5</sup> dilution) lower than that of the corresponding MP-OSN pb3A (10<sup>–4</sup> dilution).

We used trap and T-maze assays to measure short-range attraction, and wind tunnel assays to measure long-range attraction. In trap and T-maze experiments, we used 10<sup>–4</sup> concentration, which is similar to the concentration used to measure the specificity of these ligands to different OSN types. In wind tunnel experiments, we used 10<sup>–2</sup> concentration because the wind tunnel is supplied with a continuous airstream (0.3 m/s), which further dilutes this concentration. Six out of the eight tested compounds were behaviorally active; two compounds, 5-hexen-3-one and furaneol methylether, in T-maze assays, four compounds, 4-ethylguaiacol, methyleugenol, 2-phenethyl acetate and phenethyl propionate, in trap assays, and one compound, furaneol methylether, in wind tunnel assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

Part of the explanation of this variation might be due to flies flying in traps assays for 24 hr, while walking in T-maze assays for only 40 min. However, as so far never any odor was observed to be attractive in one and repellent in the other assay, we regard each odor that elicited at least attraction in one assay as attractive.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14925.021</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Contribution of the maxillary palp to the behaviors evoked by the palp best activators.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Behavioral responses of WT flies to the palp best activators (10<sup>–4</sup> dilution used for trap and T-maze experiments, and 10<sup>–2</sup> dilution used for wind tunnel experiments).

We, thus, measured innate responses of flies to 10<sup>–2</sup> concentration of these ligands. We found, indeed, that flies are strongly repelled by 5-hexen-3-one, 4-ethylgauaicol, and phenol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

We, therefore, excluded this concentration in our further experiments. From our results we conclude that the palp best ligands represent positive cues at lower concentration, and that the processing of this information requires Or genes, while the processing of higher concentrations seems to be independent of functioning Ors.</p><p>To ensure that the behaviors evoked by the active compounds were mediated through the maxillary palps, we surgically removed either maxillary palps or antennae (we excluded wind tunnel experiments here, as the antenna has been shown to be involved in flight control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Budick et al. 2007</xref>]), and then tested behavioral responses of the manipulated flies. For 4-ethylguaiacol, 5-hexen-3-one, methyleugenol and furaneol methylether, amputation of the palps resulted in loss of attraction, while amputation of the antennae did not affect the behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript examines the ligand selectivity and function of the maxillary palp in olfactory coding in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>suzukii</italic>. The authors use single sensilla electrophysiological recordings and GC-MS to isolate odors that activate the different classes of palp neurons in <italic>melanogaster</italic>, determine the sensitivity of the response, and compare with antennal sensitivity. They show that these odors influence short- and long- range olfactory behaviors and require the maxillary palp. Moreover, <italic>suzukii</italic> palp responds to the same odors. Overall, this is a potentially important analysis of olfactory responses in the maxillary palp and the role of these odors in behavior. However, there are major concerns about the methodology and documentation of the study that must be addressed.</p><p>1) The odorant concentrations used for the behavioral assays are far above those used for specific pb neuron activation. What odor concentrations are experienced by the fly at choice points? Do the odor concentrations used for behavioral experiments elicit the same activation patterns as the concentrations used for recording? The authors need to more definitely demonstrate that their behavioral conditions replicate their SSR data. As it is now, it is possible that the odorant concentrations they used may very well activate non-pb neurons, and it is that activation of these other olfactory neurons that are guiding the observed behaviors.</p><p>2) The authors should provide full SSR data (MP and antenna responses to all odors tested and all dilutions), raw or as plots similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, or as a table like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, and grade the responses based on intensities, for both antenna and MP responses; doing this will be necessary to assess olfactory specificity of MP-OSNs. Reviewers and authors will be familiar with the impact of e.g. the Hallem and Carlson 2006 on study of 24 antennal receptors, which included a table summarizing all odorant/receptor responses. 10 years later we should expect something similar for the 6 receptor neurons/7 ORs of the palp.</p><p>3) The behavioral results that are used to argue for short- and long-range attraction are not straightforward. For some odors, the authors observe attraction in T-maze but not in the trap assay, nor wind-assay, for others only in the trap-assay. The authors give no explanation for this variation and do not justify their subsequent choice only to consider those odor-assay combinations that gave positive results. Similarly, the authors provide no information on why in some assays only females were used, why sometimes flies were starved, or why the assay duration and fly age was varied between assays. The behavioral studies need to be better documented. Details required:</p><p>A) Odorant concentrations experienced by the fly (as mentioned above).</p><p>B) Genetic background of experimental animals. Are genetic reagents backcrossed (i.e., OrX-GAL4, and UAS-shibire) into the same genetic background?</p><p>C) Experimental conditions: were flies starved or fed? Were experiments performed in the dark or light? Age of flies? Virgins?</p><p>D) For significance, which 'controls' are the experimental groups being compared to? For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, is the WT 30C flies compared to the Or42a-Shi 30C flies? This needs to be described more fully.</p><p>E) Did the authors perform positive controls to verify that their assays could identify repulsive behaviors? If the authors want to claim certain odorants guide attraction, they need to verify that they would have seen the lack of attraction (repulsion) in their assay if this was a possibility. Cyclopentanone has been found to be repellant to flies (Tauxe, 2013) as well as many other odorants.</p><p>F) T-maze assay. a) The authors use 40 minutes in the T-maze assay. Since the T-maze is used as a read-out for innate olfactory valence responses, shorter times should be used (2-5 minutes should be sufficient). b) Did the authors change the side in the T-maze that contained the odor tube?</p><p>4) The same wild-type data is apparently used repeatedly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in comparisons to different experimental condition. For example, WT bar representing 5-hexen-3-one is the same in 4A, 4B, 4C; WT bar representing strawberry furanone is the same in 4A, 4B, 4C. How did the authors control for changes in behavioral effects that often occur when control and experimental behaviors are not performed in parallel? Even slight variations in temperature and humidity can have large effects on olfactory behaviors.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Olfactory Channels Associated with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Maxillary Palp Mediate Short- and Long-range Attraction&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The behavioral studies need to be better documented. Details required:</italic></p><p>We agree that it is a bit confusing that flies become attracted to one odor within one but not within another assay. However, it has been shown many times that, whether a fly becomes attracted or not by an odorant strongly depends on the bioassay. We therefore decided to use several bioassays. We agree that for the most attractive odorant one would assume that the fly becomes attracted in all assays. However, as already shown even for the well-known attractant ethyl acetate, some assays fail to show attraction (ethyl acetate: Knaden et al. 2012). We, therefore regard an odor as attractive if it at least provokes attraction in one of the assays used. We added “The finding that odors are differentially attractive in the trap and the T-maze assays is not new. E.g., the well-known <italic>Drosophila</italic> attractant, ethyl acetate, is attractive in T-maze assays (Farhan et al., 2013) and neutral in trap assays (Knaden et al., 2012). Part of the explanation of this variation might be due to flies flying in traps assays for 24 h, while walking in T-maze assays for only 40 min. However, as so far never any odor was observed to be attractive in one and repellent in the other assay, we regard each odor that elicited at least attraction in one assay as attractive.”</p><p><italic>A) Odorant concentrations experienced by the fly (as mentioned above).</italic></p><p>See our arguments above.</p><p><italic>B) Genetic background of experimental animals. Are genetic reagents backcrossed (i.e., OrX-GAL4, and UAS-shibire) into the same genetic background?</italic></p><p>Yes. We added to the Materials and methods section this information and now give the complete genotypes of all strains used in this study.</p><p><italic>C) Experimental conditions: were flies starved or fed? Were experiments performed in the dark or light? Age of flies? Virgins?</italic></p><p>We apologize and have now added all information on mating state, age, and experimental conditions to the Materials and methods part.</p><p><italic>D) For significance, which 'controls' are the experimental groups being compared to? For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, is the WT 30</italic>°<italic>C flies compared to the Or42a-Shi 30C flies? This needs to be described more fully.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the comparison with WT flies is not correct. We have now deleted the WT data from this part of the figure and e.g. the Or42a-Shi 30C flies both with Or42a-Shi 23C flies as well as with the parental lines.</p><p><italic>E) Did the authors perform positive controls to verify that their assays could identify repulsive behaviors? If the authors want to claim certain odorants guide attraction, they need to verify that they would have seen the lack of attraction (repulsion) in their assay if this was a possibility. Cyclopentanone has been found to be repellant to flies (Tauxe, 2013) as well as many other odorants.</italic></p><p>We agree that such a positive control would be helpful and have added data from experiments with higher concentrations: “Many pure chemicals become repellent at higher concentrations (Strutz et al. 2014). We, thus, measured innate responses of flies to 10<sup>-2</sup> concentration of these ligands. We found, indeed, that flies are strongly repelled by 5-hexen-3-one, 4-ethylgauaicol, and phenol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and Figure 5—source data 2). Interestingly, the aversion elicited by this concentration was independent of functioning Ors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and Figure 5—source data 2). We, therefore, excluded this concentration in our further experiments.”</p><p><italic>F) T-maze assay. a) The authors use 40 minutes in the T-maze assay. Since the T-maze is used as a read-out for innate olfactory valence responses, shorter times should be used (2-5 minutes should be sufficient).</italic></p><p>Different T-maze assays exist. In the T-maze that people e.g. use for learning assays indeed flies need only 2-5 minutes for decision. However, the T-maze used in our manuscript was developed in the Sidiqi lab (used e.g. by Stensmyr et al. Cell 2012; Farhan et al. Scientific Reports 2013). As the flies need to pass a pipette tip to enter each arm of the T-maze, decision time needs to be longer.</p><p><italic>b) Did the authors change the side in the T-maze that contained the odor tube?</italic></p><p>Yes. We added this information to the Methods section.</p><p><italic>4) The same wild-type data is apparently used repeatedly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in comparisons to different experimental condition. For example, WT bar representing 5-hexen-3-one is the same in 4A, 4B, 4C; WT bar representing strawberry furanone is the same in 4A, 4B, 4C. How did the authors control for changes in behavioral effects that often occur when control and experimental behaviors are not performed in parallel? Even slight variations in temperature and humidity can have large effects on olfactory behaviors.</italic></p><p>As we now compare all genetic modified flies with their parental lines WT is not used as a control as often anymore (only to compare with flies with removed antennae or palps, and <italic>Orco</italic> flies). The condition inside the climatic chamber is computer controlled, which hopefully reduces variation between experiments. However, in addition, we did not perform all 10 replicates of a single experiment at the same time, but tested e.g. some WT replicates, some <italic>Orco</italic> replicates and some manipulated flies in parallel.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining text and figure clarification issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The GC-SSR axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is not clear. What is the scale? Should this not be represented as a vertical scale bar?</italic></p><p>We apologize for this and have now added a scale bar to both figures. We also mention scale bar in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The main graphic (panel B) shows what odorants are present in different extracts. What is the connection to the response properties of the palp neurons? Rather than odor present, shouldn't neuron response be mapped?</italic></p><p>We have rewritten the part of the figure legend (“Presence/Absence matrix of the physiologically active compounds identified from the different headspace extracts for each MP-OSN in the GC-SSR experiments (i.e. each filled box represents not only the presence of this odor in a specific fruit, but also a physiological response in GC-SSR recordings).”) and hope that this decreased the confusion.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. What odor concentrations do these represent?</italic></p><p>We apologize and have added the information to the figure legend (“GC-SSR responses of the MP-OSNs best activators across the Ant-OSNs (n = 3, dilution, 10<sup>-4</sup> in hexane).”)</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. Controls should have been compared to solvent odor controls, and not to zero. For example, maybe in their assay, the solvent itself leads to some attraction. Or if given a choice between two solvent background odors, the behavior would become highly variable (larger spread) such that the significantly different from zero data points would no longer be significant.</italic></p><p>We agree that all responses should be compared to solvent odor controls. That is actually what we did (for each trap assay sample we count the number of flies in the trap filled with odor and solvent, and in the trap with solvent only. The attraction index (AI) is calculated as (number of flies in odor trap-number of flies in solvent trap)/total number of flies. An AI of 0 depicts equal attraction of odor and solvent, while an AI of 1 is a result of strong attraction to the odor (-1: strong repellency of the odor). Hence, by testing the result against 0, one tests, whether the odor is more (or less) attractive than the solvent control. To clarify we now tested against solvent control directly (resulting in the same level of significance) and have re-written the figure legend accordingly (“For T-maze and trap assays, the symbol * indicates significant differences from the solvent control (p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test, n = 10)”).</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.
