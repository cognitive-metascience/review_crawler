We have determined the 4.5 Å structure of the ~2.2 MDa pore complex of pneumolysin, the main virulence factor of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, by cryoEM. The pneumolysin pore is a 400 Å ring of 42 membrane-inserted monomers. Domain 3 of the soluble toxin refolds into two ~85 Å β-hairpins that traverse the lipid bilayer and assemble into a 168-strand β-barrel. The pore complex is stabilized by salt bridges between β-hairpins of adjacent subunits and an internal α-barrel. The apolar outer barrel surface with large sidechains is immersed in the lipid bilayer, while the inner barrel surface is highly charged. Comparison of the cryoEM pore complex to the prepore structure obtained by electron cryo-tomography and the x-ray structure of the soluble form reveals the detailed mechanisms by which the toxin monomers insert into the lipid bilayer to perforate the target membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23644.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23644.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC)</kwd><kwd>membrane pore</kwd><kwd>pore-forming toxin</kwd><kwd>electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM)</kwd><kwd>electron cryo-tomography (cryoET)</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DepartmentSB</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Pee</surname><given-names>Katharina</given-names></name><name><surname>Neuhaus</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>D'Imprima</surname><given-names>Edoardo</given-names></name><name><surname>Mills</surname><given-names>Deryck J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name><name><surname>Yildiz</surname><given-names>Özkan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The near-atomic cryoEM pore complex structure of pneumolysin, the main virulence factor of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, shows how the individual domains rearrange during the pore formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gram-positive bacteria, including the common wound-infecting <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, the virulent food-borne pathogen <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> that causes pneumonia, utilize cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) to attack and kill mammalian and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gilbert, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tweten, 2005</xref>). The bacteria produce and release CDCs as water-soluble monomers that attach to cholesterol-containing cell membranes, where they assemble into large, 200–500 Å cytolytic pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olofsson et al., 1993</xref>). X-ray structures of pneumolysin (PLY) from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lawrence et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marshall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Pee et al., 2016</xref>) show that the soluble toxin monomers are roughly rod-shaped and consist of four domains (D1-D4). Sequence comparison suggests that all CDCs have the same domain structure and therefore insert into target membranes in essentially the same way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tweten et al., 2001</xref>). Although numerous biochemical studies have addressed the arrangement of monomers in the CDC prepore or pore complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hotze and Tweten, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tilley et al., 2005</xref>) and how they might penetrate the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shatursky et al., 1999</xref>), the detailed structure of the pore complex, and hence the exact mechanism of membrane insertion is unknown. The size heterogeneity of CDC prepores and pores has so far precluded structure determination at high resolution. We determined the structure of the ring-shaped ~2.2 MDa PLY pore complex by cryoEM. Together with our 2.4 Å x-ray structure of soluble PLY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Pee et al., 2016</xref>) and a map of the prepore complex obtained by electron cryo-tomography, we can now describe the entire process of membrane attachment, prepore and pore formation in near-atomic detail. Given the high degree of sequence conservation amongst CDCs, it is likely that the same mechanism of membrane insertion holds for related bacterial toxins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CryoEM structure of the PLY pore complex</title><p>Ring-shaped pore complexes of wildtype PLY (PLY<sub>WT</sub>) forming on unilamellar, cholesterol-containing liposomes were solubilized with detergent.

Rebuilding of domains that refolded upon membrane insertion and readjustment of secondary structure elements and sidechains within domains yielded an atomic model of the pore complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Comparison to the soluble form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>) revealed a complete reorganization of the toxin upon membrane insertion. Of the four protein domains D1-D4 in the x-ray structure, D1 and D4 fitted the map of the pore complex with minimal modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). In the membrane-inserted form, the loop linking D1 to D2 refolds into a helix (α3a) at the interface between the rearranged domains D1, D2 and D3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). In D4, the highly conserved undecapeptide loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that renders PLY cholesterol-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soltani et al., 2007b</xref>) was shifted by up to ~9 Å into the cryoEM map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). The undecapeptide loops of adjacent protomers in the pore complex are located in one plane on the outer membrane surface of the target cell, where they interact closely with the lipid head groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A,C</xref>). In the linear rows of soluble PLY monomers that are found in the PLY crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lawrence et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marshall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Pee et al., 2016</xref>), the distance between the loops of neighbouring monomers is ~14 Å. In the pore complex this distance decreases to 4–5 Å, which enables an interaction of the loop that connects β-strands 18 and 19 (β18/19) in D4 with the β22/23 loop in D4 of the next monomer along the ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). The close proximity of loop β18/19 that contains Asp403, Thr405, and His407 of one monomer to loop β18/19 and the uncedapeptide containing Trp433 of the adjacent monomer suggests a critical role of these D4 loops not only in receptor recognition, but also in oligomer formation.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23644.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Soluble and membrane-inserted PLY monomer.</title><p>One subunit of membrane-inserted form of PLY in the cryoEM structure (<bold>A</bold>) and x-ray structure of soluble PLY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Pee et al., 2016</xref>) (<bold>B</bold>) seen from the side (left) and from the pore center (right).

The elongated two-stranded β-sheet of D2 rotates from its vertical position in the x-ray structure by 90° around a short glycine linker to an orientation parallel to the membrane plane in the pore complex. D2 connects D1 to D4, and its rotation results in a roughly linear translation of D1 by 35 Å towards the membrane surface and by 30 Å towards the pore centre. Otherwise, D2 required only minor adjustments of secondary structure for an optimal fit to the cryoEM map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, the structure of D3 changes entirely upon membrane insertion. In the soluble toxin, the central, five-stranded β-sheet in D3 is flanked by two bundles of short α-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the pore complex, both bundles refold into four 85 Å β-strands, which form two parallel β-hairpins that insert into and traverse the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The β-hairpins of neighbouring subunits coalesce into one extensive, 168-strand β-barrel with an inner diameter of 260 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The new β-strands can be traced unambiguously, because they are straight, apparently rigid and continuous with four β-strands in the D3 x-ray structure that are preserved in the membrane form. The two new, long β-hairpins are inclined by 20° relative to the membrane normal, in good agreement with predictions for perfringolysin O on the basis of cysteine crosslinking experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sato et al., 2013</xref>). The chain trace in the refolded domain is confirmed by the positions of bulky densities for large sidechains in the β-barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). While five of the six helices in bundles HB1 and HB2 refold into β-strands in the pore complex, one remains intact. Conversely, the loop and fifth β-strand in the central β-sheet of D3 refold into a helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Together, the two α-helices form a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). In the ring, the HTH motifs of the 42 subunits line up in one plane on the exoplasmic side of the molecule and form an α-barrel inside the β-barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), restricting the pore diameter locally to 250 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The outside of the membrane-inserted part of the β-barrel is almost entirely hydrophobic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,E</xref>) and covered by the toroid density of disordered amphipol that replaces the membrane lipid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as in the cryoEM structures of amphipol-solubilized membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Althoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liao et al., 2013</xref>). The inside pore surface is highly polar, with three aspartates and two glutamates forming a 15 by 9 Å patch of negative charge, flanked above and below by positive charges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,F,G</xref>). Apart from the hydrogen bonds between the 168 β-strands in the barrel and the interactions of helix α3a with D1 and β-hairpin one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), three other factors contribute to pore stability: (1) the surface and charge complementarity of the membrane-inserted monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>); (2) the alternating positive and negative charges of helices α13a and α13b in the α-barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>); and (3) ionic interactions between charged sidechains in adjacent β-strands of the pore barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). In particular, Asp168 and Glu170 in β-strand β7 are in a good position for forming a salt bridge with Lys271 in β-strand β10 of the next-door monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23644.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Charge distribution in the PLY pore complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Positive (blue) and negative charges (red) are evenly distributed on the polar outer surface of the pore complex.

The low form has the same height as the pore complex, but the lipid bilayer is still intact. We propose that in this lower prepore, D1, D2 and D4 have moved to their positions in the pore assembly, while D3 has not yet refolded and the long, membrane-spanning β-hairpins have not yet formed. We assign the tall form to an early prepore state, which then rearranges into the lower, late prepore state. The cross-section profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>) shows that the early prepore is essentially a ring-shaped side-by-side arrangement of soluble PLY monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), similar to that in the crystal lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lawrence et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marshall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Pee et al., 2016</xref>). While the late prepore was observed for 13% of the rings on planar bilayers examined by AFM, it was not observed in tomographic volumes of PLY on liposomes, implying that it is an intermediate, transient state which inserts more readily into curved liposomes than into planar bilayers. Cross-sections of pore complexes in liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,E</xref>) show that the lipid bilayer around the prepores and pores is curved, whereas in the AFM images it was flat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Pee et al., 2016</xref>). Prepore stability and membrane insertion thus seem to be related to membrane curvature, such that pores form preferentially in lipid bilayers with a convex curvature.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Determinants of lytic activity</title><p>To understand the functional role of individual sidechains in oligomerization, prepore and pore formation, we mutated Asp168 that, as the structure suggests, might be involved in forming a salt bridge between adjacent subunits to alanine (PLY<sub>D168A</sub>). We also deleted Ala146 and Arg147 (PLY<sub>Δ146/147</sub>) in the loop that would clash with the last β-strand of the central β-sheet.

However, unlike PLY<sub>WT</sub> that lysed the liposomes within a short time, liposomes incubated with PLY<sub>D168A</sub> remained intact for hours. Frequently, the rings detached from the liposomes, indicating they were prepores that had not yet inserted into the membrane. This is also reflected by the hemolytic activity, which was reduced by 80% compared to PLY<sub>WT</sub>, highlighting the important role of Asp168 in ionic interactions between β-strands that stabilize the pore complex.</p><p>PLY<sub>Δ146/147</sub> was not able to bind to the membranes at all and had no detectable hemolytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Ionic interactions between the β-strands thus contribute significantly to pore stability, and any disruption of these interactions compromises pore formation. Both mutations pinpoint protein regions that are promising targets for drug development. Drugs that interfere with these interactions would render the toxin ineffective, and the bacteria that produce it non-pathogenic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>With the ongoing resolution revolution in cryoEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kühlbrandt, 2014</xref>), structures of macromolecular assemblies can now be determined at high resolution without crystals. This is proving especially useful for membrane proteins and membrane protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allegretti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hahn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Letts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liao et al., 2013</xref>), which tend to be unstable and flexible, and often do not crystallize. In the case of CDC pore complexes, structure determination represents a particular challenge, because they consist of variable numbers of 30 to 50 monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shatursky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shepard et al., 1998</xref>), and hence are intrinsically inhomogeneous. This fact has so far precluded structure determination of the membrane-attached or membrane-inserted form at high resolution. By a rigorous screen of the detergents used for solubilisation and purification of the pore complex from cholesterol-containing liposomes we were able to isolate a suitably homogenous population. Exchanging the detergent against amphipols appeared to stabilize rings of uniform size, as an important prerequisite for high-resolution single-particle cryoEM. The number of monomers in the amphipol-stabilized complexes was higher than in the prepores or the pores imaged by cryoET, even though the liposomes were prepared in the same way. This means that either the number of subunits in the ring varies from one liposome preparation to another, or that the rings rearrange into a more stable form upon detergent solubilisation, which we consider more likely. Interestingly, an earlier, low-resolution cryoEM structure of PLY pores and prepores in lipid bilayers deduced that there were 31 ± 3 subunits in the prepore and 38 or 44 in the pore complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tilley et al., 2005</xref>), in good agreement with our findings. Since the PLY pores in our subtomogram averages were smaller, consisting of 34 rather than 42 subunits, it seems that the rings can grow in the membrane by incorporating further subunits. Apparently, complexes of 42 monomers are more stable than both larger and smaller rings. The inherent variability in ring size restricts the number of particles that can be averaged in any one class. Moreover, the large ring-shaped assemblies are easily distorted and rarely, if ever, perfectly circular, which limits the accuracy to which they can be aligned by image processing. Both factors constrain the attainable resolution of the cryoEM reconstruction.</p><p>Earlier cryoEM work, AFM and FRET studies have described the vertical height change of the prepore upon membrane insertion in terms of a collapse or unfolding of D2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramachandran et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tilley et al., 2005</xref>). Our atomic model of the pore complex now shows that this change is due to a rigid-body rotation of D2, in which the structure of the domain remains intact. Time-lapse AFM of PLY and listeriolysin (LLO) on planar membranes indicated that the vertical height change is not directly linked to pore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mulvihill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Pee et al., 2016</xref>), in line with a mechanism that involves two different prepore states that we refer to as the early and late prepore. Our model of the late prepore monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) is an intermediate between the x-ray structure of the soluble form and the cryoEM structure of the membrane-inserted form. The 5-stranded central β-sheet in the crystal structure of D3 fits into the cryoET map of the early prepore complex without any modification, but the late prepore model indicates a potential steric clash between the short β-strand in the central β-sheet of D3 and the adjacent monomer. The pivotal role of the loop that contains residues 145–147 connecting helix α5 of D1 to β7 of β-hairpin one is underlined by mutant PLY<sub>Δ146/147</sub> that was completely inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kirkham et al., 2006</xref>) and did not even bind to liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The detachment of PLY<sub>D168A</sub> rings indicates that the mutant does not insert into the membrane as easily as PLY<sub>WT</sub> to form pores. We have shown by time-lapse AFM that pore formation is irreversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Pee et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore the rings that become detached from the membrane are prepores, not pores.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23644.021</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Mechanism of membrane insertion and pore formation.</title><p>Stepwise conformational changes of PLY toxin during pore formation shown for one monomer (above, side view) and for three neighbouring monomers (below, view from the pore centre).

A 90° rotation of D2 moves D1 and D3 towards the membrane in the late prepore. Helix bundles HB1 and HB2 are poised above the membrane surface to refold into 85 Å β-hairpins HP1 and HP2. In the final step of pore formation, both hairpins traverse the hydrophobic membrane core and assemble into a 168-strand, 260 Å β-barrel.

A similar HTH motif was found in the 8 Å cryoEM map of poly-C9 component of the human membrane attack complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dudkina et al., 2016</xref>). This HTH motif was already present in the soluble monomer of the C6 component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aleshin et al., 2012</xref>) As in PLY, the HTH in the poly-C9 pore forms an α-barrel that determines the effective pore diameter.</p><p>Together with the x-ray structure of the soluble form, our cryoEM structures of the pore and prepore explain the step-by-step process of membrane insertion and pore formation in near-atomic detail. Movies showing the transition from the soluble monomer to the pore complex via the intermediate stages of the early and late prepore illustrate the complete mechanism of pore formation (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Videos 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref>). In the early prepore, PLY monomers assemble side by side into rings on the membrane surface. In the late prepore, the D3 helices are poised for re-folding immediately above membrane surface. Helix unfolding may be a stochastic yet cooperative event, such that the spontaneous transition of one monomer triggers the refolding of its neighbours in the ring, comparable to a zipper. As the 168-strand β-barrel assembles in the membrane, the charged patches on its inside surface would repel any trapped hydrophobic lipid. Most likely the lipid is pushed out of the nascent pore by successively inserted toxin monomers, rather than being ejected in the form of micelles or small vesicles, as has been proposed for suilysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leung et al., 2014</xref>). Upon pore formation, the membrane potential collapses, the cytoplasm leaks out and the cell dies.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-23644-media2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23644.022</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Mechanism of pneumolysin pore formation.</title><p>(1) Soluble PLY monomers attach to cholesterol-rich membranes by the cholesterol-binding undecapeptide (light green) of domain D4 (blue) and oligomerize into rings.

Samples of 3 µl were applied to glow-discharged Quantifoil EM grids (R2/2, Cu 300 mesh), excess liquid was blotted off with filter paper (Whatman #4) and samples were vitrified by plunge-freezing into liquid ethane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dubochet et al., 1988</xref>). Single-axis tilt series were typically collected from −62° to +62° at 2° increments and 3–4 µm underfocus with a total electron dose of 60–80 e<sup>-</sup> · Å<sup>-2</sup>, on a Tecnai Polara electron microscope equipped with a field emisson gun operating at 300 kV (FEI, Hillsboro, OR), a post-column energy filter (GIF Quantum, Gatan) and a K2 summit direct electron detector (Gatan). Images were recorded in counting mode with a pixel size of 0.35 nm. Tilt series were CTF-corrected, binned 2 × 2 and aligned.

Ring-shaped complexes were picked manually in 3dmod. A total of 752 prepore complexes and 2400 pore complexes were picked for averaging. Ring volumes were pre-aligned in one plane in 2 × 2 binned unfiltered tomograms. All prepores had roughly the same size and shape and were averaged in PEET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nicastro et al., 2006</xref>). The average volume was used as an initial reference for symmetry determination by sub-tomogram averaging with IMOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>). Symmetries of 42-fold or lower were applied to each prepore volume on a trial-and-error basis. Volumes were aligned and averaged in an iterative process, which converged within about 15 iterations on an average volume with clear 34-fold symmetry. The best 70% of the prepore volumes contributed to the final average, in which 34 PLY monomers were resolved in the ring.</p><p>Pore complexes were separated into seven classes according to their shape and diameter by principal component analysis and clusterPCA in IMOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>). The best class with 844 pore complexes was used for further processing as described above. In the final pore complex average, individual subunits were clearly distinguished in one third of the ring, indicating some heterogeneity of ring size and symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The number of PLY monomers in the pore was determined as 34 from the angular distance between distinct subunits in the average volume and the ring diameter. As for the prepores, all averaging steps were performed in PEET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nicastro et al., 2006</xref>). The resolution at FSC<sub>0.5</sub> was 27 Å for the pore and 22 Å for the prepore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>).

Initially, individual domains in the x-ray structure of soluble PLY were fitted manually into the cryoEM map as rigid bodies using COOT. Refolded or flexible protein regions were re-fitted manually, followed by geometry regularization in COOT. The complete backbone of PLY was traced in the pore complex map. Densities of bulky side chains were observed in well-ordered regions. The transmembrane β-hairpins, which form upon unfolding of HB1 and HB2 in domain 3 were readily fitted to the map density.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Sjors HW Scheres, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christos G Savva (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by van Pee and co-workers describes the cryo-EM structures of the cholesterol dependent cytolysin (CDC) pneumolysin (PLY) in the membrane-inserted and pre-pore states by single particle and tomography respectively. Although the first crystal structure of a CDC (perfringolysin O) in the water soluble state was solved almost 20 years ago, a high-resolution structure of the membrane-inserted form has been elusive due to the inherent structural heterogeneity of these complexes with the best results so far limited to the resolution of ~10-15Å where domains can be approximately identified but the exact mechanics of the transition from soluble to membrane-inserted cannot be seen. Despite the recent developments of direct electron detectors and better software that have pushed the resolution limits of Cryo-EM, this class of pore forming toxins still poses difficulties due to the irregular size and shape of the pores. In this study authors have succeeded in preparing more homogeneous samples by systematically screening various detergents. The end result is the first near-atomic resolution structure of a CDC in the membrane-inserted state, which provides valuable information for the mechanics of pore formation including the large movements of domains 2 and 3, which have not been resolved previously by other studies. In general the manuscript is well written and is an important step for the field of pore forming proteins of the CDC/MACPF family. Therefore, the three reviewers were overall positive about publishing this work, although several important issues were raised that should be addressed in a revised version.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The overall resolution of the single-particle reconstruction is limited to 4.5A, whereas the entire paper discusses the resulting atomic model as if this were a atomic-resolution structure. Locally the resolution is probably even worse than 4.5A, as for example the β strands are not well separated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Overall, too little information is given on the quality of the map and the corresponding atomic model. In fact, at 4.5A, the map alone will probably still leave considerable scope for registry or main chain tracing errors. Therefore, the authors should explicitly discuss these caveats where relevant in the main text. In addition, they should provide the following (supplementary?) information in their revision:</p><p>– A map that displays variations in local resolution (e.g. as calculated in resmap).</p><p>– A view of a segmented monomer from the sharpened map (possibly also colored by local resolution) would be helpful to further evaluate the quality of the map</p><p>– Zoomed-in views of density and model, or movie(s) of such, for various regions in the structure</p><p>– FSC curve between the refined model and the map. And because overfitting can be important at this resolution, preferably also FSC curves for refinement in one half-map, combined with FSC curves between the refined model and the other half-map.</p><p>– A more detailed description of the model building and refinement procedures, which is transparent about which parts of the model are less well defined than others.</p><p>2) At the reported resolution the salt bridge between Asp168 and Lys271 should be interpreted carefully. A close up of the EM densities around these residues should be provided. Although the authors have mutated Asp168 and seen a 20% reduction in hemolytic activity this is not conclusive of a salt-bridge disruption. Did mutation of Lys271 also result in the same phenotype? In addition the mutation seems to affect membrane binding as the authors mention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> legend) and the ring attachment from the membranes (subsection “Determinants of lytic activity”). Does this imply that pores are formed but are then released? Previous AFM studies by the authors (van Pee et. Al, Nano Letters, 2016) suggest the process is irreversible. Some clarity and caution interpreting this salt bridge would improve the manuscript.</p><p>3) Also related to the limited resolution: interactions of the Trp-rich loop are discussed (Results section) but the electron density map in that region looks poorly resolved. This is a very important part of a CDC and the motif defines the family so another panel is required to show the quality of the electron density map in that region. (A close up stereo showing side-chains would help). There is great interest in seeing what conformation this loop adopts in the prepore and pore states since it is thought to control prepore to pore conversion. In Results paragraph two, the authors state that the undecapeptide is interacting with Thr405. This sentence should be re-worded to provide more detail. What is the nature of this interaction and again is the resolution of this area sufficient to justify this comment? From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> the loop itself does not seem to be resolved even at the Cα backbone level.</p><p>4) A major finding of this work is that domain 2 collapses but does not lose its structure (Results section). Earlier EM studies suggested it does lose its structure but modeling and FRET studies suggested otherwise. More discussion of this controversy is required. Importantly, the electron density of this key region should be shown in a figure to satisfy the reader that the structure has been maintained. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> is not convincing enough. A stereo with side-chains focused on D2 only would be easier to evaluate). Some new detailed insights are discussed; namely, the remodeled helix-turn-helix motif and helix alpha3a. Can stereo figures of the electron density with side-chains displayed of these regions be shown?</p><p>5) The electron cryo-tomography of the prepore reveals a structure of 34 protomers in the prepore, a number expected based on numerous other reports. However, the CryoEM structure of the pore reveals a larger 42 protomer pore. This is unexpected but interestingly the authors note a range of ring structures were present with this being the most stable. So the question arises whether the pore structure is an artifact. Can the authors model a 34 protomer pore based on their 42 protomer structure and convince that the details they discuss in the 42 protomer pore are likely relevant to the smaller pore? Is the 20º incline in the β-hairpin maintained in modeling the smaller pore? Like the authors, other workers have found that PLY form linear oligomers in their crystals. The authors should discuss how linear oligomers fit into their detailed mechanism of pore formation.</p><p>6) The authors have skirted around another controversial issue of whether arcs and incomplete rings observed by other workers are physiological relevant as they are not observed in this work. Some discussion of why PLY does not form such structures in their hands but do in others would be insightful.</p><p>7) Subsection “Three stages of PLY pore formation”: In the previous AFM study (van Pee et. Al, Nano Letters, 2016) only 13% of the lower height rings were pre-pores on supported lipid membranes. This could be mentioned to indicate that the occurrence of a &quot;late prepore&quot; is rare event even on membranes without curvature.</p><p>8) The literature review, particularly in the Discussion, has been narrowly focused to a large degree on the PLY literature and should be broadened out to other CDCs, particularly to PFO where there is an extensive literature on how it forms pores. Does the current study support the major findings in the PFO literature and does it disagree with any aspects?</p><p>9) Parts of the Discussion should be moderated. The limited resolution and a few static snapshots do not reveal all the details of membrane insertion and pore formation. Such details will come gradually from a host of biochemical and biophysical approaches. The suggestion that the CryoEM structure forms a good basis for drug discovery to treat numerous Gram-positive infections is not supported by any results in the manuscript so should be restricted to a speculative claim about S. pneumoniae.</p><p>10) Please include crystallization and crystallography methods.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;CryoEM structures of membrane pore and prepore complex reveal cytolytic mechanism of Pneumolysin&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this manuscript has improved considerably and is almost ready for publication. However, there was also consensus that a few of the main points raised in the first round have not been dealt with satisfactorily. These are:</p><p>1) Over-interpretation of lower-resolution parts of the map in terms of the atomic model. Although the new supplementary figures now reveal the limitations of the map more clearly, over-interpretation in the text still remains a problem. Specifically, W433 is mentioned to move wrt the crystal structure, yet there is no density visible for W433 in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> or 3 to support this statement. The map in this region is ~6Å. The same can be said for H407 that does also not have clear density. The authors should stay away from over-interpretation in this region and simply state that this domain is likely to contribute to the inter-molecular interactions that stabilize the pore, as they have done in the Discussion section, paragraph three. Likewise, there is no obvious density that connects D168 and K271 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> instead shows connecting density between β-strands that is expected at resolutions lower than 4.7A). The resolution in this area is again ~6-7Å according to the local resolution estimation. The authors should be more cautious and can suggest that a salt bridge may exist as evident by the point mutant D168A, which has an 80% reduction in hemolytic activity.</p><p>2) The comment in the Discussion section: &quot;The 4.5 Å cryoEM structure of the PLY pore complex thus paves the way towards the design of new drugs that inhibit toxin oligomerization and pore formation as a promising approach towards combating infections by wide-spread and dangerous Gram-positive pathogens&quot; jars with the reply &quot;the different CDCs seem to follow different pathways of pore formation…. Any more discussion of PFO papers would distract from the main focus of our work, which is on PLY.&quot; Therefore, the authors should focus the therapeutic claim focus to diseases that PLY has shown to contribute.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23644.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The overall resolution of the single-particle reconstruction is limited to 4.5A, whereas the entire paper discusses the resulting atomic model as if this were a atomic-resolution structure.</italic> </p><p>We are aware, and do not approve of the general tendency to overstate the resolution and quality of cryoEM maps.

Together with the hydrophobic residues facing the lipid bilayer on the outside of the barrel and the polar and charged residues facing the inside, this leaves virtually no room for chain trace errors even at 4.5 Å. Moreover, we know that the β-strands in the barrel are well-resolved because of the sharp peak at 4.8 Å in the FSC curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), which is the characteristic distance between β-strands. We can therefore be sure that our atomic model of the β-barrel, which is the major new part of the structure, is correct and accurate within the constraints of the map.</p><p><italic>Therefore, the authors should explicitly discuss these caveats where relevant in the main text. In addition, they should provide the following (supplementary?) information in their revision:</italic> </p><p><italic>– A map that displays variations in local resolution (e.g. as calculated in resmap).</italic> </p><p><italic>– A view of a segmented monomer from the sharpened map (possibly also colored by local resolution) would be helpful to further evaluate the quality of the map</italic> </p><p>It is true that the local resolution of some parts of the map, especially the loops connecting the long β-strands and one loop in the periphery of domain 4, is worse than 4.5 Å, but the resolution of domains 1, 2 and parts of domain 4 is significantly better. The local resolution estimate (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) shows this clearly for the whole pore complex and for an individual protomer seen from different directions. The new supplementary figures demonstrate the excellent quality of the map, which resolves many of the tryptophan and tyrosine sidechains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). This would be expected at 4 Å rather than at 4.5 Å resolution.</p><p><italic>– Zoomed-in views of density and model, or movie(s) of such, for various regions in the structure</italic> </p><p>We included five new zoomed-in figures as supplements to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>: stereo diagram of the interface between domain 1 (red) and domain 3 (green) drawn as a ribbon-and-stick model.

Note that the model was used as built into the map, but not refined, for the reasons given below. Like the masked FSC, this curve shows a sharp peak at 4.8 Å, due to the strong contribution of the resolved long β hairpins in the barrel. The correlation factor at the steep drop beyond this peak at 4.5 Å is not 0.5 (which is an arbitrary value), but approximately 0.3. We draw the reviewers’ and editor’s attention to two papers, which will be familiar to the BRE of our study, that report similar thresholds for the map against model FSC of the 3.4 Å structure of the ribosome/Sec61 complex (Voorhees et al., Cell 2014) and the tri-snRNP spliceosome at 5.9 Å (Nguyen et al., Nature 2015).</p><p><italic>And because overfitting can be important at this resolution, preferably also FSC curves for refinement in one half-map, combined with FSC curves between the refined model and the other half-map.</italic> </p><p>We can rule out overfitting for three reasons: (1) Substantial portions of the model were not built from scratch, but they were rigid-body fitted domains from our 2.4 Å x-ray structure of soluble PLY. These map regions cannot be overfitted. (2) The major new part of the membrane-inserted form of the PLY protomer is a β-barrel with 84 long β-hairpins of rigid, pre-defined geometry, so the risk of overfitting in this region is minimal. (3) The comparison of the phase-randomized vs masked FSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) indicates that there is no overfitted noise.</p><p><italic>– A more detailed description of the model building and refinement procedures, which is transparent about which parts of the model are less well defined than others.</italic> </p><p>The individual domains of the PLY x-ray structure were fitted manually into the cryoEM map as rigid bodies with COOT. Where necessary, flexible or refolded protein regions were then refitted manually, followed by geometry regularization in COOT. We had described this procedure clearly in the methods of the original manuscript, but now describe it also in the main text, where it is less easily overlooked.</p><p>Fitting and refinement with Phenix or Refmac was tried but did not work, because these automatic procedures attempted to e.g. fit the membrane-inserted β-hairpins into the amphipol density around the hydrophobic part of the pore. The densities of amphipol and protein are comparable at 4-4.5 Å resolution, and only manual fitting can differentiate between them. Therefore, it was unfortunately not possible to employ automatic model fitting and refinement. It is well known that refinement of x-ray structures at similar resolutions also does not work, for the same reasons.</p><p><italic>2) At the reported resolution the salt bridge between Asp168 and Lys271 should be interpreted carefully. A close up of the EM densities around these residues should be provided.</italic> </p><p>Even though this salt bridge is in the least well-defined map region near the tip of the long β-hairpins, there was significant density for it, as shown in the new panel G of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. We would like to point out that we did not look for this salt bridge, but deduced that there had to be one in this position from our chain trace, and then found the corresponding map density, which again shows there were no chain tracing errors in the β-barrel. Moreover, the interaction of adjacent β-hairpins that includes this salt bridge is in excellent agreement with the S-S crosslinking studies of Tweten and colleagues in the related PFO (Sato et al. 2013, NatChemBiol). This is now explained more fully in subsection “CryoEM structure of the PLY pore complex” paragraph four of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Although the authors have mutated Asp168 and seen a 20% reduction in hemolytic activity this is not conclusive of a salt-bridge disruption. Did mutation of Lys271 also result in the same phenotype?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer did not read our manuscript carefully. The mutation of Asp168 to alanine reduces the hemolytic activity by 80%, not to 80%! This is exactly the strong effect that one would expect from the disruption of a salt bridge stabilizing the membrane-inserted form. We do not see the point of mutating Lys271 as well.</p><p><italic>In addition the mutation seems to affect membrane binding as the authors mention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> legend) and the ring attachment from the membranes (subsection “Determinants of lytic activity”). Does this imply that pores are formed but are then released? Previous AFM studies by the authors (van Pee et. Al, Nano Letters, 2016) suggest the process is irreversible. Some clarity and caution interpreting this salt bridge would improve the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We apologize if this was not clear in the original manuscript. In the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> legend we wrote “Many PLY<sub>D168A</sub> rings become detached from the liposomes, probably due to reduced binding affinity, and tend to break into fragments.” At this stage, the rings are of course prepores, and it is these, not the pores, that become detached and break into fragments. In the revised manuscript (subsection “Determinants of lytic activity” paragraph two) and Figure legend, we have clarified this point.</p><p>Note that the AFM study (van Pee et. al, Nano Letters, 2016, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) describes the transformation of membrane-attached rings into pores as irreversible, not the membrane attachment of the rings. Rings of this PLY mutant in the early prepore state detach from the membrane easily, but only before they (irreversibly) insert into the membrane to form the pore. This is now discussed in on paragraph two of the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>3) Also related to the limited resolution: interactions of the Trp-rich loop are discussed (Results section) but the electron density map in that region looks poorly resolved. This is a very important part of a CDC and the motif defines the family so another panel is required to show the quality of the electron density map in that region. (A close up stereo showing side-chains would help). There is great interest in seeing what conformation this loop adopts in the prepore and pore states since it is thought to control prepore to pore conversion. In Results paragraph two, the authors state that the undecapeptide is interacting with Thr405. This sentence should be re-worded to provide more detail. What is the nature of this interaction and again is the resolution of this area sufficient to justify this comment? From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> the loop itself does not seem to be resolved even at the Cα backbone level.</italic> </p><p>The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> shows domain 4 of PLY in the cryoEM (green) and x-ray structure from the inside of the ring. Differences between the undecapeptide structure in the soluble and pore forms of PLY are surprisingly small. The closest distance between Trp433 and Asp403 or Thr405 is 4-5 Å.</p><p>The stereo image of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> (see response to comment 1 above) shows the interactions of the D4 loops between two monomers. These interactions and their consequences are now discussed in more detail in the revised manuscript in paragraph three of the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>4) A major finding of this work is that domain 2 collapses but does not lose its structure (Results section). Earlier EM studies suggested it does lose its structure but modeling and FRET studies suggested otherwise. More discussion of this controversy is required. Importantly, the electron density of this key region should be shown in a figure to satisfy the reader that the structure has been maintained. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> is not convincing enough. A stereo with side-chains focused on D2 only would be easier to evaluate). Some new detailed insights are discussed; namely, the remodeled helix-turn-helix motif and helix alpha3a. Can stereo figures of the electron density with side-chains displayed of these regions be shown?</italic> </p><p>In the earlier cryoEM studies no intramolecular details were resolved and the rotation of domain 2 was interpreted as a “collapse”. To propose a rotation of domain 2 would have been more plausible but was not suggested. The FRET study (Ramachandran et al. 2005, PNAS) was interpreted in terms of a bending of domain 2 to account for the height change observed by AFM (Czajkowsky et al. 2004, PNAS). Our present cryoEM structure now shows that both interpretations were incorrect. We rewrote the corresponding text passage (Discussion section paragraph three) that now includes a reference to the FRET study. The AFM study had already been cited.</p><p>The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> shows the remodeled helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif as stick models and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref> the β-strands of domain 2.</p><p><italic>5) The electron cryo-tomography of the prepore reveals a structure of 34 protomers in the prepore, a number expected based on numerous other reports. However, the CryoEM structure of the pore reveals a larger 42 protomer pore. This is unexpected but interestingly the authors note a range of ring structures were present with this being the most stable. So the question arises whether the pore structure is an artifact.</italic> </p><p>We do not think that the numbers of subunits we found in the PLY prepore and pore are at all unexpected. Tilley et al. (Cell, 2005) reported 31 ± 3 monomers in the PLY prepore, and two classes with 38 or 44 monomers in the PLY pore, in excellent overall agreement with our findings. Both the prepore and pore of Tilley et al. were in liposomes, so there can be no question that the number of subunits in our detergent-solubilized PLY pores is artefactual.</p><p><italic>Can the authors model a 34 protomer pore based on their 42 protomer structure and convince that the details they discuss in the 42 protomer pore are likely relevant to the smaller pore? Is the 20º incline in the β-hairpin maintained in modeling the smaller pore?</italic> </p><p>It must have escaped the reviewer’s notice that we already built a 34-protomer model into the smaller pore of the subtomogram average, and that this was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> of the original manuscript. No significant modification of the pore subunit, in particular not of the 20° incline of the β-hairpins relative to the membrane normal, was necessary to fit 34 copies of the pore-forming subunit into the 27 Å-resolution cryoET map. This is now pointed out more clearly in subsection “Three stages of PLY pore formation” of the revised manuscript</p><p><italic>Like the authors, other workers have found that PLY form linear oligomers in their crystals. The authors should discuss how linear oligomers fit into their detailed mechanism of pore formation.</italic> </p><p>A description of how the linear arrays of the various x-ray structures relate to the prepore and pore form of PLY, and how this fits our detailed mechanism of pore formation can be found in our recent AFM paper (van Pee et al., Nano Lett 2016; supporting figure S2 and text relating to it).</p><p><italic>6) The authors have skirted around another controversial issue of whether arcs and incomplete rings observed by other workers are physiological relevant as they are not observed in this work. Some discussion of why PLY does not form such structures in their hands but do in others would be insightful.</italic> </p><p>We certainly have no intention of skirting around this issue. Arcs and slits of PLY<sub>wt</sub> are actually visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. This figure was there in the original manuscript, but we now point them out specially with coloured arrows. However, in contrast to LLO, PLY forms mostly complete rings.</p><p><italic>7) Subsection “Three stages of PLY pore formation”: In the previous AFM study (van Pee et. Al, Nano Letters, 2016) only 13% of the lower height rings were pre-pores on supported lipid membranes. This could be mentioned to indicate that the occurrence of a &quot;late prepore&quot; is rare event even on membranes without curvature.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, which we have taken up in paragraph two of subsection “Three stages of PLY pore formation2” of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>8) The literature review, particularly in the Discussion, has been narrowly focused to a large degree on the PLY literature and should be broadened out to other CDCs, particularly to PFO where there is an extensive literature on how it forms pores. Does the current study support the major findings in the PFO literature and does it disagree with any aspects?</italic> </p><p>Notwithstanding their high degree of sequence identity and similar monomer and oligomer structures, the different CDCs seem to follow different pathways of pore formation. Of the 21 papers on pore-forming toxins that we cite in our manuscript, more than half deal with PFO. Any more discussion of PFO papers would distract from the main focus of our work, which is on PLY.</p><p><italic>9) Parts of the Discussion should be moderated. The limited resolution and a few static snapshots do not reveal all the details of membrane insertion and pore formation. Such details will come gradually from a host of biochemical and biophysical approaches. The suggestion that the CryoEM structure forms a good basis for drug discovery to treat numerous Gram-positive infections is not supported by any results in the manuscript so should be restricted to a speculative claim about S. pneumoniae.</italic> </p><p>The cryoEM structure of the PLY pore complex shows clearly the interactions of the secondary structure elements of neighboring protomers. The structure further shows how elements of secondary structure present in the soluble form refold and take on a completely different structure in the membrane. While the formation of the long membrane-inserted β-hairpins was predicted as such, no one could know or predict the exact structure of the β-strands and how they interact to form the membrane-perforating barrel. Other structural elements, including the inner α-barrel and the newly formed helix in domain 1, are entirely new. These elements are involved in inter- and intramolecular interactions in the pore complex. Even at 4.5 to 5 Å resolution there can be no reasonable doubt of their existence and interaction. Targeting these regions with newly developed drugs would be an elegant way to inhibit pore formation and infection, and thus an effective means of putting these pathogen out of action. We think that our discussion of this aspect of the PLY structure is reasonable and adequate.</p><p><italic>10) Please include crystallization and crystallography methods.</italic></p><p>Done</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The reviewers agreed that this manuscript has improved considerably and is almost ready for publication. However, there was also consensus that a few of the main points raised in the first round have not been dealt with satisfactorily. These are:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Over-interpretation of lower-resolution parts of the map in terms of the atomic model. Although the new supplementary figures now reveal the limitations of the map more clearly, over-interpretation in the text still remains a problem. Specifically, W433 is mentioned to move wrt the crystal structure, yet there is no density visible for W433 in Video-1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> or 3 to support this statement. The map in this region is ~6Å. The same can be said for H407 that does also not have clear density. The authors should stay away from over-interpretation in this region and simply state that this domain is likely to contribute to the inter-molecular interactions that stabilize the pore, as they have done in the Discussion section, paragraph three.</italic> </p><p>As explained in our first response letter, the location of most residues in domain 4, which hardly changes its conformation upon membrane insertion, is predefined by the crystal structure of the soluble PLY monomer. Although the resolution of the cryoEM map in the loop regions is lower, there is little room for misinterpreting the loop conformations. Nevertheless, we changed the manuscript text as requested by the reviewers.</p><p>The statement:</p><p>“In D4, Trp433 at the tip of the highly conserved undecapeptide loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that renders PLY cholesterol-specific (Soltani et al., 2007b) was shifted by ~9 Å into the map density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). “</p><p>was changed to:</p><p>“In D4, the highly conserved undecapeptide loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that renders PLY cholesterol-specific (Soltani et al., 2007b) was shifted by up to ~9 Å into the cryoEM map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).”</p><p>The statement:</p><p>“The short distances of Asp403 and Thr405 to Trp433 and of His407 to Try461 in adjacent monomers suggest a critical role of the D4 loop not only in receptor recognition, but also in oligomer formation.“</p><p>was changed to:</p><p>“The close proximity of loop β18/19 that contains Asp403, Thr405, and His407 of one monomer to loop β22/23 and the uncedapeptide containing Trp433 of the adjacent monomer suggests a critical role of these loops not only in receptor recognition, but also in oligomer formation.”</p><p>The statement:</p><p>“The conserved Trp433 in the undecapeptide loop seems to form a polar interaction with Asp403 and Thr405 in the loop that connects β18/19 in the neighbouring monomer, and Try461 interacts with His407 of the next monomer, most likely by π-stacking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>).”</p><p>was changed to:</p><p>“Loop β22/23 and the conserved undecapeptide loop with Trp433 at its tip appear to interact with loop β18/19 of the neighbouring monomer, thereby stabilizing the pore complex by inter- and intramolecular interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>).”</p><p><italic>Likewise, there is no obvious density that connects D168 and K271 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> instead shows connecting density between β-strands that is expected at resolutions lower than 4.7A).

As far as anyone knows, the mechanism of membrane insertion by rearrangement of the conserved domains 1 – 4 is the same for all CDCs. What we meant was that the exact pathways by which the membrane-inserted toxin monomers assemble into pores may differ between species. While most CDCs form circular pores, a small number of bacteria, for example <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> or Streptococcus pyogenes, give rise to slit-like or arch-shaped pores. However, the structure of the membrane-inserted monomers in these slit-like or arch-shaped pores would be essentially the same as the membrane-inserted form of PLY. Therefore, compounds that interfere with refolding and membrane insertion of soluble monomers would prevent infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae and other CDC-producing Gram-positive bacteria. We have modified the last paragraph of the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>“The mechanism of membrane insertion by rearrangement of the conserved domains 1 – 4 is likely to be the same for all CDCs.
