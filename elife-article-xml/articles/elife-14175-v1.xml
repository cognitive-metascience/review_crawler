photosensitivity. This symptom results from accumulation of porphyrins, tetrapyrrole intermediates in heme biosynthesis that generate reactive oxygen species when exposed to light, in the skin of affected individuals. Here we report that in addition to producing an ommochrome body pigment, the planarian flatworm <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> generates porphyrins in its subepithelial pigment cells under physiological conditions, and that this leads to pigment cell loss when animals are exposed to intense visible light. Remarkably, porphyrin biosynthesis and light-induced depigmentation are enhanced by starvation, recapitulating a common feature of some porphyrias – decreased nutrient intake precipitates an acute manifestation of the disease. Our results establish planarians as an experimentally tractable animal model for research into the pathophysiology of acute porphyrias, and potentially for the identification of novel pharmacological interventions capable of alleviating porphyrin-mediated photosensitivity or decoupling dieting and fasting from disease pathogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14175.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14175.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14175.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Porphyrias are rare diseases that involve ring-shaped molecules called porphyrins accumulating in various parts of the body. Porphyrins are produced as part of the normal process that makes an important molecule called heme, which is required to transport oxygen. However, high levels of porphyrins can be toxic. For example, porphyrins deposited in the skin can cause swelling and blistering when the skin is exposed to bright light. Other disease symptoms include neurological issues ranging from anxiety and confusion to seizures or paralysis. It has been speculated that porphyrias may have affected several historical figures, including the artist Vincent van Gogh.</p><p>In addition to their role in heme production, porphyrins also have other roles. For example, they are used as pigments in the wing feathers of some owls. Researchers are trying to understand more about how organisms regulate porphyrin production so that it might be possible to develop more effective treatments for porphyria in humans.</p><p>Here, Stubenhaus et al. studied how a flatworm called <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> makes porphyrins. A group of undergraduate students noticed that these animals – which are normally brown in color – turned white when they were exposed to sunlight for several days. Stubenhaus et al. found that <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> makes porphyrins in the pigment cells of its skin using the same genes that make porphyrins in humans. Together with other molecules called ommochromes, the porphyrins give rise to the normal color of this flatworm. However, when the animals are exposed to intense light for extended periods of time, which is unlikely to occur in the wild, porphyrin production leads to loss of the pigment cells.</p><p>The experiments also show that starvation increases the rate of pigment cell loss in light-exposed flatworms, which mirrors the worsening of disease symptoms some porphyria patients experience when they diet or fast. Stubenhaus et al. propose that flatworms are useful models in which to study the molecular processes that are responsible for porphyrias in humans. Further research is required to determine the exact chemical structure of the porphyrin and ommochrome molecules produced in different flatworm species. Stubenhaus et al. also plan to use flatworms to screen for drugs that could potentially be developed into new treatments for porphyria.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14175.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14175.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>planarian</kwd><kwd>porphyria</kwd><kwd>porphyrin</kwd><kwd>heme</kwd><kwd>ommochrome</kwd><kwd>pigment</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-130294</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Xinwen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004203</institution-id><institution>Ontario Institute for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA-026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearson</surname><given-names>Bret J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM103506</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pellettieri</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R15GM107826-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pellettieri</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1445541</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pellettieri</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

With few exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kořený et al., 2012</xref>), it is essential for viability in all 3 domains of life.</p><p>Heme is composed of a heterocyclic tetrapyrrole called a porphyrin coordinated to a central iron atom (some researchers classify the entire heme molecule as a porphyrin, but this term is reserved for the organic ring alone here). Although naturally occurring auxotrophs have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gruss et al., 2012</xref>), heme is usually synthesized from the precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. In non-photosynthetic eukaryotes, ALA is produced in the mitochondria via condensation of glycine and succinyl CoA by ALA synthase (ALAS). This is the first and typically rate-limiting step in the heme biosynthesis pathway, which proceeds in the cytoplasm before returning to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Layer et al., 2010</xref>). Like ALAS, the enzymes catalyzing the 7 remaining reactions in the pathway are tightly regulated by ubiquitous and tissue-specific mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ponka, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balwani and Desnick, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Inherited, loss-of-function mutations in any of the heme biosynthesis enzymes downstream of ALAS (or gain-of-function mutations in ALAS) cause a group of diseases collectively referred to as porphyrias. These conditions are marked by characteristic clinical features – neurovisceral symptoms, skin lesions, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karim et al., 2015</xref>). While potentially attributable at least in part to heme deficiency, the primary etiology of these symptoms entails a buildup of pathway intermediates due to the bottleneck effect created by underlying mutations. ALA, and possibly also its pyrrole derivative porphobilinogen (PBG), is neurotoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pierach and Edwards, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Felitsyn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bissell et al., 2015</xref>). Porphyrins cause cutaneous abnormalities by virtue of their photosensitizing properties. Though generated primarily in the liver or bone marrow, the major sites of heme biosynthesis, they are eventually deposited in other tissues including the dermis. There, they readily absorb light to enter an excited triplet state that reacts with oxygen to produce singlet oxygen. This in turn results in oxidative damage, such as lipid peroxidation and DNA damage, that can ultimately lead to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poh-Fitzpatrick, 1986</xref>). Thus, sunlight, or even bright indoor light, quickly damages exposed skin in many porphyria patients. Clinically, porphyrin-mediated phototoxicity manifests as edema, blistering skin lesions, and in extreme cases, disfiguring scarring and/or tissue loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balwani and Desnick, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karim et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A subset of porphyrias classified as ‘acute’ present with sudden and potentially life-threatening attacks characterized by severe abdominal pain and neurological symptoms ranging from anxiety and confusion to seizures or paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balwani and Desnick, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karim et al., 2015</xref>). These episodes, which can last for weeks, are triggered by drugs (e.g., barbiturates), hormonal changes, dieting/fasting, and other factors that induce hepatic ALAS expression or activity. Accordingly, they are treated with therapies that effect ALAS downregulation. Carbohydrate loading reduces ALAS levels via insulin signaling and an antagonistic effect on its transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scassa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Handschin et al., 2005</xref>). This is sometimes effective in ameliorating mild attacks. More severe cases are treated with intravenous heme, which downregulates ALAS expression through a feedback inhibition mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonkowsky et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ponka, 1997</xref>). A small interfering RNA therapy targeting ALAS decreased plasma ALA and PBG levels in a mouse model of acute porphyria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yasuda et al., 2014</xref>), and entered clinical trials in 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, 2016</xref>, NCT02452372).</p><p>Given their toxic effects in porphyrias, it is interesting to note that porphyrins accumulate under physiological circumstances in some organisms. Porphyrins or their derivatives are pigments in the wing feathers of owls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">With, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weidensaul, 2011</xref>), the brilliant crimson flight feathers of turacos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">With, 1957</xref>), and numerous invertebrate lineages including earthworms, molluscs, and deep-sea medusae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kennedy, 1975</xref>). It has been known for close to a century that high levels of porphyrins are present in the rodent Harderian gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Derrien and Turchini, 1924</xref>), as well as in multiple tissues of the fox squirrel <italic>Sciurus niger</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Turner, 1937</xref>), though the significance of these observations remains mysterious. Porphyrins are also produced by bacteria such as <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>, a commensal skin microbe that contributes to the pathogenesis of acne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 1978</xref>). In summary, porphyrins appear to have important, but often uncharacterized functions independent of their more well-known roles as precursors to their metal-coordinated counterparts (e.g., heme and the magnesium porphyrin chlorophyll).</p><p>Here we extend previous biochemical studies documenting physiological porphyrin biosynthesis in the planarian <italic>Girardia</italic> (formerly <italic>Dugesia) dorotocephala</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacRae, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">1963</xref>) by showing the related planarian species <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> uses the first 3 enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway to generate porphyrins in its subepithelial pigment cells. We further demonstrate that porphyrins sensitize <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> to intense visible light, causing pigment cell loss in animals subjected to prolonged light exposure. This response is accelerated with starvation, echoing the connection between dieting or fasting and the symptomatic attacks experienced by acute porphyria patients. In addition to serving as a popular model organism for regeneration research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gentile et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reddien, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler and Sánchez Alvarado, 2015</xref>), our observations establish planarians as an invertebrate model for in vivo studies of porphyrin photosensitization, as well as metabolic inputs into the pathophysiology of acute porphyrias.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Prolonged light exposure induces bodily depigmentation in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic></title><p>This line of research originated with a serendipitous discovery in an undergraduate, general education course – sunlight exposure causes depigmentation of both regenerating and intact planarians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Red light is used in porphyrin-based PDT because it is transmitted by epithelial tissues but absorbed by porphyrins.

Thus, the growing evidence for production of these pigments in brown freshwater planarians also makes them logical candidates for contributing to the bright hues seen in many terrestrial flatworms and marine polyclads (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breugelmans et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lapraz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Noreña et al., 2014</xref>).

One possible explanation for these results is that ommochromes and porphyrins are jointly used as precursors in a downstream biosynthetic step to generate a single, brown body pigment, or that these molecules physically interact in a manner that quenches porphyrin fluorescence and is required for ommochrome maintenance. We are unaware of documented ommochrome-porphyrin interactions, but porphyrins can form complexes with melanins and this quenches their fluorescence in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ito et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Losi et al., 1993</xref>).

Ommochromes are known to have antioxidant activity in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ostrovsky et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Insausti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Romero and Martínez, 2015</xref>). Finally, our results are consistent with a negative feedback loop in which porphyrins induce ommochrome biosynthesis, with ommochromes in turn repressing porphyrin biosynthesis. In this regard, it is interesting to speculate that kynurenine or other tryptophan metabolites, rather than ommochromes themselves, might have signaling activities that impact porphyrin levels.</p><p>Ommochromes and metalloporphyrins have diverse biological functions extending beyond pigmentation per se. Adaptive roles for porphyrins in the absence of metal coordination, while suggested by the ‘physiological porphyria’ in organisms such as fox squirrels, are not understood. Thus, we can only speculate as to possible body pigment function(s) in planarians. One possibility is photoreception. <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> displays strong negative phototaxis. This is partly dependent on the melanin-producing pigment cups of the photoreceptors, yet animals lacking eye pigment retain photophobic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lambrus et al., 2015</xref>), and developing embryos display light avoidance prior to eye differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sánchez Alvarado, 2003</xref>). These observations point to the existence of one or more extraocular photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Paskin et al., 2014</xref>). The burning pain experienced by some porphyria patients upon sunlight exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balwani and Desnick, 2012</xref>) makes porphyrins logical candidates for further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>An animal model of acute porphyrias</title><p>Planarians have long attracted the interest of biologists investigating regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2002</xref>), and have recently emerged as a useful invertebrate model for human disorders including Usher syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lapan and Reddien, 2012</xref>) and cystic kidney disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thi-Kim Vu et al., 2015</xref>). Our results add acute porphyrias to this growing list.</p><p>The porphyrias are classified based on multiple criteria, including: 1) whether intermediates in heme biosynthesis are formed predominantly in the liver or bone marrow; 2) whether symptoms manifest primarily as skin lesions or neurovisceral episodes; and 3) the step at which heme biosynthesis is disrupted. Light-induced depigmentation in planarians combines aspects of multiple disease variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). UROS deficiency, the blockage in heme biosynthesis underlying CEP, is also the apparent determinant of physiological porphyrin biosynthesis in <italic>S. mediterranea.</italic> In the absence of this enzyme, its linear tetrapyrrole substrate hydroxymethylbilane undergoes spontaneous cyclization to form uroporphyrinogen I, a pathogenic isomer of uroporphyrinogen III that can in turn undergo spontaneous oxidation to form porphyrins. As in the human disease, our results implicate this biochemistry as the cause of severe cutaneous photosensitivity, but this is typically a chronic symptom in CEP, whereas it is induced by starvation in planarians. In the latter respect, <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> represents a unique animal model of acute porphyrias.</p><p>The episodic nature of acute porphyria symptoms is attributed to hepatic induction of <italic>ALAS1</italic>, 1 of 2 human isoforms of the gene, by endogenous and exogenous factors including dieting or fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balwani and Desnick, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karim et al., 2015</xref>). This can pose a weight-loss challenge for individuals carrying disease alleles and may be a complicating factor in bariatric surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lopes et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>ALAS</italic> and porphyrin levels are also increased in response to starvation in planarians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). These results are formally consistent with an increase in pigment cell number relative to other cell types as animal size decreases, but we regard this as unlikely because planarians become lighter in color, not darker, during prolonged starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller and Newmark, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, an increase in pigment cell density might be predicted to slow the rate of light-induced depigmentation, rather than accelerate it, and the rapid reversal of porphyrin-dependent photosensitivity when starved animals are re-fed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,E</xref>) is more consistent with a direct metabolic effect than a change in pigment cell density. In mice, fasting-induced <italic>ALAS</italic> upregulation is dependent on PGC- 1α, and inhibited by insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scassa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Handschin et al., 2005</xref>). While we have been unable to identify a PGC- 1α homolog in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>, insulin-like signaling has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller and Newmark, 2012</xref>). Future experiments, including RNAi knockdown of nutrient-sensing genes and the development of a defined diet, will be important for identifying the mechanisms linking metabolic cues to <italic>ALAS</italic> expression in planarians.</p><p>Existing animal models of acute porphyrias commonly rely on chemical treatments to evoke phenotypes resembling human disease symptoms. The planarian model reported here complements these systems in several respects. First, off-target effects of porphyrogenic compounds can be avoided. Second, induction of photosensitization via starvation has the potential to reveal novel metabolic inputs into heme biosynthesis, as well as the toxic effects of pathway intermediates. Third, the fluorescence of fixed animals and easily inducible depigmentation response provide a convenient means of assessing porphyrin levels and their photosensitizing activity in vivo. This could prove especially useful in screening for drugs capable of reducing porphyrin biosynthesis (constitutive or induced) or alleviating porphyrin-based photosensitivity. The protective effect of DMTU against light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) constitutes proof of principle for such an approach. Although porphyrias are usually manageable diseases, reliance on intravenous heme or liver transplantation to treat severe cases can result in significant complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Seth et al., 2007</xref>). There is no approved prophylactic treatment for patients who suffer recurrent attacks. We suggest planarians represent an experimentally tractable animal model in which to explore both physiological and pathological roles of porphyrins, and to seek new avenues for modulating their biosynthesis toward therapeutic benefit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Planarian maintenance</title><p>Asexual clonal populations of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> (strain CIW4), <italic>G. dorotocephala</italic>, and <italic>D. japonica</italic> were maintained under standard laboratory conditions, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oviedo et al., 2008</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado as the Reviewing Editor and Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This very interesting manuscript describes remarkable parallels between planarian photosensitivity and that observed in human porphyrias. The authors discovered a striking photosensitivity of planarian body pigmentation, namely that prolonged light exposure results in depigmentation in planarians. Equally remarkable is the fact that this discovery was made by undergraduates during the course of a general biology class. Following up on this observation, the authors show that this process is not simple photobleaching, but rather is caused by active elimination of pigment cells. Through the systematic analysis of ommochrome and porphyrin biosynthetic pathways, the authors identified several genes required for producing planarian pigment. RNAi knockdown of <italic>KMO-1</italic>, an enzyme involved in ommochrome synthesis that is expressed in pigment cells, leads to alterations in body color and increased porphyrin levels. The authors report that genes encoding heme synthetic enzymes (that generate porphyrin intermediates) are expressed in pigment cells, and the first three enzymes in the heme synthetic pathway are also required for proper pigmentation. To explore the potential role of porphyrins in light-induced depigmentation, they knock down genes involved in the heme/porphyrin biosynthesis pathway and show that knockdown of one gene, <italic>PBGD-1</italic>, eliminates light-induced depigmentation, and suppresses the heightened photosensitivity of <italic>KMO-1(RNAi)</italic> animals. The authors also report that the light-induced depigmentation is observed in starved, but not recently fed, animals. This work is carefully performed and thoughtfully presented. It lays the foundation for subsequent studies to investigate the biology of pigment cell differentiation and chemical identification of the pigments themselves (both of which I believe are beyond the scope of this study). The development of methods to remove pigmentation from planarians could have significant impacts on tool development in that field, and the connection to human porphyrias makes a compelling case for additional studies of this system. Altogether, we anticipate that the work will be of interest to the broad readership of this journal.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Before the paper can be further considered for publication, the reviewers, after consulting with each other, would like to see the authors address the following issues:</p><p>1) It is important for the authors to provide additional evidence for the proposed parallel between the consequences of decreased nutrient intake in planarians and humans. Because planarians are fed calf liver, which is presumably rich in heme, they could be looking at the dietary intake of heme and its specific consequences on the porphyrin biosynthetic pathway and not a generic response to feeding. Heme synthesis is known to be feedback-inhibited by heme, e.g. ALAS downregulation by heme (PMID: 10522552). Is it possible for the authors to use alternative food sources that may contain less heme (i.e., egg yolk) that would allow them to more clearly distinguish these options? Are ALAS transcript levels affected by starvation and/or different diets?</p><p>2) The author's model (subsection “Ommochrome and porphyrin biosynthesis in flatworms”, third paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) suggests that ommochromes negatively regulate porphyrin levels based on the observation that <italic>KMO-1(RNAi)</italic> causes elevation of porphyrins. However, I think another possibility worth considering is that derivatives of ommochromes and porphyrins (or HMB) could be used jointly as precursors for a downstream biosynthetic step, potentially to produce the final brown pigment itself. This model would account for why <italic>KMO-1(RNAi)</italic>, a treatment expected to reduce/eliminate ommochrome synthesis, results in accumulation of a porphyrin. Another possibility in line with author's current model could be that some hormonal/signaling action of tryptophan derivative can suppress porphyrin synthesis rather than ommochromes themselves having some interaction with porphyrins.</p><p>3) It is rather interesting that starvation accentuates the photosensitivity of pigmentation. Is this perhaps due in part to a general difference in cell death responsiveness due to nutrient status in planarians? Additionally, does starvation increase porphyrin abundance (as measured by red fluorescence) or impact the response to normal levels of porphyrins? These experiments would clarify the mechanism of how nutrient intake modulates light sensitivity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14175.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>Before the paper can be further considered for publication, the reviewers, after consulting with each other, would like to see the authors address the following issues: 1) It is important for the authors to provide additional evidence for the proposed parallel between the consequences of decreased nutrient intake in planarians and humans.

Are ALAS transcript levels affected by starvation and/or different diets?</italic></p><p>Given the feedback inhibition in the heme biosynthesis pathway (cited in our original manuscript), we agree that comparing the photoprotective effects of different laboratory diets is a useful experiment. Our revised manuscript shows that egg yolk is slightly less effective than calf liver in reversing starvation-induced photosensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), as might be expected if liver suppresses porphyrin biosynthesis merely because of its relatively high heme content. However, addition of exogenous heme to egg yolk had no discernable effect. We also show that both <italic>ALAS</italic> expression and porphyrin content increase with starvation (using qRT-PCR and measurements of porphyrin fluorescence in tissue homogenates – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7C and 7D</xref>, respectively), as occurs in mouse models of acute porphyrias (e.g., Handschin et al., 2005). While these new results do not exclude a role for dietary heme in regulating porphyrin biosynthesis in planarians, they do provide further support for the existence of other metabolic control mechanisms, underscoring planarians’ value as an acute porphyria disease model. Further experiments (e.g., developing a defined diet) will be necessary to characterize the molecular mechanisms linking nutrient intake to <italic>ALAS</italic> induction, but we respectfully suggest that work is beyond the scope of the present manuscript. We have emphasized the need for such future experiments in the revised Discussion section (”An animal model of acute porphyrias”, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) The author's model (subsection “Ommochrome and porphyrin biosynthesis in flatworms”, third paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) suggests that ommochromes negatively regulate porphyrin levels based on the observation that KMO-1(RNAi) causes elevation of porphyrins. However, I think another possibility worth considering is that derivatives of ommochromes and porphyrins (or HMB) could be used jointly as precursors for a downstream biosynthetic step, potentially to produce the final brown pigment itself. This model would account for why KMO-1(RNAi), a treatment expected to reduce/eliminate ommochrome synthesis, results in accumulation of a porphyrin. Another possibility in line with author's current model could be that some hormonal/signaling action of tryptophan derivative can suppress porphyrin synthesis rather than ommochromes themselves having some interaction with porphyrins.</italic></p><p>We agree that these possibilities are both consistent with our results and worth addressing. The potential for joint use of ommochromes and porphyrins in a downstream biosynthetic step is explicitly addressed in our revised manuscript in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> legend, as well as in the Discussion: “One possible explanation of these results is that ommochromes and porphyrins are jointly used as precursors in a downstream biosynthetic step to generate a single, brown body pigment…”. The possibility that tryptophan derivatives have signaling roles that impact porphyrin biosynthesis is addressed in the Discussion: “…it is interesting to speculate that kynurenine or other tryptophan metabolites, rather than ommochromes themselves, might have signaling activities that impact porphyrin levels.” Along with these additions to the text, we have also removed the arrows denoting possible regulatory interactions between ommochromes and porphyrins in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) to avoid giving the impression that we favor this scenario over the above (and other) equally plausible alternatives.</p><p><italic>3) It is rather interesting that starvation accentuates the photosensitivity of pigmentation. Is this perhaps due in part to a general difference in cell death responsiveness due to nutrient status in planarians? Additionally, does starvation increase porphyrin abundance (as measured by red fluorescence) or impact the response to normal levels of porphyrins? These experiments would clarify the mechanism of how nutrient intake modulates light sensitivity.</italic></p><p>We tested whether starvation leads to nonspecific cell death responsiveness by comparing TUNEL staining in 7 day and 14 day-starved animals exposed to a sublethal dose of gamma radiation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, there was no significant difference between these conditions. In contrast, we found that there is a small, but clearly significant increase in porphyrin levels in <italic>D. japonica</italic> (used because porphyrin fluorescence is much higher than in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> and therefore more easily quantified in tissue homogenates) from 7 to 14 days post-feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>); a further increase was evident at 28 days post-feeding. Together with the increase in <italic>ALAS</italic> expression observed in starved animals (see above), this not only clarifies how nutrient intake modulates photosensitivity, but adds to the parallels between light-induced depigmentation in planarians and the effects of dieting or fasting observed in acute porphyrias.</p></body></sub-article></article>
