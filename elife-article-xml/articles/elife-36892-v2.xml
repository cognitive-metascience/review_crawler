spinal cord. However, the pathogenic process involves multiple subnetworks in the brain and functional MRI studies demonstrate an increase in functional connectivity in areas connected to pMO despite the ongoing neurodegeneration. The extent and the structural basis of the motor subnetwork remodeling in experimentally tractable models remain unclear. We have developed a new retrograde AAV9 to quantitatively map the projections to pMO in the SOD1(G93A) ALS mouse model. We show an increase in the number of neurons projecting from somatosensory cortex to pMO at presymptomatic stages, followed by an increase in projections from thalamus, auditory cortex and contralateral MO (inputs from 20 other structures remains unchanged) as disease advances. The stage- and structure-dependent remodeling of projection to pMO in ALS may provide insights into the hyperconnectivity observed in ALS patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</kwd><kwd>primary motor cortex</kwd><kwd>AAV9</kwd><kwd>retrograde tracing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK1789</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bayer</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roselli</surname><given-names>Francesco</given-names></name><name><surname>Boeckers</surname><given-names>Tobias M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ulm University Medical Faculty</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Baustein program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roselli</surname><given-names>Francesco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The projections from discrete areas to motor cortex increase over disease course in motoneuron disease model with selective spatial and temporal patterns.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is classically described as a disease of upper and lower motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ravits et al., 2007</xref>). However, postmortem studies have demonstrated that pathological hallmarks of ALS (such as TDP-43 inclusions) appear in motor cortex as well as in multiple cortical and subcortical structures during disease progression, depicting a propagation pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brettschneider et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braak et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, ALS has been growingly conceptualized as a disease of the motor subnetwork or, in more advanced stages, a multi-network disease affecting motor, premotor and sensory areas. To which extent these networks are damaged by the neurodegeneration and remodel themselves during the disease progression, it is a subject of active investigation.</p><p>Diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) studies have revealed that the degeneration of axons is detected in more and more white-matter tracts affecting different structures (corticospinal, corticorubral, corticostriatal and perforant tracts) at different stages of the propagation scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Neuroimaging Society in ALS (NiSALS) DTI Study Group et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kassubek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kassubek et al., 2018</xref>) as well as in interhemispheric connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Filippini et al., 2010</xref>) and in spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen-Adad et al., 2013</xref>). However, analysis of resting-state networks by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revealed increased functional connectivity has been described in symptomatic ALS patients in the sensorimotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Menke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agosta et al., 2018</xref>) somatosensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Agosta et al., 2011</xref>) and cortico-striatal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fekete et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, an increase in functional connectivity in the motor subnetwork was already detectable in presymptomatic and early-stage ALS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schulthess et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although these data indicate that a significant architectural remodeling of the motor subnetwork takes place in ALS patients in the face of ongoing neurodegeneration, the extent of such remodeling and the structural changes underlying this effect in the motor network are unclear. Of particular interest is the extent of remodeling of the input network to pMO: in fact, the type and amount of projection to pMO determines not only the output from MO, which is strongly related to the execution of movements; in addition, the synaptic inputs are strong regulators of neuronal activity pattern and may influence activity-dependent pathogenic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roselli and Caroni, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bading, 2017</xref>). To date, connectivity maps have been obtained at mesoscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mitra, 2014</xref>) or at cellular resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wertz et al., 2015</xref>) only for wild-type models.</p><p>In order to address the remodeling of the subnetwork in an experimentally tractable condition, we have selected to quantitatively map the projections to the primary motor cortex network in the SOD1(G93A) ALS mouse model using a newly developed AAV variant endowed with retrograde tracing abilities. We have demonstrated that selected cortical areas display an increased projection to pMO already at presymptomatic stage and the increase in projection expands during disease progression to involve additional cortical and subcortical structures. We show that the pattern observed in the mouse model bears significant similarities with fMRI functional connectivity data gathered from human ALS patients. Thus, we have identified one structural component of the early and selective remodeling of the large-scale architecture of the motor subnetwork, which may contribute to explain the functional connectivity changes observed in patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AAV9-SLR variant is a new, efficient viral tool for retrograde connectivity tracing</title><p>In order to identify a variant of AAV9 suitable for retrograde tracing, we considered three variants previously generated (AAV9-SLR, AAV9-NSS and AAV9-RGD) as part of an ongoing screening of the properties of newly generated AAV9 variants.

MisfSOD1 has been reported to be a hallmark of mSOD-ALS pathobiochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosco et al., 2010</xref>) and has been identified as the earliest disease marker in vulnerable spinal MN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Saxena et al., 2013</xref>). To this aim, mice were injected with fluorescently labeled CTb in pMO at P20 and sacrificed at P35, in order to label the neuronal subpopulations projecting to pMO; misfSOD1 was revealed by the B8H10 monoclonal antibody against one conformational epitope of misfolded SOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pickles et al., 2013</xref>). In pMO, where upper MN are mainly (but not exclusively) localized, already at this age 41 ± 7% of neurons in pMO layer V were positive for misfSOD +compared to only 1 ± 0.5% of layer II/III neurons. MisfSOD1 burden (assessed by the immunofluorescence intenty) in misfSOD1 +neurons was comparable in pMO layer II/III (1798±355) and layer V (2189 ± 393; p&gt;0.05). We then identified the neurons in SS and AUD projecting to pMO by CTb retrograde labelling (the non-viral approach was used to avoid possible artifacts due to the over-expression of ZSGreen) and assessed the mSOD burden by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>). Both SS and AUD included a misfSOD +subset of neurons in layer II/III (20 ± 5%) and layer V (54 ± 6%). However, when we considered the CTb + and CTb- subpopulations of neurons, we found that, in layers II/III and V the population of neurons projecting to pMO (CTb+) displayed a significantly lower burden of misfSOD1 than the overall neuronal population of the CTb- neurons (effect size between −0.9 and −1.4; one-way ANOVA, F<sub>(11,1242)</sub> = 35.3, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref> and detailed numerical values in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3e</xref>) in both cortical layers of SS (p&lt;0.0001) as well as in both cortical layers of AUD (p&lt;0.0001). In order to verify that this finding was not due to a confounding effect of CTb itself, we traced a different subpopulation of SS neurons, namely those involved in inter-hemispheric projections; we injected fluorescently labeled CTb in contralateral SS of mSOD1 mice at P30 and we assessed the burden of misf SOD in CTb + and CTb- neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D; E</xref>). In contrast to what observed in the subpopulation connected to pMO, SS subpopulation projecting to contralateral SS displayed a range of misfSOD levels comparable to non-projecting, nearby neurons (p=0.2696) including, in both cases, neurons with high burden and neurons with low burden of mSOD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3f</xref>).

We show that this pattern displays similarities with the network remodeling in the form of increase functional connectivity changes observed by fMRI in ALS patients. Thus, we provide cellular-resolution data that contribute to analysis of large-scale architecture of motor circuits in ALS mouse model, which may provide entry points to understand changes occurring in human patients.</p><p>In order to map the input to the MO in mSOD and WT mice, a retrograde viral-tracing strategy was considered. We have introduced a new variant of AAV9 which displays significantly higher capacity for retrograde infection of neurons in vivo. Although retrograde tracing can be achieved with non-viral approaches, these methods suffer from limited sensitivity, stability and do not provide genetic access to the target neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>). Retrograde tracing has been previously achieved in vivo using rabies-derived vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wickersham et al., 2007</xref>), herpes simplex virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ugolini et al., 1987</xref>) or canine adenovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Soudais et al., 2001</xref>). These vectors, however, have been plagued by the intrinsic toxicity of the expressed viral proteins (as in the case of rabies - <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ginger et al., 2013</xref> - although new rabies variants may have overcome this issue, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ciabatti et al., 2017</xref>) or by the tendency to activate inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Muruve, 2004</xref>). Recently, the development of retrograde AAV vectors have been undertaken to allow retrograde tracing with genetic access and low toxicity; in particular, a retrograde AAV2 variant has been reported (rAAV2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>). Our AAV9 variant extends and complements the existing toolset of AAV vectors endowed with retrograde infectivity. Although rAAV2 belongs to the AAV2 serotype and may strongly bind heparan sulphate, our AAV9-derived retrograde AAV variant has the advantage of reduced binding to heparin sulfate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shen et al., 2011</xref>) and therefore it is less affected by changes in brain extracellular matrix (e.g. due to neuroinflammation associated with neurodegeneration); AAV9 is only infrequently targeted by pre-existing immunity to AAVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Saraiva et al., 2016</xref>) and may provide the entry point to enhanced vectors for circuit-specific gene therapy in humans since AAV9 has been already successfully tested for this application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boutin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We first validated the tool by mapping the input connectivity to pMO and sMO at cellular resolution; notably, the discreet pattern of regions containing retrogradely labelled neurons separated by others containing or no labeled cell, in a reproducible pattern and matching the list of brain structures projecting to pMO (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hooks et al., 2013</xref>) and the Allen Brain Connectivity atlas) suggest that the infection of distant neurons is not an artifact of passive viral diffusion or infection via blood supply (which would have resulted in a continuous or erratic distribution of labelled neurons). We further validated the reliability of our approach in the context of the mSOD1 mouse, verifying that viral-tracing results on SS and pMO could be reproduced by non-viral tracing (CTb) and that no abnormalities could be found in the projections to visual cortex, an area spared the pathogenic process. Nevertheless, AAV vectors relie on retrograde transport to reach the cell body (where expression of the genome takes place; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castle et al., 2014b</xref>) in process dependent on dynein/dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Castle et al., 2014a</xref>) and one may speculate that the transport slow-down and dysfunction reported in ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bilsland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marinkovic et al., 2012</xref>) may bias the quantitative evaluation of the tracing experiments. However, the slowing of the transport would result in the decrease or delayed arrival of the AAV to the neuronal cell body, actually decreasing the chances of Cre expression and possibly resulting in decreased number of projecting neurons; therefore, this mechanism is unlikely to underlie the observed increase in the number of projecting neurons.</p><p>We exploited this new retrograde AAV9 to investigate in ALS models the qualitative and quantitative changes in the structure of the motor subnetwork, in particular of the projections to the pMO. A major finding of the present work is the increase in the numbers of neurons projecting from several cortical and subcortical regions to pMO; the increase is selective for some cortical areas only and the number of regions involved increases over time. The increase in the number of neurons projecting to a fixed, small volume of pMO is most likely to be interpreted as due to the expansion of the axonal arborizations of these neurons in pMO as disease progresses and it is in agreement with the increased frequency of EPSPs observed early in disease course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fogarty et al., 2015</xref>). What may be the driving force of this expansion? One may hypothesize that a pathogenic process ongoing in projecting neurons may drive the expansion; however, neither the burden of misfolded SOD1 nor the signs of structural disturbances (i.e. the decrease in spine density) were detectable in the areas displaying increased projection to pMO. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated in several models (e.g. in the neuromuscular unit), that silencing of either the pre- or post-synaptic site is sufficient to induce axonal sprouting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caroni et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caroni, 1997</xref>). Since reduced firing of vulnerable spinal MN has been shown to precede degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martínez-Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roselli and Caroni, 2015</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that the expansion of the projections may be driven by abnormal activity of vulnerable post-synaptic neurons in the pMO (including vulnerable corticospinal MN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ozdinler et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, in mSOD mice excitability changes appear to affect a larger set of neurons in pMO than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>When the progressive increase in projections to pMO detected in the tracing experiments are compared with the changes in connectivity reported here and by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agosta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Menke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schulthess et al., 2016</xref>), several similarities emerge: (i) both in human and mouse data, we observe a progressive remodeling of the motor subnetwork, (ii) the remodeling of the motor subnetwork is detectable before the appearance of overt clinical or behavioral abnormalities, (iii) the remodeling of the motor subnetwork involves the primary motor cortex and more rostral, homolateral or contralateral structures (in the frontal lobe, prefrontal cortex or secondary motor cortex in human and mouse, respectively) and projecting to pMO, and (iv) both in human and mouse data the primary somatosensory cortex appears involved in the motor subnetwork remodeling (either in terms of increased projection to pMO in the mouse, or in terms of connectivity between left and right SS, SS, sensory-motor or SS to other cortical areas; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Douaud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Agosta et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, thalamocortical connectivity does not appear to be altered in the functional connectivity studies.</p><p>Based on these similarities, might the increase in projection to pMO be a leading mechanism underlying the functional hyperconnectivity in ALS patients? Although the relationship between structural and functional connectivity is not precise, severals studies have demonstrated that, at large-scale level, structural connectivity is a strong predictor of functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Honey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Honey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Damoiseaux and Greicius, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hermundstad et al., 2013</xref>) and maps of functional and structural connectivity display high degrees of similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">van den Heuvel et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, studies in non-human primates comparing functional connectivity with anatomical tracing have revealed that anatomical connectivity strongly (although not exclusively) shape the functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shen et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, deducing structural connectivity from functional connectivity data can be fraught with inaccuracies, sinc<italic>e</italic> indirect connections may contribute to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, on the assumption that the observations made on the remodelling of the motor subnetwork in mouse models could be extrapolated to humans, the expansion of projections to pMO may contribute a structural substrate of the functional hyperconnectivity observed in fMRI studies. Notably, alternative models have been proposed to explain the hyperconnectivity phenotype. Changes in functional connectivity could also result from an alteration in the local excitation/inhibition balance due to the dysfunction of inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Douaud et al., 2011</xref>): in fact, pathological studies have found that calbindin-positive GABAergic interneurons undergo degeneration in ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maekawa et al., 2004</xref>), lending support to the hypothesis that loss of inhibitory tone contributes to clinical dysfunction in ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Turner and Kiernan, 2012</xref>). The two models are actually not mutually exclusive: the pattern of either increased either decreased connectivity in resting-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jelsone-Swain et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mohammadi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agosta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Douaud et al., 2011</xref>) and task-based fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heimrath et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Konrad et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lulé et al., 2009</xref>) may be the result of ongoing degeneration and loss of axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dadon-Nachum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sarica et al., 2014</xref>) accompanied by potentially compensative phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernier et al., 2017</xref>). The observed increase in projection from cortical and subcortical areas might be an early adaptive response to ongoing cell dysfunction up to the point where a critical cell loss is reached and a disconnection syndrome begins to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gorges et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the study of large-scale patterns of projections to vulnerable cortical areas, the use of retrograde viral vectors has allowed the access to morphological features of a distinct population of neurons selected by connectivity rules (i.e. all neurons projecting to pMO). Our analysis has revealed a stage-dependent loss of spines in all neurons projecting to pMO (first in layer V, then in layer II/III), which appears independent of misfSOD burden and involves neuronal populations in areas whose vulnerability was previously unrecognized, such as AUD neurons. Spine loss has been detected as a morphological counterpart of the early stages of the degenerative process ongoing in the layer V of the motor cortex of mSOD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fogarty et al., 2015</xref>). The longitudinal study of multiple brain areas in Golgi-staining preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fogarty et al., 2016</xref>) has revealed the early and progressive spine loss affecting the basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons from MO, medial pre-frontal (MPFC) cortex; notably, SS neurons appeared to be affected only very late in disease progression (P120; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fogarty et al., 2016</xref>). By identifying a neuronal subpopulation of SS based on connectivity rules (i.e. only the neurons projecting to pMO), we report an earlier loss of spines than previously though (P50 vs P120). This finding not only underscores the importance of assessing disease manifestations in homogeneous (and characterized by connectivity rules) populations but also suggests that spine loss may be a phenomenon occurring in a larger set of neurons, possibly across the whole motor subnetwork.</p><p>Our study displays some limitations. Firstly, in order to maintain tractability while still addressing the core question of the large-scale remodeling of the structure of projections in the motor subnetwork, we decided to limit the analysis to the forebrain, avoiding the analysis of brainstem nuclei and cerebellum. Although these regions provide relevant input to the motor subsystem, they are not usually identified in fMRI studies of ALS and therefore their contribution to the definition of the hyperconnectivity phenotype may be more limited. Second, although it is desirable to have large number of biological replicates, the need to maintain the genotype blinding and to manually identify and anatomically annotate each neuron (more than 150,000 for the present work) did not allow for a n &gt; 3–6, thus underpowering the study for the comparison of structures with fewer number of projecting neurons. Although the present study is in line with the numerosity currently manageable in manual reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hooks et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yamawaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeNardo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>), the advancement of machine learning and automated neuronal annotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fürth et al., 2018</xref>) may allow a more comprehensive quantitative analysis of input network to pMO.</p><p>Third, we did not consider ipsilateral sMO and pMO for cell counting in our analysis. Due to the proximity of pMO and sMO, we could not have conclusively excluded the possibility that infected neurons in the ipsilateral sMO were derived from retrograde infection or virus diffusion, introducing ambiguity to the connectivity map. Further refinement of the retrograde-tracing approach is ongoing to provide a whole brain, full resolution map of the connectivity of the motor subsystem in ALS.</p><p>Taken together, our circuit-tracing data in mice and imaging data in humans converge to show that a significant and progressive remodeling of cortical circuits takes places in ALS and that this phenotype may be amenable to investigation in animal models. The mechanistic drivers of this remodeling are currently unclear, although it is possible to speculate that homeostatic mechanisms may be activated by alterations in excitability of pMO neurons, including corticospinal motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, pathological decrease or increase in the firing properties of vulnerable neuronal subpopulations appears to be a shared phenotype of multiple neurodegenerative conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roselli and Caroni, 2015</xref>) and may be one of the driving forces of adaptive cortical remodeling in neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">LANDSCAPE Consortium et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rosskopf et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rosskopf et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the combination of the analysis of large-scale projection patterns (enabled by retrograde viral tracing) with chronic manipulation of excitability and firing (such as chemiogenetics; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Saxena et al., 2013</xref>) may prove fundamental to link functional and structural cortical phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

Briefly, mice were administered buprenorphine (0.01 mg/Kg; Reckitt Beckiser Healthcare, Berkshire, UK) and meloxicam (1.0 mg/Kg; Böhringer Ingelheim, Biberach an der Riß, Germany) 30 min before being put into a stereotaxic frame (Bilaney Consultants GmbH D-40211 Düsseldorf, Germany) under continuous isoflurane anesthesia (4% in O2 at 800 ml/min). Skin scalp was incised to expose the underlying bone and a hand-held micro drill was used to drill the burr hole in the opportune location. Stereotactic coordinates were chosen for each target area based on The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oh et al., 2014</xref>) and corresponded to primary motor cortex (x =+ 1.5, y =+ 1.0, z = −0.5), secondary motor cortex (x =+ 0.7, y =+ 1.0, z=-0–5), striatum (x =+ 1.0, y =+ 1.5, z = −3.5), visual cortex (x = −3.0, y =+ 2.0, z = −0.6) and primary somatosensory cortex(x =+ −1.0, y = −1.0, z = 0.5). 500 nl of viral suspension, mixed with an equal volume of 1% Fast Green solution (100 mg of Fast Green in 10 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O), was injected using a pulled-glass capillary connected to a Picospritzer microfluidic device. The Fast-Green visible dye, used to visually monitor the injection, is quickly washed away in PBS and does not interfere with the imaging procedures. Injection was performed with 10 msec pulses every 30 s over a span of 5 min. The capillary was kept in place for 10 more minutes before being withdrawn to prevent backflow of the virus. Scalp skin was then stitched with Prolene 7.0 surgical thread and the animals were transferred to single cages with facilitated access to water and food for recovery. Animals were monitored for eventual neurological impairment for the following 72 hr and were administered additional doses of buprenorphine as needed.</p><p>Each of the following AAV vectors was independently injected at the titre of 5–9*10<sup>13</sup>/ml: wild-type (WT) AAV9-CMV-Cre (WT-AAV9), WT-AAV2-CMV-Cre (WT-AAV2), AAV9-RGDLRVS-CMV-Cre (AAV9-RGD), AAV9-SLRSPPS-CMV-Cre (AAV9-SLR) and AAV9-NSSRFTP-CMV-Cre (AAV9-NSS).</p><p>For cholera toxin injections, Alexa-488-conjugated or Alexa-647-conjugated cholera toxin B (CTb-488, Invitrogen) was diluted according to the manufacturer’s instructions to 1 µg/µl by gentle mixing (no vortexing). 1.0 µl of CTb was injected using the same procedure as reported above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Mice were terminally anesthetized with cloralium hydrate and transcardially perfused with 50 ml ice-cold PBS followed by 2.5–3 ml/g of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Brain samples were quickly dissected and post-fixed in 4% PFA in PBS at 4°C for 18 hr, washed in PBS and cryo-protected in 30% sucrose in PBS for 36 hr. Samples were then snap-frozen in OCT and sectioned at −15°C in a cryotome (Leica CM1950) to 70µm-thick sections serially collected. Free-floating brain sections were incubated for 2 hr at 24°C in blocking buffer (5%-donkey serum, 3% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100), followed by incubation with primary antibodies, such as: rabbit anti-RFP (1:1000, Rockland Immunochemicals, Limerick, PA) for 24 hr at 4°C; mouse anti-Tyrosine Hydroxylase (1:2000, Sigma) for 24 hr at 4°C; mouse anti NeuN (1:100, Millipore) for 24 hr at 4°C; mouse monoclonal anti-misfolded SOD1 (B8H10, 1:1000, MediMabs) for 48 hr at 4°C.

Four regions of interest (ROI, 300 × 300 µm<sup>2</sup> each) were drawn at its cardinal points and 500 µm<sup>3</sup> of tissue was analyzed in total. For each ROI, reporter +neurons and DAPI +nuclei were counted. Local infectivity for each AAV variant was calculated by averaging ROI values for every mouse (N = 3 for each viral variant) and the values are expressed as a percentage of AAV9 variants over WT- AAV9. For analysis of the retrograde infectivity in motor cortex (MO), substantia nigra (SNc), thalamus (TH) and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), brain slices corresponding to our target brain regions were cut (N = 3 for each viral variant). Reporter +soma were counted for every region and the values are expressed in terms of percentage over WT-AAV9.</p><p>For analysis of input connectivity to primary motor cortex (pMO, considering all time points analyzed: WT N = 11, SOD N = 12) and visual cortex (VIS, WT N = 3, SOD N = 3) via AAV9-SLR variant, all sections corresponding to each brain were scanned using the BZ-9000 fluorescence microscope (KEYENCE) equipped with a 4x objective, with exposure time set at 200 msec. All images were acquired in a 12bit format. Images were processed using the ImageJ software suite: images of individual brain sections were loaded, background was subtracted offline via the appropriate tool to unambiguously identify reporter +cells. Labeled cells were positively identified as neurons (in contrast to non-neuronal cells or to dense clusters of axons) by the detection of a round soma surrounded by basal dendrites and, in cortical neurons, by the presence of an apical dendritic shaft. The soma of fluorescently labeled neurons was manually identified and annotated for anatomical brain regions according to Allen Brain Atlas coordinates. Total numbers of neurons were normalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oh et al., 2014</xref>) by the volume of the injection site in pMO (AAV9- SLR: 1.3 ± 0.6 mm<sup>3</sup>, N = 23) and VIS (AAV9-SLR: 1.1 ± 0.5 mm<sup>3</sup>, N = 6). Cortical layers were discriminated according to positional criteria and using the tissue autofluorescence (which highlights nuclei in negative, since they are not strongly autofluorescent) and the region of interest (ROI, rectangular in shape, approximately 200 µm high) was placed approximately 100 µm (upper border) ventral to the cortical (pial) surface for layer II/III, whereas for layer V and VI the lower border of the ROI was placed 300 µm dorsal of, or in contact with, respectively, the boundary between gray and white matter. The correctness of this positions was checked in a subset of NeuN and DAPI-stained sections.</p><p>For analysis projecting neurons we injected a small volume (500 nl out of a suspension of a titre of 5–9*10<sup>13</sup>/ml of virus suspension) of AAV9-SLR virus suspension in the pMO corresponding to the whisker area (according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zingg et al., 2014</xref>) or in the neighboring secondary motor cortex of tdTomato-ROSA26 or ZsGreen-ROSA26 reporter mice (age P20). After sacrificing the animals 15 days post-injection, brains were serially sectioned to 70 µm sections, and each section was digitized for manual annotation. An average of 5000 + neurons were manually identified (N = 6). In order to make the analysis tractable, cerebellum and brainstem nuclei were not included in the present study. Moreover, although ipsilateral sMO is a well-known input to pMO, its analysis was not performed because of technical issues: its proximity to the injection site made it difficult to distinguish between retrograde infection and spreading of the virus.</p><p>For analysis of input connectivity to pMO via cholera toxin (CTb Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate, Thermofisher, WT N = 3, SOD N = 3), brain sections were imaged with a Zeiss 710, 20x objective (NA 0.8), 0.9 optical zoom at 12 bit depth. CTb + soma were manually counted in contralateral pMO (cMOp) and somatosensory cortex (SS) following anatomical coordinates according to the Allen Brain Atlas and neuronal counting was normalized to the injection site volume (1.2 ± 07 mm<sup>3</sup>, N = 6).</p><p>For analysis of neuronal cells number in pMO, 70 µm brain slices were cut for WT (N = 2) and SOD (N = 2) mice at the age of P90. Slices were stained for NeuN (Millipore). Images were acquired with AF6000 fluorescence microscope (Leica) equipped with a 10x objective, with exposure time set at 200 msec. All images were acquired in a 12-bit format. Single optical section images of pMO were analyzed for NeuN +soma via Imaris 7.6.5 software (Bitplane AG, ‘Spot’ tool, followed by manual correction).</p><p>For spine density analysis, fluorescent images were acquired with a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope, with a 63x oil-immersion objective (NA 1.40) and 0.9 optical zoom at 12bit depth. Cortical neurons expressing the reporter protein, therefore part of the motor network, were acquired in their full dimension, that is dendrites did not exit the plane of the coronal brain slice before reaching the dendritic terminus. Criteria for selection of neurons were anatomical and morphological: selected neurons were located in the desired cortical layer, showing the distinctive pyramidal shape and displaying at least three uncorrupted basal dendrites. For each neuron, three to six, 30–100 μm long, intermediate dendritic segments (10 µm distant from the tip) were acquired for spine counts. After image collection, each segment was analyzed for spine density using the Imaris 7.6.5 software (Bitplane AG, ‘filament tracer’ tool followed by manual correction). Only protrusions with a clear connection of the head of the spine to the dendrite shaft were counted as spines; small processes were classified as a spine only if they were &lt;3 µm long and &lt;0.8 µm in cross- sectional diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris, 1999</xref>). Spine density was then expressed as the number of spines per 10 μm dendrite length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saba et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vinsant et al., 2013</xref>).

Brain slices were stained with the mouse monoclonal anti misfolded SOD1 B8H10 antibody (MediMabs, Montreal, Canada). Imaging was performed with a Zeiss 710, 20x objective (NA 0.8), 0.9 optical zoom at 12bit depth and images were analyzed using ImageJ. For misfSOD1 +neurons assessment, an ROI of 165 mm<sup>2</sup> was drawn for each cortical layer, a threshold was set and only neurons above the threshold were considered positive. For counting CTb + neurons in layer II/III, we selected a total range of 200 µm, 100 µm away from the Pia and for layer V, we considered a total range of 200 µm, 400 µm away from the grey matter. The perimeter of misfSOD +nuclei was manually drawn for both CTb + and CTb- in order to calculate and compare their mean grey value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis - mouse experiments</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed with the GraphPad Prism six software suite. For comparing normalized neuronal counts between viral variants, ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett multiple comparison test was used.

For pMO and sMO input connectivity via AAV9-SLR, including comparison between the different cortical layers, either raw and normalized neuronal counts was compared by two-way ANOVA with Sidak correction for multiple comparison. Data regarding NeuN +neuronal count in primary motor cortex and misfSOD expression in CTb-labeled neurons have been analyzed via unpaired t-Test with Mann-Whitney correction.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Moritz Helmstaedter as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gretchen Thomsen (Reviewer #3); Edward Stern (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript reports changes in the amounts of labeled axons projecting to the primary motor area in a mouse model of ALS and combines these results with fMRI data from human patients. This work emphasizes the need to consider the upper motor neurons in the SOD model of ALS.</p><p>While the reviewers were positive about the work, they agreed on a list of important issues that would need to be addressed in the revised manuscript:</p><p>1) Validity of the correspondence claims between Human and mouse data (see comments by reviewer #2 below).</p><p>2) Methodological caveats with interpreting the viral tracing data: need for reporting of absolute numbers, blinding of the analysis (see comments by all reviewers); comparison to other methods, justification of development of a new virus compared to e.g. Tervo et al., 2016.</p><p>3) General overstatement of &quot;connectivity&quot; while the experiments only provided axonal labeling. Here we would request a condensed revision that avoids overstatements as to the equivalence of &quot;connectivity&quot; with the number or density of axonal projections.</p><p>4) Statistical concerns (especially reviewer #4).</p><p>5) Lack of discussion of the limitations of the chosen tracing method: inability to analyse interneuron projections, lack of functional correlates (here we do not consider additional experiments necessary, but a more careful presentation and extended discussion.)</p><p>6) Relevance/interpretation of the spine data (Figure 6, see reviewer #2).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic></p><p>1) First, a key caveat of viral axonal tracing is the rate of infection. In order to allow a serious judgment of the data it is therefore critical to report raw neuron numbers first before a further processing of the data in terms of fractions, normalized numbers etc. can take place. Here, Figure 2 does not currently allow judging of the number of labeled presynaptic neurons. None of the images provides a resolution that allows counting neurons. The figure legend does not allow understanding of what is shown in panel B. Is this actual data, (i.e. numbers of neurons?) or just a sketch. The fractions reported in all panels are probably percent, this label is missing but here it is excessively important to report total numbers.</p><p>2) Furthermore, when the authors turn to the effect in the disease model, Figure 3, they switch to a different reporting axis, namely normalized neuron count. This is not clear why this is necessary, I understand that this is a normalization to the injection volume, but it leaves a certain amount of doubt whether this was necessary compared to reporting fractions of neurons as done before. I think it is necessary to first report all the raw numbers and then make very clear how the further processing of these numbers took place. Especially, since the effect is very strong and surprising as shown in Figure 3A, it is very important to understand whether this is driven by primarily the raw data or rather further enhanced by the normalization procedure that was used.</p><p>3) Third, the problem that figure legends are not overly informative and figure axes are sometimes not properly labeled is prevalent throughout the manuscript, for instance Figure 2—figure supplement 1, it is not made clear that this is likely the percentage of neurons from thalamus, otherwise the numbers wouldn't add up again (percent sign is missing). Again, absolute numbers would be very helpful together with more raw data images at high resolution as to allow the reader to judge the raw data in this work.</p><p>4) In the analysis of axonal projections from PMO, Figure 8, the analysis is carried out by reporting axonal volume. While this a plausible measure because it can be estimated from images, it is not extremely informative in quantitative terms. Furthermore, there are substantial issues in how to define the volume outlines giving different intensity levels of images. Here, at least a more thorough justification of this quantification and an attempt to relate this to the amount of connectivity would be needed. It is very unlikely that axonal volume directly correlates with the number of target neurons. Since the manuscript is otherwise quantitative about projections at the single neuron level it is surprising to the reader that this measure is of such coarse resolution here.</p><p>5) In this setting of small n of animals (3 versus 6) it is very important that the counting of neurons was blinded to the disease condition. I was not able to see in the methods that this was in fact carried out in a blinded fashion (the statement reads &quot;the experimenter was kept blind to the genotype till the analysis stage&quot;, Materials and methods section – does this include the image analysis, i.e. neuron counting, injection volume normalization etc.?). It should include these steps.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p>1) I am not sure why the authors claim, &quot;the motor subnetwork in an ALS mouse model displays selective increase in projections from SS and sMO to pMO in a pattern that closely matches the connectivity measurement by fMRI in human patients&quot;. While they find alterations in anatomical projection densities in the mouse between specific brain regions (most specifically somatosensory and contralateral motor cortices), in humans the find increases in functional connectivity strength between the primary somatosensory cortices and between pMO and some prefrontal cortex areas. Perhaps there are analogies between brain regions that I do not know about, but the authors should discuss in how far these patterns &quot;closely match&quot;. Perhaps, side-by-side schematics of pMO inputs and their relative strength under normal and ALS conditions in mice and humans can clarify what is &quot;closely match[ing]&quot; here.</p><p>2) The presence of an increased retrograde labeling density does not necessarily imply any specific functional pattern of connectivity – for example, it is well documented, e.g. in the peripheral motor system, that axonal projections that are chronically silenced would show sprouting, which could easily result in increased retrograde tracing without any accompanying increase in &quot;functional connectivity&quot;. Thus, the functional predictions that can be supported by an anatomical pattern of connectivity are typically weak. In general, while I am a bit skeptical that it will be easy to &quot;interpret&quot; fMRI findings in sporadic human ALS based on data from the mouse SOD model; at least similar modalities should be compared, i.e. structural data obtained from mice and humans or functional measurements dine in both species – ideally both kinds of measurements in parallel. This is clearly not a (reasonable) revision request but illustrates my general doubt whether it is meaningful to combine widely disparate types of data from a specific genetic animal model of disease and from sporadic human patients.</p><p>3) I think the term &quot;connectomics&quot; should be avoided here – at least for the mouse no evidence of any &quot;connectivity&quot; is provided, and certainly, no &quot;comparison at circuit level of ALS mouse model and human connectomics&quot; was attempted or achieved.</p><p>4) I was not sure what purpose the spine analysis in input fields of pMO in Figure 6 served (it was bit opaque to me what the difference is between what is shown in Figure 5 vs. Figure 6A – the authors need to clarify what the difference is or combine in a meaningful way). These data are interesting in their own right, especially if in a cell-to-cell comparison, dissociation between spine loss and misfolded SOD content could be shown. However, I do not see what they explain here, especially as the patterns between local spine density and projection strength do not seem to correlate especially well. I wonder whether this belongs into another &quot;story&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic></p><p>1) The interpretation of results is a little bit unclear because of the complication that the quantification of labeled cells by means of anterograde or retrograde infectivity depends on the number of cells originally taking up the virus. If there are smaller numbers of cell populations in the injected region due to SOD1 disease pathology, there will be fewer projection neurons labeled. Is there altered connectivity, or just fewer cells in the injection regions delivering the virus?</p><p>2) I am curious as to why there were no endpoint studies conducted and the latest timepoint was 90/105 days. This seems an obvious piece of information that is missing to observe connectivity encompassing the entire spectrum of disease.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4</italic></p><p>1) I found the study to be extremely well done. However, I have some issues with the statistical analysis. In general, the authors are quite rigorous. They correctly set the p (α) value prior to the analysis and determine significance accordingly. However, they then proceed to ascribe larger significance levels to the results of various comparisons, which is simply incorrect. The p value is the one which was set a priori: in this case 0.05. However, the authors are correct in trying to emphasize stronger effects. For this, I strongly recommend leaving the p values at 0.05, starred with an asterisk as done in the paper, and adding a statistic called Effect Size. There are several ways of calculating this, and the authors need pick the most appropriate (with, of course, citation of the exact method used in the methods section). These calculations will not take much time, and, in my opinion, greatly improve the paper. Especially for papers with great clinical significance, as I believe this study to be, this statistic is of increasing importance.</p><p>A good article detailing the procedures can be found here:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3444174/</p><p>2) Another issue that concerns me is the specific types of changes in the distributions of the projections to and from the motor areas. The authors use mean and standard deviations throughout the paper, which, though reasonable, leave open a few questions. The entire study is about changes in the distributions of the projections. Mean and standard deviation alone are adequate, depending on the type of distributions. To give an idea, the authors should include the medians alongside the means. Usually, of course, the statistics will be similar. But, for example, if the medians are consistently above the means, that also tells us something about the shape of the distributions of the projections. And if that effect grows or shrinks in the Tg cases, that tells us about the effect of the pathology on the distributions. Of course, there are other methods for more sophisticated analysis of the changes in the distributions. Calculations of skewness and kurtosis come to mind. But this would be a method that yields a great deal of information without too much additional time and effort on the part of the authors. I emphasize that even if the distributions are completely normal, with no significant differences between means and medians, these statistics should be included in the paper: the information is of value.</p><p>3) Figure 3D: Regarding the reduction in percentage of projecting neurons of the SOD mice: While the changes in the mean are clear, a feature that seems to be overlooked is the reduction in variability in the Tg samples. While the statistical significance of the effect is not in doubt, the reason for the effect is of interest. The reduction in SD looks greater than one would expect from the properties of the distribution. I would ask the authors to include a table of coefficients of variation (SD/mean) of the 24 groups in the figure. Perhaps a statistical comparison of the CVs would also be appropriate. If there is a significant lowering of the CV in some the SOD cortex groups, this means that a significant reduction of the variability of this group is present. This might mean that some particular subpopulation of projections is eliminated, as opposed to a random reduction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36892.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>1) First, a key caveat of viral axonal tracing is the rate of infection.

In detail:</p><p>- We now present the raw number of projecting neurons to pMO or sMO in Figure 2; we had previously reported only the fraction (% of total number of neurons projecting to MO) represented by each structure in order to highlight their relative contribution to the total input to MO structures. We have now moved the graph depicting the fractions to the corresponding supplementary figure, in keeping with the suggestion to depict the raw numbers first.</p><p>- We now provide new representative pictures for Figure 2: a low-magnification overview picture of the brain section, accompanied by several high-resolution confocal panels depicting specific regions of interest (thalamic nuclei, primary somatosensory, contralateral motor cortex); in the high-resolution images single neurons can be easily identified.</p><p>- The panel B was intended to be a graphical depiction of the experimental design (injection site, regions in which projecting neurons have been analyzed) rather than a quantitative summary of the experiment. We have maintained the graphical depictions, clearly stating their purpose, and we have added small tables summarizing the experimental details. In a set of supplementary tables now we present the raw data corresponding to the normalized data represented in the main figure, to allow the comparison; all trends detectable in the raw-counts graphs are also detectable in the normalized-counts graphs although in the former, being the dataset more noisy (since one source of variability, namely the size of the injection site, has not been removed), some differences do not reach statistical significance. In addition, we provide the numerical data used to derive each graph as accompanying excel files, and we also provide the statistical details (mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, effect size, coefficient of variation and statistical significance) for each panel as supplementary tables.</p><p>- We have expanded the labels of every graph to include more details about the type of data depicted (raw counts, percentages, normalized counts) and we have stressed the type of processing (raw counts, normalized counts) also in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Furthermore, when the authors turn to the effect in the disease model, Figure 3, they switch to a different reporting axis, namely normalized neuron count.

We have now revised all figures to depict normalized values in the main figures and we provide the raw-counting (before normalization) in corresponding supplementary figures; for Figure 2, we also provide supplementary graphs depicting, for each structure, the fractional contribution to the overall pool of neurons projecting to pMO or sMO. In addition, we provide not supplementary tables in which the actual values (both before and after normalization), together with the statistical descriptors and the statistical significance, are reported. Because variability in the volume of the injection site can be minimized under the best experimental procedures but cannot be eliminated (as also shown in the dataset of the Allen Brain Institute), normalization for the injection volume, as performed by Oh et al., 2014, has been used to reduce this source of variability in the dataset. The increased number of neurons projecting from SS to pMO is already clearly detectable in the raw data and remains statistically significant after injection volume normalization and, with the exception of the increase in projections from cMOs to pMO at P30 (which is significant only upon normalization), all other differences are seen in the raw data as much as in normalized ones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Third, the problem that figure legends are not overly informative and figure axes are sometimes not properly labeled is prevalent throughout the manuscript, for instance Figure 2—figure supplement 1, it is not made clear that this is likely the percentage of neurons from thalamus, otherwise the numbers wouldn't add up again (percent sign is missing).

However, we agree with the reviewer that, because of the intrinsic difference in the way anterograde and retrograde tracing experiments are quantified, the degree of resolution in the values cannot be compared. We therefore agree with the reviewer´s opinion that the dataset is more homogeneous, quantitative and streamlined without the anterograde tracing experiments and we have removed them from the revised version of the manuscript now resubmitted. We reserve to expand further the dataset on anterograde tracing in further studies. We have revised the text and the figures accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In this setting of small n of animals (3 versus 6) it is very important that the counting of neurons was blinded to the disease condition.

The genotype of each mouse was revealed only once the counting of the neurons and their anatomical annotation was closed and the corresponding file transferred to a different computer for the statistical analysis. At that point, individual mice were grouped according to the genotype. Incidentally, this design is the reason why the two groups have different n (6 vs 3), since mice were not pre-selected based on their genotype. We have now added more details to the description of the blinding design in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>1) I am not sure why the authors claim, &quot;the motor subnetwork in an ALS mouse model displays selective increase in projections from SS and sMO to pMO in a pattern that closely matches the connectivity measurement by fMRI in human patients&quot;.

Perhaps, side-by-side schematics of pMO inputs and their relative strength under normal and ALS conditions in mice and humans can clarify what is &quot;closely match[ing]&quot; here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now detailed further our statement regarding (avoiding the use of the potentially misleading wording “closely matches” and referring to the human and mouse data as “sharing similarities”) the match between mouse and human data, underscoring that: (i) both in human and mouse data, we observe a progressive remodeling of the motor subnetwork (ii) both in (previously published) human data and current mouse data, the remodeling of the motor subnetwork is detectable much before the appearance of overt clinical or behavioural abnormalities (iii) both in human and mouse data, the remodeling of the motor subnetwork involves the primary motor cortex and more rostral, homolateral or controlateral structures (in the frontal lobe, prefrontal cortex or secondary motor cortex in human and mouse, respectively) and projecting to pMO iv) both in human and mouse data the primary somatosensory cortex appears involved in the motor subnetwork remodeling (either in terms of increased projection to pMO in the mouse, or in terms of inter-SS connectivity, connectivity in the sensorymotor cortex (close proximity prevents precise delineation of SS from pMO) and SS connectivity to other cortical areas (Agosta et al., 2011; Douaud et al., 2011); admittedly, the inter-SS projections were not investigated in our mouse dataset. Nevertheless, divergences were also observed, namely in the lack of hyperconnectivity from thalamus to pMO in ALS patients.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that precise analogies between different cortical areas in mouse and humans are not always established, and we have now amended the discussion to include a detailed comparison of human and mouse data, highlighting the similarities and the possible divergences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The presence of an increased retrograde labeling density does not necessarily imply any specific functional pattern of connectivity – for example, it is well documented, e.g. in the peripheral motor system, that axonal projections that are chronically silenced would show sprouting, which could easily result in increased retrograde tracing without any accompanying increase in &quot;functional connectivity&quot;. Thus, the functional predictions that can be supported by an anatomical pattern of connectivity are typically weak. In general, while I am a bit skeptical that it will be easy to &quot;interpret&quot; fMRI findings in sporadic human ALS based on data from the mouse SOD model; at least similar modalities should be compared, i.e. structural data obtained from mice and humans or functional measurements dine in both species – ideally both kinds of measurements in parallel. This is clearly not a (reasonable) revision request but illustrates my general doubt whether it is meaningful to combine widely disparate types of data from a specific genetic animal model of disease and from sporadic human patients.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept the suggestion of the reviewer and we now provide a more balanced presentation of the goals that can be obtained by our work, not in terms of “interpreting” fMRI data but rather in terms of demonstrating that the large-scale circuit remodeling identified in functional human data can be detected in high-resolution structural data obtained in the mouse model and that the occurrence of the remodeling and similarities in the pattern can be drawn. Our data show that the motor subnetwork in the ALS model undergoes a progressive remodeling during disease progression, as also shown in fMRI data and therefore provide ground to further explore this phenomenon using other modalities.</p><p>Regarding the connection between structural and functional remodeling, we agree that this correlation is not always perfect. However, several studies have shown that the structure of cortical networks provides a strong template for functional connectivity: structurally connected regions are known to display high levels of functional connectivity, e.g. in the default brain network (Honey et al., 2007; Greicius et al., 2009) and the functional and structural connectivity maps are highly correlated (van den Heuvel et al., 2009). At large scale, a strong correlation between the degree of structural connectivity (defined by DTI measurements in white matter tracts) and of functional connectivity has been reported for the resting state network (Hagmann et al., 2008) as well as for resting and task-specific networks in aggregated as well as in single-individual data (Hermundstadt et al., 2013). Furthermore, the combination of anatomical tracing with fMRI measurements in non-human primates has shown that functional connectivity increases with structural connectivity (Shen et al., 2012) and the temporal stability of functional connectivity is highly correlated with the structural connectivity (Shen et al., 2015). On the other hand, functional or physiological data do not necessarily imply structural connectivity, since indirect connections may contribute to it, at least in part (Adachi et al., 2012). Thus, we now discuss the mouse findings, within the limits of extrapolating murine data to humans, as indicating one of the possible mechanisms involved in the genesis of hyperconnectivity, since structural connectivity may constraint functional connectivity pattern.</p><p>We also discuss the expansion of projection to pMO as non-mutually exclusive with other mechanisms that may involve in the increased connectivity (as seen in fMRI data). In particular, we discuss also the functional or anatomical dysfunction of inhibitory interneurons (Kew et al., 1993; Douaud et al. 2013) as a potential mechanism.</p><p>We have followed the reviewer´s suggestion on the mechanistic interpretation of the increased projection origin. In fact, we believe, in agreement with the he reviewer´s mention of the neuromuscular unit as model, that the peripheral motoneuron-muscle innervation may be a useful example in modeling sprouting: in fact, silencing of muscle cells (as obtained by blocking the neuromuscular junction with botulinum toxin or as occurring during denervation-reinnervation phenomena) leads to sprouting of the motoneurons projecting to the these cells through mechanisms driven to large extent (although not only) by the denervated cells (Caroni et al., 1994; Caroni et al., 1997); under the condition of denervation-induced sprouting, however the functional response of the muscle (since the definition of functional connectivity, which is based on the correlation of activity pattern, cannot be easily applied to the peripheral nervous system) is indeed altered, as shown by traditional emg studies, with a larger number of muscle cells recruited by the same motor neuron (and by changes in the temporal dynamics of compound motor unit potentials); so in the peripheral nervous system, increased sprouting resulting from reduced pre or post-synaptic activity leads to detectable changes in functional properties of the motor unit. We agree with the reviewer that our experimental data have not investigated whether the increase in projections originates as a consequence of post- or pre-synaptic abnormalities or may (unlikely) involve extensive synaptic silencing, a subject deserving a dedicated investigation; we now mention these mechanistic hypotheses in the Discussion section.</p><p>Moreover, we have now provided in the Introduction a more balanced description of the goals of our investigation in terms of the comparison of mouse vs human data, underscoring that, although the correlation between structural and functional connectivity is strong and repeatedly reported, the structural component is one of several factors determining the functional connectivity, and specifying that extrapolation from experimentally tractable models (such as the murine one) to humans must be accepted with caution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I think the term &quot;connectomics&quot; should be avoided here – at least for the mouse no evidence of any &quot;connectivity&quot; is provided, and certainly, no &quot;comparison at circuit level of ALS mouse model and human connectomics&quot; was attempted or achieved.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the text to avoid reference to connectomics and we have re-phrased our statement to clarify that our data contribute to analysis of large-scale architecture of motor circuits in ALS mouse model and provide entry points to understand changes occurring in human patients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I was not sure what purpose the spine analysis in input fields of pMO in Figure 6 served (it was bit opaque to me what the difference is between what is shown in Figure 5 vs. Figure 6A – the authors need to clarify what the difference is or combine in a meaningful way). These data are interesting in their own right, especially if in a cell-to-cell comparison, dissociation between spine loss and misfolded SOD content could be shown. However, I do not see what they explain here, especially as the patterns between local spine density and projection strength do not seem to correlate especially well. I wonder whether this belongs into another &quot;story&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We now clarify that, having demonstrated the increased projections from SS and other cortical (and subcortical) structures at different stages of disease progression, we investigated if this phenotype was a consequence of pathogenic processes unfolding in the neurons projecting to pMO (i.e., if the neurons projecting from SS to pMO would display any sign of ongoing pathology which could be the driver of the increase in projections). We elected to monitor two readouts, namely the burden of misfolded SOD1 and the loss of spines, to determine if any pathology in the neurons projecting to pMO could justify the observed phenotype. The two readouts were selected in order to minimize the assumptions on the pathogenic process involved: whereas the burden of misfolded SOD1 appears to be very close to initial steps of the pathogenic cascade (the mutation of the very same gene is indeed pathogenic), the reduced spine density has been repeatedly identified in several neuronal subpopulations in ALS (e.g., Ozdinler et al., 2011; Fogarty et al., 2016, 2017) and offers a marker of the structural integrity of the neuron (which may be the result of the convergence of a number of ALS-related pathogenic processes, such as trafficking abnormalities, disturbed autophagy, altered cytoskeleton). We have demonstrated that the loss of spines does take place in the neurons projecting to pMO but there is no correlation between the increase in projections to pMO and the appearance of this sign of disease, suggesting that the increased-projection phenotype could not be a direct consequence of abnormalities (within the limits explored by the spine-loss readout) in projecting neurons. Of note, whereas loss of spines (in layer V neurons) was reported to occur in SS only at very advanced stages of the disease (Fogarty et al., 2016), in our subpopulation of neurons projecting to pMO this has been detected at earlier stages, underscoring the possibility of differential vulnerability of neuronal populations identified by their projections.</p><p>Regarding the specific points raised:</p><p>- We now present the data of Figure 6A first (neurons projecting to primary MO) and we have removed the data formerly in Figure 5 (neurons projecting to secondary MO) in order to focus on pMO data and streamline the presentation of the data.</p><p>- We now provide new data regarding the correlation between misfSOD burden and dendritic spine density (Figure 7 and Figure 8). We identified the subpopulation of pSS neurons projecting to pMO by injecting the latter with the retrograde AAV9 virus, and we assessed the burden of misfolded SOD1 by immunostaining; among the neurons projecting to pMO (ZsGreen+), we identified neurons with high misfSOD1 burden (fluorescence intensity&gt;2000) and neurons with low misfSOD1 burden (fluorescence intensity &lt; 1000). When we assessed the dendritic spines density for these two groups, we found that they were comparable and, in particular, the dendritic spine density in neurons in layer V (both in high-burden and in low-burden neurons) was significantly smaller than in layer II/III neurons (either high-burden either low-burden). Thus, these findings suggest that the loss-of-spines phenotype is dissociated from the misfolded SOD1 burden.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>1) The interpretation of results is a little bit unclear because of the complication that the quantification of labeled cells by means of anterograde or retrograde infectivity depends on the number of cells originally taking up the virus. If there are smaller numbers of cell populations in the injected region due to SOD1 disease pathology, there will be fewer projection neurons labeled. Is there altered connectivity, or just fewer cells in the injection regions delivering the virus?</p></disp-quote><p>The determination of the number of distant neurons projecting to a given volume injected with the AAV suspension is allowed by the viral infection of the axons contained within the injection volume and it is therefore not directly dependent on the number of neurons whose cell body is located within the injection volume. In contrast, the number of target neurons located within the injection volume is a critical factor in experiments using monosynaptic-retrograde viruses such as replication-incompetent rabies (rabied-DeltaG). In our system, the density of neurons in the motor cortex would not affect the infectivity or the retrograde transport of the AAV per se, unless a severe decrease in the cell number in the injected region would cause the massive loss of projecting axons, due to the degeneration of their postsynaptic counterparts. However, we have consistently observed an expansion in the number of neurons (therefore, axons) projecting to the injection volume, indicating that a net loss of axons was not taking place. Loss of neurons may, speculatively, generate conditions that may increase axonal sprouting. We have now verified, using NeuN staining, that the neuronal density in pMO is comparable in WT and mSOD1 mice at least up to P90. Therefore, regarding projection to pMO, we believe that the changes in the number of projecting neurons are not due, or are not related, to loss of neurons in pMO. We have added the data relative to overall neuronal density in pMO in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and we have amended the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I am curious as to why there were no endpoint studies conducted and the latest timepoint was 90/105 days. This seems an obvious piece of information that is missing to observe connectivity encompassing the entire spectrum of disease.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that an evaluation at end-stage would have provided additional information; in order to maintain the same interval between injection and sacrifice as in other timepoints, mice for this end-stage assessment are to be injected at P115-120 and sacrificed at P130-135 (approximatively the anticipated average survival for this strain of SOD1(G93A) mice); at P115-120 this mice already display a severe motor impairment. In our preliminary investigation, we subject to intracerebral injections 3 SOD1(G93A) mice at P117, and none of them survived the procedure because of respiratory failure during the isoflurane anesthesia. Therefore, we believed unethical to proceed with experiments at timepoints in which very high mortality rate could be expected. We have added an explanation for the lack of a more advanced timepoint to the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4</p><p>1) I found the study to be extremely well done. However, I have some issues with the statistical analysis. In general, the authors are quite rigorous. They correctly set the p (α) value prior to the analysis and determine significance accordingly. However, they then proceed to ascribe larger significance levels to the results of various comparisons, which is simply incorrect. The p value is the one which was set a priori: in this case 0.05. However, the authors are correct in trying to emphasize stronger effects. For this, I strongly recommend leaving the p values at 0.05, starred with an asterisk as done in the paper, and adding a statistic called Effect Size. There are several ways of calculating this, and the authors need pick the most appropriate (with, of course, citation of the exact method used in the methods section). These calculations will not take much time, and, in my opinion, greatly improve the paper. Especially for papers with great clinical significance, as I believe this study to be, this statistic is of increasing importance.</p><p>A good article detailing the procedures can be found here:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3444174/</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his suggestions. We have amended the graphs as recommended, highlighting with one asterisk the differences that are significant, irrespective of the value of p as far as p&lt;0.05. In order to underscore the magnitude of the effects observed, we now report the effect size (calculated according to Cohen´s d approach) in a tabulated format so that for each structure whose projections to pMO are compared in WT and mSOD, both the Effect Size value and the statistical significance is available. In keeping with the requests of other reviewers, we provide the Effect Size value only in the tables in order to streamline the text and improve readability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another issue that concerns me is the specific types of changes in the distributions of the projections to and from the motor areas. The authors use mean and standard deviations throughout the paper, which, though reasonable, leave open a few questions. The entire study is about changes in the distributions of the projections. Mean and standard deviation alone are adequate, depending on the type of distributions. To give an idea, the authors should include the medians alongside the means. Usually, of course, the statistics will be similar. But, for example, if the medians are consistently above the means, that also tells us something about the shape of the distributions of the projections. And if that effect grows or shrinks in the Tg cases, that tells us about the effect of the pathology on the distributions. Of course, there are other methods for more sophisticated analysis of the changes in the distributions. Calculations of skewness and kurtosis come to mind. But this would be a method that yields a great deal of information without too much additional time and effort on the part of the authors. I emphasize that even if the distributions are completely normal, with no significant differences between means and medians, these statistics should be included in the paper: the information is of value.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now enriched the statistical analysis by providing the value of the median along with the mean for every structure considered, both for raw and normalized data; in order to improve readability and enable an easier comparison, we have provided the values in tabular format along with mean and standard deviation. The median values appear to be, with the exclusion of areas with small number of projecting neurons, very close (in most cases within 10%) of the mean value. In order to properly characterize the distribution, we have also computed the skewness for each group and we have tabulated the values along the mean, the median, the standard deviation and other statistical parameters. The skewness value was often close to 0 (in particular for structures with large number of projecting neurons) and in no case exceeding the value of ± 2.0 (the largest value observed being 1.7 for perirhinal cortex, in which only 25 pMO-projecting neurons were identified), indicating a limited impact of non-normal distribution on the results reported. We have amended the text in the methods section to provide a description of the calculation performed and a short summary of the interpretation of the Skewness values, and we have mentioned the median and skewness data in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3D: Regarding the reduction in percentage of projecting neurons of the SOD mice: While the changes in the mean are clear, a feature that seems to be overlooked is the reduction in variability in the Tg samples. While the statistical significance of the effect is not in doubt, the reason for the effect is of interest. The reduction in SD looks greater than one would expect from the properties of the distribution. I would ask the authors to include a table of coefficients of variation (SD/mean) of the 24 groups in the figure. Perhaps a statistical comparison of the CVs would also be appropriate. If there is a significant lowering of the CV in some the SOD cortex groups, this means that a significant reduction of the variability of this group is present. This might mean that some particular subpopulation of projections is eliminated, as opposed to a random reduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now presented the data in Figure 3D in histogram format, in order to make the value of each column more easily compared, and we are providing all the numerical values, together with the value of the coefficient of variation, in a companion table. However, with the exclusion of the neurons allocated to layer iv (between 0 and 1.5%), the CV for all other cortical layers was comparable, preventing further analysis in this direction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
