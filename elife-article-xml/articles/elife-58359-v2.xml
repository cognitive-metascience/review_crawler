through neuromodulation. In the vertebrate striatum, dopamine adjusts cellular functions to regulate behaviors across broad time scales, but how the dopamine secretory system is built to support fast and slow neuromodulation is not known. Here, we set out to identify Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggering mechanisms for dopamine release. We find that synchronous dopamine secretion is abolished in acute brain slices of conditional knockout mice in which Synaptotagmin-1 is removed from dopamine neurons. This indicates that Synaptotagmin-1 is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for fast dopamine release. Remarkably, dopamine release induced by strong depolarization and asynchronous release during stimulus trains are unaffected by Synaptotagmin-1 knockout. Microdialysis further reveals that these modes and action potential-independent release provide significant amounts of extracellular dopamine in vivo. We propose that the molecular machinery for dopamine secretion has evolved to support fast and slow signaling modes, with fast release requiring the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor Synaptotagmin-1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>secretion</kwd><kwd>neuromodulation</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>calcium sensor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS103484</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeser</surname><given-names>Pascal S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dean's Initiative Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeser</surname><given-names>Pascal S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hearst Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banerjee</surname><given-names>Aditi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Brooks Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banerjee</surname><given-names>Aditi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gordon Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Changliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008328</institution-id><institution>Marshallplan-Jubiläumsstiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Exchange Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nemcova</surname><given-names>Paulina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Harvard-MIT Joint research grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeser</surname><given-names>Pascal S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and electrophysiological analyses reveal calcium-triggering mechanisms for dopamine release in the striatum that may enable fast and slow dopamine coding.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dopamine is an important neuromodulator in the vertebrate brain, but the secretory biology of dopamine is not well understood. A key dopamine pathway arises from midbrain dopamine neurons located in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Their axons send projections to the dorsal striatum, where dopamine neuromodulation controls initiation and execution of movement. A prominent model is that dopamine operates slowly and on distant receptors through volume transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agnati et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu and Kaeser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sulzer et al., 2016</xref>). Recent studies, however, have started to suggest that dopamine can modulate the neuronal membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckstead et al., 2004</xref>), structural synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yagishita et al., 2014</xref>) and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Menegas et al., 2018</xref>) with temporal precision in the range of tens of milliseconds, suggesting the presence of molecular machines for rapid dopamine coding.</p><p>A requirement for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggering of secretion is the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors. Various Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins are used as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for vesicular exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaeser and Regehr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pang and Südhof, 2010</xref>), and each could be a candidate for dopamine release. Fast synaptic transmission relies on Synaptotagmin-1, –2 or –9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernández-Chacón et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Synapses without these fast Synaptotagmins have prominent asynchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Turecek and Regehr, 2019</xref>). At these asynchronous and other synapses, the higher affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors Synaptotagmin-7 and Doc2, and possibly additional sensors, mediate asynchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacaj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaeser and Regehr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yao et al., 2011</xref>). At inner ear ribbon synapses, release is triggered by otoferlin, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor with different Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding properties and kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Michalski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Roux et al., 2006</xref>). In chromaffin cells, which release catecholamines, a major release component is left after Synaptotagmin-1 deletion, and this component is likely mediated by Synaptotagmin-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schonn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Voets et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>). Knockdown of Synaptotagmin-1, –4 or –7 resulted in partial impairments of [<sup>3</sup>H]-dopamine released into the supernatant in response to KCl depolarization of cultured midbrain neurons, and BDNF release is also modulated by Synaptotagmin-4, but at least Synaptotagmin-4 is unlikely to operate as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor in these experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dean et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mendez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang and Chapman, 2010</xref>). In this study, we find that fast dopamine secretion is abolished in the striatum of mouse mutants that lack Synaptotagmin-1 in dopamine neurons, and conclude that Synaptotagmin-1 is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for fast dopamine release.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We here set out to identify Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggering mechanisms for rapid dopamine signaling. First, we analyzed the dependence of striatal dopamine release on the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>) in acute brain slices. We generated mice that express channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) selectively in dopamine neurons using mouse genetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and measured optogenetically evoked dopamine transients in slices of the dorsal striatum using carbon fiber amperometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to electrical stimulation paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brimblecombe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ford et al., 2010</xref>), optogenetically triggered dopamine release was steeply [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> dependent below 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). At 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>, the 20–80% rise time was 1.91 ± 0.13 ms, which includes the diffusion of dopamine from the release site to the electrode, and rise times slowed down in low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

During short stimulus trains (10 stimuli at 10 Hz), dopamine release strongly depressed in Syt-1 control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>), which was not due to action potential failures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), but likely a consequence of the high initial release probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). In Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice, stimulus trains failed to evoke measurable dopamine release. Hence, Synaptotagmin-1 is likely the main Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that mediates synchronous dopamine release.</p><p>Striatal dopamine release is not only triggered by ascending action potentials, but also by cholinergic interneurons that innervate dopamine axons and trigger release via activation of axonal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). This mechanism dominates in response to electrical stimulation in the slice preparation used here and accounts for as much as 90% of the released dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). We used electrical stimulation to assess whether Synaptotagmin-1 triggers dopamine release initiated by nAChR activation. Electrically evoked dopamine release was also abolished in Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating that Synaptotagmin-1 mediates both release evoked by ascending action potentials and release triggered by nAChR activation.</p><p>To assess whether loss of Synaptotagmin-1 and synchronous dopamine release has effects on striatal structure, we used 3D-structured illumination superresolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gustafsson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Striatal dopamine axons were labeled by TH, and their length and density were unchanged in Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Dopamine release sites can be marked by Bassoon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), and Bassoon clustering inside TH axons was not strongly affected in Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). Bassoon cluster volumes were unchanged, and there was only a very mild increase in Bassoon cluster densities in Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup>. Local shuffling of Bassoon objects decreased Bassoon density but increased the volume of the clusters artificially localized inside of TH axons in both genotypes. This confirms that Bassoon clusters are more frequent within TH axons than in areas surrounding these axons and that the Bassoon clusters in dopamine axons are smaller than the nearby Bassoon clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), and indicates signal specificity. These experiments indicate that dopamine axons and release sites develop mostly normally in Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice despite the strong impairments in dopamine release.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dopamine axon structure and depolarization induced dopamine release are intact after ablation of Synaptotagmin-1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sample 3D-SIM images of striatal brain sections of Syt-1 control and Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice stained for the dopamine axon marker TH and the release site marker Bassoon.

Local puffing of KCl onto brain slices causes a strong depolarization of dopamine axons and surrounding neurons, for example cholinergic interneurons, which triggers massive dopamine release that requires the active zone protein RIM in dopamine axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Compellingly, puffing KCl directly onto the recording site evoked an amperometric response that was indistinguishable between control and Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–I</xref>). This establishes that dopamine is produced, loaded into vesicles, and released by strong depolarization throughout a structurally largely normal dopamine axon in Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice. While the exact mechanism of KCl depolarization induced dopamine release is not known, the data further suggest that depolarization-induced, likely massive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry may trigger vesicular dopamine release via one or multiple alternative Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors in the absence of Synaptotagmin-1.</p><p>These additional sensors may for example mediate asynchronous release, a form of vesicular exocytosis at synapses that is triggered with a longer, variable delay in response to action potentials and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaeser and Regehr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pang and Südhof, 2010</xref>). However, if asynchronous dopamine release is present in Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice, the amount of dopamine after one or 10 action potentials is too small to be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–I</xref>). It is possible that the dopamine transporter (DAT) is sufficient to mediate re-uptake of dopamine before extracellular accumulation is observed. To test this hypothesis, we repeated the optogenetic experiments with 10 Hz stimulus trains before and after wash-in of the DAT-blocker nomifensine. In control slices, nomifensine resulted in a reduction of the first amplitude in the train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), which may be due to suppression mediated by tonic axonal D2-receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benoit-Marand et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ford, 2014</xref>). When we assessed release throughout the train (measured as the area under the curve), a robust enhancement was observed in Syt-1 control and Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and the total increase in extracellular dopamine upon DAT blockade was similar between Syt-1 control and Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

These experiments indicate that asynchronous release is present and persists in Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice, and this can be detected upon blockade of dopamine re-uptake.

To test this hypothesis, we performed microdialysis in anesthetized mice. In Syt-1 control mice, extracellular dopamine levels were reduced to approximately one third upon reverse dialysis of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX), which inhibits action potential firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Remarkably, extracellular dopamine levels before TTX reverse dialysis were only mildly reduced in Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice and action potential blockade robustly reduced extracellular dopamine in these mice. Hence, asynchronous release may provide a substantial amount of extracellular dopamine in vivo. These data suggest that three modes of dopamine release exist: synchronous and asynchronous release in response to action potentials, and action potential independent release that is likely mediated by spontaneous exocytotic events. Remarkably, each component appears to contribute significantly to the extracellular dopamine measured by microdialysis in anesthetized mice, suggesting that asynchronous and action potential-independent release may be prominent. It is not known whether Synaptotagmin-1 knockout affects spontaneous dopamine release, but literature from conventional synapses establishes that Synaptotagmin-1 knockout strongly enhances miniature synaptic vesicle release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broadie et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, it is possible that Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> leads to increased spontaneous dopamine release in the striatum. But the observation that extracellular dopamine levels after TTX are not increased in Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice suggests that there is no dramatic enhancement of miniature dopamine release, that microdialysis is not sufficiently sensitive to detect such a change, or that an enhancement is counteracted by dopamine clearance.</p><p>Here, we find that synchronous striatal dopamine release requires the fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor Synaptotagmin-1. Given the prevailing model of volume transmission, which postulates that dopamine neurotransmission is slow and imprecise, it is surprising that dopamine neurons have evolved to employ a fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor. This finding, however, is in line with a recent description of sparse secretory hotspots in striatal dopamine axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). We propose that at these sparse sites, dopamine is rapidly and synchronously released with a high vesicular release probability to generate an extracellular dopamine signal that is spatially restricted and has rapid kinetics. While the dopamine receptor distribution relative to the dopamine release hotspots is not known, our data generally suggest that dopamine transmission may be fast and compartmentalized within a target cell. These mechanisms may support fast dopamine coding functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Menegas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yagishita et al., 2014</xref>). Our work further suggests that slower signaling modes exist. Substantial amounts of extracellular dopamine may come from asynchronous and action potential-independent dopamine release. Future studies should address which dopamine functions rely on fast dopamine signaling machinery, and whether some functions are supported by slower signaling mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.SJL-Slc6a3<sup>tm1.1(cre)Bkmm</sup>/J; DAT<sup>IRES-Cre</sup></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bäckman et al., 2006</xref></td><td valign="top">JAX 006660, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:006660">IMSR_JAX:006660</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.129S-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm32(CAG-COP4*H134R/EYFP)Hze</sup>; Ai32</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Madisen et al., 2012</xref></td><td valign="top">JAX 012569, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:012569">IMSR_JAX:012569</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6NTac-<sup>Syt1tm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi</sup>/WtsiCnrm; Syt-1 floxed; <italic>Syt1<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Skarnes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; obtained from Dr. T.C.

For all genotype comparisons, each littermate pair was recorded on the same day with interleafed recordings, and the experimenter was blind to genotype throughout recording and data analyses. All data acquisition and analyses for electrophysiology was done using pClamp10 (Clampex, Axon Instruments).</p><p>For all carbon fiber amperometry, carbon fiber microelectrodes (CFEs, 7 µm diameter, 100–150 µm long) were made from carbon fiber filaments (Goodfellow). Each CFE was calibrated by puffing freshly made dopamine solutions of increasing concentrations (0, 1, 5, 10, 20 µM) in ACSF for 10 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The currents for each concentration of dopamine were plotted against the dopamine concentration and only CFEs with a linear relationship were used. On each day, a new CFE was calibrated and dopamine release was measured with the same CFE for a Syt-1 control and Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> littermate pair. CFEs were held at 600 mV and placed 20–60 µm below the slice surface in the dorsolateral striatum. Signals were sampled at 10 kHz and low-pass filtered at 400 Hz. Dopamine release was evoked by electrical or optogenetic stimulation every 2 min.</p><p>Optogenetic stimulation was performed with channelrhodopsin expression limited to dopamine neurons by AAV-mediated expression of Cre-dependent oChIEF-citrine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B–3G</xref>) or transgenic mice for Cre-dependent ChR2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Madisen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). For stimulation, brief 1 ms pulses of 470 nm light were delivered at the recording site in the dorsolateral striatum through a 60 x objective by a light-emitting diode (Cool LED pE4000). Optogenetic stimulation was applied as a single stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref> using ChR2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref> using oChIEF) or as stimulus trains (10 stimuli at 10 Hz in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1H, I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B–3E</xref> or 40 stimuli at 40 Hz in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3F and G</xref> using oChIEF). Optogenetic stimulation was applied every 2 min for all dopamine release measurements, or every 10 s for the field recordings shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. Total dopamine release during stimulation trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–E</xref>) was measured as area under the curve from the start of the 1<sup>st</sup> stimulus for 2.935 s and expressed as μM x s after removal of the stimulus artefacts. The total increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) was calculated by subtracting the area (area<sub>nomifensine</sub> – area<sub>baseline</sub>), and the fold increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) was calculated by division (area<sub>nomifensine</sub>/area<sub>baseline</sub>).</p><p>Electrical stimulation was performed with an ACSF filled glass pipette (tip diameter 3–5 µm) connected to a linear stimulus isolator (A395, World Precision Instruments) to deliver monopolar electrical stimulation (10–90 µA). The stimulation pipette was placed 20–30 µm below the slice surface in the dorsolateral striatum and 100–120 µm away from the tip of the CFE. A biphasic wave (0.25 µs in each phase) was applied to evoke dopamine release. Electrical stimulation was delivered either as a single stimulus or a 10-stimulus 10 Hz train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>For KCl stimulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–I</xref>, KCl solution containing (in mM) 100 KCl, 50 NaCl, 1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 12 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, 300–310 mOsm) was puffed onto the recording site in the dorsolateral striatum for 10 s at 9 µl/s using a syringe pump (World Precision Instruments). Only one KCl puff was applied per slice. The peak amplitude of the dopamine response and the area under the curve were quantified from start of application of KCl to 200 s after the puff, at which time the levels returned to baseline.</p><p>For experiments in variable [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>, CFEs were first tested with a 20 µM dopamine puff at different [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mM) to ensure that the CFE correctly reports [dopamine] across variable amounts of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Sodium channels were blocked using 1 µM TTX (Tocris, Catalogue No.# 1078) and extracellular potentials evoked by 10 Hz trains were recorded before and after TTX. To quantify the reduction by TTX, the amplitude evoked by the 1<sup>st</sup> stimulus in the 10 Hz train before and after TTX was analyzed in Syt-1 control and Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Immunostaining of brain sections</title><p>Male and female Syt-1 control and cKO<sup>DA</sup> littermate mice (99–111 days old) were deeply anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and perfused transcardially with ice-cold 30–50 ml phosphate buffer saline (PBS), followed by 50 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS at 4°C. Brains were then left in 4% PFA for 12–16 hr followed by incubation in 30% sucrose + 0.1% sodium azide in PBS overnight or until they sank to the bottom of the tube. Coronal striatal sections (20 µm thick) were cut using a vibratome (Leica, VT1000s) in ice-cold PBS. Antigen retrieval was performed on slices overnight at 60⁰C in 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, 10 mM Tris Base, pH 9.0. After antigen retrieval, slices were washed in PBS, and incubated in Image-iT FX signal enhancer (Invitrogen, I36933) for 30 min at room temperature. Slices were washed in PBS for 10 min and non-specific binding was blocked in 10% goat serum in 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) for 1 hr at room temperature. Slices were stained with primary antibodies for 12 hr at 4°C, and the following primary antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal IgG2a anti-Bassoon (1:500, A85, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11181058">AB_11181058</ext-link>) and guinea pig polyclonal anti-TH (1:1000, A111, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2619897">AB_2619897</ext-link>).

Z stacks were acquired with 125 nm step size and 15 raw images per plane (five phases, three angles). Immersion oil matching was used to minimize spherical aberration. Lateral shift between green and red channels was measured using a control slide to generate a calibration image and all images were reconstructed using this calibration to remove lateral shifts. All raw images were aligned and reconstructed to obtain superresolved images using the image registration function in softWoRx. Image volumes (40 × 40 × 6 µm<sup>3</sup>) were acquired from 7 to 8 regions within the dorsolateral striatum in each section. For image analysis, regions of interest (ROIs) ranging from 20 × 20 × 2.5 µm<sup>3</sup> to 25 × 25 × 2.5 µm<sup>3</sup> were selected manually in each image stack. ROIs were analyzed to characterize TH and Bassoon signals and to determine their overlap using a custom written MATLAB code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hmslcl/3D_SIM_analysis_HMS_Kaeser-lab_CL">https://github.com/hmslcl/3D_SIM_analysis_HMS_Kaeser-lab_CL</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu, 2017</xref>). Briefly, intensity thresholding using Otsu and size thresholding (0.04–20 µm<sup>3</sup> for TH axons, 0.003–0.04 µm<sup>3</sup> for Bassoon) were applied to each ROI. The volume occupied by TH was quantified and was divided by the total image volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The TH signals were skeletonized to determine TH axon length by 3D Gaussian filtering and a homotypic thinning algorithm. TH axon length was divided by the total image volume in Syt-1 control and Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The volume of Bassoon clusters and percentage overlap of Bassoon with TH was calculated, and &gt;40% overlap of Bassoon with TH was considered to be a positive association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). For generating controls using local shuffling, each Bassoon object was randomly shuffled within 1 × 1 × 1 µm<sup>3</sup> for 1000 rounds of shuffling and for each ROI, and the overlap between the average of shuffled Bassoon and TH was calculated. Sample images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> were generated using Imaris 9.0.2 (Oxford Instruments) from masked images of either ‘Bassoon + TH’ or ‘Bassoon within TH’ derived from the custom written MATLAB code. Adjustments of contrast, intensity and surface rendering were done identically for each condition for illustration, but after quantification. For all 3D-SIM data acquisition and analyses, the experimenter was blind to the genotype of the mice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Striatal synaptosome preparation and immunostaining</title><p>Striatal synaptosome preparations were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Wild type mice (P21-70) were deeply anesthetized, decapitated, and brains were harvested into ice-cold PBS. Dorsal striata were dissected and placed into a pre-cooled detergent-free glass tube and 1 ml of ice-cold homogenizing buffer containing (in mM): 4 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)−1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 320 sucrose, pH 7.4, and 1x of a mammalian protease inhibitor cocktail was added. A detergent-free ice-cold glass-teflon homogenizer was used to homogenize the tissue using 12 strokes. The striatal homogenate was added to 1 ml of homogenizing buffer and centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant (S1) was collected and centrifuged at 12,500 g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant (S2) was removed and the pellet (P2) was re-homogenized in 1 ml homogenizing buffer with six strokes. A sucrose density gradient was prepared with 5 ml of both 0.8 M and 1.2 M sucrose in thin wall ultracentrifugation tubes (Beckman Coulter, Cat # 344059). The P2 homogenate was mixed with 1 ml of homogenizing buffer, and 1.5 ml was added to the top of the sucrose gradient and was centrifuged at 69,150 x g for 70 min at 4°C (SW 41 Ti Swinging-Bucket Rotor, Beckman Coulter, Cat. # 331362). The synaptosome layer (1–1.5 ml) was collected from the interface of the two sucrose layers. Synaptosomes were then diluted 20–30 times in homogenizing buffer and spun (4000 x g, 10 min) onto Poly-D-lysine coated #1.5 coverslips at 4°C. Excess homogenizing buffer was pipetted out and synaptosomes were fixed using 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min at 4⁰C. Non-specific binding block and permeabilization was done in 3% bovine serum albumin + 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 45 mins. Primary antibody staining was done for 12 hr at 4°C, followed by three washes for 15 mins each. Secondary antibody staining was done for 2 hr at room temperature in blocking solution followed by three washes each for 15 mins.

For quantification, images were processed for background subtraction in Fiji using the ‘rolling ball’ algorithm with a radius of 1 µm for each channel. Each background subtracted image was analyzed in a custom MATLAB program (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hmslcl/3D_SIM_analysis_HMS_Kaeser-lab_CL">https://github.com/hmslcl/3D_SIM_analysis_HMS_Kaeser-lab_CL</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu, 2017</xref>). Otsu intensity thresholds, size thresholds (0.2–1 µm<sup>2</sup>) and shape thresholds (ratio of x to y axis &lt;1.5) were applied for object detection. These threshold settings were identical for each image and allowed for unbiased and automated detection of Bassoon-positive (Bassoon<sup>+</sup>), TH-positive (TH<sup>+</sup>) and Synaptotagmin-1-positive (Syt-1<sup>+</sup>) ROIs in each image, with a total of 300–600 synaptosome objects detected per image.

A fresh probe was used for each mouse. The microdialysis probe was continuously perfused with ACSF containing (in mM): 155 NaCl, 1.2 MgCl<sub>2,</sub> 2.5 KCl, 1.2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 glucose at a speed of 1 µl/min. After probe calibration, the probe was inserted into dorsal striatum (coordinates: 1.0 mm anterior, 2.0 mm lateral of bregma, and 3.3 mm below pia) of anesthetized male and female mice using stereotaxy (73–103 days old). Striatal dialysates were collected every 15 min and the concentration of dopamine was measured using an HPLC (HTEC-510, Amuza Inc) connected to an electrochemical detector (Eicom). The data during the first 75 min were not plotted because during this time window dopamine levels stabilize after surgery.

Despite the obvious importance of dopamine, the molecular machinery that governs release of dopamine from nerve terminals remains enigmatic. The authors used interdisciplinary techniques including unequivocal mouse genetics, elegant electrophysiology, optogenetics, carbon fiber amperometry, high resolution imaging and in vivo microdialysis to show that synaptotagmin-1 acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for rapid exocytosis of dopaminergic synaptic vesicles in striatal neurons. Syt-1 deletion completely abolished fast synchronous release of dopamine. These terminals were capable of Syt-1-independent asynchronous release that accounted for roughly two thirds of extracellular dopamine levels. Overall, this is a straightforward study with convincing evidence establishing Syt-1 as the main Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for fast dopamine release in striatal neurons. All three reviewers were enthusiastic about this work and had only the following minor concerns.

First, it has been shown that for conventional synaptic vesicle exocytosis, knockout of the fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor often increases miniature release (for key examples, see Broadie et al., 1994; Xu et al., 2009). Second, and as we discuss in the paper, there appears to be a significant amount of extracellular dopamine in the extracellular space even after removal of action-potential triggered dopamine release. This is true for knockouts for synaptotagmin, for knockouts of RIM, and for wild type mice after reverse dialysis of TTX (Figures 1 and 3 in this manuscript and Liu et al., 2018). In microdialysis experiments in the striatum, however, there is no robust increase in extracellular dopamine in Syt1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice after TTX, suggesting that miniature release is not enhanced, or that dopamine clearance is efficient enough to counteract such an increase. Unfortunately, there is currently no reliable direct measurement for miniature dopamine release in the striatum. Notably, in the midbrain, individual spontaneous events can be detected via measuring GIRK-IPSCs (Gantz et al., 2013) and these events are unaffected after knockout of RIM (Robinson et al., 2019).</p><p>We have revised the manuscript to better explain what is known about miniature release in the dopamine system. We now state in the manuscript: “It is not known whether synaptotagmin-1 knockout affects spontaneous dopamine release, but literature from conventional synapses establishes that synaptotagmin-1 knockout strongly enhances miniature synaptic vesicle release (Broadie et al., 1994; Xu et al., 2009). Hence, it is possible that Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> leads to increased spontaneous dopamine release in the striatum. But the observation that extracellular dopamine levels after TTX are not strongly increased suggests that there is no dramatic enhancement of miniature dopamine release, or that an enhancement is counteracted by dopamine clearance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How does external Ca concentration affect asynchronous dopamine release? Recordings in the Syt-1 DAT- cKO with dopamine re-uptake blocker provides an unique opportunity to explore this a bit further.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up the [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>ex</sub> dependence of asynchronous dopamine release, and realize that we did not properly introduce the topic of asynchronous release in the text. While there is a large body of literature that establishes complex but positive correlations between [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>ex</sub> and asynchronous release (reviewed in Kaeser and Regehr, 2014), we currently do not know what the [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>ex</sub> dependence of asynchronous dopamine release is. The strong prediction from conventional synapses is that asynchronous dopamine release is positively correlated with [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>ex</sub>, but characterization beyond this point will require better measurements than accumulation during stimulus trains upon DAT blockade. We hope that recent developments in measurements of dopamine release will allow in the future to detect individual secretory events and their timing relative to action potential firing during trains. To better introduce asynchronous release, we added the following statement: “These additional sensors may for example mediate asynchronous release, a form of vesicular exocytosis at synapses that is triggered with a longer, variable delay in response to action potentials and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (Kaeser and Regehr, 2014; Pang and Sudhof, 2010).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors mention that Syt-7 levels are also high in midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Could Syt-7 be the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for asynchronous dopamine release?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that, in the long-term, it will be important to know which other Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors contribute to dopamine release. Synaptotagmin-7 is indeed a leading candidate because it is expressed in these neurons. But the properties of asynchronous dopamine release are not understood, and better measurements need to be established before mechanisms of asynchronous release can be studied. Furthermore, while Synaptotagmin-7 is expressed in these neurons, it is uncertain whether Synaptotagmin-7 is present in their axonal arbor in the striatum and previous literature suggests that Synaptotagmin-7 mediates somatodendritic release (Mendez et al., 2011). We now state in the revised manuscript that synaptotagmin-7 is a candidate sensor for asynchronous release based on the literature: “While sensors for asynchronous dopamine release are not known, the presence of Synaptotagmin-7 in substantia nigra dopamine neurons and its role in asynchronous release at fast synapses (Bacaj et al., 2015; Lein et al., 2007; Mendez et al., 2011; Saunders et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2010) makes Synaptotagmin-7 a candidate sensor protein.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Puffing of 100mM KCl in Figure 2 F-H.

Can the authors elaborate on the nature of dopamine release induced by high KCl-mediated depolarization. See also point 9.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out and now elaborate in the manuscript on mechanisms of KCl depolarization-induced dopamine release. The KCl puff causes massive depolarization in all neurons in the area of the puff, including dopamine axons and cholinergic interneurons (which stimulate dopamine release via nAChRs on dopamine axons). Most likely, this depolarization triggers Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into dopamine axons, which results in dopamine release. While we do not know how Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggers KCl-mediated dopamine release, we hypothesize that other Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors account for it in Syt-1cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice. We are confident that KCl triggers dopamine release through vesicular exocytosis at active zone-like release sites, because in mutants in which we knockout RIM from dopamine neurons, KCl-triggered dopamine release is abolished (Liu et al., 2018). We have added the following statement to the paper: “Local puffing of KCl onto brain slices causes a strong depolarization of dopamine axons and surrounding neurons, for example cholinergic interneurons, which triggers massive dopamine release that requires the active zone protein RIM in dopamine axons (Liu et al., 2018).”</p><p>Additional explanations that are related to this point are provided further below in response to point 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For each manipulation of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, was extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> appropriately adjusted?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> was adjusted accordingly in all experiments. The revised Materials and methods now state: “Extracellular magnesium was adjusted for recordings in variable [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> (solutions contained Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> in mM: 0.5/2.8; 1/2.3; 2/1.3 and 4/0).”</p><p>We note that we have done experiments increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> before without adjusting Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Liu et al., 2018), and that the increase in dopamine release was similar to what we report here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Regarding the Syt-1 cKO DA slices, the traces in Figures 1H and 3A and the normalization in 1I indicate a slow accumulation of dopamine over time as a result of optical stimulation. The Syt-1 cKO DA dopamine traces and normalization yielded from electrical stimulation (Figure 1—figure supplement 4 D,E) show a much more stable dopamine level closer to 0. What is the potential explanation for this discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>The key difference between the two experiments is that in the main figures (Figures 1H and 3A), optogenetic stimulation was used while in the figure supplement (Figure 1—figure supplement 4D and 4E) electrical stimulation was applied. Optogenetic stimulation only recruits dopamine axons and leads to depression. In contrast, electrical stimulation recruits dopamine axons and cholinergic interneurons, and stimulating cholinergic interneurons strongly enhances depression (Liu et al., 2018; Threlfell et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2001). Hence, the discrepancy is explained by recruitment of the cholinergic mechanism and is consistent with previous papers published on this topic. We now state in the figure legend of Figure 1—figure supplement 4: “Electrical stimulation activates dopamine fibers and cholinergic interneurons, and cholinergic innervation of dopamine axons accounts for as much as ~90% of the extracellular dopamine detected upon electrical stimulation and leads to enhanced depression of dopamine release during stimulus trains (Liu et al., 2018; Threlfell et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2001).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 3C: The legend indicates that these measurements approximate total dopamine accumulated by integrating the dopamine curves between 0 and 2.9 s following the 1st stimulus. It is therefore unclear why the baseline DA level in Syt-1 cKO DA slices is exactly at 0 when the traces in Figures 1H and 3A, as well as the normalization in 1I, show a slight accumulation of dopamine over time in these slices.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing this up and would like to note that the baseline DA level in Syt1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> was not exactly zero, but the scale of the y-axis was such that it was difficult to see this. We have now split up the graph in Figure 3C such that Syt1 control and Syt1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> values are shown on separate scales and the low amount of accumulation at baseline can be visualized. We thank the reviewers for pointing this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 3G: In the pre-TTX condition, the average dopamine level in Syt-1 cKO DA animals is significantly smaller than that in Syt-1 control animals at only 1 of 3 time points. Can the author provide an explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>In our view, the pre-TTX effect of Syt1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> in Figure 3G is surprisingly mild given the strong reduction in synchronous release. Because the pre-TTX effect of Syt1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> is mild and there is some variability in microdialysis measurements, it is difficult to detect. This is particularly striking because in mutants that lack RIM in dopamine neurons in which action potential triggered release is also absent, pre-TTX dopamine levels in microdialysis are very strongly reduced (Liu et al., 2018).</p><p>We describe the effect of synaptotagmin-1 ablation on pre-TTX dopamine in vivo as follows : “Remarkably, extracellular dopamine levels before TTX reverse dialysis were only mildly reduced in Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup>…”.</p><p>While we don’t have a definitive answer as to why this is the case, we think it is most likely that in vivo, asynchronous release contributes robustly to extracellular dopamine because dopamine levels in microdialysis drop significantly after action potential blockade with TTX in Syt-1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice, and changes in the clearance of dopamine could also contribute. We also note that there is a good match across different mutants between dopamine in the microdialysate and KCl depolarization induced release: in Syt1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> animals, amperometric currents in response to action potentials are strongly reduced, but KCl depolarization and in vivo microdialysis reports significant extracellular dopamine. This is different from dopamine neuron RIM knockouts (RIM cKO<sup>DA</sup>), in which KCl triggered release is abolished and pre-TTX extracellular dopamine in microdialysis is strongly reduced (Liu et al., 2018). To summarize these effects, we now state the following: “These data suggest that three modes of dopamine release exist: synchronous and asynchronous release in response to action potentials, and action potential independent release that is likely mediated by spontaneous exocytotic events. Remarkably, each component appears to contribute significantly to the extracellular dopamine measured by microdialysis in anesthetized mice, suggesting that asynchronous and action potential-independent release may be prominent.”</p><p>We hope that these statements, together with the explanations above, address this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors' explanation for how KCl but not ChR2 is able to cause DA release in Syt-1 cKO DA slices is not clear. Is this high KCl<sup>-</sup>induced release calcium-dependent?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers to bring up this important point, and it relates to point 4 as well. This point has two aspects: (1) how channelrhodopsin triggers release, and (2) how KCl triggers release.</p><p>1) While it is possible that Ca<sup>2+</sup> enters through channelrhodopsin directly under some circumstances, this is not the case here in a way that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is sufficient to trigger dopamine release. The experiments in Syt1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> animals are performed with oChiEF, not ChR2, and we have directly tested whether sodium channels are necessary for this form of release. We found that TTX entirely blocks oChiEF induced release (Figures 6A-6C in Liu et al., 2018). Hence, this method triggers release by evoking action potentials in dopamine axons. We now state: “In these mice, we expressed oChiEF-citrine, a fast channelrhodopsin, selectively in dopamine neurons using AAVs (Figure 1A) to optogenetically evoke dopamine release through triggering of axonal action potentials (Liu et al., 2018).”</p><p>2) As outlined above, KCl triggers release most likely through at least two mechanisms, massive depolarization of (i) dopamine axons and (ii) of cholinergic interneurons, which in turn release acetylcholine and then trigger dopamine release through an unknown mechanism after activation of dopamine axonal nAChRs. Notably, this form of dopamine release requires the presence of vesicular release machinery, for example RIM, and hence we concluded in a previously published study that it is vesicular (Liu et al., 2018). Because release triggered through nAChRs activation (Figure 1—figure supplement 4) is abolished in Syt1 cKO<sup>DA</sup> mice, we conclude that KCl triggers vesicular exocytosis of dopamine through strong depolarization of dopamine axons.</p><p>We now specifically describe the mechanisms of KCl mediated release: “Local puffing of KCl onto brain slices causes a strong depolarization of dopamine axons and surrounding neurons, for example cholinergic interneurons, which triggers massive dopamine release that requires the active zone protein RIM in dopamine axons (Liu et al., 2018).”</p><p>The best experiment to directly test the requirement for extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> for this form of release would be to remove extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> entirely. For optogenetic experiments, we have tried to fully remove extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> from striatal slices, but have found that this is challenging and we do not have good experiments to evaluate the requirement of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> for KCl<sup>-</sup>triggered dopamine release. Hence, although there is a long-term body of literature to suggest that KCl triggers release through depolarization-dependent opening of voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels followed by flooding of the nerve terminal with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we do not have the capability to prove this at this point in striatal brain slices. To account for this in the manuscript, we now state: “While the exact mechanism of KCl depolarization induced dopamine release is not known, the data further suggest that depolarization-induced, likely massive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry may trigger vesicular dopamine release via one or multiple alternative Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors in the absence of Synaptotagmin-1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The third paragraph of the main section seems to have been misplaced.
