painkillers are urgently needed. The activation of opioid receptors in peripheral inflamed tissue can reduce pain without central adverse effects such as sedation, apnoea, or addiction. Here, we use an unprecedented strategy and report the synthesis and analgesic efficacy of the standard opioid morphine covalently attached to hyperbranched polyglycerol (PG-M) by a cleavable linker. With its high-molecular weight and hydrophilicity, this conjugate is designed to selectively release morphine in injured tissue and to prevent blood-brain barrier permeation. In contrast to conventional morphine, intravenous PG-M exclusively activated peripheral opioid receptors to produce analgesia in inflamed rat paws without major side effects such as sedation or constipation. Concentrations of morphine in the brain, blood, paw tissue, and in vitro confirmed the selective release of morphine in the inflamed milieu. Thus, PG-M may serve as prototype of a peripherally restricted opioid formulation designed to forego central and intestinal side effects.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27081.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27081.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>opioid</kwd><kwd>nanocarrier</kwd><kwd>polymer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MA 2437/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Machelska</surname><given-names>Halina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haag</surname><given-names>Rainer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0316177B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stein</surname><given-names>Christoph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Society of Anaesthesiology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant 2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stein</surname><given-names>Christoph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel opioid formulation producing analgesia similar to conventional opioids without permeation of blood-brain or intestinal barriers, thus precluding sedation, constipation and respiratory depression.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Opioid agonists such as morphine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; 1) are the gold standard for the treatment of severe pain. However, their clinical effectiveness is limited by adverse side effects that mainly result from permeation of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and activation of mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS). These include sedation, apnoea, tolerance, and addiction and have recently lead to an epidemic of overdoses, death, and abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kolodny et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Passik, 2014</xref>). In addition, constipation due to activation of central and/or intestinal opioid receptors is a major drawback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schumacher et al., 2015</xref>), and nonsteroidal analgesics are burdened by detrimental side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, or cardiovascular complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhala et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arfè et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sondergaard et al., 2017</xref>).

Such receptors are upregulated in injured tissue and can be targeted selectively to avoid centrally mediated side effects. The local application of small, systemically inactive doses of opioid agonists has been demonstrated to potently reduce pain and inflammation in animal models and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stein and Machelska, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalso et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vadivelu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stein et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stein and Küchler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graham et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zeng et al., 2013</xref>), and pharmacological, genetic, and clinical studies have shown that a large proportion of the analgesic effects produced by systemically administered opioids can be mediated by peripheral opioid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Labuz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaveriaux-Ruff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weibel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jagla et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stein and Jagla, 2014</xref>).

The former were unsuccessful due to peripheral side effects (e.g. loperamide-induced constipation), or because polar residues can decrease ligand affinity to opioid receptors and do not achieve complete BBB impermeability at higher doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stein and Machelska, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown and Goldberg, 1985</xref>). The latter are burdened by allergic reactions to proteins, instability in the circulation, low drug loading capacity, cross-reactivity with healthy or off-target tissues, impaired release of active drug, rapid elimination, or high molecular complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker and Carr, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koshkaryev et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present an unprecedented strategy that does not aim at site-directed drug delivery via tissue-specific antigens or receptors, but harnesses the characteristics of the most prevalent form of clinical pain, that is, pain associated with localized or disseminated inflammation. Inflammation is accompanied by aggregation of leukocyte esterase, proteases, low pH and other mediators, and is an essential component of multiple acute and chronic painful syndromes, including arthritis, endometriosis, cystitis, neuropathic pain, cancer, and surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kominsky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holzer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rindler-Ludwig et al., 1974</xref>). Our approach relies on the high molecular size and hydrophilicity of a polyglycerol-morphine (PG-M) conjugate that hinders BBB permeation, on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) characteristic which permits diffusion of high-molecular-weight species through leaky blood vessels in inflamed tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khandare et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzopardi et al., 2013</xref>), and on the use of an ester bond as a cleavable linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koshkaryev et al., 2013</xref>).

The average molecular weight of PG-M was 21.4 kDa. This permits low-molecular-weight fractions, originating most likely from the conjugation of morphine (M) to low-molecular-weight PG remaining from the initial anionic polymerization process for the synthesis of the hyperbranched scaffold. Due to the statistical nature of molecular weight distribution of hyperbranched polymers, it was not possible to obtain a monomodal MALDI signal of PG or PG-M. The bottom excerpt shows zoom into PG-M peak. Right: GPC of M-salt (top) and PG-M (bottom), incubated in buffer without enzymes. Measurements were performed using BioSil SEC250 columns (Biorad) with a mobile phase flow rate of 1 ml/min under isocratic elution. An injection volume of 50 μl (of either M-salt or PG-M) was used in a mobile phase composed of 10% acetonitrile, 90% 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.0, and detection at 285 nm. Free unmodified M (dimeric morphine sulfate) starts eluting between 20 and 22 min (top), while PG-M begins eluting at 14 min and does not yield free M (bottom).

The solubility profile of PG can be controlled by the functionalization gradient among and within the surface hydroxyl groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haag et al., 2000</xref>). By conjugation with hydrophobic free morphine base at a low functionalization level (&lt;10%), we expected PG-M to retain its inherent hydrophilicity. We converted PG hydroxyl groups to succinate functionalities, which were esterified with morphine through carbodiimide-mediated esterification. This compound released morphine when exposed to either leukocyte esterase or acidic pH in vitro. Because polymer conjugates can selectively aggregate in tumor tissue based on the EPR effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khandare et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzopardi et al., 2013</xref>), we assumed that the hyperpermeable vasculature in inflamed tissue would permit a targeted accumulation of PG-M and subsequent release of free morphine in vivo.</p><p>Using a standard model of high predictive validity for clinical analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stein and Machelska, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalso et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stein et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stein, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Machelska et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Bars et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Whiteside et al., 2008</xref>), we found that both conventional morphine and PG-M produced stronger analgesic effects in inflamed than in noninflamed tissue. This is consistent with numerous experimental and clinical studies and has been attributed to upregulation, increased functionality and accessibility of peripheral opioid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stein and Machelska, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalso et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spahn et al., 2017</xref>). After local injection of conventional morphine or PG-M into inflamed paws, peak morphine concentrations in microdialysates coincided with peak analgesic effects within 5–20 min. These concentrations were about twice as high after conventional morphine than after PG-M, even though we administered the same absolute amounts of morphine. This may be due to protracted release of morphine from the conjugate. In both cases, the analgesic effect in inflamed paws was completely blocked by NLXM, indicating peripheral opioid receptor activation. The effects of both compounds were of similar magnitude, suggesting that maximum efficacy is determined by the available number of peripheral opioid receptors rather than by the amount of agonist, in line with our previous observations after recruitment of opioid-producing inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brack et al., 2004</xref>). Upon local injection of morphine into inflamed paws, small amounts of morphine and a minor analgesic effect appeared in contralateral noninflamed paws (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), suggesting vascular absorption of morphine and subsequent stimulation of central opioid receptors.</p><p>I.v. morphine produced dose-dependent analgesia in both hindlimbs. NLXM partially reduced this response in inflamed but not in noninflamed paws, indicating that the effect in inflamed paws was mediated by both central and peripheral, while that in noninflamed paws was mediated by central opioid receptors only. Concentrations of free morphine measured in brain, blood, and paw tissue corroborated these results. Considering the low microdialysis perfusion rate (see below), the morphine levels in subcutaneous paw tissue within the first hour correlated well with analgesic actions, consistent with the notion that peripheral opioid receptors mediated these effects. Enhanced plasma extravasation most likely accounted for the higher morphine concentrations in inflamed than in noninflamed paws.</p><p>At dosages containing equivalent amounts of morphine-free base, i.v. PG-M produced equally strong analgesia as morphine, but restricted to the inflamed paw. This effect was completely reversed by NLXM, indicating exclusive peripheral opioid receptor activation. Consistently, we did not detect free morphine in noninflamed paw tissue, blood, or brain. This suggests that the conjugates are not cleaved in the absence of inflammation and are unable to cross the BBB. The maximum analgesic effect preceded the peak concentrations of morphine in paw microdialysates. However, such a delay is expected since morphine is cleaved at the injured site where it can readily bind local opioid receptors, and only the spill-over morphine may diffuse to the dialysis membrane. The low perfusion rate of 1 μl/min will cause an additional delay of at least 10 min for the dialysate to reach the outlet. Thus, given a paw volume of about 1–2 ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Machelska et al., 1998</xref>), the first peak at the outflow should not occur before 35–45 min after PG-M extravasates into subcutaneous paw tissue. Our data indicate that after i.v. administration, PG-M is retained in the circulation, slowly accumulates at the target site and produces prolonged analgesia, likely based on the EPR effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khandare et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzopardi et al., 2013</xref>). After i.pl. administration, the analgesic effect was of shorter duration, consistent with the notion that PG-M does not need to extravasate and is cleaved soon after injection.</p><p>No free morphine was detectable in blood after i.v. PG-M, suggesting that this conjugate is stable in absence of leukocyte esterase at physiologic pH. Our direct measurements revealed pH-values of about 6.8 in inflamed paws in vivo. Free morphine was measurable in vitro when PG-M was exposed separately either to low pH or to leukocyte esterase. The in vitro release occurred at a relatively slow rate with a clear enzymatically driven profile. In addition to acidosis and leukocyte esterase, the combination of multiple inflammatory mediators and other lytic enzymes such as proteases may promote a much faster cleavage of PG-M in vivo. These factors appear to contribute to the selective release of morphine from PG-M in injured but not in normal environment, as encountered in brain, blood, or intestinal wall. Indeed, while conventional morphine produced sedation both in the open field and in PPT experiments (rats receiving high doses frequently reached cut-off values), our microdialysis, locomotor, analgesia and binding assays clearly indicated that PG-M did not reach the CNS and did not bind to opioid receptors. Consistent with the notion that PG-M should not extravasate or be cleaved in the noninjured intestinal wall, we did not detect any signs of constipation, in contrast to previously developed peripheral opioid agonists (e.g. loperamide). The abuse potential and organ toxicity of PG-M need to be investigated in further detail, although free hyperbranched PG has already been declared safe for in vivo application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kainthan et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our concept offers a novel perspective for the design of safer opioid analgesics by use of nanocarriers and suggests additional areas for exploration, for example the development of conjugates with other opioids or with antihistamines to preclude central sedative effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>All chemicals and solvents were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich GmbH and Fisher Scientific GmbH.

To stay within the range of the standard curve, some samples (microdialysates after i.pl. injections, blood plasma after thawing) were diluted 1:100 with PBS. Optical density was measured by Spectra Max (Molecular Devices). Data were analyzed by the Softmax program. The manufacturer excluded cross-reactivities with morphine metabolites and related molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>Concentrations of free morphine in paw dialysates, blood, and brain were measured at different intervals after i.pl. or i.v. injection of morphine or PG-M, according to the occurrence of maximum analgesic effects in behavioral experiments. Dialysates were thawed and added directly into the ELISA plate wells. Blood samples were obtained by intracardiac puncture under deep isoflurane anesthesia, directly transferred onto ice and immediately afterwards spun down at 10°C and 3000 rpm for 7 min. Directly after centrifugation, the supernatant (plasma) was collected and stored at −80°C. To collect brain samples, rats were perfused under deep isoflurane anesthesia with saline, brain was removed and stored at −80°C. Once thawed, brain tissue was weighed and homogenized in 6 µl buffer per mg of tissue with Ultra-Turrax-T8 (IKA). The buffer consisted of 0.1 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS (Sigma-Aldrich) and a protease inhibitor (1 tablet/50 ml buffer, Roche Diagnostics). Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>In vitro release of morphine</title><p>Acidic cleavage was examined using 1.2 ml of PG-M solution (0.875 mg/ml) in sodium acetate buffer (1.5 M; pH 5.5). The solution was divided into 24 reaction tubes containing 50 µl each, and the tubes were placed in a heating block for incubation at 37°C and constant shaking at 500 rpm. At defined time points, the incubation was stopped by shock freezing in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. Thereafter, all samples were thawed simultaneously at room temperature, 50 µl PBS solution (10 x PBS; pH 7.4) per sample was added, followed by the addition of 900 µl PBS solution (1 x PBS; pH 7.4), yielding a (theoretical) PG-M concentration of 0.0438 mg/ml. The samples were transferred to filter devices (pore size 3000 Da) and centrifuged for 20 min at 4000 U/min and 4°C. The filtrates were isolated for LC-MS measurements. Enzymatic cleavage was examined using 1.2 ml PG-M solution (0.875 mg/ml) in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) mixed with human leukocyte esterase (8.688 ml). The solution was divided into 24 reaction tubes containing 50.4 µl each. Incubation and termination of the reaction was performed as described above. After thawing at room temperature, 50.4 µl PBS solution (10 x PBS; pH 7.4) was added, followed by 899 µl PBS solution (1x PBS; pH 7.4), yielding a (theoretical) PG-M concentration of 0.0434 mg/ml. Centrifugation was then performed as described above. In control experiments, PG-M solution (1 mg/ml) was incubated in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) without leukocyte esterase. All experiments were performed in triplicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Cell culture and membrane preparation</title><p>An established standard cell line for the expression of exogenous proteins, HEK 293 (obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen; DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany), stably expressing rat mu-opioid receptors was used. According to DSMZ, this cell line is negative for mycoplasms in DAPI, microbiological culture, mRNA hybridization and PCR assays, and multiplex PCR of minisatellite markers revealed a unique DNA profile confirmed as human using isoenzyme analysis of aspartate amino transferase and lactate dehydrogenase with isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine blood plasma, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 0.1 mg/ml geneticin (Biochrome) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a cell incubator. The cells were passaged 1:3 - 1:10 every second to third day depending on the confluence. For binding experiments, cells were cultured in flasks with a growth area of 175 cm². Cells were washed with ice-cold Trizma (50 mM, pH 7.4) (Sigma-Aldrich), scratched with a cell scraper, homogenized, and centrifuged twice at 42,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Radioligand binding</title><p>Displacement of the radiolabeled standard mu-opioid receptor agonist [<sup>3</sup>H]-DAMGO (4 nM) by different concentrations of morphine or PG-M (50, 10, 5, 1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005 µM) was used to determine the half maximal concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) necessary to displace [<sup>3</sup>H]-DAMGO from the receptor. A protein amount of 80–100 µg was incubated with [<sup>3</sup>H]-DAMGO (50 Ci/mmol) and test compounds were dissolved in 50 mM Trizma at pH 7.4 for 90 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of 10 µM naloxone hydrochloride, a standard opioid receptor antagonist (Sigma-Aldrich).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Cytotoxicity</title><p>An established standard cell line for assessment of cytotoxicity, NIH 3T3 cells (DSMZ no.: ACC 59), were seeded into 96-well plates at 5000 cells per well. According to DSMZ, this cell line is negative for mycoplasms in DAPI, microbiological culture, mRNA hybridization and PCR assays, and it was confirmed as mus musculus by cytochrome oxidase I DNA barcoding. After 24 hr incubation, the culture medium was removed and replaced with 100 μl PG-M or morphine sulphate in DMEM at different concentrations. After 48 hr incubation, 10 μl of the tetrazolium dye 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)−2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT solution; 5 mg/ml PBS) was added to each well. Cells were further incubated for 2 hr, culture medium was removed, and 100 μl DMSO were added to dissolve the purple formazan crystals. Optical density was measured at 490 nm by a microplate reader. Untreated cells were used as a control. The experiment was repeated three times and mean values are reported.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Real-time cell analysis (RTCA)</title><p>This assay is a real-time technique to dynamically monitor cell viability. Microelectrode-coupled microtiter plates were used to culture cells, and the cell number, cell morphology, and degree of cell adhesion were reflected by the electrode impedance. Untreated cells attach to the bottom of the well and cause an increase of the cell index (CI) value due to the increased impedance. When treated with toxic compounds, the cells die and detach from the bottom, displaying a decrease of the CI value. 50 μl of culture medium was added to each well of the E-plate 96 (Roche) for background measurements. NIH 3T3 cells were then added at a concentration of 5000 cells per well for 24 hr incubation, followed by adding PG-M and morphine sulphate diluted with DMEM to contain morphine-free base concentrations of 2.6 to 168 μg/ml. Untreated cells were used as controls. The E-plate was incubated and monitored on the RTCA SP system (Roche) for 48 hr at intervals of 15 min for 48 hr. The normalized CI was calculated by CI <sub>original</sub>/CI <sub>normalize time</sub> using the RTCA software version 1.2.1. Four replicates were measured for each sample and the means are reported.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Statistics</title><p>Effect sizes were not pre-specified and no <italic>a priori</italic> power analysis was run. Animal and sample numbers were chosen based on similar previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Labuz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaveriaux-Ruff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weibel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stein, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Machelska et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brack et al., 2004</xref>). No animals, samples, or outliers were excluded from analysis. Synthetic and chromatographic experiments were performed in biological replicates of N = 3. Behavioral and microdialysis experiments were performed in parallel and always with the corresponding controls. Each animal was used only once (behavioral tests or microdialysis). Data were analyzed by Sigma Plot software. Normality of data distribution was tested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Changes over more than two time points induced by one treatment were evaluated using one-way repeated measurements (RM) analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni test. Two-way RM ANOVA and Bonferroni test were used to compare two treatments or treatment versus control over time. Multiple comparisons at one time point were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test for normally distributed data, and Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks followed by Dunn test for non-normally distributed data. Dose-response relationships were tested by linear regression ANOVA. Paired or unpaired t-tests were used for two-sample comparisons of dependent or independent data, respectively. For radioligand binding data, nonlinear regression and calculation of the mean IC<sub>50</sub> was performed using Prism 5 (GraphPad). The difference between IC<sub>50</sub> values was evaluated using unpaired t-test. Differences were considered significant at values of p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG-MA 2437/2–1), the Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF 0316177B), the European Society of Anaesthesiology (Research Grant 2010), the Helmholtz Virtual Institute ‘Multifunctional Biomaterials for Medicine’, and by the Focus Areas ‘Nanoscale’ and ‘DynAge’ of the Freie Universität Berlin and Charité.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Polyglycerol-opioid conjugates – a novel generation of painkillers designed to preclude side effects&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom, Peggy Mason, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered in its current form for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>First, it should be said that all reviewers appreciated the potential excitement around this new therapeutic approach. Thus, while we are rejecting this version, we are open to a new submission of a manuscript that addresses the key points.</p><p>1) First, the low pH of inflamed tissue is assuredly true but how low is unclear. Two references are given for this &quot;fact.&quot; One (Stein and Machelska) contains no information on the pH of inflamed tissue. The other (Holzer) states &quot; pH values can fall to 4.7 in fracture-related haematomas, to 5.4 in inflammation, to 5.7 in cardiac ischaemia, and to 6.2 during exhausting skeletal muscle contractions.&quot; Given this large range, the reviewers wanted to see a measurement of pH in the model used here (CFA).</p><p>2) Not unrelated to the first point, in vitro data on PG-M release as a function of pH and time is needed. This is particularly important because acidotic hydrolysis is not steeply dependent on pH and because of a highly plausible alternative possibility, namely that the PG-M release occurs through an esterase reaction. Whichever of these mechanisms causes release is obviously fine but the experiments need to be done to back up the conclusions.</p><p>There are additional points in the detailed reviews provided below which the authors may use to effect. However, the mechanism of action questions highlighted here are the central points that drove the decision to reject this manuscript in its current version.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In general, I like this manuscript. The following are my major comments:</p><p>– The use of 12 mg/kg morphine for comparison is specious. As the authors demonstrate, this dose is sedating and constipating and causes respiratory depression to the extreme. It is above the dose that would be used clinically (in a non-tolerant pt). Saying that rats that have received 12 mg/kg morphine have no fecal boli is simply not that interesting or relevant.</p><p>– It is not accurate to say that the same amount of morphine resulted from the various opioid administration. The dose resulting from PG-M in injured paw may be equivalent to that yielded by M given systemically, but not this is not true of PG-M in the uninflamed tissue. The point that the amount of opioid in the inflamed paw is equivalent to that from systematic opioid is well taken without the frankly hyperbolic statement above.</p><p>– There is no figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>– I don't understand the figure legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Systemic doses are given for both iv PG-M and systemic morphine. Just give the actual doses used not the calculated doses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Gonzalez-Rodriguez and colleagues shows that the novel compound polyglycerol-morphine (PG-M) alleviates local inflammatory pain without producing sedation, a classically described morphine effect on the central nervous system, and with no constipatory action. The paper reports entirely new data as this is the first release on this new morphine polymer that gets cleaved to morphine in an acidic milieu only, a characteristic of inflammation sites. It is an important contribution in the fight against chronic pain that constitutes a major health problem worldwide. Indeed, opiates are the most potent analgesics but their use leads to important side effects that limit their utility. This work constitutes a key advance for the development of analgesics based on morphine self-degradable polymers that would not produce brain-mediated effects such as sedation or addiction. The data presented support the major conclusions and there are no concerns with ethics.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting manuscript with some fascinating data on the use of HPGs as a carrier for morphine coupled to the dendritic polymer by a biodegradable ester linkage. The synthesis of the material is sound and well supported. The biological results seem quite clear in that the material has an analgesic effect in the model examined. However, I have concerns about the mechanism proposed for the effect, as outlined below.</p><p>My issue is the mechanism of release of morphine and the supporting data to establish the acidic hydrolysis of the morphine substituents. It is known that acidic hydrolysis of esters is much less pH sensitive than basic hydrolysis, so a fairly acidic environment or long reaction times are generally recognized as necessary to provide significant bond rupture. Are these conditions satisfied in the inflammation model used? While the authors provide references reporting extreme acidic environments in some inflammatory conditions, the statements therein seem anecdotal and no supporting measurement data in these references is available. The best paper I found on this subject (A. Punnia-Moorthy, J. Oral Pathol 1987, 16: 36-44) describes direct pH measurements in the inflamed area and of the exudates in a model of inflammation induced by three agents, one bacterial as in the present case. The results show pH changes generally less than 0.5 pH units to ~pH 6.9-7.0 as the maximum drop with measurements up to 24 hr after injection. The authors do not show any data that would suggest this small change would be sufficient to release much morphine under their conditions. It would have helped to have in vitro data of release as a function of pH and time to look directly at this issue. I think what has been ignored here is the likelihood of the inflammatory exudate containing significant enzymatic esterase activity that could be responsible for ester hydrolysis and morphine release. Leukocyte esterases are routinely found in exudates and are used as evidence of the presence of inflammation clinically so it would be easy to test for this and to measure the release rates to compare with the acidic hydrolysis model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic> </p><p>This is a well-written and very interesting manuscript with an innovative approach for the use of a polymer-drug conjugate. The in vivo experiments are really good. Only, a few more controls and physico-chemical characterization of PG-M conjugates would be needed in order to corroboration statement throughout the manuscript mainly referring to morphine pH-responsive release.</p><p>1) Characterization of drug loading and absence of encapsulated drug should be done in more quantitative manner by means for example of NMR- TOCSY would give you conjugation identity and DOSY could support absence of non-conjugated drug.</p><p>2) A systematic drug release kinetics study should be performed in vitro at different pHs, 7.4 and 4.7 as reported. Also including stability in plasma as local/sc vs. iv administrations are compared.</p><p>3) Also it would be nice to see PG-M accumulation in the inflamed areas by labeling PG with a NIR tag for example, this will give an idea of conjugate fate and will support clinical use if shows adequate PK/biodistribution data.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Polyglycerol-opioid conjugate produces analgesia devoid of side effects&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Peggy Mason, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. Both reviewers are skeptical of the importance of the acidic environment. And the cleaving of PG-MOR by a far more acidic environment than was measured is minimal. At this point, the whole acidic cleavage story appears to be a holdover from earlier drafts and constructions of the story but no longer appears warranted for inclusion given the new data. Or at the very least, the pH story needs to be toned down and background for the leukocyte esterase story expanded. More detailed comments are below and should be helpful in preparing a revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>I think this version is significantly improved and is much closer to acceptance. I am still unhappy with the discussion around the mechanism of morphine release from HPGs however. Measuring the local pH in vivo (6.8) and adding the release kinetics in vitro is helpful but I don't understand why the acidic pH chosen (5.5) is so much lower than the value measured in the inflamed rat paw. Based on the data presented I don't see any reason to expect pH to be involved in morphine release in vivo, at least not in this model. This comment is based on the very small and slow effect shown for more even acidic conditions than observed, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>, compared to esterase-driven release and to the very rapid (minutes) analgesic effects measured in vivo, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The authors' lose nothing by focussing on the esterase mechanism as it is universally recognized as a critical element of inflammation. As I said in my first review, it is known that acidic conditions are much less effective than basic ones in hydrolyzing esters so the short time scale of analgesia appearance observed in vivo should be an immediate sign that pH is <italic>not</italic> driving morphine release in the rat paw but it is quite consistent with what is known about the behavior of leukocytes in such circumstances. I would suggest then that:</p><p>a) A brief description of leukocyte esterase activity in inflammation should be provided in the Introduction or Discussion so the reader does not just abruptly come on the idea with no background, and;</p><p>b) A clearer discussion included comparing the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">12</xref> and what they mean mechanistically. I know the discussion is toned down with respect to pH effects compared to the original version. However, I don't think it is useful to the readership to not be clear that the enzymatic route is likely the important one and singularly promising for ongoing development of the exciting discovery resulting from this fine set of experiments. This is an important paper in my mind so mechanistic clarity is critical for future evolution of the approach.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This revision adds two important findings. First, the authors have measured the actual pH in their injury model. Second they have shown that either low pH (far lower than measured and so of dubious relevance) or esterase (of far more relevance) will cleave the PG-MOR. This is a valuable contribution.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27081.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>First, it should be said that all reviewers appreciated the potential excitement around this new therapeutic approach. Thus, while we are rejecting this version, we are open to a new submission of a manuscript that addresses the key points.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) First, the low pH of inflamed tissue is assuredly true but how low is unclear. Two references are given for this &quot;fact.&quot; One (Stein and Machelska) contains no information on the pH of inflamed tissue. The other (Holzer) states &quot; pH values can fall to 4.7 in fracture-related haematomas, to 5.4 in inflammation, to 5.7 in cardiac ischaemia, and to 6.2 during exhausting skeletal muscle contractions.&quot; Given this large range, the reviewers wanted to see a measurement of pH in the model used here (CFA).</italic> </p><p>We have now added in vivo pH measurements in paw tissue and blood, performed by a new co-author (A.R.G.). This information and a respective reference were added to the Results (subsections “PG-M produces analgesia selectively in inflamed tissue” and 2 In vivo concentrations of free morphine in paw tissue, circulating blood, and brain “), Discussion (paragraph five) and Materials and methods (“In vivo pH measurement”) sections. Additional references are now cited in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Not unrelated to the first point,</italic> in vitro <italic>data on PG-M release as a function of pH and time is needed. This is particularly important because acidotic hydrolysis is not steeply dependent on pH and because of a highly plausible alternative possibility, namely that the PG-M release occurs through an esterase reaction. Whichever of these mechanisms causes release is obviously fine but the experiments need to be done to back up the conclusions.</italic> </p><p>We have now raised additional funds and added a substantial volume of new experiments to this effect. These were conducted and analyzed by three new co-authors (K.W., J.J., M.K.P.). We replaced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>), removed previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref> (and related text. Several statements throughout the manuscript were altered to acknowledge the role of leukocyte esterase in addition to acidosis.) References were also updated/added.</p><p><italic>There are additional points in the detailed reviews provided below which the authors may use to effect. However, the mechanism of action questions highlighted here are the central points that drove the decision to reject this manuscript in its current version.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>In general, I like this manuscript. The following are my major comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>– The use of 12 mg/kg morphine for comparison is specious. As the authors demonstrate, this dose is sedating and constipating and causes respiratory depression to the extreme. It is above the dose that would be used clinically (in a non-tolerant pt). Saying that rats that have received 12 mg/kg morphine have no fecal boli is simply not that interesting or relevant.</italic> </p><p>We would like to retain this statement because these experiments impressively demonstrate that an equivalent dose of PG-M does not produce sedation, respiratory depression or constipation. This is one of the major findings of our study. In addition, a dose of 12 mg/kg morphine is not unusually high in rodents (e.g. Craft. Exp Clin Psychopharmacol. 2008;16:376-85; Nakamura et al., 2011; Bajic et al., 2015; Gallantine et al. Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol. 2008;103:419-27).</p><p><italic>– It is not accurate to say that the same amount of morphine resulted from the various opioid administration. The dose resulting from PG-M in injured paw may be equivalent to that yielded by M given systemically, but not this is not true of PG-M in the uninflamed tissue. The point that the amount of opioid in the inflamed paw is equivalent to that from systematic opioid is well taken without the frankly hyperbolic statement above.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer. To avoid misunderstandings, we have changed the respective statements by replacing the terms “yield” with “contain” throughout the manuscript.</p><p><italic>– There is no figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</italic> </p><p>The figure legend is now included.</p><p><italic>– I don't understand the figure legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Systemic doses are given for both iv PG-M and systemic morphine. Just give the actual doses used not the calculated doses.</italic> </p><p>For clarification, the respective statements were amended in all figure legends.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>The manuscript by Gonzalez-Rodriguez and colleagues shows that the novel compound polyglycerol-morphine (PG-M) alleviates local inflammatory pain without producing sedation, a classically described morphine effect on the central nervous system, and with no constipatory action. The paper reports entirely new data as this is the first release on this new morphine polymer that gets cleaved to morphine in an acidic milieu only, a characteristic of inflammation sites. It is an important contribution in the fight against chronic pain that constitutes a major health problem worldwide. Indeed, opiates are the most potent analgesics but their use leads to important side effects that limit their utility. This work constitutes a key advance for the development of analgesics based on morphine self-degradable polymers that would not produce brain-mediated effects such as sedation or addiction. The data presented support the major conclusions and there are no concerns with ethics.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is an interesting manuscript with some fascinating data on the use of HPGs as a carrier for morphine coupled to the dendritic polymer by a biodegradable ester linkage. The synthesis of the material is sound and well supported. The biological results seem quite clear in that the material has an analgesic effect in the model examined. However, I have concerns about the mechanism proposed for the effect, as outlined below.</italic> </p><p><italic>My issue is the mechanism of release of morphine and the supporting data to establish the acidic hydrolysis of the morphine substituents. It is known that acidic hydrolysis of esters is much less pH sensitive than basic hydrolysis, so a fairly acidic environment or long reaction times are generally recognized as necessary to provide significant bond rupture. Are these conditions satisfied in the inflammation model used? While the authors provide references reporting extreme acidic environments in some inflammatory conditions, the statements therein seem anecdotal and no supporting measurement data in these references is available. The best paper I found on this subject (A. Punnia-Moorthy, J. Oral Pathol 1987, 16: 36-44) describes direct pH measurements in the inflamed area and of the exudates in a model of inflammation induced by three agents, one bacterial as in the present case. The results show pH changes generally less than 0.5 pH units to ~pH 6.9-7.0 as the maximum drop with measurements up to 24 hr after injection. The authors do not show any data that would suggest this small change would be sufficient to release much morphine under their conditions. It would have helped to have</italic> in vitro <italic>data of release as a function of pH and time to look directly at this issue. I think what has been ignored here is the likelihood of the inflammatory exudate containing significant enzymatic esterase activity that could be responsible for ester hydrolysis and morphine release. Leukocyte esterases are routinely found in exudates and are used as evidence of the presence of inflammation clinically so it would be easy to test for this and to measure the release rates to compare with the acidic hydrolysis model.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment. We have now raised additional funds, performed new experiments (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>), and added a new table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) to this effect.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is a well-written and very interesting manuscript with an innovative approach for the use of a polymer-drug conjugate. The in vivo experiments are really good. Only, a few more controls and physico-chemical characterization of PG-M conjugates would be needed in order to corroboration statement throughout the manuscript mainly referring to morphine pH-responsive release.</italic></p><p><italic>1) Characterization of drug loading and absence of encapsulated drug should be done in more quantitative manner by means for example of NMR- TOCSY would give you conjugation identity and DOSY could support absence of non-conjugated drug.</italic></p><p>We respectfully disagree that TOCSY or DOSY NMR would have provided more relevant data because these methods have the same level of precision as normal 1H NMR. Using three independent methods, we demonstrated that there was practically no free morphine present in PG-M. This was shown by UV-Vis spectroscopy, thin layer chromatography, gel permeation chromatography, and 1H NMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The results of these experiments were mutually supportive of each other and clearly showed no evidence of free morphine (in the form of TLC spot, shift of UV absorption maximum and proton resonance signals corresponding to free drug). Hence, we did not see a compelling reason to perform DOSY or TOCSY-based experiments to repeat the same observations obtained from conventional characterization techniques.</p><p><italic>2) A systematic drug release kinetics study should be performed</italic> in vitro <italic>at different pHs, 7.4 and 4.7 as reported. Also including stability in plasma as local/sc vs. iv administrations are compared.</italic> </p><p>We have now raised additional funds, performed such experiments, added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). No free morphine was detectable in blood after i.v. PG-M, suggesting that PG-M is stable in the circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). This now mentioned in the Discussion (paragraph five).</p><p><italic>3) Also it would be nice to see PG-M accumulation in the inflamed areas by labeling PG with a NIR tag for example, this will give an idea of conjugate fate and will support clinical use if shows adequate PK/biodistribution data.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be nice to perform such additional experiments. Unfortunately, this would require stable radiolabeling, a significant number of additional animals, the approval of a new animal ethics protocol, and would exceed the scope of the present proof-of-concept study. We certainly hope that other groups (e.g. in the pharmaceutical industry) will be stimulated by our initial report and perform such studies in the framework of drug development.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. Both reviewers are skeptical of the importance of the acidic environment. And the cleaving of PG-MOR by a far more acidic environment than was measured is minimal. At this point, the whole acidic cleavage story appears to be a holdover from earlier drafts and constructions of the story but no longer appears warranted for inclusion given the new data. Or at the very least, the pH story needs to be toned down and background for the leukocyte esterase story expanded. More detailed comments are below and should be helpful in preparing a revision.</italic> </p><p>We have now toned down the importance of acidic pH and emphasized the relevance of leukocyte esterase throughout the manuscript. Specifically, we made the following changes:</p><p>1) We removed (former) <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and the respective text passages.</p><p>2) We emphasized the relevance of leukocyte esterase (and possibly other lytic enzymes) in the text (Introduction final paragraph; Discussion paragraph five) and discussed the difference between in vitro and in vivo release of morphine from the conjugate.</p><p>3) The passage on characterization of the PG-M conjugate was removed from the Materials and methods section because this was already described under Results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
