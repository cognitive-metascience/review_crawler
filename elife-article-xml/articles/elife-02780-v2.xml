model, which emphasizes the primacy of PDF-containing neurons, and a cell-autonomous model for circadian phase adjustment. We identify five different circadian (E) neurons that are a major source of rhythmicity and locomotor activity. Brief firing of PDF cells at different times of day generates a phase response curve (PRC), which mimics a light-mediated PRC and requires PDF receptor expression in the five E neurons. Firing also resembles light by causing TIM degradation in downstream neurons. Unlike light however, firing-mediated phase-shifting is CRY-independent and exploits the E3 ligase component CUL-3 in the early night to degrade TIM. Our results suggest that PDF neurons integrate light information and then modulate the phase of E cell oscillations and behavioral rhythms. The results also explain how fly brain rhythms persist in constant darkness and without CRY.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02780.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02780.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02780.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most animals have daily rhythms of activity: some are awake during the day and asleep at night, whilst others are more active at night, or during the twilight hours around dawn and dusk. These cycles of activity are driven by an internal body clock, which is reset in response to external cues, like light and temperature, and which keeps the animal in sync with the day–night cycle.</p><p>The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> has daily—or circadian—rhythms of behavior, which are controlled by a network of genes that are switched ‘on’ or ‘off’ at different times in every 24-hr period. These circadian genes encode various proteins, including PERIOD and TIMELESS. The levels of these two proteins increase during the day and into the night, until they reach a point at which they cause their own genes to be switched off. PERIOD and TIMELESS are then destroyed each morning, and the cycle begins anew. Most of these same proteins perform similar functions in mammals.</p><p>In the fly brain, two groups of neurons express these key proteins and control the timings of activity or movement. One group, called M cells, regulates activity in the morning and also produces a small molecule called PDF. Another group, called E cells, controls evening activity, but is less well-defined.</p><p>Since M cells can maintain circadian rhythms even in total darkness, these cells were also considered key ‘pacemaker neurons’. However, Guo et al. now challenge this view by identifying five E cells that are the major source of circadian activity. Blocking the release of signaling molecules from these neurons severely disrupted movement in both the morning and the evening. The E cells are also critical for timekeeping under a normal day–night cycle.</p><p>Guo et al. found that the rhythm of the E cells is reset when the M cell neurons fire, which causes a release of PDF molecules. Further, PDF molecules reset the E cells by causing the degradation of the TIMELESS protein—which is similar to the effect of light, although light cause TIMELESS to be degraded via a different biochemical pathway.</p><p>Guo et al. suggest that under normal light–dark conditions the E cells are important for driving the flies' activity as well as for overall timekeeping. The M cells, instead, appear to function primarily to integrate information about light and reset the E cell clock. Challenges moving forward will include understanding other ways in which the firing of neurons can affect timekeeping, as well as looking if there any differences between the five E cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02780.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02780.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>phase shift</kwd><kwd>PDF</kwd><kwd>locomotor activity</kwd><kwd>neuron activity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 NS44232</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Fang</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xiao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Exceptional Research Opportunities Program (EXROP)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cerullo</surname><given-names>Isadora</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A few circadian ‘evening’ neurons within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain play a key role in driving activity as well as keeping time, whereas the well-known PDF-containing morning cells are likely involved in integrating and transmitting light information.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals use endogenous circadian pacemakers to control their physiology and behavior with roughly 24-hr periodicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bass and Takahashi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thut et al., 2012</xref>). Intracellular timekeeping mechanisms include transcriptional feedback loops, which involve many key genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. They include <italic>period</italic> (<italic>per</italic>), <italic>timeless</italic> (<italic>tim</italic>), <italic>clock</italic> (<italic>clk</italic>), <italic>cycle</italic> (<italic>cyc</italic>), and <italic>doubletime</italic> (<italic>dbt</italic>). Coordination of their encoded protein activities (<italic>period</italic>, PER; <italic>timeless</italic>, TIM; <italic>clock</italic>, CLK; <italic>cycle</italic>, CYC: and <italic>doubletime</italic>, DBT) contributes to the intracellular cycling of the molecular pacemaker, which is similar between flies and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dubruille and Emery, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Menet and Rosbash, 2011</xref>). PER and TIM concentrations increase during the day, and they eventually negatively regulate their own transcription. Biochemical oscillations in the head occur in part through a direct interaction of PER and TIM with the positive transcription factor CLK: CYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dubruille and Emery, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Menet and Rosbash, 2011</xref>). They also require the photoreceptor cryptochrome (CRY) as well as a cycling light:dark (LD) environment, that is, RNA and protein oscillations damp rapidly in constant darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stanewsky et al., 1998</xref>). The central brain is probably different as its molecular and behavioral rhythms persist in constant darkness and is CRY-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stanewsky et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, CRY is expressed within many of the 75 pairs of central brain circadian neurons and is necessary for an important biological feature of circadian rhythms, namely, light-mediated phase adjustment or phase-shifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emery et al., 1998</xref>). There is good evidence in favor of a cell-autonomous view of <italic>Drosophila</italic> phase-shifting: light penetrates the thin insect cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fogle et al., 2011</xref>) and causes a CRY conformational change within circadian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ozturk et al., 2011</xref>). The altered CRY molecules recruit the E3 ligase JETLAG (JET) to TIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Peschel et al., 2009</xref>). Premature TIM degradation then causes phase advances in the late night, whereas inappropriate TIM degradation during the TIM accumulating phase in the early night causes phase delays.</p><p>Two groups of central brain circadian neurons appear particularly important for behavioral rhythms. The 4 PDF-expressing small ventrolateral neurons (sLNvs) dictate morning activity as well as the rhythmicity in constant darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Renn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanchardon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>). This latter feature, free running locomotor activity rhythms, has caused the s-LNvs to be considered the major fly pacemaker neurons. A less well-defined set of cells directs evening activity. These neurons (E cells) also dictate circadian behavior in constant light and probably include the 6 LNds and the PDF-negative 5<sup>th</sup> s-LNv (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Picot et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We identify here five E neurons as a major source of circadian and behavioral rhythmicity as well as locomotor activity, of which the 2 CRY+ E neurons are most important. The phase of these cells is shifted by the M cell firing and requires PDF as well as the PDF receptor within these five E cells. Moreover, brief firing of M cells at different times of day generates a phase response curve (PRC), which resembles a proper light-mediated PRC. Brief M cell firing also resembles light by causing rapid TIM degradation within downstream circadian neurons, but firing-mediated phase-shifting is CRY-independent and exploits the E3 ligase components CUL-3 to degrade TIM, at least in the early night-delay zone. Our findings suggest that E cells are very important for timekeeping under light–dark conditions whereas an important function of PDF cells is for light-mediated phase adjustment, that is, to integrate light information and appropriately fire. This degrades TIM within E cells, which modulates the phase of E cell oscillations and behavioral rhythms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of an E cell subset as major circadian and locomotor activity neurons</title><p>To address further the roles of M and E cells, we made use of a recently described <italic>DvPdf-GAL4</italic> driver, which expresses strongly and specifically in the M cells and subsets of the E cells.

In contrast, the evening peak phase is dramatic advanced when accelerating the endogenous clock in the 5 Dv-E cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that the E cells independently determine the major activity phase in LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stoleru et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Because differential neuron expression profiling suggests that the 5 Dv-E cells use excitatory neurotransmitter machinery to communicate with other neurons (unpublished data) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johard et al., 2009</xref>), we blocked neurotransmitter release from 5 Dv-E cells by expressing the tetanus toxin light chain (TNT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sweeney et al., 1995</xref>).

Moreover, the effect of CUL-3 is particularly striking when TIM is cytoplasmic in the early night. This suggests that CUL-3 might be important for PDF mediated, CRY-independent TIM degradation and phase-shifting, especially in the early night-delay zone. Indeed, co-expression of CUL-3 RNAi with dTrpA1 under <italic>DvPdf-GAL4</italic> control did not significantly affect DD rhythmicity and period at 21°C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grima et al., 2012</xref>).

Here we provide a modified configuration with a more prominent role for 5 Dv-E cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This view is based on several new and unanticipated results. First, the 5 Dv-E cells are not only responsible for the evening anticipation peak and its timing, but they also contribute to the morning peak, free running rhythms and total activity. Otherwise put, these cells appear to play a key role in all aspects of circadian rhythms and locomotor activity. Second, E cell resetting can occur in a non cell-autonomous manner, through M cell neuron firing, PDF release and E cell PDFR activation. Third, TIM level changes within the 5 Dv-E cells in response to M cell firing likely make a major contribution to the resulting phase changes, at least in the early night when phase delays occur, and therefore make a major contribution to circadian timekeeping under more normal LD conditions.</p><p>The classical cell-autonomous model of <italic>Drosophila</italic> phase-shifting has long contrasted with the well-established view of phase-shifting in the mammalian SCN. In this system, firing from optic track activates SCN NMDA receptors, which is necessary and sufficient for light-mediated phase shifts. Importantly, the contribution of PDF cell firing and PDF to <italic>Drosophila</italic> phase-shifting brings this system closer to that of mammals. Because many aspects of Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) function in mammals resemble those of PDF in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vosko et al., 2007</xref>), it will be interesting to know if VIP cell firing can mimic light and phase-shift mammalian rhythms.</p><p>An important contribution of the E cell TIM level change to phase delays is consistent with previous work showing that a full light pulse at ZT15 induces rapid and potent TIM degradation in all 6 LNds as well as reduced TIM degradation in response to a light pulse of decreased intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tang et al., 2010</xref>). This conclusion is also consistent with more recent data from Emery et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lamba et al., 2014</xref>). Our data here also point to a more important role of the LNds rather than the M cells: the LNds show more TIM degradation in response to firing and a bigger response to the CUL-3 knockdown, which correlates with the decrease in phase delay caused by the knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>This previous work also indicates that there is no observed TIM degradation in the PDF-positive M cells after a light pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tang et al., 2010</xref>). This is consistent with older work showing that <italic>cry</italic> rescue in non M cell circadian neurons (with <italic>Tim-GAL4/Pdf-GAL80</italic>) provides a robust light mediated PRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stoleru et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that canonical CRY-JET-mediated TIM degradation within M cells is unnecessary to convey light information to the brain clock. Our data extend this picture to the more dorsal circadian DNs by showing that TIM degradation within this circadian subpopulation is probably also not essential, at least to phase delays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lamba et al., 2014</xref>). Although these data do not exclude a more inclusive view, our results indicate that acute PDF cell activation causes TIM degradation within the 5 Dv-E cells and that this degradation correlates with the magnitude of the phase delay. We note however that PDF cell activation may also function in other ways, for example by chronically affecting PER levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2014</xref>) or by activating other downstream neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Seluzicki et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>CUL-3 is the first ubiquitin ligase component other than JET to connect with phase-shifting. Importantly, CUL-3 has been shown to participate in light-independent TIM degradation within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grima et al., 2012</xref>). This is where TIM is localized during its accumulating phase in the early night (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), which perfectly matches the preferential role of CUL-3 in promoting delay zone phase-shifts.</p><p>However, the CUL-3 RNAi effects are incomplete. The new non cell-autonomous pathway described here may therefore cooperate with the more traditional cell-autonomous light-CRY-JET pathway to effect phase shifting. As the latter is essential for light-mediated phase-shifting, another non-exclusive possibility is that the two pathways are in series rather than in parallel, that is, that the light-CRY-JET pathway is upstream of neuronal firing and that the RNAi effects reflect incomplete knockdowns. This notion fits with recent studies suggesting that the light-CRY interaction promotes neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fogle et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>At least 2 and probably 3 LNds are CRY-negative by antibody staining criteria even after many days of extended incubation in DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoshii et al., 2008</xref>). As all 6 LNds respond similarly to a full light pulse and to neuronal firing, this indicates that TIM degradation within the CRY-negative LNds is non cell-autonomous and probably requires communication from M cells and/or from other neurons like their CRY-positive LNd neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lamba et al., 2014</xref>). If the CRY-negative LNds are also PDFR-negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Im et al., 2011</xref>), other neuropeptides, neurotransmitters or perhaps even gap junctions may participate in the transfer of light or firing information upstream of TIM degradation.</p><p>Surprisingly, output from the 5 Dv-E cells controls a substantial fraction of evening activity as well as overall locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These conclusions are also based on the phenotypes of Kir as well as dTrpA1 expression under <italic>Dv-E GAL4</italic> control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and data not shown). As <italic>Dv-E GAL4/UAS-TNT</italic> flies have significantly impaired activity in DD as well as in LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the residual locomotor activity may be clock-independent. However, these flies still manifest an evening anticipation peak under LD conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting incomplete suppression by TNT or a role of other circadian activity neurons. As the circadian activity-promoting subset of circadian neurons expresses CRY and PDFR and the <italic>Dv-E GAL4</italic> driver only labels 1 CRY positive LNd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), a simple explanation is that one or more of the other 2 CRY<sup>+</sup> LNds also promotes locomotor activity.</p><p>The Dv-E cells also contribute to morning activity. This is because rescue of PDFR expression only in the Dv-E cells is sufficient to rescue the morning anticipation peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In addition, Dv-E cell output is necessary for a robust morning peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Yet previous results connect the M cells to morning activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2012</xref>). These cells also communicate via PDF with the DN1p dorsal neurons, which also impact the morning anticipation peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2010b</xref>). Although all of these considerations suggest that redundant circuits downstream of the M cells underlie the morning anticipation peak, only output from the Dv-E cells has been shown to be necessary for morning activity, and there is evidence that even the M cells are not necessary for the morning activity peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sheeba et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>These PDF+ M cells have been considered the master pacemakers based on their critical role in keeping time in constant darkness. However, their firing-resetting properties, the identification of the Dv-E cells as major activity neurons even in DD and the likely importance of TIM degradation within these cells for phase adjustment suggest a different reason for the strong molecular rhythms of the PDF neurons in DD and their contribution to behavioral rhythmicity under these conditions. These features likely reflect the important role of the PDF neurons as light-sensitive cells, directly through CRY and indirectly as post-synaptic targets of other light-sensitive cells such as photoreceptor cells within the eye and dorsal brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malpel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoshii et al., 2008</xref> and unpublished data). We therefore suggest that a major function of the PDF neurons is to integrate light information and use it to phase-adjust the Dv-E cells, which are important pacemakers under LD conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Phase is a more important parameter than period under these more ‘natural’ conditions, and expression of period-altering mutants under Dv-E control appropriately alters the phase of the major evening peak but fails to do so under PDF control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and data not shown).</p><p>Lastly, our data offer a simple mechanistic explanation for a long-standing difference between peripheral and central circadian oscillators in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The amplitude of peripheral oscillators is dependent on light as they damp rapidly after transfer of flies to constant darkness. Fly peripheral oscillators are also dependent on the photoreceptor CRY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stanewsky et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malpel et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, the circadian brain network and resultant rhythmic behavior persist in constant darkness and in the absence of CRY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emery et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2000</xref>). Our work here can explain this difference in a simple way: neuronal firing replaces the function of light and CRY and even acts at the same step in the circadian cycle, namely, to promote TIM degradation within circadian neurons. We suggest that this step is intrinsically weak and that TIM degradation is normally potentiated every day, by light and/or by firing. This ensures the maintenance of robust rhythms of brain and behavior without compromising the light- and firing-sensitivity needed for phase adjustment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p><italic>DvPdf-GAL4</italic> was provided by Dr. JH Park; <italic>per</italic><sup><italic>0</italic></sup><italic>;UAS-per</italic> was from Dr. Francois Rouyer; <italic>UAS-dTrpA1</italic> was from Dr. Paul Garrity; <italic>pdfr</italic><sup><italic>5304</italic></sup><italic>; UAS-PDFR</italic> were from Dr. Paul Taghert; <italic>pdf-GSG</italic> was from Dr. Fernanda Ceriani ; the <italic>cry</italic><sup><italic>01</italic></sup> mutant was from Dr. JC.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K (Vijay) Raghavan (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviews to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study by the Rosbash lab addresses the function of the so-called morning and evening cells in the Drosophila brain clock that controls activity-rhythms. In particular, the authors ask whether phase-shifting of the clock (synchronization to day-night cycles) involves neuronal firing and intercellular communication. Although cell-autonomous CRYPTOCHOME-dependent degradation of the TIMELESS clock protein is a key mechanism in molecular phase-shifting, previous work from the same lab has shown that non cell-autonomous resetting mechanisms also operate in the clock neuronal network. They show here that neuronal excitation of the PDF-expressing morning cells can induce both advances and delays of the behavioral rhythms, similarly to what light pulses do. These behavioral phase shifts are correlated with TIM degradation in morning and evening cells. TIM degradation does not require CRY and appears to rely upon the activity of CUL-3 ubiquitylation complexes for evening signals.</p><p>These are very interesting data that reveal new mechanisms for the synchronization of the clock, both at the cellular and molecular level. Some control quantifications should added to strengthen the conclusions and a few additional experiments would be welcome. One weakness is the first part of the paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1-2</xref>) where the authors question the role of PDF-negative cells in the LD and DD behavior. The results are rather different depending on the tools that are used to alter these cells and this should be clarified or toned down.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Characterization of the <italic>Dvpdf-gal4</italic> cells: the so-called 5 Dv-E cells should be better characterized, most importantly for their CRY expression status since “evening” LNds have mostly been described through CRY expression. Please do anti-CRY labeling to tell whether these cells or some of them are CRY-positive.</p><p>2) The effects of E cell manipulations on DD rhythms and activity is very interesting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, how do the authors reconcile these findings with previous results (including those from their own lab) showing that clocks in M cells are necessary and sufficient for DD rhythms? Is it the case that clocks in E cells are not essential in DD, but the cells themselves are? Or that the cells are not required either, but tinkering with the activity of E cells interferes with the rhythms generated by M cells? Related to this point, what is the effect of M (Pdf) cell manipulation on activity levels in DD?</p><p>3) To strengthen the case that the E cells are driving the phase of activity in LD, I recommend that the authors include the data demonstrating that period-altering transgenes are more effective in altering phase when expressed in E cells than M cells (currently mentioned as “data not shown” in the Discussion).</p><p>4) The manuscript shows nicely that expression of pdfr in M+E cells rescues M cell-induced phase-shifting in a <italic>pdfr</italic> mutant background. The argument that the expression in E cells is the relevant one makes sense, and I recognize that restricting expression of pdfr to E cells, while driving TrpA in M cells, could be complicated (requiring two driver systems). However, the authors should show that restricting expression to M cells is ineffective (again, currently mentioned as “data not shown”).</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D/E</xref>:Why do TNT and Kir expression in the Dv-E cells produce so different behavioral phenotypes in LD ?

To address the most important ones, we added three major additions to our paper:</p><p>1) We added a panel to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (now 1D) to show that the expression of a period-altering gene in E cells but not in M cells or in DN1p cells can change the activity phase in LD. This indicates that the E cell clock directs the phase of behavioral output.</p><p>2) We did a new experiment, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, addressing the effect of blocking E cell activity. This was previously done under incomplete conditions (26-27°C), and we have now done it at 30°C to effect a more complete block of E cell activity. As predicted there is a nearly complete loss of morning activity (as well as a strong effect on evening activity). Importantly, the two approaches, in 2A and 2B, are now much more similar than before. More than one referee had trouble with the previous difference between 2A and 2B, which is now essentially gone.</p><p>3) We did CRY staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and now show that 1 of the Dv-LNds as well as the 5<sup>th</sup> sLNv are CRY-positive. We also show behavior data to indicate that these 2 CRY+ Dv-E cells are key for the circadian phenotype.</p><p><italic>1) Characterization of the</italic> Dvpdf-gal4 <italic>cells: the so-called 5 Dv-E cells should be better characterized, most importantly for their CRY expression status since “evening” LNds have mostly been described through CRY expression. Please do anti-CRY labeling to tell whether these cells or some of them are CRY-positive</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We did CRY staining and also CRY-GAL80 behavior experiments and show the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. They are: 1) Only one of the four LNd cells is CRY positive (as well as the 5th s-LNv). 2) These CRY+ DV-E cells were essential for circadian behavior, i.e., adding CRY-gal80 to the PDFR rescue with the DV-E driver blocks the rescue of the M/E peaks on the PDFR mutant background.3) Conclusion: It is the 2 CRY+ cell that are most important, one or both.  And this doesn't exclude the other two CRY+ LNds as being effective too.</p><p><italic>2) The effects of E cell manipulations on DD rhythms and activity is very interesting (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1D</italic></xref><italic>). However, how do the authors reconcile these findings with previous results (including those from their own lab) showing that clocks in M cells are necessary and sufficient for DD rhythms? Is it the case that clocks in E cells are not essential in DD, but the cells themselves are? Or that the cells are not required either, but tinkering with the activity of E cells interferes with the rhythms generated by M cells? Related to this point, what is the effect of M (Pdf) cell manipulation on activity levels in DD?</italic></p><p>In a nutshell, we think that the basic DD result is compatible with a model where E-cells are downstream of PDF cells. We think the activity phase is both controlled by the clock within the E cells (please see the answer to next comment) and PDF signaling from M cells and that the output from E cells is necessary to translate the PER/TIM phase within the PDF neurons into circadian behavior.</p><p><italic>3) To strengthen the case that the E cells are driving the phase of activity in LD, I recommend that the authors include the data demonstrating that period-altering transgenes are more effective in altering phase when expressed in E cells than M cells (currently mentioned as “data not shown” in the Discussion)</italic>.</p><p>Please see addition to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, i.e., 1D. We have expressed DBT-S in M-cells, DN1ps and E-cells, and only DBT-S in E-cells moves the major activity peak in the expected direction. This is also compatible with the literature, where SGG expression was used to advance the evening peak (2007 Stoleru Cell paper). Our current paper extends that result by having a much more restricted expression pattern, and suggests that clock in E cells directly controls the major activity phase in LD. In other words, PDF acts through Dv-E cells to modulate phase and period.</p><p><italic>4) The manuscript shows nicely that expression of pdfr in M+E cells rescues M cell-induced phase-shifting in a</italic> pdfr <italic>mutant background. The argument that the expression in E cells is the relevant one makes sense, and I recognize that restricting expression of pdfr to E cells, while driving TrpA in M cells, could be complicated (requiring two driver systems).

Since one copy of Cry-GAL80 (3<sup>rd</sup> chromosome) only blocks GAL4 activity in CRY+ Dv-E-cells (1 CRY+ LNd as well as 5<sup>th</sup> sLNv,) but not in M cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure5C</xref>), we use <italic>DvPdf-GAL4;Cry-GAL80</italic> to drive the TrpA1 and PDFR expression in M as well as CRY negative Dv-E cells, which is ineffective to cause a M cell-induced phase-shifting in a <italic>pdfr</italic> mutant background.</p><p><italic>5)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1D/E</italic></xref><italic>:Why do TNT and Kir expression in the Dv-E cells produce so different behavioral phenotypes in LD ?
