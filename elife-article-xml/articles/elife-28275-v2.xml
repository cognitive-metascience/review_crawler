We have measured the genome-wide binding profile of Bcd using ChIP-seq in embryos expressing single, uniform levels of Bcd protein, and grouped Bcd-bound targets into four classes based on occupancy at different concentrations. By measuring the biochemical affinity of target enhancers in these classes in vitro and genome-wide chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq, we found that the occupancy of target sequences by Bcd is not primarily determined by Bcd binding sites, but by chromatin context. Bcd drives an open chromatin state at a subset of its targets. Our data support a model where Bcd influences chromatin structure to gain access to concentration-sensitive targets at high concentrations, while concentration-insensitive targets are found in more accessible chromatin and are bound at low concentrations.

This process requires highly regulated control of gene expression, both in developmental time and at reproducible positions in an embryo. These complex gene regulatory networks are controlled by systems of transcription factors, which bind to DNA and control the expression of genes required for development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levine and Davidson, 2005</xref>). In early <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryos, Bicoid (Bcd) protein forms an anterior-to-posterior gradient the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Driever and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1988b</xref>). Bcd functions as transcriptional activator to pattern the embryo, binding to target gene enhancers and activating gene expression at distinct positions along the AP axis, corresponding to different concentrations of Bcd protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Driever and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1988a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Struhl et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies of Bcd function suggest that its interaction with its targets may be more complex than the simple concentration-dependent activation originally proposed for morphogen gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wolpert, 1969</xref>). Embryos in which the graded distribution of Bcd is disrupted still exhibit patterned expression of Bcd target genes, and these genes can be activated at lower concentrations of Bcd than these nuclei would be exposed to in a wild-type embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ochoa-Espinosa et al., 2009</xref>). While changing Bcd dosage shifts cell fates, the shifts deviate quantitatively from those expected of strict concentration dependence, especially as expression patterns are assayed progressively later during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Because Bcd is not the sole determinant of its target genes’ expression domains, their final patterns are also influenced by other maternal patterning systems and interactions among the Bcd targets themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jaeger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Löhr et al., 2009</xref>). Chen <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that the posterior boundaries of Bcd target genes are positioned by a system of repressors including Runt, Krüppel, and Capicua. These studies have consequently raised doubts about the extent to which the local concentration of Bcd determines the spatial patterns of in the embryo. Further, they demonstrate that using target gene expression as a metric for Bcd function cannot directly address how information from the Bcd gradient initially establishes distinct cell fates, as these expression patterns will always be influenced by additional inputs.</p><p>Part of the difficulty in evaluating direct roles of the Bcd gradient arises from the unknown nature of the molecular mechanism by which Bcd establishes concentration thresholds at different positions along the gradient. A simple model of the positioning of Bcd target genes predicts that <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements of different genes respond to different concentrations of Bcd. Genes in the anterior would have low affinity Bcd binding sites and could therefore only be activated by high Bcd concentrations, whereas genes expressed in more posterior positions would have higher affinity binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Driever et al., 1989</xref>). Direct measurements of Bcd binding affinity have been conducted in vitro using DNA probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao and Finkelstein, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yuan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ma et al., 1996</xref>) and have demonstrated that Bcd is able to bind cooperatively to achieve sharp concentration thresholds. While these measurements lend some support to a simple affinity model, little correlation has been shown between predicted binding site affinity and AP position of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ochoa-Espinosa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Segal et al., 2008</xref>). However, neither in vitro measurements of Bcd binding nor computational predictions of binding sites can capture interactions between Bcd and its target enhancers in the context of local chromatin structure.</p><p>In this study, we sought to measure Bcd’s interactions with its targets directly in the context of the early embryo. Using high throughput sequencing approaches, we measured in vivo genome-wide Bcd-DNA binding and chromatin accessibility in transgenic embryos expressing different concentrations of uniform Bcd protein. These data reveal distinct classes of DNA targets that differ in their sensitivity to Bcd concentration. We find that these classes differ both in the DNA binding motifs that they contain and in their local chromatin accessibility. We also find that Bcd influences the accessibility of a subset of its target enhancers, primarily at highly concentration-sensitive enhancers that drive gene expression in the anterior of the embryo. This leads us to a model in which target enhancers throughout the genome have a broad range of sensitivities for Bcd protein, and can therefore respond to a range of Bcd concentrations along the gradient. However, rather than arising from differences in Bcd binding site composition, these in vivo interactions are chromatin context-dependent, and Bcd influences the chromatin structure of its target enhancers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bicoid target gene expression boundaries are influenced by other patterning factors, but its physical interaction with DNA targets is not</title><p>To investigate the mechanism whereby Bcd functions to pattern the AP axis, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to determine the genome-wide binding profile of Bcd to its targets.

This cassette is flanked by FRT sites. The <italic>sqh</italic> 3'UTR lies downstream of the FRT cassette. Flies expressing this version of the transgene can be identified by RFP expression in their eyes, and females produce embryos in which Bcd is distributed in a gradient. Males from this transgenic stock are crossed to females expressing a heat shock inducible flippase (<italic>hsFLP)</italic>, and heat shocking the F1 larvae results in recombination and excision of the cassette at the FRT sites, bringing the <italic>sqh</italic> 3'UTR directly downstream of the <italic>bcd</italic> coding sequence. This initially results in mosaic F1 flies with a mosaic graded/uniform Bcd germline.

We therefore tested whether loss of the posterior and terminal systems (<italic>nos</italic> and <italic>tsl</italic>) would alter the Bcd ChIP-seq profile. We used the statistical package EdgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) to test for differential Bcd binding between wild-type and <italic>nos tsl</italic> embryos and found that we could not detect any significant change in binding at any of these 1027 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, although the expression domains of Bcd target genes are ultimately influenced by inputs from other AP patterning systems, the physical interaction of Bcd with DNA occurs independently of other maternal AP patterning inputs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Embryos expressing bcd uniformly show developmental fates reflecting the concentration of bcd</title><p>We set out to test whether incremental changes in Bcd concentration along the gradient can be read out directly at the level of binding to target enhancers. Due to the graded distribution of Bcd, each nucleus along the AP axis is exposed to a different concentration of the protein. To measure the Bcd binding state at individual concentrations, we performed ChIP-seq on embryos expressing Bcd at single, uniform concentrations in every nucleus along the AP axis. Several previous studies have included genetic manipulations in which the Bcd gradient has been flattened to assess its activity independently of its distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Driever and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1988a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Löhr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ochoa-Espinosa et al., 2009</xref>). However, genetically disrupting the gradient does not result in a total flattening, and transgenic approaches to date have not allowed for precise and reproducible control over the level of expression of the flattened Bcd. We therefore generated transgenic lines expressing GFP tagged Bcd in which the endogenous 3’UTR responsible for graded localization is flanked by FRT sites that allow it to be replaced with the unlocalized <italic>spaghetti squash</italic> 3’UTR. To generate different expression levels of uniform Bcd, we coupled transgenes to different maternally active promoters that yield embryos in which individual uniform Bcd concentration approximates single positions along the gradient (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To determine the expression levels of the uniform lines, we imaged GFP fluorescence in live embryos expressing either uniform or graded GFP-Bcd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gregor et al., 2007a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The gene expression patterning we observe in the presence of uniform Bcd likely results from the activity of additional maternal patterning cues (<italic>nanos</italic> and <italic>torso</italic>) as well as interactions between the Bcd target genes themselves. The concentration-dependent activity of uniform Bcd is also apparent in cuticle preparations of embryos expressing the transgenic constructs. The transgenic constructs specify increasingly anterior structures along larval body plan as the concentration of Bcd increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These effects on the body plan indicate that the uniform Bcd transgenes can specify cell fates that reflect their relative expression levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Bcd binding to genomic targets is concentration dependent</title><p>We next determined genome-wide Bcd binding profiles at each individual concentration by ChIP-seq and used these measurements to assign each of the 1027 peak regions to classes distinguished by their degree of concentration-dependent Bcd binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Concentration-Sensitive II peaks (n = 138) are significantly reduced in binding at the lowest Bcd level compared to either the medium or the high levels. Finally, Concentration-Sensitive I peaks (n = 152) are significantly reduced in binding at both the medium and the low Bcd levels compared to the highest level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These different groups suggest that Bcd binds differentially to its targets at specific concentrations, and furthermore that certain subsets of these targets are bound only in anterior nuclei whereas others are bound broadly across the entire AP axis.</p><p>Although 63 out of 66 previously characterized Bcd-dependent enhancers are identified in our ChIP peaks, the majority of the 1027 peaks identified have not been extensively examined. Within the set of known Bcd targets, there is strong correlation between position of expression and the associated Bcd sensitivity class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To extend this observation to previously uncharacterized Bcd targets, we queried the Fly Enhancer resource generated from the Vienna Tile GAL4 reporter library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kvon et al., 2014</xref>). The Fly Enhancer collection is a library of candidate enhancer DNA fragments (Tiles) driving expression of GAL4 that covers 13.5% of the non-coding genome. Each Tile’s expression pattern has been measured and scored by developmental stage. A total of 293 Tiles overlap with at least one peak in our data set. Of these, 163 drive gene expression in stage 4–6 (which includes NC14), and these active Tiles overlap with a total of 151 (14.7%) of the Bcd-peaks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The remaining overlapping Tiles either are active later in development (75), or are not functional (55). The fraction of the 293 Tiles that overlap with Bcd peaks and are active during early development (163, or 55.6%) is significantly higher than the proportion of Tiles active in early embryos for the collection as a whole (666 of the total 7793 or 8.5%). This suggests that the Bcd binding peaks are significantly enriched for enhancer activity, and that a similar fraction of the remaining 793 Bcd peaks not present in the Fly Enhancer collection may correspond to active enhancers as well.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28275.008</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Number of overlapping Bcd ChIP peaks and Vienna Tile-GAL4 enhancer reporters.</title><p>Note that some Bcd peaks overlap with more than one Vienna Tile, and vice versa.

Of these overlapping peaks, 52% overlap with Tiles active at stage 4–6, a smaller fraction than observed for the other peak classes which range from 73% to 77% (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).

In vitro, Bcd binds with high affinity to the consensus 5'-TCTAATCCC-3', and that variations on this consensus sequence constitute weak binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Driever and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Driever et al., 1989</xref>). If the affinity of a given enhancer for Bcd were encoded primarily at the level of its DNA sequence, we would expect to see a higher representation of strong Bcd binding sites in the less sensitive classes, and weaker sites in the more sensitive classes. To test this, we performed de novo motif discovery using the RSAT peak-motifs algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thomas-Chollier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">2008</xref>). We identified the top motifs in the entire Bcd ChIP peak list, ranked by their e-value, and found that the top three most highly ranked motifs were the consensus binding site for the proposed pioneer factor Zelda (Zld) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">ten Bosch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Renzis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nien et al., 2011</xref>), and a strong (TAATCC) and weak (TAAGCC) Bcd binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next calculated the frequency with which these motifs appear in each peak, and tested for enrichment between sensitivity classes by permutation test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We found that despite their failure to bind Bcd at low concentrations, the Concentration-Sensitive I and II classes are enriched for both the strong and weak Bcd sites relative to the peak set as a whole. The Concentration-Sensitive III class did not contain an enrichment of any site over the total peak set. The Concentration-Insensitive class, however, showed a higher prevalence of the Zld binding site relative to the total peak set than any other class.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ochoa-Espinosa et al. (2005)</xref> found little correlation between either the number or strength of Bcd binding sites in an enhancer and the position of gene expression driven by that enhancer. Given our result that the Concentration-Sensitive I and II classes drive expression primarily in the anterior of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the higher density of Bcd binding sites in these peaks indicates that there is, in fact, a correlation between the binding site number and position of gene expression. This difference likely reflects the larger sample size used in our study, as well as our method for classifying Bcd bound peaks. However, in contrast to a binding site affinity model for Bcd function, Bcd targets that behave as concentration-sensitive and -insensitive in vivo are not distinguished by their representation of strong versus weak Bcd binding sites, partially confirming the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ochoa-Espinosa et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In further support of this concept, we found little correlation between in vitro binding affinity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and the in vivo binding properties we observe by ChIP for a selected subset of peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). At the level of sequence composition, they instead appear to differ in their balance of Bcd and Zld binding sites. Although both strong and weak Bcd sites and Zld sites are enriched in the Bcd ChIP peaks as a whole, there is a bias toward both Bcd sites in peaks that show concentration-sensitive binding properties by ChIP-seq and a bias toward Zld sites in the concentration-insensitive peaks. Zld, a ubiquitously expressed early embryonic transcription factor, has been implicated in chromatin remodeling prior to zygotic genome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). The predominance of Zld motifs over Bcd motifs in the Concentration-Insensitive class suggests that in vivo chromatin structure also plays a role in the sensitivity of a given target to transcription factor concentration in the context of the developing embryo. Taken together, these findings suggest that the chromatin context of an enhancer may play a greater role in its overall affinity for a transcription factor in vivo than the sequences of the binding sites that it contains. We therefore set out to test the hypothesis that sensitivity classes are distinguished at the level of chromatin structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Bcd is required for chromatin accessibility at a subset of concentration-sensitive target sites</title><p>To measure genome-wide patterns of chromatin accessibility and nucleosome positioning, we performed ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>) on single wild-type embryos precisely staged at 12 min after the onset of NC14, and identified 13,266 peaks of chromatin accessibility (see Materials and methods).

The contrast between predicted occupancy and observed depletion suggests that these regions are actively restructured for Bcd and other transcription factors to bind. The increased nucleosome preference of the more Concentration-Sensitive peaks, combined with the observation that these sites become occupied by nucleosomes in <italic>bcd</italic> mutants suggests a model where Bcd, either directly or in combination with cofactors is able to direct chromatin remodeling events, which may play a significant role in distinguishing concentration-sensitive and -insensitive targets. Additionally, we find that Bcd-bound regions that are dependent on either Zld or Bcd for their accessibility are more likely to have a higher nucleosome preference than regions that are independent of both factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

We hypothesize that Bcd renders its target sites accessible either by competing with nucleosomes to access its binding sites and bind to DNA at high concentrations or by recruiting chromatin-remodeling enzymes to accessible motifs and subsequently driving local nucleosome remodeling to render more sites accessible. We reasoned that if Bcd can displace nucleosomes simply by competing with them for access to its binding sites, it should be possible for the Bcd DNA-binding homeodomain to compete. However, if Bcd instead drives remodeling via recruitment of cofactors, it is likely that these interactions or activities are carried out through regions of the protein outside of the DNA binding domain. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we designed a transgenic GFP-Bcd construct that is truncated downstream of the homeodomain.

We identified the Zld binding sites in the <italic>caudal</italic> enhancer sequence and mutated them to Bcd binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These mutations result in a shift of <italic>caudal</italic> reporter expression to the anterior of the embryo. Anterior expression of the mutated reporter is Bcd dependent, as it is lost in <italic>bcd</italic> mutant embryos. Importantly, the mutant enhancer is functional in <italic>zld</italic> mutant embryos, retaining a distinct anterior expression domain.

By replacing Zld motifs with Bcd motifs, the enhancer retains functionality, but the spatial domains of expression are now restricted to regions of high Bcd concentration. While technical limitations prevented us from measuring chromatin accessibility of the reporter constructs directly, these results are consistent with a model where Bcd operates at high concentrations to confer chromatin accessibility at target sites. Previous work has demonstrated that addition of Zld sites to an inactive DNA fragment (HC_45) can transform it into an enhancer that drives gene expression early in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2014</xref>).

The overrepresentation of enhancers for anteriorly expressed target genes in the more sensitive classes provides support for the classic French flag model, as their enhancers are only capable of binding Bcd at high levels. However, motif analysis and in vitro EMSA experiments reveal that the differences in binding affinities that we observe in vivo cannot be explained entirely by the sequence of Bcd binding sites in the target enhancers. Instead we find that a subset of the enhancers in the concentration-sensitive classes require Bcd for chromatin accessibility. Taken together, this leads us to model in which the Bcd morphogen establishes concentration thresholds along the AP axis of the developing embryo by driving opening chromatin states at high concentrations, thereby gaining access to its most sensitive target enhancers. At lower concentrations in more posterior nuclei, Bcd is unable to access these enhancers, and therefore does not bind and activate their transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In this way, expression of these concentration-sensitive target genes is restricted to anterior regions of the embryo. The higher density of Bcd binding sites in highly concentration-sensitive target enhancers (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) suggests that these targets may require a larger number of Bcd molecules to be bound at a given time to keep them free of nucleosomes and accessible to the additional regulatory factors.

In our model Bcd establishes these initial patterns not by competing with its own target genes, but with default nucleosome positions in the early embryo. We predict that this initial interaction with chromatin is an essential event for establishing distinct, positionally defined patterns of gene expression. The chromatin landscapes established early by Bcd are then elaborated upon by additional patterning factors, including Bcd target genes themselves, as well as the repressor gradients proposed by Chen, <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2012</xref>) Thus, the pre-transcriptional information presented by Bcd in the form of differential binding states is refined at the level of gene expression domains both by Bcd and other transcription factors active in the early embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Relationship of bicoid and Zelda at Bicoid-bound enhancers</title><p>The prominence of the Zld binding motif in the Bcd-bound ChIP peaks and ATAC-seq in <italic>zld</italic> mutants reveals that Zld also contributes to the accessibility of Bcd targets in the genome, in part at those targets that are not dependent on Bcd for their accessibility (61/1,027 peaks are dependent on both Bcd and Zld for accessibility). Zld is therefore likely to be one component that influences the accessibility and therefore the apparent in vivo affinity of the peaks that are bound by Bcd but insensitive to its local concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Indeed, it has been demonstrated that Zld can extend the effective range of the dorsal-ventral morphogen Dorsal and aid in establishing concentration thresholds and interpreting the gradient at low concentrations, while the requirement for Zld is less significant at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nien et al., 2011</xref>). Previous work has also suggested that Zld contributes to activation of target genes at low concentrations of Bcd protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), and a recent study demonstrated optically that in the absence of Zld, Bcd occupancy on chromatin in the posterior of the embryo is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mir et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>These studies, in combination with the work presented here, allow us to predict that transforming a concentration-sensitive Bcd target enhancer into a Zld dependent enhancer would increase the accessibility and therefore the sensitivity of that region in vivo.

The reporter construct used to demonstrate this effect (HC_45) is identified as a Concentration-Sensitive I target in our study. We posit that the increase in gene expression from this reporter observed in their work is the result of increasing the accessibility of the enhancer region. Interestingly, adding four additional Bcd sites to this reporter also activates anterior gene expression. This suggests that at high concentrations, Bcd's activity is similar to Zld.</p><p>Alternately, when we replace Zld sites with Bcd sites in an enhancer that drives posterior expression, the expression domain shifts to the anterior of the embryo. This demonstrates that without Zld to keep the enhancer open in posterior nuclei, activation of the reporter gene becomes entirely dependent on Bcd, effectively shifting this reporter from a concentration-insensitive to concentration-sensitive enhancer. This finding fits with both previously reported findings and the model proposed in our study. Namely, that Zld contributes to the accessibility of Bcd target genes throughout the embryo, while high levels of Bcd can drive accessibility independently and activate gene expression at a subset of targets in the anterior of the embryo.</p><p>The reduced binding by a truncated Bcd protein at the most concentration-sensitive targets indicates that Bcd does not displace nucleosomes by simply by competing for binding to genomic targets, but rather that the C-terminus of the Bcd protein is required for accessing its nucleosome-associated DNA targets. Previous work has shown that various domains of the Bcd protein are required for interactions with both co-activators and co-repressors. The N-terminus of Bcd is required for interactions with components of the Sin3A/HDAC repressor complex, and these interactions are proposed to play a role in reducing Bcd's transcriptional activation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhu et al., 2001</xref>). Multiple Bcd domains, including the C-terminus, are required for interaction with CREB-binding protein (CBP), which has histone acetyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fu and Ma, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2004</xref>). It is possible that in our truncated Bcd construct, this interaction with CBP is disrupted. As CBP is thought to play a role in increasing chromatin accessibility for transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan and La Thangue, 2001</xref>), the loss of this interaction could lead to the reduced binding to sensitive targets that we observe in embryos with truncated Bcd. The targets that we have classified as concentration-insensitive do not depend on Bcd to establish an open chromatin state. This suggests that these sites are opened by other chromatin remodeling factors, or are inherently more likely to be nucleosome-free based on their underlying sequence.</p><p>It has previously been suggested that transcription factors can compete with nucleosomes for access to their DNA binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mirny, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). This could occur through cooperative binding to nucleosome-associated enhancers: if one Bcd molecule could gain access to a binding site that was protected by a nucleosome, it could recruit additional Bcd protein molecules to bind to nearby sites and occlude nucleosome binding. This cooperativity would require a high concentration of Bcd protein, fitting with our observation that Bcd influences accessibility more strongly at high concentrations. However, our experiments with a truncated Bcd protein reveal that Bcd cannot bind to its most sensitive targets without its C-terminal domains. As many of the residues that have been implicated in cooperative binding reside in the Bcd homeodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burz and Hanes, 2001</xref>), we would expect this truncated Bcd to bind cooperatively. This finding therefore supports a model in which Bcd is actively remodeling chromatin, either directly or more likely by interacting with chromatin remodeling factors through its C-terminus.</p><p>As a maternally supplied factor, Bcd provides one of the first cues to the break the symmetry of the embryonic body plan. Our results suggest that this symmetry breaking occurs first at the level of chromatin accessibility, as Bcd drives the opening of its most concentration-sensitive target enhancers in anterior nuclei. Another maternal factor, Zld, is proposed to act as a pioneer factor at early embryonic enhancers with a high intrinsic nucleosome barrier. By binding to these enhancers, Zld depletes them of nucleosomes and allows patterning transcription factors to bind and activate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). We have demonstrated here that Bcd influences the accessibility primarily of its concentration-sensitive targets, which also exhibit a high predicted nucleosome barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This raises the possibility that Bcd may be exhibiting pioneer-like activity at high concentrations, driving accessibility of these sites prior to transcriptional activation. It is unlikely that Bcd is unique in its ability to influence the local chromatin accessibility of its targets. Recent work in mouse embryos has shown that another homeodomain transcription factor, Cdx2, influences the chromatin accessibility of its targets during posterior axial elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amin et al., 2016</xref>). It will therefore be of interest to assess whether other developmental transcription factors can drive accessibility of their genomic targets while the chromatin state of the genome is being remodeled during early development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Model organism</title><p>All reported experiments were performed on embryos from transgenic and mutant variants of the Fruit Fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (NCBI Taxon 7227).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Fly stocks and Genetics</title><p><italic>bcd</italic> mutants refers to embryos derived from <italic>bcd<sup>E1</sup></italic> homozygous mothers.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Concentration Dependent Chromatin States Induced by the Bicoid Morphogen Gradient&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript shows a strong dataset demonstrating that Bicoid influences chromatin accessibility in a concentration-dependent manner, and that Bcd can act as a pioneer factor when at high concentrations. Using fly embryos engineered to uniformly express high, medium, and low levels of Bcd protein, the authors identified four classes of Bcd bound regions, with Concentration-Sensitive I and II classes bound only by high and high/medium levels of Bcd, respectively, driving anterior expression of candidate enhancer fragments, enriched for Bcd motifs, and highly represented in Bcd-dependent chromatin accessibility regions. Concentration-Sensitive III class peaks were bound stronger by high/medium levels of Bcd but lower by low levels of Bcd, driving broad expression of candidate enhancer fragments, not enriched for the transcription factor Zelda (Zld) or Bcd motifs, and not quite dependent on Bcd for chromatin accessibility. Concentration-Insensitive class peaks were bound equally well by all levels of Bcd, driving posterior expression of candidate enhancer fragments, highly enriched for Zld motifs, and not dependent on Bcd for chromatin accessibility. The authors found that the presence and/or the strength of Bcd motifs do not account for in vivo sensitivity to Bcd concentration, as predicted by the binding site affinity threshold model for morphogen function. Rather, the Bcd morphogen gradient is read at the level of chromatin accessibility, established at Bcd concentration-sensitive targets primarily and perhaps even independently by high levels of Bcd, and at concentration-insensitive targets by factors like Zld. The authors further demonstrated using a C-terminus truncated Bcd that the ability of high levels of Bcd to drive chromatin accessibility at concentration-sensitive targets is likely through co-factor recruitment, rather than Bcd cooperative binding. Finally, they turn a Zld dependent target enhancer into a Bcd high level target by changing Zld binding sites into Bcd binding sites thereby increasing the number of Bcd binding sites, and suggest that high levels of Bcd can confer chromatin accessibility.</p><p>Overall, the paper supports the model put forth, whereby Bcd itself, acting through different classes of genomic binding sites differentially sensitive of Bcd concentration, can create a regulatory logic that delivers spatio-specific regulation of its targets.</p><p>Although the study was well designed and performed, the reviewers ask that the authors address several criticisms as outlined below.</p><p>1) The manuscript was difficult to follow at times. For Bcd aficionados it may be easier, but for the more general audience of <italic>eLife</italic>, it might be difficult to read, not only because of the many typos, but the jargon and flow. Examples are: a) What does &quot;strong Bcd gradient&quot; mean? b) Introduction, third paragraph, first sentence: The two phrases seem disconnected. Also, the last sentence of this paragraph could also use some word changes to be more logical; perhaps &quot;Therefore&quot; instead of &quot;However&quot; would flow better. c) A transition is missing between the last two paragraphs of the Introduction. Why is the employed approach better than computational predictions and in vitro measurements? The logic is not obvious. d) Introduction, last paragraph: The use of the word &quot;enhancer&quot; is vague and somewhat misleading. The data reveal distinct classes of Bcd targets not necessarily enhancers. However, further down when referring to the model, it seems appropriate to use &quot;target enhancers.&quot;</p><p>2) First section in Results is titled: &quot;Bicoid target gene…other maternal factors, but is physical interaction is not”. Change &quot;maternal&quot; to &quot;patterning&quot; since Bcd binding is changed in zelda mutants (Xu et al., 2014).</p><p>3) With regard to &quot;enhancers whose expression patterns span broadly across the AP axis&quot; – where is the data to support this statement. How many of the 1027 Bcd peaks do these enhancers you speak of comprise – 10 or 100? It is unclear if the following section, are the three specific targets supposed to represent these enhancers? It is not clear because the transition is poor between these paragraphs. Nevertheless, please show the data that led to this conclusion that peaks &quot;overall associate with enhancers[…]&quot;</p><p>4) The terminology used in the Results (and elsewhere) is incorrect. &quot;the <italic>kni</italic> posterior enhancer is not expressed&quot; – enhancers are not expressed, genes are expressed; enhancers drive expression. By the way, which enhancer is driving the strong expression seen in the <italic>bcd hb nos tsl</italic> embryo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> bottom right? Why is there such a discrepancy between this embryo and the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> where expression appears lower? Please sort this out.</p><p>5) In general, the term &quot;enhancer&quot; is used too loosely in this paper and it is advised that the authors change this. For example, in the last sentence of the second paragraph of the subsection “Bcd binding to genomic targets is concentration dependent” the use of &quot;enhancer&quot; (twice) is premature because it isn't until the following paragraph where a correlation between Bcd peaks and known enhancers is discussed.</p><p>6) In the third paragraph of the subsection “Bcd binding to genomic targets is concentration dependent”, of the 163 Vienna enhancers that are active in stage 4-6, how many are expressed in a discrete AP domain? I could not find this information and it should be included. Also, why don't all 163 candidate enhancers overlap with a Bcd peak if the 293 overlap with at least one Bcd peak. Also, it is unclear how &quot;77.2%&quot; was derived. 163/293 = 55.6. Please clarify.</p><p>7) The statement, &quot;we find no evidence that the Bcd sensitivity classes are predominantly defined by repressive interactions.&quot; It is worrysome that the authors are making a sweeping statement when there are clearly Concentration-Sensitive I enhancers that bind repressors, in addition to those shown by Chen et al. (2012). For example, anterior <italic>Gt</italic> and <italic>Kr</italic> are not in the same expression domain, which is not in align with the statement in the last paragraph of the subsection “Bcd binding to genomic targets is concentration dependent”, and <italic>Kr</italic> was found enriched in Concentration-Sensitive I peaks that include the <italic>Gt</italic> anterior enhancer. Though it is brave to conclude from the data presented that Bcd sensitivity class gene expression domains are not defined by repressors, it seems dangerous because so many AP gene domains that have been well studied are defined by repressor interactions. Is it possible that enrichment for specific repressors was not seen because your group of peaks contains peaks that are not real Bcd target enhancers and thus the real ones get diluted out?</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref> and B that Concentration-Sensitive III peaks are enriched in pol II binding and the Dref motif, which is a type of promoter element. Also, it is not clear why the BDTNP Bcd peaks were not enriched in Concentration-Sensitive III peaks even though they are in this study. I'm somewhat confused by these peaks – on the one had they appear to be at promoters (versus enhancers), which might bind Bcd promiscuously because they are so open, but on the other hand they have Bcd binding sites. At any rate, it would be important to show more examples of the genes associated with Concentration-Sensitive III peaks and what happens to their expression in bcd mutants, starting with the two mentioned, <italic>cnc</italic> and <italic>hkb</italic>. Also, importantly, it should be shown how many of the peaks in each class are near a TSS (within 500 bp). Do they differ?</p><p>9) Text in the first paragraph of the subsection “Sequence composition of ChIP sensitivity classes does not account for in vivo sensitivity to Bcd concentration” is confusing. The authors say their results are not in agreement with those of Ochoa-Espinosa et al. (2005) study, but then in the next paragraph they say their results confirm theirs. Please rewrite for clarity.</p><p>10) When demonstrating the relationship between Zld and Bcd at Bcd-bound regions, the authors claimed that &quot;Zld-dependent peaks are distributed across each sensitivity class determined by ChIP, with no particular class being significantly more Zld dependent,&quot; thus Zld &quot;is unlikely to determine the differential concentration sensitivity of Bcd peaks as a whole.&quot; This should be examined more closely. How many of the 855 Bcd peaks that overlap with ATAC open regions overlap with Zld binding? How many of the 402 Bcd peaks with reduced accessibility in <italic>zld-</italic> overlap with Zld binding? How many ATAC-seq peaks overlap with Zld binding? The authors are advised to show Zld binding, Zld motifs, and Bcd motifs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and/or provide additional analysis separating the four classes into those bound by Zld and not bound by/bound by low levels of Zld. Does the conclusion change, e.g., is any Bcd peak class significantly more Zld dependent? If so, this must be added.</p><p>11) Structure function studies (protein deletion mutant here) are often difficult to assess because it is unclear whether the structure, and thus function, of the remaining protein (in this case the homeodomain), not just its presence, is unchanged, which is beyond the scope of this experiment. Therefore, the authors should qualify their conclusion by adding something like &quot;assuming the structure of the homeodomain remains completely intact…&quot;</p><p>12) The authors showed that a Concentration-Insensitive target caudal (cad), whose chromatin accessibility is Zld-dependent and Bcd-independent, can be converted to a Bcd concentration-sensitive target at anterior region by mutating Zld motifs into Bcd motifs. The authors reasoned that high Bcd levels in anterior regions conferred chromatin accessibility to the transgene. If Bcd-dependent chromatin accessibility at regions with high levels of Bcd is the key to its target expression, the authors should provide additional data to show that Bcd binds stronger to Cad (Zld-&gt;Bcd)-GAL4 than to Cad-GAL4 in both wt and <italic>zld-</italic> embryos; 2) that accessibility increases when adding Bcd sites (in the absence of Zld sites); and 3) though elaborate, adding Bcd sites to HC-45 instead of Zld sites should render the enhancer active if Bcd can pioneer chromatin.</p><p>13) Discussion of model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. The idea that in regions where morphogen levels are low, Zld is required to boost activity has been proposed for both Dl and Bcd (Nien et al., 2011). Likewise, that morphogens at high levels can access and activate their high-level targets mostly on their own has also been discussed (same paper). This study corroborates and advances those ideas very nicely, and this should be mentioned.</p><p>14) The authors should move the last sentence of the paper “This may be a common property of developmental transcription factors that must gain early access <italic>to</italic> their target enhancers while the chromatin state of the genome is being remodeled during large scale transitions in the gene regulatory landscape.” to the Abstract.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Concentration Dependent Chromatin States Induced by the Bicoid Morphogen Gradient&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We could move the Supplementary experiment to the main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, but would prefer to keep it in the Supplement.

Overall we agree that this analysis does not advance the concepts in the manuscript. We did not make it a main figure in the paper for this reason, and one possibility would be to remove the figure and corresponding argument entirely from the last paragraph of the subsection “Bcd binding to genomic targets is concentration dependent”. We would appreciate advice from the reviewers on this point.</p><p>Reviewer's answer: Please delete the corresponding argument from the last paragraph of the subsection “Bcd binding to genomic targets is concentration dependent”, rather than keeping the new paragraph because it isn't much better with the single repressor focus.</p><p>3) Regarding the assays on cad and HC45 reporters: The major limitation to measuring chromatin accessibility or performing ChIP on reporter constructs (as suggested in experiments 1 and 2 for our cad reporters) is that the measurements must be able to distinguish between the transgenic (reporter) and endogenous (wild-type) copies of the regulatory element in question.</p><p>Reviewer's answer: While it is possible to distinguish transgenic from endogenous enhancers by having one primer in the reporter sequence (GAL4), which is likely within ChIPed fragments, and one inside the enhancer (as in Xu et al., 2014 for Bcd ChIP on HC45), it is not necessary pursuing this venue at this point.</p><p>With regard to the new HC45 data, the discussion about endogenous HC45 being accessible whether active or not and with or without Zld or Bcd is interesting, though it is formerly possible that local chromatin at the transgene is not behaving the same way as endogenous.

For Bcd aficionados it may be easier, but for the more general audience of eLife, it might be difficult to read, not only because of the many typos, but the jargon and flow. Examples are: a) What does &quot;strong Bcd gradient&quot; mean? b) Introduction, third paragraph, first sentence: The two phrases seem disconnected. Also, the last sentence of this paragraph could also use some word changes to be more logical; perhaps &quot;Therefore&quot; instead of &quot;However&quot; would flow better. c) A transition is missing between the last two paragraphs of the Introduction. Why is the employed approach better than computational predictions and in vitro measurements? The logic is not obvious. d) Introduction, last paragraph: The use of the word &quot;enhancer&quot; is vague and somewhat misleading. The data reveal distinct classes of Bcd targets not necessarily enhancers. However, further down when referring to the model, it seems appropriate to use &quot;target enhancers.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have made changes throughout the revised manuscript (including those specifically listed in the point above) to make the manuscript more readable and easier to follow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) First section in Results is titled: &quot;Bicoid target gene…other maternal factors, but is physical interaction is not”.

For example, in the last sentence of the second paragraph of the subsection “Bcd binding to genomic targets is concentration dependent” the use of &quot;enhancer&quot; (twice) is premature because it isn't until the following paragraph where a correlation between Bcd peaks and known enhancers is discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed our use of &quot;enhancer&quot; throughout the revised manuscript in instances where it was used prematurely or inappropriately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the third paragraph of the subsection “Bcd binding to genomic targets is concentration dependent”, of the 163 Vienna enhancers that are active in stage 4-6, how many are expressed in a discrete AP domain?

The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> suggest that while repressors interact with Bcd targets in each class, it is not clear from the binding data that these repressors determine the concentration sensitivity of the Bcd ChIP classes. If, for example, Runt were responsible for setting the posterior boundaries of anterior Bcd targets, we would expect enrichment for Runt binding in the Concentration-Sensitive I and II classes, which we do not observe. That was the point we were trying to make. However, we agree that the data are not entirely clear, and difficult to interpret. Overall we agree that this analysis does not advance the concepts in the manuscript. We did not make it a main figure in the paper for this reason, and one possibility would be to remove the figure and corresponding argument entirely from the revised manuscript.

Also, importantly, it should be shown how many of the peaks in each class are near a TSS (within 500 bp). Do they differ?</p></disp-quote><p>There are several possible reasons why our Bcd ChIP peak list differs from the BDTNP peaks.</p><p>First, in the manuscript, we compared our ChIP-seq data to BDTNP ChIP-chip data. Second, the BDTNP data were collected from roughly staged embryos (2-3 hour staging), using two replicates per antibody (MacArthur et al., 2009). Our embryos are more carefully staged and limited to early NC14. Third, we used different criteria to select our peaks. After performing the ChIP-seq experiments, we selected the most reproducible peaks across 8 replicates to generate the peak list. We selected these peaks using the Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) approach used by modENCODE to measure reproducibility between genomic datasets, as detailed in the Materials and methods. We are therefore using a different significance threshold to determine which peaks we include in our list, and this approach is different than the FDR ranking used for the BDTNP ChIP data (MacArthur et al., 2009). As such, we expect to generate a list of peaks that differs from theirs. However, as all of the peaks included in our list are highly reproducible across replicates, we are confident that our dataset allows accurate identification of real Bcd peaks at this stage of development. Overall, the Concentration-Sensitive I and II classes had higher ChIP signals than the Concentration-Sensitive III and Insensitive peaks, so these peaks were less likely to be detected in the BDTNP data. Although we acknowledge that some proportion of these types of peaks could be artifacts due to high accessibility, we have filtered our peaks by ATAC-seq accessibility score to mitigate this issue (described in the Materials and methods).</p><p>With respect to the proximity of these peaks to promoters, many early developmental genes have cis-regulatory elements in close proximity to their promoters, for example hunchback P2. It is therefore not clear whether proximity to a promoter rules out a peak as an enhancer, or predicts whether TF binding will be functional. We have added an additional table to the manuscript indicating the number peaks in each class overlapping with Vienna Tile-GAL4 reporters active at stage 4-6 and within 500 bp of a TSS. In both cases there are interesting differences between the sensitivity classes, and these differences are now discussed in the text.</p><p>Gene expression patterns for the Concentration Sensitive III members <italic>hkb</italic> and <italic>cnc</italic> have been previously published and shown to be sensitive to Bcd. In <italic>bcd<sup>E1</sup></italic> mutants, expression of <italic>cnc</italic> is lost (Löhr et al., 2009), while anterior <italic>hobo</italic> expression is confined to a smaller expression domain.

Does the conclusion change, e.g., is any Bcd peak class significantly more Zld dependent? If so, this must be added.</p></disp-quote><p>Using a published list of Zld ChIP-seq peaks (Harrison et al., 2011), we find that 732 of our Bcd ChIP peaks (71.3%) overlap with Zld peaks. Interestingly, despite the higher representation of Zld motifs in the less sensitive classes, the peaks in the more sensitive classes (I and II) actually overlap with more Zld ChIP peaks:</p><p>Sensitive I = 125 (82.2%) Zld bound</p><p>Sensitive II = 113 (81.9%) Zld bound</p><p>Sensitive III = 396 (66.8%) Zld bound</p><p>Insensitive = 97 (67.8%) Zld bound</p><p>However, in terms of Zld dependence, the more relevant feature is whether a peak is open or closed in the absence of Zld. By this metric, none of the peak classes are significantly overrepresented in the Zld dependent group. A barplot showing enrichment of each class in the Zld dependent peaks has been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, alongside the plot of Bcd dependent peaks. We have also added a supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) showing overlap between Zld and Bcd ChIP peaks and comparisons of Bcd and Zld dependence (as defined by ATAC-seq) between Bcd peaks that are bound or not bound by Zld. These comparisons show that while there is a greater enrichment of Zld binding at the Concentration Sensitive I and II classes, only the Concentration Insensitive class shows a (slight) enrichment for Zld dependence when the classes are separated into those bound and not bound by Zld.</p><p>Of all ATAC-seq peaks that are open at NC14, 5182 (39.2%) overlap with Zld ChIP peaks.</p><p>However, only 2675 (20.2%) are dependent upon Zld for accessibility (closed in <italic>zld<sup>–</sup></italic> embryos).

However, these experiments present significant technical issues, as described in detail below. Experiment 3 was performed, and confirms the hypothesis that addition of Bcd sites to HC45 renders the enhancer “active”. We will discuss experiment 3 first, followed by our attempt at experiments 1 and 2.</p><p>To perform experiment 3, we generated three HC45 transgenic reporter lines (wild-type, +4 Zld sites, +4 Bcd sites). We used the HC45 wild-type and +4 Zld site sequences reported in Xu et al., 2014, and introduced 4 Bcd sites at the same positions used to make the +4 Zld site reporter to make the new +4 Bcd site reporter. We replicated the previously reported result, that HC45 is inactive in blastoderm embryos, and that adding 4 Zld sites confers activity to the reporter. Similar to addition of Zld sites, addition of Bcd sites also confers activity to the reporter (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We performed this experiment at the suggestion of the reviewers, and are encouraged by the positive result, but we have some reservations about whether this provides stronger evidence of “pioneering” activity than our prior results with the cad enhancer. HC45, while inactive in blastoderm embryos, has open chromatin at this stage according to our ATAC data. The wildtype sequence has one Zld binding site, and seven Bcd binding sites. HC45 requires neither Zld (as cad does) nor Bcd for chromatin accessibility, in the sense that it retains chromatin accessibility in embryos maternally mutant for either factor. As such, it is unclear what drives the phenomenon of HC45 “acquiring activity” upon addition of Zld or Bcd sites. By analogy to the hsp70 system, where GAGA-factor pioneers the acquisition of open chromatin, thus allowing HSF to interact with binding sites and activate transcription, it would appear that neither Zld nor Bcd are operating like a pioneer (GAGA-factor), and are instead possibly functioning like transcriptional activators (HSF). On the other hand, we cannot rule out that addition of Zld or Bcd binding sites further enhances chromatin accessibility at HC45, or drives remodeling of chromatin to favor an ‘active’ versus an ‘inactive’ state. To address such questions, we would need to be able to measure differences in binding state and chromatin accessibility at these reporters (as suggested in experiments 1 and 2 above), and as described below, this is technically difficult. For these reasons, we have chosen to incorporate this new result with HC45 only as a supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>The major limitation to measuring chromatin accessibility or performing ChIP on reporter constructs (as suggested in experiments 1 and 2 for our cad reporters) is that the measurements must be able to distinguish between the transgenic (reporter) and endogenous (wild-type) copies of the regulatory element in question. This effectively limits our analysis to fragments of DNA that we can distinguish by SNPs. To pursue this, we sequenced the cad enhancer in genomic DNA preps from single adult flies, from every possible genetic background that would be present in the flies used in this experiment. The reporter constructs were generated by injecting plasmid DNA into flies with an attp2 landing site and then crossed to white females to isolate transformants. <italic>zld</italic> germline clones were produced by crossing <italic>zld<sup>294</sup></italic>/FM7 females to C(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>)Dx/<italic>ovo<sup>D</sup></italic> males. By sequencing genomic DNA from each of these genotypes and comparing it to our cad enhancer reporter sequences, we identified only one SNP that was present in the reporters and absent in all other genotypes. We were therefore constrained to using this SNP to design primers for qPCR. We tested these primers on genomic DNA, and the result is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28275-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig><p>Primer set 1 amplifies a product using the &quot;wild-type&quot; or non-transgenic SNP, primer set 2 amplifies a product using the transgenic SNP, and primer set 3 amplifies a product in the cad enhancer that is identical between the wild-type and transgenic sequences. These primers were successful at distinguishing between the wild-type and transgenic SNP sequences in genomic DNA, as primer 2 only gives a product in DNA from a fly with the cad-GAL4 construct. Similar results were obtained by qPCR on intact genomic DNA.</p><p>A second technical limitation is how to effectively measure differences in chromatin accessibility at a single locus by a qPCR based assay that can leverage the presence of the SNP to distinguish between the transgenic and endogenous enhancer copies. ATAC-seq sample preparations are themselves not suitable for PCR-based quantification approaches due to the insertion of adapter sequences at the time of chromatin fragmentation at accessible sites. On the other hand, the feasibility of Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE)-qPCR has to our knowledge not been reported in the literature, but it is likely that samples prepared by the FAIRE-seq technique would remain compatible with qPCR analysis. We therefore pursued this possibility in order to address this question. We fixed and sorted embryos by stage, homogenized, and sonicated genomic DNA as described for ChIP-seq in the Materials and methods. Following sonication, we isolated soluble chromatin by phenol-chloroform extraction as described in (Simon et al., 2013). We tested the effectiveness of this approach using wild-type (Oregon-R) embryos, and qPCR primers that would give predictable results based on chromatin accessibility measured by ATAC-seq in this study. We used three optimized primer sets that amplify short regions around the hunchback coding sequence. These regions amplified by these primers should be highly accessible (hb ChIP2), accessible (hb ChIP2), and inaccessible (hb P2 +4) at nuclear cycle 14. A plot showing the enrichment of the qPCR products over an input chromatin sample is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>, and gave the expected results.</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28275-resp-fig4-v2"/></fig><p>This result was encouraging. To perform the requested experiment to measure accessibility at cad (WT) and cad(<italic>zld-</italic>&gt;<italic>bcd</italic>), we performed FAIRE on wild-type (white) embryos and embryos expressing either the cad-GAL4 or cad(<italic>zld-&gt;bcd</italic>)-GAL4 in either a wild-type or <italic>zld<sup>–</sup></italic> background. Unfortunately, when we performed the FAIRE experiment, the primers that effectively distinguish between the transgenic and endogenous cad enhancer in intact genomic DNA do not distinguish between the wild-type and transgenic alleles on a sheared DNA sample. Both the wild-type and transgenic primer sets gave a low signal compared to the highly accessible hb ChIP2 region, and are indistinguishable between embryos with and without the transgenic reporter:</p><fig id="respfig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28275-resp-fig5-v2"/></fig><p>Since we cannot even detect the transgene (or the endogenous copy) in a sheared DNA prep, and since we are limited to this single priming site to distinguish the alleles of this enhancer, we feel that we have exhausted our options for measuring the accessibility of the transgenic reporters directly, and are technically unable to address this point sufficiently.</p><p>Similarly, to measure differential binding of Bicoid to these reporters by ChIP (suggested experiment 1), we would be constrained by the same technical limitations as described for measuring chromatin accessibility via SNP based PCR. We emphasize that we recognize the potential power of such an experimental approach, but regrettably for this particular set of reporter constructs, despite our hardest efforts, we cannot address these questions within the limited time available for revision of this manuscript.</p><p>What is the most likely explanation for our results with the cad enhancer? Our data demonstrate that this enhancer is Zld-dependent, meaning that in <italic>zld</italic> mutant embryos, neither is the enhancer accessible, nor is the enhancer active. Suggested experiment 1 is designed to confirm an expected result, namely that adding Bcd sites results in greater Bcd binding in both wild-type and <italic>zld</italic> mutant embryos. This is likely to be the case. Suggested experiment 2 is designed to show the presumed positive correlation between chromatin accessibility and the activity state of the reporter construct. We are not aware of any documented example of an enhancer that shows activity without an accessible chromatin signature. Similar to the wild-type enhancer in <italic>zld</italic> mutant embryos, mutating the Zld motifs to a non-functional DNA sequence eliminates the activity of this enhancer in wild-type embryos (seeFigure 6—figure supplement 1A). When we instead convert the Zld motifs to Bcd motifs (Z-&gt;B), we recover enhancer activity, albeit in a different spatial pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The (Z-&gt;B) enhancer is active in <italic>zld</italic> mutants, and is now completely dependent on Bcd for activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In sum, we feel that it is highly likely that the recovery of activity of the Cad(Z-&gt;B) enhancer stems from Bcd-dependent acquisition of chromatin accessibility, and that the shift in the spatial pattern reflects the demonstrated concentration-dependence of this function of Bcd. It seems significantly less likely that the Cad(Z-&gt;B) enhancer would somehow recover activity without recovering chromatin accessibility within at least the anterior ~1/3 of the embryo. We have now qualified this conclusion in the manuscript text to reflect the key assumptions we have made here. We hope that this is a suitable compromise, given the strength of our results with the transgenic Cad (and HC45) reporters and the technical limitations described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Discussion of model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. The idea that in regions where morphogen levels are low, Zld is required to boost activity has been proposed for both Dl and Bcd (Nien et al., 2011). Likewise, that morphogens at high levels can access and activate their high-level targets mostly on their own has also been discussed (same paper). This study corroborates and advances those ideas very nicely, and this should be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been added to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The authors should move the last sentence of the paper “This may be a common property of developmental transcription factors that must gain early access to their target enhancers while the chromatin state of the genome is being remodeled during large scale transitions in the gene regulatory landscape.” to the Abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made this change in the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed reviewer concerns.

We would appreciate advice from the reviewers on this point.</p><p>Reviewer's answer: Please delete the corresponding argument from the last paragraph of the subsection “Bcd binding to genomic targets is concentration dependent”, rather than keeping the new paragraph because it isn't much better with the single repressor focus.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the discussion of the BDTNP repressor binding is not a valuable addition to the manuscript.
