positive transcription factors. However, how these two events are integrated to ensure appropriate neural conversion remains unclear. In this study, we showed that Pou3f1 is essential for the neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), specifically during the transition from epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) to neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Chimeric analysis showed that Pou3f1 knockdown leads to a markedly decreased incorporation of ESCs in the neuroectoderm. By contrast, Pou3f1-overexpressing ESC derivatives preferentially contribute to the neuroectoderm. Genome-wide ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses indicated that Pou3f1 is an upstream activator of neural lineage genes, and also is a repressor of BMP and Wnt signaling. Our results established that Pou3f1 promotes the neural fate commitment of pluripotent stem cells through a dual role, activating internal neural induction programs and antagonizing extrinsic neural inhibitory signals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02224.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02224.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02224.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>After an egg has been fertilized, it undergoes a series of divisions to produce a ball of cells known as a blastocyst. The cells within the blastocyst are pluripotent stem cells, which have the potential to become many different types of cell. After a few days, the stem cells organize into three layers—an innermost layer called the endoderm, a middle layer of mesoderm, and an outer layer of ectoderm—that ultimately give rise to different types of tissues.</p><p>The brain and nervous system are formed from cells in the neuroectoderm, which is part of the ectoderm. Now, Zhu et al. have shown that a transcription factor called Pou3f1 triggers stem cells within a region of the ectoderm to turn into neural progenitor cells, thereby generating the neuroectoderm. These neural progenitor cells then go on to become neurons and glial cells that make up the brain and nervous system.</p><p>Using a virus to reduce levels of Pou3f1 in embryonic stem cells grown in a dish led to a drop in the number of stem cells that committed to neural progenitor cells. Overexpressing Pou3f1 in the stem cells restored the number of neural progenitor cells. Together these results showed that Pou3f1 is both necessary and sufficient for the conversion of embryonic stem cells into future neurons and glia.</p><p>The same result was seen when embryonic stem cells containing either reduced or elevated levels of Pou3f1 were injected into 2.5-day-old mouse blastocysts, which were then implanted into surrogate females. The resulting embryos comprised some cells with normal levels of Pou3f1, and others with either too little or too much. Cells with elevated Pou3f1 mostly became neural progenitors, whereas those with reduced levels rarely did so. Gene expression studies revealed that Pou3f1 promoted the formation of neural progenitor cells by activating the expression of pro-neuronal genes inside the stem cells, and by blocking anti-neuronal pathways called Wnt/BMP signaling cascades initiated outside the cells.</p><p>By revealing the two roles of Pou3f1, Zhu et al. have increased our understanding of one of the earliest stages of nervous system development. Further work is required to determine exactly how Pou3f1 exerts its effects and, in particular, whether it performs its two roles simultaneously or in sequence.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02224.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02224.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Pou3f1</kwd><kwd>neural fate commitment</kwd><kwd>pluripotent stem cell</kwd><kwd>intrinsic factor</kwd><kwd>extrinsic signal</kwd><kwd>BMP/Wnt pathway</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Priority Research Program, XDA01010201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jing</surname><given-names>Naihe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91219303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jing</surname><given-names>Naihe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Key Basic Research and Development Program of China, 2014CB964804</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jing</surname><given-names>Naihe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transcription factor Pou3f1 triggers embryonic stem cells to become neuronal progenitor cells in two ways: by activating the expression of pro-neuronal genes and by blocking external inhibitory signaling cascades.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Early vertebrate development is the process by which unrestricted pluripotent stem cells progressively make lineage fate choices. Central to cell allocation is gastrulation, during which the epiblast responds to secreted signals and generates three primary germ layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2001</xref>). In early mouse embryos, gastrulation initiates at embryonic day (E) 6.5. Posterior epiblast cells ingress through the primitive streak to form the mesoderm and endoderm, whereas the cells that remain in the anterior part of the epiblast form the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tam and Loebel, 2007</xref>). Then, a portion of the anterior ectoderm is specified to adopt the neural fate and subsequently, develops into the neuroectoderm, forming a plate-shaped structure called the neural plate at approximately E7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tam and Zhou, 1996</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have indicated that neural fate specification from embryonic ectoderm occurs autonomously in the absence of inhibitory signals such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and Wnts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Munoz-Sanjuan and Brivanlou, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stern, 2005b</xref>). In early <italic>Xenopus</italic>, chick, and mouse embryos, BMP and Wnt signals prevent neural conversion and contribute to non-neural fates such as epidermal differentiation and primitive streak formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Winnier et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hemmati-Brivanlou and Melton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilson et al., 2001</xref>). BMP and Wnt inhibition in the prospective neural ectoderm is essential for proper neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilson and Edlund, 2001</xref>). In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), BMP and Wnt signals are required for self-renewal and readily repress neural differentiation partially through their targets, such as <italic>Id1</italic>, <italic>Id2</italic>, and <italic>Myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">ten Berge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Varlakhanova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ying et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2010a</xref>). BMP and Wnt antagonists have been utilized to generate neural lineage cells in mouse or human ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blauwkamp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gratsch and O'Shea, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watanabe et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In addition to extrinsic signaling pathways, neuroectoderm specification is also controlled by the sequential activation of intrinsic neural fate-promoting factors. Sox2, which is an ESC pluripotency-maintenance factor, plays an important role in ESC neural differentiation, indicating that Sox2 is a neural lineage-poised factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thomson et al., 2011</xref>). Zic2 and Otx2 are also involved in epiblast stem cell (EpiSC) neural conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iwafuchi-Doi et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, Zfp521 was identified as an intrinsic factor that promotes the progression of early neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamiya et al., 2011</xref>). Studies concerning these neural fate-promoting factors have partially revealed the internal mechanism of early neural development. However, how these neural factors are activated during neural fate commitment remains unclear. Moreover, considering the importance of the effect of extrinsic signals on the neural fate decision, it remains unclear whether the inhibition of extrinsic signals and activation of internal factors are regulated separately or are integrated by a single determinant.</p><p>POU family transcription factors play important roles in the development of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Veenstra et al., 1997</xref>). Pou3f1 (also known as Oct6, Tst1, or as SCIP) has been reported as the earliest expressed POU III family member in mouse embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Monuki et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meijer et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suzuki et al., 1990</xref>). During gastrulation, <italic>Pou3f1</italic> expression is observed in the chorion and in the anterior epiblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zwart et al., 1996</xref>). As embryonic development proceeds, <italic>Pou3f1</italic> expression becomes restricted to central nervous tissues and is detectable in the midbrain and in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zwart et al., 1996</xref>). Pou3f1 has also been documented as a crucial regulator of the myelination of Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bermingham et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaegle et al., 1996</xref>). In vitro, the rapid increase of <italic>Pou3f1</italic> mRNA in retinoic acid-induced neural differentiation of P19 cells suggests that Pou3f1 may be functionally associated with neural fate commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meijer et al., 1990</xref>). Recent reports have proposed that Pou3f1 might be a potential regulator associated with early neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamiya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iwafuchi-Doi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yasuhara et al., 2013</xref>). However, whether Pou3f1 is involved in the neural initiation of pluripotent stem cells remains elusive, and the underlying mechanism requires further investigation.</p><p>In this study, we show that Pou3f1 is necessary and sufficient for the neural fate commitment of ESCs and of EpiSCs. In chimeric mice, Pou3f1-knockdown cells display suppressed neuroectoderm distribution. Conversely, ESCs with Pou3f1 overexpression preferentially contribute to the neuroectoderm but not to other lineages. We further demonstrate that Pou3f1 promotes the neural fate commitment of pluripotent stem cells through the activation of intrinsic neural lineage genes and through the inhibition of extrinsic BMP and Wnt signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pou3f1 is essential for ESC neural differentiation</title><p>We previously established an efficient system to induce ESC neural differentiation in serum-free medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2010a</xref>).

Compared with the control, the constitutive expression of Pou3f1 notably enhanced the expression of NPC and the neuron markers during serum-free differentiation, particularly at day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Single cell suspensions from EBs at various days were replated in N2 medium for neuronal differentiation. Many Tuj1<sup>+</sup> neurons emerged from stable Pou3f1-overexpression ESCs at day 4, 2 days earlier than the control ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>, d). These results demonstrate that neural differentiation was accelerated by Pou3f1 overexpression under serum-free conditions. To exclude the influences of Pou3f1 overexpression on the ESC state, doxycycline (Dox)-inducible Pou3f1-overexpressing ESCs were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). As expected, the Dox-induced overexpression of <italic>Pou3f1</italic> strongly enhanced ESC neural differentiation in serum-containing medium, which was accompanied by the increased expression of the neural markers Sox1, Pax6, Nestin, and Tuj1 in both quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and immunostaining assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). Moreover, the decreased neural marker expression in Pou3f1-depleted ESCs was restored by the overexpression of a <italic>Pou3f1</italic> coding sequence (CDS) lacking the 3′ UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Cell aggregation assays were performed by co-culturing wild-type ESCs with either GFP-labeled control or Pou3f1-overexpressing ESCs in serum-free medium. The neural differentiation of wild-type ESCs was not affected by Pou3f1-overexpressing ESCs in the culture system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>), indicating that Pou3f1 promoted neural differentiation cell-autonomously.

Luciferase assays were performed with a four-repeat BMP responsive element (BRE)-driven reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katagiri et al., 2002</xref>) to examine BMP activity in ESCs and in P19 cells. Pou3f1 knockdown increased BRE activity in ESCs with or without BMP4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), whereas Pou3f1 overexpression partially inhibited BRE-luc activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Furthermore, among the several known functional domains, only the HOMEO domain was necessary to maintain the inhibitory effect of Pou3f1 on BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). ChIP assays using a Pou3f1 antibody were performed, and we found that the binding of wild-type Pou3f1, rather than Pou3f1-ΔHOMEO, was specifically enriched at the BRE region of the <italic>Id1</italic> gene promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We also performed ChIP assays using a pSmad1 antibody and found that pSmad1 bound to the BRE locus of the <italic>Id1</italic> promoter, but not to the 3′ UTR region, in the presence of BMP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, open column). Interestingly, Pou3f1 interfered with the binding of pSmad1 to the BRE locus of the <italic>Id1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, filled column). Moreover, Pou3f1 repressed BMP-induced luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). We also observed that Pou3f1 did not affect the stimulation, degradation, dephosphorylation, or intracellular translocation of pSmad1 (data not shown), excluding the fact that Pou3f1 regulates the BMP pathway through a signaling cascade. Together, these results suggest that Pou3f1 may inhibit BMP signaling by interfering with pSmad1 binding to the regulatory elements and then repressing the transcription of target genes.</p><p>Similar to the BMP pathway, <italic>Wnt3a</italic>, <italic>Axin2</italic>, <italic>Dkk1</italic>, and <italic>Myc</italic> in Wnt signaling were regulated by Pou3f1 during ESC neural fate commitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H,I</xref>).

In luciferase-based TOPflash (TCF optimal promoter) Wnt reporter assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korinek et al., 1997</xref>), TOPflash-luc activity was enhanced by Pou3f1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), and Wnt3a-induced luciferase activity was partially reduced with Pou3f1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). We also found that the HOMEO domain is crucial for sustaining the inhibitory effect of Pou3f1 on TOPflash-luc activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Pou3f1 also inhibited Wnt agonist CHIR99021-induced TOPflash-luc activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>).

Thus, we investigated whether Pou3f1 could attenuate their inhibitory effects. ESCs were differentiated in serum-free medium with or without BMP4 for 48 hr from day 2 to day 4, and Dox was simultaneously added to induce Pou3f1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Recent works have provided new insights concerning the intracellular programs involved in early neural fate commitment in the absence of extracellular signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamiya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iwafuchi-Doi et al., 2012</xref>). However, how the intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory networks are orchestrated to ensure the appropriate initiation of neural differentiation remains largely unclear. Our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that Pou3f1 is crucial for ESC neural fate commitment and promotes the transition from EpiSCs to neural progenitor cells. Furthermore, Pou3f1 functions as an intrinsic regulator of both intracellular transcription factors and extracellular inhibitory signals during neural fate commitment.</p><p>Pou3f1 was previously reported to be a transcription factor that participates in Schwann cell development and myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bermingham et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaegle et al., 1996</xref>). The <italic>Pou3f1</italic> gene expression profiles in mouse embryos in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zwart et al., 1996</xref>) and of ESC differentiation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) imply that Pou3f1 may also participate in early neural development. Indeed, the shRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>Pou3f1</italic> in ESCs results in the reduced expression of the neural markers <italic>Sox1</italic>, <italic>Pax6</italic>, and <italic>Tuj1</italic> in serum-free medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, the compensation of the POU III member Brn2 may be one of the reasons for the mild effects observed during ESC neural differentiation after <italic>Pou3f1</italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Brn2 compensation and the different ESC lines and culture system used potentially explain why the Pou3f1 knockdown effects are not reported in Iwafuchi-Doi's study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iwafuchi-Doi et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, our results are consistent with their results indicating that the forced expression of <italic>Pou3f1</italic> promotes the expression of neural markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iwafuchi-Doi et al., 2012</xref>). Clearly, Pou3f1 is necessary and sufficient for ESC neural differentiation. Pou3f1-overexpressing or Pou3f1-knockdown ESCs generate EpiSC-like colonies that are similar to the control ESCs. However, the neural differentiation of Pou3f1-overexpressing or Pou3f1-knockdown EpiSCs is markedly different from the control EpiSCs, suggesting that Pou3f1 functions specifically during the neural transition from the epiblast to neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, in our blastocyst injection study, the contribution of Pou3f1-knockdown ESCs to the neuroectoderm was severely impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), indicating that Pou3f1 most likely functions cell-autonomously during the neural fate commitment of pluripotent stem cells in vivo. Our findings revealed that Pou3f1 is an essential transcription factor required for the intrinsic neural differentiation of pluripotent stem cells.</p><p>Cell fate determination is regulated in a step-wise fashion via the activation or inhibition of lineage specification factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pfister et al., 2007</xref>).

To date, the intrinsic modulators essential for the early neural initiation event have not been identified. In this study, the combination of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq enabled us to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms governing Pou3f1-mediated neural fate commitment in ESCs at the genome-wide level and to determine whether Pou3f1 is involved in the initiation of neural differentiation. Our results indicate that <italic>Pax6</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Zfp521</italic>, and dozens of other known neural fate-promoting genes are enhanced by Pou3f1 overexpression during ESC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref>). Furthermore, ChIP-seq data reveal that Pou3f1 is enriched at the regulatory regions of <italic>Pax6</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Zfp521</italic>, <italic>Zic1</italic>, and <italic>Zic2</italic> genomic loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that <italic>Pou3f1</italic> directly activates these neural fate-promoting genes. Surprisingly, <italic>Pou3f1</italic> did not bind the <italic>Sox2</italic>N1 enhancer, which controls <italic>Sox2</italic> posterior neural plate expression; <italic>Pou3f1</italic> preferentially binds to the <italic>Sox2</italic>N2 enhancer, which drives <italic>Sox2</italic> anterior neural plate expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref>). This result is consistent with the in vivo <italic>Pou3f1</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic> overlapping expression patterns during neural fate commitment. Our results are also consistent with the notion that the anterior-most portion of the epiblast constitutes the primitive neural identity following neural induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andoniadou and Martinez-Barbera, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013</xref>).

Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Pou3f1 is most likely an intrinsic neural initiation factor that participates in the transition of pluripotent stem cells to NPCs by directly activating a group of key neural fate-promoting genes.</p><p>In addition to intrinsic factors, several extrinsic signals involved in early neural fate commitment have been intensively studied, including BMPs and Wnts. However, how BMP/Wnt inhibitory activities are alleviated to secure neural fate commitment has not been fully elucidated. BMP and Wnt signals function partially through their downstream genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">ten Berge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Varlakhanova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ying et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2010a</xref>). Unlike <italic>Zfp521</italic>, which did not affect BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamiya et al., 2011</xref>), the expression of a few genes related to BMP and Wnt pathways was regulated by Pou3f1 knockdown or by overexpressing in EBs at day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, this regulation was not evident in ESCs or in EBs at day 2 (data not shown). This finding suggests that Pou3f1 interferes with the BMP/Wnt signaling pathways during the process of neural conversion from epiblast to NPCs. Moreover, Pou3f1 is recruited to the genomic loci of many downstream targets of BMP and Wnt signals, such as <italic>Id1</italic>, <italic>Id2</italic>, <italic>Myc</italic>, and <italic>Axin2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also found that Pou3f1 represses the transcriptional activation of a BMP responsive element (BRE) by BMP4 and of a TCF optimal promoter (TOP) by Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our data further suggest that the binding of pSmad1 to the BRE locus is potentially compromised in the presence of Pou3f1, which results in the repression of BMP signaling pathway activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, other possibilities, such as the recruitment of repressing cofactors by Pou3f1, could not be excluded by the present study. Notably, Pou3f1 overexpression enables neural differentiation even in the presence of BMP4 or Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We propose that the Pou3f1-dependent repression of the BMP and Wnt signaling pathways and the activation of intrinsic neural lineage genes together are involved in the neural fate-promoting activity of Pou3f1.</p><p>In summary, our study establishes Pou3f1 as a critical dual-regulator of intrinsic transcription factors and extrinsic signals to promote neural fate commitment. This study provides a better understanding of the internal mechanism of neural initiation. Nonetheless, many questions concerning this process remain unanswered, such as whether the dual regulatory mechanism of Pou3f1 is also utilized to initiate the mouse neural program in vivo, whether this two-way modulating processes occurs simultaneously or in a sequential, temporal manner, and how the controversial activation/inhibition activities of the Pou3f1 transcription factor is achieved. All these unanswered questions lay the foundation for exciting future work concerning the interplay between the extrinsic and intrinsic cues during early embryonic neural fate commitment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, differentiation, and treatment</title><p>Mouse ESCs (R1 and R1/E) were maintained on feeders in standard medium.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Ali Brivanlou, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors analyzed the role of Oct6 in during neuronal commitment and differentiation by using mouse ES cell differentiation system. The three reviewers' comments are mostly positive for this manuscript. However, to be acceptable, we would urge authors to make substantial revisions as summarized below.</p><p>1) Authors need to clarify what they mean by “neural commitment”. In many cases, very vague words are used in the text to describe the role of Oct6, e.g. “essential positive factor” or “critical regulator”, etc.</p><p>2) At the beginning of the paper, while authors are referring some microarray time course data, such data are not represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>. Furthermore, no reference was added in the text. Authors need to specify this.</p><p>3) While authors claim that Oct6 expression is detectable in undifferentiated ES cells and increases during differentiation. Then, what is the role of Oct6 in ES cells? Does Oct6 bind to the Wnt/BMP target genes and repress them?</p><p>4) Controls for overexpression and KD experiments are not clear. Authors need to clarify it. Furthermore, the effects of Oct6 KD and overexpression are relatively small upon gene expression profile and cell fate than expected. How do such relatively small changes translate to the role of Oct6 in neural induction by targeting both intrinsic transcription factors and extracellular signaling molecules? Authors need to explain about these results.</p><p>5) In the Oct6 KD experiment, there is no information about the level of KD.

Neural fate commitment is an essential step in neural induction, which is defined as the process by which cells differentiate to the neural fate even in the presence of inhibitory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilson and Edlund, 2001</xref>). In addition, we also removed the words mentioned by the reviewers, such as “essential positive factor,” and “critical regulator” from the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) At the beginning of the paper, while authors are referring some microarray time course data, such data are not represented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1a</italic></xref><italic>. Furthermore, no reference was added in the text. Authors need to specify this</italic>.</p><p>To identify the intrinsic factors that are involved in the neural differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, we performed microarray assays in mouse ESCs undergoing neural differentiation. ESCs were aggregated as embryonic bodies in 8% knockout serum replacement medium from days 0 to 6 (Zhang et al., 2010). RNA was extracted from ESCs at days 0, 2, 4, and 6 samples, and analyzed using Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Oligo 4X44K microarrays. The microarray data have not been published yet, and we have uploaded the data to the Dryad (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3vk1g">doi:10.5061/dryad.3vk1g</ext-link>). Using differential gene expression (DEG) analysis, we identified multiple genes that were up-regulated during ESC neural differentiation, including <italic>Pou3f1</italic><bold>.</bold></p><p><italic>3) While authors claim that Oct6 expression is detectable in undifferentiated ES cells and increases during differentiation. Then, what is the role of Oct6 in ES cells? Does Oct6 bind to the Wnt/BMP target genes and repress them?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this interesting question. Pou3f1 expression is detectable in undifferentiated ES cells, indicating that <italic>Pou3f1</italic> might be involved in ESC pluripotency maintenance. However, Pou3f1 expression in undifferentiated ESCs is much lower compared with differentiated ESCs at days 2 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, the expression profiles of pluripotency markers were similar in Pou3f1 knockdown ESCs and in control ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, the role of Pou3f1 in ESCs is not obvious.</p><p>We also examined whether altering Pou3f1 expression in ESCs affects the expression of Wnt/BMP target genes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref> below, both knockdown and overexpression of <italic>Pou3f1</italic> have no effect on the expression of Wnt/BMP target genes in ESCs, indicating that Pou3f1 most likely does not bind to and repress the Wnt/BMP target genes in ESCs.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-02224-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>4) Controls for overexpression and KD experiments are not clear. Authors need to clarify it. Furthermore, the effects of Oct6 KD and overexpression are relatively small upon gene expression profile and cell fate than expected. How do such relatively small changes translate to the role of Oct6 in neural induction by targeting both intrinsic transcription factors and extracellular signaling molecules? Authors need to explain about these results</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for not making this clear in the original manuscript. For the Pou3f1-inducible overexpression experiment, we used no doxycycline addition group as control. For stable overexpression cell lines, mPou3f1 was inserted into the lentiviral expression vector pFUGW-IRES-EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Naldini et al., 1996</xref>). The empty lentiviral expression vector pFUGW-GFP was used as a negative control. For the knockdown experiments, the lentiviral vector pLentiLox 3.7, which expresses a control shRNA sequence (Huang et al., 2010), was used as a negative control. We have added this information to the Materials and methods section in the revised manuscript.</p><p>For the <italic>Pou3f1</italic> knockdown experiment, we found that the POU III family member <italic>Brn2</italic> could compensate for Pou3f1 depletion, and we will discuss this finding in further detail in Question 6. Briefly, we found that <italic>Brn2</italic> expression increases after <italic>Pou3f1</italic> knockdown, whereas the simultaneous knockdown of <italic>Pou3f1</italic> and <italic>Brn2</italic> decreases the expression of neural markers more significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2D</xref>). Thus, the relatively small effects of Pou3f1 knockdown are likely due to Brn2 compensation.</p><p>As an intrinsic neural fate promoting factor, <italic>Pou3f1</italic> is expressed earlier than the neural lineage related genes <italic>Zfp521</italic>, <italic>Pax6</italic>, and <italic>Zic1</italic>, and <italic>Pou3f1</italic> directly binds and upregulates these genes expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig4">Figures 1, 4</xref>). Pou3f1-dependent direct regulation of the So<italic>x2</italic>N2 enhancer serves as additional support for its neutralization function. These factors synergistically contribute to neuroectoderm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iwafuchi-Doi et al., 2012</xref>); Pou3f1 controls their expression intrinsically and then promotes early neural fate commitment. On the other hand, the repression of extrinsic signals is essential for neural fate commitment. We demonstrate that the Pou3f1-dependent repression of BMP and Wnt signaling genes occurs at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Pou3f1 coordinates the expression of both endogenous factors and exogenous signals at the transcriptional level, which is a fast and efficient approach to regulating cell fate determination.</p><p><italic>5) In the Oct6 KD experiment, there is no information about the level of KD. It is necessary to show how much the shRNAs to Oct6 is down-regulating the Oct6 gene at the transcript and protein level</italic>.</p><p>We examined the effect of shRNAs to Pou3f1 on the transcript and protein levels, and found that shRNA1 (Pou3f1-KD1) and shRNA3 (Pou3f1-KD3) decreases the expression of <italic>Pou3f1</italic> transcripts in ESCs by approximately 50% and 30%, respectively; however, shRNA2 (Pou3f1-KD2) does not affect <italic>Pou3f1</italic> expression in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1Ba</xref>). Similar results were observed regarding the expression of Pou3f1 protein with various Pou3f1-shRNAs via Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1Bb</xref>). We have added this information to the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) Do Oct-family members compensate for the depletion of Oct6?</italic></p><p>This question is important. Oct-family members belong to POU domain factors. In previous studies, the functional redundancy between various POU factors has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen and Rosenfeld, 2001</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Friedrich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaegle et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, we sought to address whether the compensation by other POU III family members, Brn1 and Brn2, plays a role in Pou3f1 depletion. First, we examined the expression patterns of these genes during ESC neural differentiation and observed that Brn1 and Brn2 are up-regulated in serum-free medium after day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2A</xref>), which occurs much later than Pou3f1. Consistently, in mouse embryos <italic>in vivo</italic>, Pou3f1 expression is detected at E5.5, which occurs much earlier than neural induction in the mouse embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zwart et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, Brn1 and Brn2 expression is only detected after E8.5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/search?author1=Maxime+Bouchard%26sortspec=date%26submit=Submit">Maxime Bouchard</ext-link> et al., 2005). Brn1 and Brn2 expression patterns in ESCs <italic>in vitro</italic> and mouse embryos <italic>in vivo</italic> suggest that distinct critical windows potentially exist for each POU factor to modulate neural developmental events.</p><p>Next, we assessed whether Pou3f1 depletion affects Brn1 and Brn2 expression. Indeed, Brn2 expression is obviously up-regulated in Pou3f1-KD1 and Pou3f1-KD3 cell lines compared with the control cells, whereas Brn1 expression is unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2B</xref>). In addition, when both Pou3f1 and Brn2 were simultaneously knocked-down by co-transfection with lentiviral-mediated shRNAs, Brn1 expression was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2C</xref>). Then, the expression of neural markers decreased more dramatically in the Pou3f1 and Brn2 double-knockdown cells compared with control or Pou3f1 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2D</xref>). This information was added to the revised manuscript. Together, these results suggest that Brn2 potentially compensates for Pou3f1 depletion.</p><p><italic>7) It also needs to be shown that constitutive and dox-inducible Oct6 overexpression in the mouse ES cells in within the physiological range at the transcript and protein levels</italic>.</p><p>The gene functional analysis is achieved by loss-of-function or gain-of-function. Typically, a gain-of-function analysis in embryos and tissues is executed through the ectopic expression of a gene within the physiological range. However, in the cultured cells, gain-of-function is performed by overexpression, which will lead the gene expression level higher than the physiological range. To answer this question, we examined <italic>Pou3f1</italic> expression patterns during ESC neural differentiation in control, Dox-inducible and in Pou3f1-stable overexpression cell lines. We found that the <italic>Pou3f1</italic> expression peaked at days 2-4 of ESC neural differentiation in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>), which is consistent with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A</xref>. During the same period, Pou3f1 expression levels in the Dox-inducible and stable lines were approximately two-fold higher compared with control cells; except that Dox-induced Pou3f1 expression displayed a considerably higher peak at day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>). After day 5, all three cell lines displayed similar <italic>Pou3f1</italic> expression levels.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-02224-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>8) The Oct6 target genes identified in gain-of-function lines should be validated in the loss-of-function lines</italic>.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, the Pou3f1 target genes identified in gain-of-function lines have been validated in the loss-of-function lines. The expression of neural lineage-related genes, such as <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Zfp521</italic>, <italic>Zic1</italic>, and <italic>Zic2</italic>, increased in <italic>Pou3f1</italic> overexpressing ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and their expression decreased after <italic>Pou3f1</italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The expression of BMP and Wnt pathway-target genes, such as <italic>Id1/2</italic>, <italic>Msx1/2</italic>, <italic>Wnt3</italic>, <italic>Axin2</italic>, <italic>Dkk1</italic>, and <italic>Myc</italic>, was reduced in <italic>Pou3f1</italic> overexpressing ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B and 6I</xref>), and their expression increased after <italic>Pou3f1</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A and 6H</xref>).</p><p><italic>9) Multiple media conditions are used in various parts of the manuscript during neural differentiation. For example, data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>is not compatible to data from other figures. Ideally, the data for all figures should be presented in serum free conditions</italic>.</p><p>In this study, we used two culture conditions for ESC neural differentiation: serum-free medium (8% knockout replacement serum) and serum-containing medium (10% FBS). In serum-free medium, the percentage of Sox<sup>+</sup>/Oct4<sup>-</sup> neural progenitor cells (NPCs) can reach 80% of total cells by day 6 (Zhang et al., 2010); these conditions are not optimal for a gain-of-function analysis of neural fate-promoting factors but are suitable for a loss-of-function analysis. In contrast, ESC neural differentiation was inhibited in serum-containing medium, which contains BMP and other neural inhibitory signals. In addition, the percentage of NPCs is considerably reduced compared with serum-free medium after 8 days of differentiation (data not shown). The serum-containing medium is more suitable for the gain-of-function analysis of neural fate-promoting factors. Thus, we performed Pou3f1 knockdown experiments in serum-free medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B-D</xref>) and Pou3f1 overexpression assays in serum-containing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E-G</xref>). The culture condition used depends on the experimental approaches and effects. We have added this culture condition information to the revised manuscript.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we also performed the Pou3f1 overexpression experiments in serum-free medium to further confirm the function of Pou3f1 in ESC neural differentiation. The results indicate that the NPC markers, such as Sox1, Pax6, and Nestin, and the neuron markers Tuj1 and Map2 were notably upregulated in the day 4 EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3A</xref>). The immunostaining assays also revealed an increased number of Sox<sup>+</sup>/Oct4<sup>-</sup> NPCs, Nestin<sup>+</sup> NPCs, and Tuj1<sup>+</sup> neurons in the Pou3f1-stable overexpressing cells at day 4 EBs compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3B, 3C</xref>). Cells in EBs from various days were replated in N2 medium for neuronal differentiation, and a significantly increased number of Tuj1<sup>+</sup> neurons were observed at day 4 in the Pou3f1-overexpressing ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3C</xref>d). These results suggest that ESC neural differentiation is accelerated by Pou3f1 overexpression in serum-free culture. We have added this information to the “Results” section of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>10) As regards the results of Oct6 loss-of-function experiments are not consistent with those obtained in the previous report (Iwabuchi-Doi et al., 2012). Such differences should be explained in the text</italic>.</p><p>In the previous report, Iwabuchi-Doi et al. found that <italic>Pou3f1</italic> was expressed at E7.5-E7.75 in the anterior portion of mouse embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iwafuchi-Doi et al., 2012</xref>), which contributes to neuroectoderm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tam and Loebel, 2007</xref>). They showed that <italic>Pou3f1</italic> overexpression promotes the expression of neural lineage marker genes, such as <italic>Sox1</italic> and <italic>Pax6</italic>, and concluded that <italic>Pou3f1</italic> was involved in anterior neural plate development. In fact, our observations in Pou3f1 gain-of-function assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E-G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>) are consistent with their findings. The discrepancy between Iwabuchi-Doi’s study and ours occurs in the Pou3f1 loss-of-function assays. Iwabuchi-Doi et al. did not report Pou3f1 knockdown results; however, we demonstrated that Pou3f1 is required for ESC neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B-D</xref>). Several possibilities may contribute to the discrepancy between our study and Iwabuchi-Doi’s:</p><p>First, we differentiated mouse ESCs and EpiSCs in cell aggregates (EBs) in serum-free medium, whereas Iwabuchi-Doi et al. performed EpiSC neural differentiation using monolayers in N2B27 medium. Thus, the different differentiation protocols may account for the different observations between these two studies.</p><p>Second, the POU III family member <italic>Brn2</italic> compensates for <italic>Pou3f1</italic> depletion in ESC neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>); therefore, it is difficult to capture the phenotype of ESC neural differentiation after <italic>Pou3f1</italic> knockdown.</p><p>Third, Iwabuchi-Doi et al. have studied multiple transcriptional factors to establish the transcriptional regulatory networks during the anterior neural plate development, and <italic>Pou3f1</italic> is only one of six factors that these authors analyzed. In our study, we exclusively focused on the function and mechanism of <italic>Pou3f1</italic> during ESC neural differentiation, and we have to confirm Pou3f1’s function in the loss-of-function experiment very carefully. Given that the exon sequence of the <italic>Pou3f1</italic> gene is GC-rich, it is extremely difficult to knockdown its expression effectively. We tried several shRNAs against <italic>Pou3f1</italic>, but only two of the shRNAs (Pou3f1-shRNA1 and Pou3f1-shRNA3) worked. We used these two shRNAs in our study.</p><p>We have explained this discrepancy in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
