The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> recognizes pathogenic bacteria and elicits defense responses by activating immune pathways and pathogen avoidance. Here we show that chemosensation of phenazines produced by pathogenic <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, which leads to rapid activation of DAF-7/TGF-β in ASJ neurons, is insufficient for the elicitation of pathogen avoidance behavior. Instead, intestinal infection and bloating of the lumen, which depend on the virulence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, regulates both pathogen avoidance and aversive learning by modulating not only the DAF-7/TGF-β pathway but also the G-protein coupled receptor NPR-1 pathway, which also controls aerotaxis behavior. Modulation of these neuroendocrine pathways by intestinal infection serves as a systemic feedback that enables animals to avoid virulent bacteria. These results reveal how feedback from the intestine during infection can modulate the behavior, learning, and microbial perception of the host.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The bacteria that cause disease may be microscopic, but animals can use senses other than sight to protect themselves from infection. Some bacteria produce harmful toxins, which animals can instinctively recognize as being dangerous using their sense of smell or taste. This is called chemosensation, an innate ability that allows animals to react to chemical stimuli.</p><p>But animals can also ‘learn’ to avoid harmful bacteria, though it remains unclear how they do so. Now, Singh and Aballay have used roundworms as a model organism to study this phenomenon.</p><p>Roundworms feed on bacteria, so they need to be able to distinguish between disease-causing strains and harmless ones. However, they only start avoiding harmful bacteria after several hours of exposure, which would not necessarily be expected if they were using chemosensation.

Instead, the experiments showed that when roundworms ingested disease-causing bacteria, the infection caused intestinal bloating. The more toxic the bacteria, the more the intestine swelled, triggering a neural pathway associated with a preference for oxygen.

To ensure their survival, organisms must recognize pathogens and mount a robust defense in response to their attack. Physical avoidance of pathogens is also a critical defense strategy to reduce pathogen infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kavaliers et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Medzhitov et al., 2012</xref>). Chemosensation of bacterial metabolites and toxins appears to play an important role in eliciting pathogen avoidance behaviors. In mammals, olfactory chemosensory neurons and nociceptor sensory neurons detect bacterial toxins, quorum-sensing molecules, formyl peptides, and lipopolysaccharides through distinct molecular mechanisms that lead to rapid avoidance behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boillat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meseguer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rivière et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tizzano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang and Chiu, 2017</xref>). Similarly, in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, olfactory and gustatory neurons have been reported to detect geosmin (the smell of mold), phenol, and lipopolysaccharides via distinct molecular mechanisms, allowing the organism to avoid food contaminated with bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mansourian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soldano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stensmyr et al., 2012</xref>). A deeper understanding of the various mechanisms of pathogen avoidance has the potential to uncover conserved host defense responses that are important against pathogen infections.</p><p>The free-living nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> feeds on bacteria. Pathogenic bacteria such as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infect and kill <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and upon exposure to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic> elicits an innate immune response that results in the activation of microbial-killing pathways and a pathogen-avoidance behavior that improve its survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meisel and Kim, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Styer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Troemel et al., 2006</xref>). Chemosensation of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> metabolites phenazine-1-carboxamide and pyochelin has been proposed to be responsible for eliciting the avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>). These metabolites activate a G-protein signaling pathway in the ASJ chemosensory neuron pair that induces expression of the neuromodulator DAF-7/TGF-β within minutes of exposure to the pathogen. However, the animals are initially attracted towards lawns of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and only begin to avoid the pathogen after exposure for hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singh and Aballay, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). The initial attraction of <italic>C. elegans</italic> towards <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is mediated by sensing of quorum-sensing molecules acylated homoserine lactones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beale et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ha et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, in a two-choice preference assay between <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, the naïve animals show a higher preference for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). The animals only change their choice and move towards <italic>E. coli</italic> lawns after an exposure time to the two bacteria exceeding 4 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the activation of DAF-7/TGF-β signaling in ASJ neurons, which takes place after minutes of exposure to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, does not fully explain the later aversive learning towards <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p><p>Here we show that chemosensation of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> metabolites, which leads to the induction of DAF-7/TGF-β in ASJ neurons, does not correlate with the avoidance behavior. Instead, bloating of the intestinal lumen caused by the pathogen infection underlies the avoidance behavior via modulation of both DAF-7/TGF-β and the G-protein coupled receptor NPR-1 neuroendocrine pathways, which regulate aerotaxis. We further show that the modulation of these neuroendocrine pathways by intestinal infection or genetic modulation of aerotaxis by loss of <italic>ocr-2</italic> and <italic>osm-9</italic> drives the change in preference of animals from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to <italic>E. coli</italic> lawns. Our findings demonstrate that signaling from the intestine via neuroendocrine pathways modulates microbial perception during infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection elicits <italic>C. elegans</italic> avoidance in a phenazine-independent manner</title><p>Because <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-produced phenazines lead to induction of the neuromodulator DAF-7/TGF-β in the ASJ neuron pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>), we studied the role of phenazines in the elicitation of the pathogen avoidance behavior. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> uses a well-characterized biosynthetic pathway to generate four different phenazines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dietrich et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Therefore, the avoidance of <italic>E. coli</italic> lawns containing 1-hydroxyphenazine was likely caused by intestinal bloating of the animals induced by the toxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>).

It is likely that the variations in avoidance kinetics are due to differences in the production of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> factors governing the avoidance behavior. We reasoned that different growing conditions for the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lawns might be responsible for the differences in avoidance behaviors.

Enhanced activities of these pathways, as a consequence of intestinal infection, lead to the avoidance of low oxygen, resulting in the avoidance of bacterial lawns with low oxygen due to microbial metabolism. Intestinal infection-mediated avoidance of low oxygen also drives the movement of animals from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to <italic>E. coli</italic> lawns, which have been reported to have relatively higher oxygen levels. Thus, modulation of aerotaxis-regulating neuroendocrine pathways by intestinal infection plays a role in the learning process, resulting in changes in the preference of animals from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

However, we found that phenazine-1-carboxamide does not play a role in elicitation of the avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,H</xref>). The induction of DAF-7/TGF-β in ASJ chemosensory neurons was observed within 6 min of exposure to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and no further changes were observed up to 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>). However, the avoidance behavior was observed only after hours of interaction with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Therefore, while the activity of the DAF-7/TGF-β pathway is required to elicit the avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), its rapid activation in ASJ neurons by chemosensation appears to be insufficient for induction of this behavior. Because the DAF-7/TGF-β and NPR-1/GPCR pathways are induced by intestinal bloating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singh and Aballay, 2019a</xref>) and act synergistically to elicit pathogen avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), it is likely that animals integrate multiple inputs, including intestinal infection and chemosensation, to induce defense responses. Indeed, in addition to O<sub>2</sub>, animals sense CO<sub>2</sub> and NO from bacterial lawns via multiple chemosensory neurons to control the pathogen avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandt and Ringstad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> possesses an innate attraction to the smell of <italic>P. aeruginosa,</italic> and a brief exposure to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> does not lead to changes in preference to <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Because the olfactory aversive learning of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and changes in preference to <italic>E. coli</italic> require several hours of exposure to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, the mechanism by which the animals learn to avoid pathogens over time remain unclear. Here we show that bloating of the intestine caused by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection is required for the learning process. We demonstrate that the learning involves modulation of aerotaxis-regulating neuroendocrine pathways by intestinal bloating. By genetic modulation of the aerotaxis behavior of the animals, we are able to induce a rapid change in preference from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>Feeding on several pathogenic, but not nonpathogenic, bacteria leads to colonization and bloating of the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuhrman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Irazoqui et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kurz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yuen and Ausubel, 2018</xref>). Thus, the bloating-induced defense response might be a generalized response of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to infection by different pathogens and enables the animals to distinguish between pathogenic and innocuous microbes. Indeed, the induction of intestinal bloating by genetic manipulation activates avoidance behavior towards even nonpathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singh and Aballay, 2019a</xref>). Interestingly, the neuropeptide Y (NPY)-related signaling neuroendocrine pathway NPR-1, which is activated by intestinal bloating in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, appears to have a conserved mode of activation and action across a variety of disparate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duvall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Singh and Aballay, 2019b</xref>). For instance, gut distension caused by a complete blood meal may activate the NPY-related signaling in mosquitoes and induce host aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Singh and Aballay, 2019b</xref>). It will be interesting to study whether intestinal bloating is a conserved danger signal that activates immune responses in different species.</p><p>The precise mechanism by which bacterial pathogens cause bloating remains unclear. <italic>C. elegans</italic> possesses a rhythmic defecation cycle that is timed by an oscillation in intestinal pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</xref>). Defects in the pH wave lead to defects in the defecation cycle causing intestinal bloating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</xref>). Pathogenic bacteria such as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, but not nonpathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic>, disturb the pH wave in <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benomar et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that it is this disturbance of pH wave by pathogens that leads to intestinal bloating in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, it remains to be determined how pathogenic bacteria disturb the pH wave. Replication of bacteria in the intestinal lumen alone and other possible mechanisms could also lead to intestinal bloating.</p><p>Increasing evidence shows that <italic>C. elegans</italic> recognizes potential pathogen attack by sensing homeostasis perturbations, including perturbations of core cellular processes, DNA damage, and intestinal bloating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dunbar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ermolaeva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McEwan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Melo and Ruvkun, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pukkila-Worley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singh and Aballay, 2019a</xref>). Thus, these studies show that the physiological changes induced by pathogen infection or toxins generate modifications in <italic>C. elegans</italic> homeostasis that elicit an innate immune response and microbial aversion behavior via neuroendocrine signaling. It remains to be determined whether <italic>C. elegans</italic> is also capable of recognizing infecting microbes through more traditional mechanisms like those capable of recognizing microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). <italic>C. elegans</italic> mounts immune responses toward heat-killed pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pukkila-Worley and Ausubel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yuen and Ausubel, 2018</xref>), suggesting the possible existence of MAMP-like mechanisms. However, the interpretation of these results is not straightforward because heat-killed bacteria could lead to intestinal bloating and activation of defense responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singh and Aballay, 2019a</xref>).</p><p>Our studies indicate that chemosensation of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> phenazines, which leads to the rapid induction of DAF-7/TGF-β in ASJ chemosensory neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, is insufficient for the elicitation of pathogen avoidance behavior. We cannot rule out the possibility that other metabolites or virulence factors play a role in the elicitation of pathogen avoidance. Our results suggest that intestinal bloating caused by microbial infection plays a crucial role in aversive learning and microbial preference from pathogenic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to nonpathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic>. Recent studies in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> also highlight the role of intestinal infection in modulating the immune response and social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the modulation of behavior by intestinal infection appears to be conserved across species. Future research further deciphering these conserved pathways will aid in better understanding intestinal infection and gut dysbiosis-mediated behavioral and physiological changes.</p></sec><sec

in ASJ sensory neurons has the major role in transmitting the pathogen information for generation of the pathogen avoidance behavior, because the authors show that expression of <italic>daf-7</italic> in ASJ is not correlated with pathogen avoidance, but they instead show clearly that intestinal bloating is the major cause. Upon revision, authors addressed all major concerns that the reviewers raised. We are therefore glad to accept the manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Intestinal infection regulates behavior and learning via neuroendocrine signaling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Javier Irazoqui (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers appreciate the importance of the work, especially because it challenges the prevailing view of the major role of <italic>daf-7</italic> in ASJ in transmitting the pathogen information for generation of the pathgen avoidance behavior. However, they also agree that some of the authors' assertion needs to be substantiated further. We therefore invite revision of the manuscript, and as a consensus of the reviewers, we request the following to be addressed in revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors seem to claim that the pathogen avoidance behavior is driven by aerotaxis (at least in the present manuscript it sounds so). However, is it really aerotaxis which causes preference of <italic>E. coli</italic> over pathogenic bacteria after pathogenic exposure? The authors' claim is mainly based on the fact that lawn of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has lower oxygen level than that of <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the requirement of <italic>npr-1, ocr-2</italic> and <italic>osm-9</italic> for avoidance and suppression by <italic>egl-9</italic>. However, these pathways regulate other functions as well. We request authors either test whether dead bacteria cannot cause the avoidance behavior, or perform behavioral assay that directly tests aerotaxis. Another option is to weaken the claim that it is aerotaxis.</p><p>2) Genetic requirements were assessed by RNAi for <italic>nol-6, aex-5</italic> and <italic>egl-8</italic>. Because RNAi does not always generate specific and complete loss of the targeted gene, and because mutants are available for all these genes, the results need to be backed up by using respective mutants.</p><p>3) The following point is not an absolute requirement, but it would be nice to be added: this study intriguingly shows that increased ASJ-expression of <italic>daf-7</italic> has no correlation with lawn avoiding. Since this finding will be very important for the field, it will be useful to provide a more complete analysis on <italic>daf-7</italic> by including ASI-expression of <italic>daf-7</italic>, because Meisel et al. shows that <italic>daf-7</italic> in ASI also rescues the lawn avoidance defects of <italic>daf-7</italic> mutant and the expression of <italic>daf-7</italic> in ASI also increases by exposure to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this very interesting paper, Singh and Aballay tackle a central question in innate immunity in general and in <italic>C. elegans</italic> innate immunity in particular: how is infection detected and host defense mechanisms engaged in vivo? The paradigm in this manuscript is <italic>C. elegans</italic> aversive learning, in which behavioral innate immunity is activated during infection so that the animal can escape an unfavorable (pathogenic) environment. The assays are very simple: in one case (lawn assay), the animals are exposed to stimuli (chemical, bacterial) on lawns of bacteria, and then their preference to stay on the lawn (and, thus, feed) or avoid it (and, thus, escape infection) is measured over time. In the other case (choice assay), animals reared on non-pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> are given the choice to continue eating <italic>E. coli</italic> or to feed on the &quot;tastier&quot; <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> aeruginosa – which is pathogenic.</p><p>First, the investigators dispel the notion, put forward in Meisel et al. (2014) in Cell, that sensory-neuron-mediated detection of phenazine-1-carboxamide is the trigger of aversive learning and pathogen avoidance through the induction of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in ASJ neurons. This result is extremely important to the field, as many researchers have expressed their doubts about such a simplistic model, and is consistent with prior research from the Ausubel lab that showed that phenazine mutants of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> are just as virulent as wild type (replicated in this study).</p><p>Then, the investigators set out to determine what really triggers aversion during infection. First, they find that &quot;older&quot; solid cultures of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> are more virulent than &quot;younger&quot; ones. They establish that virulence correlates with intestinal distention, or &quot;bloating&quot;. Drawing on their seminal work published earlier this year in Dev Cell, they find that older more pathogenic <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> induce gut-derived neuropeptides more strongly than younger ones, and that intestinal distention is required for aversive learning in the lawn assay. Then, they show that avirulent mutants of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, identified in a whole genome screen by the Ausubel lab, are defective in inducing aversive learning by the same assay. The nail in the phenazine/<italic>daf-7</italic> coffin is presented in Figure 4F,G, where they show a complete lack of correlation between <italic>daf-7</italic> ASJ expression and aversive learning, but almost perfect correlation with <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> virulence. After establishing that, they turn to preference. What makes <italic>E. coli</italic> less &quot;tasty&quot; than <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, despite the virulence? Why does this choice invert after about 12 hours? To answer the first question, they examine aerotaxis. Consistent with the idea (and previous research) that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> lawns exhibit lower oxygen tension (preferred by wild type <italic>C. elegans</italic>) than <italic>E. coli</italic> ones, they find induction of a HIF-1 target gene only in animals feeding on <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, not <italic>E. coli</italic>. Then, they examine mutants. <italic>daf-7</italic> mutant exhibit no choice; <italic>npr-1</italic> mutants invert their choice more slowly than wild type. The double mutants show additive effects. Importantly, they also show that distention-resistant <italic>nol-6</italic> RNAi worms also do not invert their choice – they never learn. Conversely, <italic>ocr-2</italic> and <italic>osm-9</italic> mutants, which prefer higher oxygen tensions, switch their preference to <italic>E. coli</italic> and learn to avoid <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> lawns faster than wild type; this is suppressed by loss of <italic>egl-9</italic>, a negative regulator of HIF-1. The implication, which is not substantiated or tested, is that HIF-1 activation and thus target gene transcription is epistatic to the loss of aerotaxis behavior phenotype in <italic>ocr-2</italic> or <italic>osm-9</italic> mutants.</p><p>In summary, this important study corrects the record on an important subject, and identifies the genetics in host and pathogen that are involved in aversive learning and food choice during infection.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Singh and Aballay examine the mechanisms that regulate the avoidance of pathogenic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> bacteria in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>They first test the role of several phenazines in eliciting avoidance and increasing <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in ASJ. They report that only one type of phenazine increases <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in ASJ, but it does not generate avoidance when put on <italic>E. coli</italic>. They also find that another type of phenazine repels worms although it does not increase ASJ expression of <italic>daf-7</italic> and mutants lacking phenazines repel worms similarly as wild type. These results show that phenazines are not required for the repulsion of the worms.</p><p>Next, they examine whether the growth conditions regulate lawn repulsion by using 72 hour lawns and 12 hour lawns. They found that 72 hour lawns that strongly repel worms cause intestine bloating but 12 hour lawns that repel worms less do not cause bloating. Meanwhile, the 72 hour lawns, but not the 12 hour lawns, also regulate transcription similarly as intestine bloating and decreasing bloating by <italic>nol-6</italic> RNAi delays avoidance. Meanwhile, they show that enhancing intestine bloating (<italic>aex-5, egl-8</italic> RNAi) enhances repulsion. These results demonstrate a strong link between intestine bloating and lawn avoidance.</p><p>Finally, they find that several <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mutants with weaker virulence show decreased repulsion to the worms and mutating aerotaxis gene <italic>oms-9</italic> and <italic>ocr-2</italic>, alters the switch of preference from pathogenic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>The findings in this study demonstrate a strong link between intestine bloating and lawn avoidance and provide a new mechanism for the worms to avoid infectious bacteria.

This is confusing, because Meisel et al. does not seem to propose that increased expression of <italic>daf-7</italic> in ASJ, induced by pathogenic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> or phenazine-1-carboxamide and pyochelin, elicits avoidance. Rather, they propose that it is one of sensory responses to the bacteria (for example, they conclude that &quot;Our findings demonstrate how specific bacteria can exert effects on host behavior and physiology and point to how secondary metabolites may serve as environmental cues that contribute to pathogen discrimination and avoidance.&quot;). It is important to clarify these issues for the readers to better understand the complexity of the question.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic></p><p>In &quot;Intestinal infection regulates behavior and learning via neuroendocrine signaling,&quot; the authors show that feedback from the intestine modulates the worm behavioral response to infection with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> – namely pathogen avoidance. The response requires <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>npr-1</italic>; loss of either of these genes reduces pathogen avoidance and loss of both completely blocks the process. It had previously been thought that <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in the ASJ neurons might drive this process because a <italic>daf-7p::GFP</italic> reporter construct is activated in these neurons upon exposure to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. However, the authors show that the behavior is not correlated with this expression. In one example, 12 hour and 72 hour lawns of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cause equal amounts of <italic>daf-7p::GFP</italic> expression, but elicit different levels of lawn avoidance. In a second example, worms are exposed to mutants of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> that change how avidly they avoid the lawns, but the degree of avoidance is not correlated with the levels of induced ASJ <italic>daf-7p::GFP</italic> expression. Rather, the authors argue that the level of intestinal bloating caused by the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection drives the pathogen avoidance response. Several examples of correlation are given.</p><p>1) The phenazine 1-hydroxyphenazine is the only one of four tested that causes both bloating and avoidance.</p><p>2) A 72 hour lawn causes more rapid bloating and more rapid avoidance.</p><p>3) The degree of bloating caused by different <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mutants is correlated with the degree of avoidance.</p><p>4) <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants that have more bloating have more avoidance, and those that have less bloating have less avoidance. The data in total supports in a correlative manner the authors' postulate that the changes in the intestine (bloating) causes the ensuing pathogen avoidance behavior.</p><p>The authors then argue that it is aerotaxis behavior via neuroendocrine signaling that drives the learned pathogen avoidance behavior. Worms like bacterial lawns with less oxygen and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lawns are known to have less oxygen. However, following intestinal bloating and activation of the NPR-1/DAF-7 neuroendocrine pathway on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, the animals come to prefer the higher oxygen lawns of <italic>E. coli</italic>. The argument is supported by the fact that animals mutant in <italic>daf-7</italic> and/or <italic>npr-1</italic> cannot learn to avoid <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lawns.</p><p>Overall, this is a very interesting study and it will be of broad interest to the worm community. However, I am concerned about the heavy dependence on correlative results on which the main conclusions rest.</p><p>1) Are oxygen levels really the signal the worms learn to recognize as a sign of a pathogenic lawn or is it a correlation? Is there a way to equalize the oxygen levels between the pathogenic and non-pathogenic lawns? Then one could see if the worms can still learn to avoid the lawn (and if intestinal bloating still occurs (see point 2)). Alternatively, maybe the animals trained to avoid <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> could be tested in an assay designed to test their aerotaxis preferences?</p><p>2) The relationship, if any, between low/high oxygen and intestinal bloating is not clear. Does the low oxygen cause the bloating on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, or could it? Or do the authors think that the high/low oxygen is just how the worms learn to distinguish between a good (<italic>E. coli</italic>) and bad (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) lawn?</p><p>3) Worms like bacterial lawns with less oxygen and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lawns are known to have less oxygen.

However, is it really aerotaxis which causes preference of E. coli over pathogenic bacteria after pathogenic exposure? The authors' claim is mainly based on the fact that lawn of P. aeruginosa has lower oxygen level than that of E. coli, and the requirement of npr-1, ocr-2 and osm-9 for avoidance and suppression by egl-9. However, these pathways regulate other functions as well. We request authors either test whether dead bacteria cannot cause the avoidance behavior, or perform behavioral assay that directly tests aerotaxis. Another option is to weaken the claim that it is aerotaxis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have both carried out additional experiments to directly study the role of aerotaxis in the change of microbial preference and discussed the possibility of additional cues, other than aerotaxis. As shown in new Figure 6—figure supplement 2, we have provided further evidence for the role of aerotaxis in the change of microbial preference. The revised manuscript reads: “We were also able to elicit a rapid preference towards <italic>E. coli</italic> by exposing the animals to 5% oxygen (Figure 6—figure supplement 2).”</p><p>In addition, we have also added that our studies do not rule out the role of additional cues in the elicitation of the behavioral changes: “We cannot rule out that other metabolites or virulence factors may play a role in the elicitation of pathogen avoidance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Genetic requirements were assessed by RNAi for nol-6, aex-5 and egl-8. Because RNAi does not always generate specific and complete loss of the targeted gene, and because mutants are available for all these genes, the results need to be backed up by using respective mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added data with <italic>aex-5</italic> and <italic>egl-8</italic> mutants in new Figure 6H. The <italic>nol-6</italic> mutant animals are temperature-sensitive sterile. Therefore, we have used RNAi for knocking down <italic>nol-6</italic>. Previous studies have shown that knockdown of <italic>nol-6</italic> by RNAi reduces bacterial colonization and intestinal bloating (Fuhrman et al., 2009). In our current study, we also confirmed that <italic>nol-6</italic> RNAi reduces intestinal bloating (Figure 3F,G, Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C). Since we are testing the role of intestinal bloating (and not the function of <italic>nol-6</italic> per se) in the avoidance behavior, we believe that the use of <italic>nol-6</italic> RNAi is reliable and sufficient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The following point is not an absolute requirement, but it would be nice to be added: this study intriguingly shows that increased ASJ-expression of daf-7 has no correlation with lawn avoiding. Since this finding will be very important for the field, it will be useful to provide a more complete analysis on daf-7 by including ASI-expression of daf-7, because Meisel et al. shows that daf-7 in ASI also rescues the lawn avoidance defects of daf-7 mutant and the expression of daf-7 in ASI also increases by exposure to Pseudomonas.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added data on <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in ASI neurons.

However, we would like to bring out that Meisel et al. did indeed suggest that induction of DAF-7 in the ASJ neuron pair promotes the avoidance behavior. Meisel et al., 2014 reads “Secondary metabolites phenazine-1-carboxamide and pyochelin activate a G-protein-signaling pathway in the ASJ chemosensory neuron pair that induces expression of the neuromodulator DAF-7/TGF-β.
