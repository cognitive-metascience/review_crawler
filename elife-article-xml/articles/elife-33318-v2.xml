Regeneration of endocrine cells is of therapeutic interest and recent studies are promising, but mechanisms of endocrine cell fate acquisition need to be better characterised. The NOTCH pathway is important during pituitary development. Here, we further characterise its role in the murine pituitary, revealing differential sensitivity within and between lineages. In progenitors, NOTCH activation blocks cell fate acquisition, with time-dependant modulation. In differentiating cells, response to activation is blunted in the POU1F1 lineage, with apparently normal cell fate specification, while POMC cells remain sensitive. Absence of apparent defects in <italic>Pou1f1-Cre; Rbpj<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice further suggests no direct role for NOTCH signalling in POU1F1 cell fate acquisition. In contrast, in the POMC lineage, NICD expression induces a regression towards a progenitor-like state, suggesting that the NOTCH pathway specifically blocks POMC cell differentiation. These results have implications for pituitary development, plasticity and regeneration. Activation of NOTCH signalling in different cell lineages of the embryonic murine pituitary uncovers an unexpected differential sensitivity, and this consequently reveals new aspects of endocrine lineages development and plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NOTCH signalling</kwd><kwd>pituitary</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U117562207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le Tissier</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lovell-Badge</surname><given-names>Robin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U117512772</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lovell-Badge</surname><given-names>Robin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lovell-Badge</surname><given-names>Robin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lovell-Badge</surname><given-names>Robin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activation of NOTCH signalling in different cell lineages of the embryonic murine pituitary uncovers an unexpected differential sensitivity, and this consequently reveals new aspects of endocrine lineages development and plasticity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The pituitary is an essential endocrine gland that is closely associated with the hypothalamus, in the ventral diencephalon, which controls its hormonal secretions. Pituitary hormones regulate different aspects of metabolism hence they are involved in maintenance of organism homeostasis, and important physiological functions such as growth, reproduction and stress. In consequence, pituitary hormone deficiencies, either congenital (1 in 3500 to 10000 births) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alatzoglou and Dattani, 2009</xref>) or acquired later in life, mostly caused by tumours or brain damage, are associated with significant morbidity. We, and others, have characterized a population of stem cells (SCs) in the mouse pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rizzoti et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andoniadou et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the differentiation of embryonic SC to generate endocrine cells has been demonstrated in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Suga et al., 2011</xref>). It would be of therapeutic interest to utilize SCs to generate endocrine cells; however, the limited efficiency of current protocols highlights the requirement for improved characterization of the mechanisms of endocrine cell fate acquisition.</p><p>The pituitary rudiment, or Rathke’s Pouch (RP), develops from the oral ectoderm. It comprises progenitors that will give rise to the pituitary anterior lobe (AL) ventrally, and the intermediate lobe (IL) dorsally. The AL comprises five pituitary endocrine cell types (somatotrophs, lactotrophs, thyrotrophs, corticotrophs and gonadotrophs), while the IL contains exclusively melanotrophs (for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rizzoti, 2015</xref>)). The third lobe, or posterior lobe (PL), is of neural origin and is comprised of glial cells and vasopressin and oxytocin hypothalamic axon terminals. During early pituitary development, RP progenitors initially proliferate, then gradually commit towards endocrine cell fates. Cell fate acquisition is associated with exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bilodeau et al., 2009</xref>) and an Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)-like process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pérez Millán et al., 2016</xref>). Birth-dating studies have moreover shown that the different endocrine lineages emerge during the same period, mostly between 11.5 and 13.5dpc in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis et al., 2011</xref>). The molecular events underlying endocrine differentiation have been relatively well described for each endocrine cell type. Within each lineage, expression of specific transcription factors is initiated as progenitors commit to an endocrine fate, such as TBX19 (also known as TPIT) along with NEUROD1 in future corticotrophs or with PAX7 in prospective melanotrophs, POU1F1 (also known as PIT1) in future somatotrophs, lactotrophs and thyrotrophs, and SF1 for gonadotroph cell fate (for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rizzoti, 2015</xref>)). It is still unclear however how the endocrine cell fates are initially specified, but the NOTCH pathway is known to be involved.</p><p>The NOTCH pathway plays a central role during cell fate acquisition in different organs. In vertebrates, the ligands, Delta-like or Jagged proteins, activate the transmembrane receptors NOTCH1-4. Following activation, cleavage of the NOTCH Intracellular Domain (NICD) allows its translocation to the nucleus, resulting in activation of target genes, such as the HES bHLH transcription factors, by the pathway nuclear effector RBPJ. Deregulation of the pathway is associated with inherited and degenerative diseases, but also with cancers in humans (for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hori et al., 2013</xref>)). In the pituitary, the receptors NOTCH 2 and 3, the ligands Jagged one and Delta-like 1, and downstream effectors of the HES and HEY families are expressed in embryonic progenitors; as endocrine lineages emerge expression of these genes is mostly confined to SCs and this persists post-natally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raetzman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, the ligands Dll1 and 3, and HES6, that does not bind DNA itself but suppresses HES1 activity, are present in differentiating cells, suggesting that the pathway is also active once cell fate is acquired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raetzman et al., 2004</xref>). Studies investigating the consequences of conditional deletion of RBPJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>Notch2</italic> and loss of the NOTCH targets <italic>Hes1</italic> and <italic>Hes5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raetzman et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nantie et al., 2014</xref>) support a role for NOTCH pathway in maintenance of an undifferentiated proliferative state to allow emergence of the different endocrine cell types. In contrast, overactivation of the pathway by conditional expression of NICD in either committed progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>), or differentiated corticotrophs and melanotrophs constituting the POMC lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldberg et al., 2011</xref>), results in a blockade of cell differentiation.</p><p>To better characterize the role of the NOTCH pathway during pituitary development, we have here manipulated its activity and compared outcomes in different cellular contexts. Using <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2007</xref>), we show that progenitors are particularly sensitive to NOTCH signalling, as cell fate acquisition is mostly prevented by NOTCH over-activation. However, we reveal that timing and/or duration of activation modulates cell responses; early activation results in exclusion of cells from the future IL, while activated cells remain in the IL if induction is performed 72 hr later. In contrast, in POU1F1 positive committed cells, NICD expression results in a blunted activation of NOTCH target genes. In consequence, there is no apparent effect on differentiation of somatotrophs, thyrotrophs and lactotrophs. However post-natally, as activation becomes more efficient, there is a reduction in Growth Hormone (GH) pituitary contents, suggesting that the function of GH-secreting somatotrophs is altered. Nonetheless, and in agreement with a minor role of NOTCH pathway in this lineage, we observe that deletion of <italic>Rbpj</italic> using the same POU1F1-Cre does not affect GH levels. Intrigued by the relatively modest effect of NOTCH activation in the POU1F1 lineage, we expressed NICD in the POMC lineage, where we observe an efficient activation of the pathway, showing that corticotrophs and melanotrophs remain sensitive to NOTCH activation. While cell fate acquisition did not appear affected initially, we observe a fast downregulation of differentiation markers expression, while SC markers are up-regulated, as well as a spectacular regression of IL soon after birth. This study uncovers an unexpected differential sensitivity to NOTCH activity according to timing and lineage identity. We propose that the sensitivity of the POMC lineage to NICD activity reflects a specific physiological requirement of NOTCH pathway to prevent differentiation toward the first endocrine cell lineage to emerge, the corticotrophs. Moreover, the lasting sensitivity of this lineage may have a pathological relevance because NOTCH activation has been associated with tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activation of NOTCH pathway in RP progenitors efficiently blocks cell fate acquisition</title><p>We initially examined cell fate acquisition potential after over-activation of the NOTCH pathway in RP progenitors.

We used quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and observed a significant induction of targets of the <italic>Hes</italic> and <italic>Hey</italic> families, showing that NOTCH pathway can be efficiently over-activated in RP progenitors.

Hes1</italic> and <italic>Hes5</italic> are closely related and are frequently expressed in complementary patterns, in particular in the developing nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hatakeyama et al., 2004</xref>). In the developing pituitary, <italic>Hes5</italic> expression has previously been described as undetectable, but it is up-regulated upon deletion of <italic>Hes1</italic> and compensates for its loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kita et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore induction of <italic>Hes5</italic> expression in <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOP- NICD1 or 2/+</sup></italic> is physiologically relevant.</p><p>We then analysed expression levels of markers for endocrine and progenitor cells in <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOP- NICD1 or 2/+</sup></italic> pituitaries at E18.5 by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). The transcription factor PROP1 is expressed in pituitary progenitors where it is required for cell fate progression toward commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pérez Millán et al., 2016</xref>) and has been proposed to be a direct target of NOTCH pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>). In agreement with these data, we observe an upregulation of its expression upon NOTCH activation, which only reaches significance using the NICD2 allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). <italic>Prop1</italic> is rapidly down-regulated as cells differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoshida et al., 2011</xref>), therefore, up-regulation of its expression suggests an impairment in cell differentiation. Persistent NICD1, but not NICD2, expression leads indeed to a significant reduction in <italic>Pou1f1</italic>, which encodes a transcription factor required for maintenance of GH (growth hormone), PRL (prolactin secreted by lactotrophs) and TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone secreted by thyrotrophs) secreting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bodner et al., 1988</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition, we also observe a reduction in the expression of <italic>Pax7,</italic> the product of which is a pioneer factor for melanotroph fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Budry et al., 2012</xref>), and <italic>Pomc</italic> (proopiomelanocortin), which encodes the precursor of the hormone secreted by corticotrophs (ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone) and melanotrophs (MSH, melanocyte stimulating hormone) when either NICD1 or NICD2 are overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> is not significantly altered. In summary, these results indicate that melanotrophs, endocrine cells of the POU1F1 lineage, and possibly corticotrophs, are affected by NOTCH over-activation. In addition, NICD1 appears more efficient, and/or has a specific effect on the POU1F1 lineage that we do not observe using NICD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting non-redundant function for NOTCH cellular domains.</p><p>We subsequently performed 3D reconstitution of <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOP NICD1 or 2/+</sup></italic> pituitaries at 15.5dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We observe clear malformations of the gland with varying degrees of severity. Using NICD1, 2 out of 7 mutant embryos presented a severe phenotype, while using NICD2, 3 out of 5 were severely affected, suggesting that NICD2 was associated with more serious defects. However, this effect may be confounded by varying levels of Cre activity because other studies utilizing Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup> have also reported variations in phenotype severity such as prostate defects in <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup>;Fgfr2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2007</xref>), and spinal defects in <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup>;Erk5<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loveridge et al., 2017</xref>). The AL appears smaller, particularly the lateral wings of the developing gland. In addition, the progenitor zone, surrounding the pituitary cleft appears enlarged and folded, suggesting a retention of progenitors. The sphenoid bone is sometimes affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, high severity phenotype) and this could be a direct consequence of the activity of NKX3.1Cre in the developing skeleton, or indirectly because of the abnormal development of the gland, as we observed previously in <italic>Sox2<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nkx3.1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldsmith et al., 2016</xref>). Over-activation of NOTCH signalling in the developing skeleton causes severe developmental abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hosaka et al., 2013</xref>) and this likely explains the lethality of <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOPNICD1 or 2/+</sup></italic> newborns.</p><p>We next assessed cell fate acquisition potential in mutant pituitaries by analysing the number of NICD1 expressing cells maintaining expression of SOX2 at 18.5dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>). We restricted here our analysis to NICD1 as this allele seemed to affect endocrine lineages more efficiently than NICD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We can identify cells in which <italic>Rosa26<sup>floxSTOPNICD1</sup></italic> has been recombined because they express GFP, as the NICD allele includes an IRES-nuclearGFP cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murtaugh et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We analysed embryos expressing <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic>, induced at 9.5dpc, or <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> in combination with <italic>Rosa26<sup>floxSTOPNICD1</sup></italic> and, as controls, with the Cre reporter allele <italic>Rosa26<sup>ReYFP</sup></italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Srinivas et al., 2001</xref>)). Of note, cellular patterns of NICD1iresGFP and eYFP expression differ because GFP is nuclear while eYFP is present throughout the cell, resulting in apparently increased levels of eYFP. However, we observed that the number of fluorescent cells resulting from recombination of the <italic>Rosa26<sup>ReYFP</sup></italic> allele always appears higher than that of GFP from <italic>Rosa26<sup>floxSTOPNICD1</sup></italic>, particularly when we use an inducible Cre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This is therefore likely due to a difference in recombination efficiency between the two alleles. In addition, GFP in <italic>Rosa26<sup>floxSTOPNICD1</sup></italic> is preceded by an IRES and this could result in reduced expression levels. We did not observe any TUNEL activity so this difference is not due to a loss of GFP positive cells by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In control Cre; <italic>Rosa26<sup>ReYFP/+</sup></italic> embryos quantification revealed only a small proportion, less than 10%, of recombined cells retaining expression of SOX2 in AL (we excluded the cleft region where SOX2 positive progenitors are maintained), because the vast majority of early progenitors have differentiated at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rizzoti et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, in either <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT2/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOPNICD1/+</sup></italic> embryos, the majority of recombined cells maintain SOX2 expression and do not express endocrine differentiation markers such as GH and POMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.F-H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Expression of SOX9, another marker of pituitary SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fauquier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rizzoti et al., 2013</xref>), is observed in most NICD1iresnucGFP positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, over-activation of the NOTCH pathway in RP progenitors efficiently blocks cell fate acquisition. In addition, timing and/or duration of NOTCH activation appear important, because the earliest it is induced, comparing <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> induced at 9.5dpc (84% SOX2;GFP double positive/GFP at 18.5dpc) and <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, active at 12.5dpc (60% SOX2;GFP double positive/GFP at 18.5dpc), the more potent is its effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33318.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Differential timing of NOTCH activation IL progenitors has contrasting phenotypic consequences.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence of 18.5dpc <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>ReYFP</sup></italic> and <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>flSTOPNICD1/+</sup></italic> pituitaries.

NKX3.1Cre is mostly active in dorsal RP and cell recombination is essentially ubiquitous in the prospective IL. As a consequence, and in agreement with a blockade of cell differentiation induced by NOTCH over-activation, melanotrophs are dramatically reduced in <italic>Nkx3.1Cre;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOP-NICD1</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) while instead SOX2 is maintained at high levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). However, some cells are still able to commit to a melanotroph fate, because a proportion of NICD1iresnucGFP positive cells express low levels of PAX7, but are unable to upregulate POMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In sharp contrast, we do not observe any NICD1iresnucGFP-positive cells in <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOP</sup></italic><sup>NICD1</sup> IL, when Cre is induced at 9.5dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> lower panel). This is clearly due to NOTCH activation, because in <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT2/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>ReYFP/+</sup></italic> pituitaries, IL comprises eYFP-positive cells, which as expected reveal a mosaic pattern of induction of cell recombination following tamoxifen induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> upper panel).</p><p>The differential distribution of NICD1iresnucGFP-positive cells in <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> and <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOPNICD1</sup></italic> IL could be due to a difference in the pattern of recombination. This is because <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> is active homogenously across what will become the IL while <italic>Sox2</italic><sup><italic>CreERT2</italic> </sup>is induced in a mosaic pattern. Alternatively, or in addition, the difference could be explained by the variation in timing of activation because <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> is mostly active at 12.5dpc, 72 hr after we induced <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> at 9.5dpc. To discriminate between these two explanations, we examined <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOPNICD1</sup></italic> IL following induction at 12.5dpc, mimicking <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> timing, but in a mosaic pattern. At 18.5dpc we observe NICD1iresnucGFP positive cells in IL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, similarly to what we saw in <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOP-NICD1</sup></italic> IL, these cells are unable to upregulate POMC expression, but some commit to a melanotroph fate and express low levels of PAX7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Therefore, it is the variation in timing of activation in dorsal RP that underlines the phenotypic differences observed between <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOPNICD1</sup></italic> induced at 9.5dpc and <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOPNICD1</sup></italic>.</p><p>To understand how recombined cells disappear from the IL of <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT2/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOPNICD1</sup></italic> induced at 9.5dpc, we harvested pituitaries earlier during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We never detected TUNEL-positive cells in IL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, at 12.5dpc we observed IL NICD1iresnucGFP-positive cells and these are essentially restricted to the ventral most part of the developing IL, while control embryos show an equal distribution across IL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). More precisely, we observe patches of IL NICD1iresnucGFP positive cells apparently reaching toward the AL progenitor layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We do also observe regions of apparent contact between the future IL and AL in control embryos, but these are rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To assess epithelial integrity in mutant cells, we examined E-cadherin and ZO-1 expression, present respectively in adherent and tight junctions. Alterations in localisation of both proteins, normally present in the apical lateral membranes, are observed with a relocalisation around the plasma membrane, and sometimes loss from the apical ones, in IL NICD1iresnucGFP-positive cells closest to Rathke’s cleft. This suggests a loss of epithelial polarity of mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Experimental induction of cell fate change within epithelial cells is known to result in cell extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Thompson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bielmeier et al., 2016</xref>). We suggest that in IL, over-activation of NOTCH pathway, resulting in blockade of cell commitment and therefore singling out mutant cells, induces an apical extrusion of recombined cells toward AL. This phenomenon only happens in a narrow time window because overactivation performed 72 hr later still leads to a blockade of cell fate acquisition, but cell extrusion is no longer observed, or is significantly less efficient. Therefore, variations in timing and/or duration of NOTCH pathway activation result in strikingly different outcomes during IL development, reflecting modulation of cell responses to NOTCH activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Expression of NICD in the POU1F1 lineage does not alter cell fate acquisition, but post-natal function of somatotrophs is altered</title><p>We then decided to examine the effects of NOTCH overactivation in committed cells.

Our experiments reveal an unexpected differential sensitivity to NICD expression between lineages and, in consequence, provide a better understanding of the physiological role of the pathway during pituitary development. Progenitors, normally exposed and responsive to NOTCH signalling, are sensitive to its activation and this results in a blockade of cell fate acquisition. However, we show here that timing and/or duration of activation in progenitors differentially affects cell fate acquisition and maintenance in the prospective IL. Strikingly, in differentiating endocrine cells, we then uncover that NOTCH ectopic activation induces a blunted response in the POU1F1 lineage, while POMC-positive cells remain sensitive to its effect. Consequently, cell fate acquisition and maintenance of differentiation in POU1F1-positive cells is apparently not affected, suggesting that the NOTCH pathway does not play a role for this process in this lineage. In agreement, deletion of the NOTCH effector RBPJ has no apparent phenotypic consequence in this lineage. In contrast, in the POMC lineage, NOTCH activation results in a gradual dedifferentiation of both corticotrophs and melanotrophs toward a progenitor-like state. Taken together these results demonstrate first that the NOTCH pathway maintains progenitors in an undifferentiated state, however, response to activation is modulated in time in dorsal progenitors. Second, sensitivity to NOTCH signalling in the developing pituitary varies in the different endocrine lineages. We suggest that the maintenance of high responsiveness to NOTCH activation in the POMC lineage, but not in the POU1F1 cells, points to a physiological requirement for the NOTCH pathway to specifically prevent corticotroph and melanotroph cell differentiation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Role of NOTCH pathway in progenitors.</title><p>When NOTCH signalling is prevented in pituitary progenitors, either by deleting <italic>RBPJ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>), the target genes <italic>Hes1</italic> and <italic>Hes5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raetzman et al., 2007</xref>), or the <italic>Notch2</italic> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nantie et al., 2014</xref>), reduction of cell proliferation and precocious differentiation are observed. Conversely, ectopic expression of <italic>Hes1</italic> in both gonadotrophs and thyrotrophs blocks their differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raetzman et al., 2007</xref>), and ectopic expression of <italic>Notch2</italic> in the same cells delays differentiation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raetzman et al., 2006</xref>). This suggests that NOTCH signalling maintains progenitors in an undifferentiated state and that downregulation of its activity is required for cells to differentiate, as observed in other tissues (for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bray, 2016</xref>)). In agreement with these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raetzman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>);(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nantie et al., 2014</xref>), we show here that maintained activation of the NOTCH pathway in pituitary progenitors efficiently blocks cell fate acquisition. However, progression of progenitors, exemplified in the pituitary by the transition from an early SOX2-positive;SOX9-negative highly proliferative cell to a SOX2;SOX9 double-positive more quiescent progenitor/SC at late gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rizzoti et al., 2016</xref>), does not appear to be prevented by NOTCH activity. This is because we still observe up-regulation of SOX9 expression in <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOP-</sup></italic><sup>NICD1</sup> progenitors. Therefore, NOTCH specifically affects cell fate acquisition, but apparently not other aspects of progenitor identity and fate.</p><p>Blockade of cell fate acquisition appears more efficient in <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOP-</sup><sup>NICD1</sup></italic> progenitors induced at 9.5dpc than in <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOP-</sup></italic><sup>NICD1</sup> ones, because the proportion of recombined cells that retain SOX2 expression is significantly higher in the former samples. In RP, <italic>Nkx3.1</italic> is initially expressed at 10.5dpc, in a mosaic pattern, then up-regulated in the dorsal region of RP at 12.5 until at least 14.5dpc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Treier et al., 2001</xref>). This domain encompasses that of SOX2 expression, and 70% of SOX2-positive cells are also EYFP-positive in 12.5dpc <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup>;Rosa26<sup>ReYFP</sup></italic> RPs (S. Goldsmith, PhD thesis). It is possible that some cells where <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> is active are not progenitors since we have not established co-localisation between NKX3.1 and SOX2 at all stages; this would explain why fewer cells express SOX2 in <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOP-</sup></italic><sup>NICD1</sup> compared to <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOP-</sup></italic><sup>NICD1</sup> pituitaries. However, it is likely that the earlier NOTCH activation is induced, the more efficiently cell fate acquisition is prevented. This implies that, as progenitors progress toward commitment, some become less sensitive to its effects, perhaps those up-regulating POU1F1 expression (see below), because we do observe some rare cells where SOX2 and POU1F1 co-localise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fauquier et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The differential sensitivity of progenitors is also well illustrated by the contrasting effects of NOTCH activation in IL progenitors. Indeed, in <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Rosa26<sup>floxSTOP-</sup><sup>NICD1</sup></italic> embryos we observe an exclusion of recombined cells from the future IL. This exclusion appears to be an active process because recombined cells lose some epithelial characteristics and appear to integrate into the AL. This process is reminiscent of a phenomenon recently described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> where juxtaposition, within an epithelium, of cells with different fates results in extrusion of single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bielmeier et al., 2016</xref>). A similar mechanism could operate here, where recombined cells with higher levels of NOTCH activity are singled-out because they are unable to commit to a dorsal/IL fate. Alternatively, or in addition, NOTCH signalling activity is polarized in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perez-Mockus and Schweisguth, 2017</xref>). It is therefore possible that our NICD expression approach directly affects epithelial properties. Surprisingly, however, this effect is transient, because activation of the NOTCH pathway 72 hr later, using either <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> or inducing <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> at 12.5dpc, does not result in cell extrusion. Instead, as we observe in AL, cell fate acquisition is mostly prevented, with some rare cells committing to a PAX7 positive melanotroph fate, but unable to progress to differentiation and to up-regulate POMC expression. These data suggest that between 9.5 and 12.5 dpc a dorsal fate may be imparted to cells in the prospective IL, and that this regionalisation information is sensitive to NOTCH signalling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>NOTCH signalling in POU1F1 and POMC lineages.</title><p>The effects of NICD ectopic expression in the POU1F1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>) and POMC lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldberg et al., 2011</xref>) have previously been reported. However, both the approaches used and the outcomes are different from ours. Zhu et al engineered a POU1F1-NICD transgene and observe a dramatic blockade of cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>), which is in sharp contrast with our observations. This discrepancy may be explained by an earlier and maybe higher expression of the POU1F1-NICD transgene compared to NICD in our <italic>Pou1f1-Cre;Rosa26<sup>flSTOPNICD1/+</sup></italic>samples. If the transgene was expressed in cells that are not yet committed, then blockade of cell differentiation would be expected. Similarly, in the <italic>Pomc-Cre;Rosa26<sup>flSTOPNICD1/+</sup></italic> embryos described in Goldberg et al, POMC expression is never detected, suggesting that corticotrophs and melanotrophs do not emerge, again in contrast with our results. This discrepancy could be explained by an earlier expression of the <italic>Pomc-cre</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balthasar et al., 2004</xref>) used in Goldberg et al, which is different from the one used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langlais et al., 2013</xref>). We have previously characterised this Cre transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langlais et al., 2013</xref>) in the embryonic pituitary, and showed that it matches endogenous POMC expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldsmith et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Consistently, our results show that neither ectopic expression of NICD, nor deletion of RBPJ in the POU1F1 lineage affect cell fate acquisition. In agreement with an apparent absence of a phenotypic effect, we show that ectopic expression of NICD hardly affects expression of NOTCH target genes in the embryonic pituitary, demonstrating that the cells are relatively insensitive to its effect. This lack of responsiveness may be explained by sequestration of NOTCH responsive enhancers by other factors, as observed in different contexts (for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bray, 2016</xref>)). Therefore, the classical NOTCH pathway is unlikely to be directly involved for POU1F1 lineage commitment and differentiation. However, there is a significant activation of the pathway by NICD post-natally and a reduction in GH production and secretion, therefore, the NOTCH pathway activation compromises some aspects of somatotroph function.</p><p>In contrast, in the POMC lineage, responsiveness to NICD expression is comparable to what is observed in progenitors. Following activation, expression of <italic>Tbx19</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lamolet et al., 2001</xref>), the key determinant of melanotroph and corticotroph identity, is gradually downregulated in the embryo. However, expression of <italic>Neurod1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lamolet et al., 2004</xref>), transiently required for early corticotroph differentiation, is not significantly affected. Both TBX19 and NEUROD1 can activate the expression of POMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lamolet et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poulin et al., 1997</xref>). We therefore propose that unaffected levels of NEUROD1 and sufficient levels of TBX19 in early stages of terminal differentiation allow up-regulation of POMC expression in <italic>Pomc-Cre;Rosa26<sup>flSTOPNICD1/+</sup></italic> corticotrophs. Corticotrophs are the first pituitary endocrine cells to up-regulate expression of the hormone they secrete. Our results point to a direct and specific effect of NOTCH signalling in preventing their differentiation, presumably through down-regulation of <italic>Tbx19</italic>. This is in agreement with results obtained in pituitary organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Suga et al., 2011</xref>) where efficient and specific generation of corticotrophs is observed after inhibition of NOTCH pathway. In IL, expression of the melanotroph pioneer factor <italic>Pax7</italic> is not affected, therefore cell fate acquisition is not impaired by NOTCH activation. However, as observed in corticotrophs, gradual downregulation of <italic>Tbx19</italic> results in loss of POMC expression post-natally.</p><p>Regression of both IL and AL in cells with <italic>Pomc-Cre;Rosa26<sup>flSTOPNICD1/+</sup></italic> is associated with up-regulation of the pituitary SC markers SOX2 and SOX9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rizzoti et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that the cells partially dedifferentiate. In agreement with this hypothesis, IL mutant cells proliferate more, at least early post-natally. We observe a differential expression of the two SOX transcription factors post-natally: SOX9 is strongly up-regulated and maintained in <italic>Pomc-Cre;Rosa26<sup>flSTOPNICD1/+</sup></italic> IL but not in AL. In contrast SOX2, normally present in melanotrophs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldsmith et al., 2016</xref>), is up-regulated in <italic>Pomc-Cre;Rosa26<sup>flSTOPNICD1/+</sup></italic> corticotrophs. Both factors belong to different SOX families therefore, they do not perform redundant functions. In addition, in different cellular contexts, expression of SOX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pan et al., 2013</xref>) or SOX9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martini et al., 2013</xref>) is induced in response to NOTCH activation, and this is required for NOTCH-dependant progenitor maintenance. The significance of this differential expression is unclear. However we show here that deletion of <italic>Sox9</italic> in <italic>Pomc-Cre;Rosa26<sup>flSTOPNICD1/+</sup></italic> pituitaries does not prevent IL regression, suggesting that SOX9 does not play a significant role in the phenotype. Further analysis is necessary to better characterise the role of these factors following NOTCH activation in the POMC lineage.</p><p>In conclusion, the regression of both melanotrophs and corticotrophs observed in response to NICD expression shows that the NOTCH pathway most likely has a direct role in preventing POMC lineage differentiation. In addition, the lasting sensitivity of this lineage to NOTCH activation and its dedifferentiating effect may be of relevance in pathological situations, such as tumorigenesis. This also raises the possibility that this lineage may be more easily reprogrammed, potentially to promote regeneration. It is tempting to speculate that this specificity reflects the absolute requirement for a functioning hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis for survival. Further characterization of NICD action in this lineage is now essential.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup></italic></td><td>Lin, Y., Liu, G., Zhang, Y., Hu, Y.P., Yu, K., <break/>Lin, C., McKeehan, K., Xuan, J.W., <break/>Ornitz, D.M., Shen, M.M.<italic>, et al.</italic> (2007). <break/>Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 <break/>tyrosine kinase is required for prostatic <break/>morphogenesis and the acquisition of strict <break/>androgen dependency for adult tissue <break/>homeostasis.

We have performed lineage tracing in <italic>Nkx3.1<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Rosa26<sup>ReYFP/+</sup></italic>pituitaries at 18.5dpc and quantified the percentage of eYFP;hormone positive cells for each endocrine lineage of the pituitary. This work was performed by Sam Goldsmith for his doctoral thesis in our lab, so we have now included his name in the author list and specified his contribution. This analysis shows that Nkx3.1Cre is mostly active in IL POMC positive melanotroph precursors, followed by POMC positive corticotrophs, and somatotrophs. These data support our results because we show that over-activation of NOTCH pathway using this Cre driver affects POMC expressing cells most significantly. Less than 40% of gonadotrophs are present in the progeny of Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup> expressing cells and we did not observe a reduction in <italic>Lhb</italic> expression by RT-qPCR. However, we would expect that NOTCH activation in precursors blocks gonadotroph differentiation, and therefore a reduction in hormone levels. It is possible that such a defect affecting such a proportion of recombined cells is too low to detect an effect by RT-qPCR, and/or that cells of the lineage that did not recombine the NOTCH allele can compensate and restore normal numbers. In addition, determination of gonadotrophs starts at 12.5dpc as GnRHR is upregulated, which is the same stage as Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup> is active. Therefore, it is alternatively possible that future gonadotrophs are already determined, and in consequence less sensitive to NOTCH activation, as we observed in the Pou1F1 lineage. Similarly, TSH levels are not affected but transient embryonic thyrotrophs that differentiate very early, at the time when Nkx3.1<sup>Cre</sup> is active, would have differentiated before NICD is expressed.</p><p>In addition, this sentence is added in the Results section:</p><p>“Lineage tracing analysis of NKX3.1Cre confirms that this driver is predominantly active in future melanotrophs, and also, albeit less efficiently, in all anterior lobe endocrine populations (Figure 1A,B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarly, a novel Pou1f1Cre strain is used for the study but lacks validation via lineage tracing to confirm that Cre expression is faithful to the Pou1f1 lineage. This should be shown in the Supplementary data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed lineage tracing for the <italic>Pou1f1-Cre</italic> strain at 18.5dpc. We have inserted a new figure, Figure 4—figure supplement 1. We show that there is some ectopic activity in the corticotroph and gonadotroph lineages, as we respectively observed some reporter;POMC and reporter;LH double positive cells. We analysed POU1F1-Cre progeny and observed that the vast majority of recombined cells are PIT1 positive 78.2%( ± 11.16SD, n=3) while we estimated the ectopic activity (reporter positive;PIT1 negative cells) represents 4.9% ( ± 2.5 SD, n=3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) More data needs to be provided to bolster the argument that NICD expressing cells are extruded and incorporated into the anterior lobe. At present only a single example is provided. More quantification of the numbers of mutant versus wild type in which this phenomenon is seen is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize because the legend describing the quantification was really poor and gave the impression that this was not done properly. We have now amended the legend, added one more mutant embryo in the quantification and, importantly, added an annotated scheme to explain how the counting was done. We are confident this shows clearly that the quantification was performed adequately and provides a clear and significant account of the biased localization of recombined cells toward the pouch lumen.</p><p>Figure legend “In control <italic>Sox2<sup>CreERT2/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>ReYFP</sup></italic>pituitaries, eYFP positive cells are homogeneously distributed in IL (n=5 embryos, 58 ( ± 8.5SD) cells were counted/embryo). In contrast, 85% of NICD1iresGFP positive cells in mutant embryos are found in the ventral half of IL (n=5 embryos, 29 ( ± 23.6SD) cells were counted/embryo). Unpaired t test performed, p=0.0045 after angular transformation of percentages.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Finally, to confirm the conclusion that E-cadherin and hence epithelial polarity is potentially disrupted, ideally further polarity markers should be used to confirm this finding in additional mutants as compared to wild type controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now examined the expression of ZO-1 localized at tight junctions in epithelial cells. We also observe a loss/aberrant localization of this protein, similarly to the alterations observed for Ecadherin, normally restricted to adherent junctions. These observations, made exclusively in NICD;GFP positive cells, reinforce our conclusions that epithelial polarity is lost in the NICD cells closest to Rathke’s pouch cleft. We are not excluding the possibility that this phenomenon happens in normal embryos, but even if it does, it is extremely rare as we hardly see these zones of apparent contact between the two epithelia. In contrast, these are frequent in our mutants and they correlate very well with the succeeding absence of mutant cells in IL. Because we are looking at mosaics, where most cells are effectively wild type and a much smaller proportion are mutant, we do not think it is necessary to look at purely wild type controls. Indeed, this type of mosaic analysis where only the mutant cells exhibit the phenotype is a robust way of addressing the question, eliminating variability between embryos. In addition, we have also examined expression of Slug, as NOTCH activation has been connected to EMT. We do not observe any up-regulation of Slug in NICD;GFP positive cells suggesting that EMT is not induced in these cells. Finally, we also examined expression of N-cadherin as there is a switch of expression from E-cadherin in epithelial cells, to N-cadherin in mesenchymal cells but N-cadherin was present throughout Rathke’s pouch and its pattern didn’t seem altered in NICD;GFP positive cells.</p><p>The results were modified as follows.</p><p>To assess epithelial integrity in mutant cells, we examined E-cadherin and ZO-1 expression, present respectively in adherent and tight junctions. Alterations in localisation of both proteins, normally present in the apical lateral membranes, are observed with a relocalisation around the plasma membrane, and sometimes loss from the apical ones, in IL NICD1iresnucGFP-positive cells closest to Rathke’s cleft. This suggests a loss of epithelial polarity of mutant cells (Figure 2E, F).</p></body></sub-article></article>
