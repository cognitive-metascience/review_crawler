However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying intestinal sensing of specific nutrients, especially micronutrients such as vitamins, and the connections to downstream physiological responses in animals remain underexplored. We have established a system to analyze the intestinal response to vitamin B<sub>2</sub> (VB2) deficiency in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and demonstrated that VB2 level critically impacts food uptake and foraging behavior by regulating specific protease gene expression and intestinal protease activity. We show that this impact is mediated by TORC1 signaling through reading the FAD-dependent ATP level. Thus, our study in live animals uncovers a VB2-sensing/response pathway that regulates food-uptake, a mechanism by which a common signaling pathway translates a specific nutrient signal into physiological activities, and the importance of gut microbiota in supplying micronutrients to animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26243.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26243.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26243.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals are able to sense changes in the quality of their diet, which allows them to adapt to environments where the availability of nutrients fluctuates. For example, if a food lacks essential nutrients, or contains toxic molecules, animals can avoid it. If food is scarce, they can alter their metabolism to compensate. This assessment is done in the intestine, but exactly how it works is not fully understood, especially when it comes to vitamins.</p><p>Animals require Vitamin B2 to grow and remain healthy. This vitamin is involved in the process by which cells make chemical energy, which is needed to fuel many biological processes. Vitamin B2 is found in the diet, and is also produced by bacteria living in the gut. Here, Qi et al. used a worm called <italic>Caenorhabiditis elegans</italic> to examine how the gut detects this vitamin, and what impact this has on how the worm behaves and develops.</p><p>The experiments show that when the worms’ diet includes live bacteria, they developed normally from larvae into adults. However, if the worms were fed only bacteria that had been killed by cooking and exposure to light – which damages Vitamin B2 – they stopped eating, shut down the production of two key digestive enzymes and stopped growing. Supplying these worms with extra vitamin B2, or extra digestive enzymes, stimulated the worms to start eating the cooked bacteria.</p><p>Further experiments show that when Vitamin B2 is scarce, the levels of chemical energy in the worms’ cells decrease. This drop in energy is sensed by a complex of molecules called TORC1, which triggers the changes in the worms’ metabolism and behavior.</p><p>The findings of Qi et al. indicate that gut microbes can play important roles in providing micronutrients like Vitamin B2. Many of the molecular pathways used by these worms have equivalents in humans. Therefore, further research on these pathways in worms may help us to understand how the human body responds to nutrients and how metabolic diseases may alter these pathways.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26243.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26243.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>nutrient sensing</kwd><kwd>Riboflavin</kwd><kwd>TOR</kwd><kwd>FAD</kwd><kwd>energy metabolism</kwd><kwd>ATP sensing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name><name><surname>Kniazeva</surname><given-names>Marina</given-names></name><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The availability of an essential dietary micronutrient is evaluated by an intestinal signaling system that in turn regulates food-uptake and response behaviors by modulating protease expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To survive challenging environments with fluctuating nutrient resources, animals have acquired the ability to evaluate food quality, which may lead to avoidance of food lacking certain essential nutrients or containing toxic molecules, and to alterations in developmental and metabolic programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bargmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bjordal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iwatsuki and Torii, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kniazeva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Melo and Ruvkun, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tang and Han, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Watson et al., 2014</xref>). Besides neuronal sensory systems that permit rapid feeding decision, food quality is also evaluated by the intestine-initiated systems that may be more sensitive in detecting the deficiency of certain types of nutrients including micronutrients and are capable of dictating changes in cellular/developmental programs as well as food uptake and seeking behaviors. However, the metabolic and signaling events in the intestine that are involved in evaluating the availability of specific nutrients, and the mechanisms underlying the connection of these signaling activities to food uptake/foraging behaviors, as well as developmental programs, remain largely unexplored. More specifically, although the functions of TOR complexes in responding to cellular nutrient changes (e.g. amino acids and ATP) have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dennis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Efeyan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>), the functions of these sensing activities in whole animals under true physiological conditions, including responses to nutrient variations in food, remain to be investigated.</p><p>Vitamin B<sub>2</sub> (VB2) is the precursor and component of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) that are the redox cofactors of a large number of flavoproteins involved in various metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joosten and van Berkel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lienhart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Powers, 2003</xref>). Animals obtain VB2 from diet and likely also from gut microbes, although the VB2 contribution from gut microbes has not been well documented. VB2 deficiency has been associated with various human diseases and health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Powers, 2003</xref>). It would thus be reasonable to speculate that a food-quality monitoring system in animals can sense VB2 in food and then regulate food response behaviors, and such a monitoring system may function in the intestine. Such a potential VB2-sensing mechanism is explored in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Heat-killed bacteria are low-quality food that <italic>C. elegans</italic> cannot use</title><p>When fed live <italic>E. coli</italic> strain OP50, a standard laboratory food for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, all hatched larvae develop to adults within 3 days at 20°C.

Among micronutrients tested, we found that vitamin B2 (VB2) supplementation partially but significantly recovered larval growth as indicated by increased gonad length at day 7, which indicated the increased usage of the food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These animals fed VB2 supplemented food still grew very slowly, reaching mid to late larval stages based on gonad length and vulval development compared to that of well-fed worms, but never reach adulthood by day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). This slow growth indicated that VB2 supplementation does not completely compensate for the undefined deficiencies of heat-killed bacteria, which suggested that multiple essential nutrients are lacking in heat-killed bacteria. However, the prominent increase in growth suggested that VB2 may play a critical role in a food-quality evaluation pathway. Our behavior assays showed that VB2 supplementation increased the preference for heat-killed bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Furthermore, the FAD benefit is also TORC1 dependent, as pretreatment with RNAi targeting <italic>daf-15/raptor</italic> essentially eliminated the effect of FAD supplementation on protease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>We then further analyzed the functional relationship between FAD and TORC1 by decreasing FAD production through RNAi of a FAD synthetase gene (<italic>flad-1</italic>) and a riboflavin transporter gene (<italic>rft-2)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biswas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gandhimathi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liuzzi et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The similarity of the data between <italic>flad-1</italic> and <italic>rft-2</italic> further supports that FAD plays the key role in mediating VB2 effect on intestinal protease activity.</p><p>FAD-associated proteins are involved in many metabolic events including fatty acid metabolism, the TCA cycle and electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lienhart et al., 2013</xref>). Since many of these events are related to energy production, and TORC1 is known to be an ATP sensor in mammals and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dennis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hay and Sonenberg, 2004</xref>), we tested if the ATP level serves as a signal to relay the impact of VB2/FAD on TORC1 and downstream protease activity. We found that the ATP level was indeed dramatically reduced in worms fed HK-OP50 compared to that in worms fed live OP50, whereas VB2/FAD supplementation partially recovered the level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Consistently, reducing FAD production by <italic>flad-1(RNAi)</italic> in the first generation of wild-type worms also reduced ATP and the reduction was eliminated by FAD supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Therefore, the decreased ATP level is a major cellular consequence of VB2 deficiency. To provide further evidence that ATP reduction is causal to the reduction in TORC1 and protease activity, we used RNAi to partially inactivate <italic>atp-2/ATP5B</italic> that encodes an ATP synthetase known to affect ATP production in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chin et al., 2014</xref>).

Together, these data support the hypothesis that the ATP level change mediates the impact of VB2 on TORC1 and intestinal protease activity. Our data do not exclude potential impacts of other metabolic products from FAD-associated enzymes in the process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We identified an intestinal food-quality evaluation mechanism by which animals detect vitamin B2 deficiency by the FAD-ATP-TORC1-ELT-2 pathway that dictates food uptake and foraging behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Such a mechanism with conserved functions enhances survival in wild environments by discriminating against low-quality food. Unlike rapid neuronal food responses that facilitate quick food consumption decisions, the intestinal system described here requires a rather slow, multi-step process after the ingestion of food. It should be noted that our findings do not exclude the involvement of sensory neurons in the food evaluation systems described in this study. The intestinal process may be evolved specifically to detect the deficiency of specific nutrients such as vitamins that elude the neuronal sensory system that may be honed to detect the presence of major nutrients and toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bargmann, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandrashekar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Watson et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to VB2, we have recently shown that intestinal deficiencies in certain fatty acids and pyrimidine are also sensed by signaling systems in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to alter reproductive/developmental programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kniazeva et al., 2015</xref>). These examples also suggest that the protective response to nutrient deficiency by the intestine-initiated mechanism commonly includes regulation of developmental/reproductive programs, in addition to food behaviors. VB2 deficiency likely affects the functions of a large number of flavoproteins involved in many essential cellular functions; the responses by TORC1, including protease regulation and developmental arrest, may be considered the last and emergent protective actions by the animal.</p><p>TORC1 is well known for its role in sensing multiple biomolecules including amino acids, lipids and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dennis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Efeyan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). However, what this ATP-TORC1-sensing activity might do in a whole organism under physiological conditions including response to environmental challenges is a fascinating and largely unexplored question. This study provides a perfect example to address this question as we present evidence for that ATP serves as an intermediate nutrient to mediate the sensing of VB2/FAD by TORC1. Moreover, our study may be the first to connect TORC1 sensing to a specific micronutrient in a model organism. The versatility of TORC1 in responding to the deficiency of multiple nutritional/metabolic inputs suggests that the TORC1-protease pathway may be used to evaluate the levels of multiple essential nutrients in food sources, albeit that the evaluation process for other nutrients in the intestine remain to be demonstrated in vivo.</p><p>This study may also indicate the importance of live bacteria in providing micronutrients, such as VB2, to animals and may thus be highly related to human health, as we obtain vitamins from gut microbes in addition to food sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">LeBlanc et al., 2013</xref>). Since VB2 is known to be light sensitive and heat labile in aqueous solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sheraz et al., 2014</xref>), the contribution of VB2 from gut microbes could be significantly undervalued.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a very interesting paper that describes responses to deficiency in a critical micronutrient (Vitamin B2) in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The authors show that the failure of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to develop on heat-killed food derives in large part from VB2 deficiency, which impairs activity of critical metabolic pathways, leading to decreased ATP production, reduced TORC1 activity, reduced expression of key intestinal digestive proteases, and increased foraging. The findings are quite novel, and will be of wide interest in the nutrition, metabolism, and TOR fields. The data are of high quality and the conclusions seem to be generally solid, but some additional points need to be addressed:</p><p>1) It is difficult to understand how worms could grow in the absence of vitamin B2, even if the asp13/14 proteases were activated by downstream intervention. Isn't VB2 required for essential biochemical reactions? Are the worms able to liberate sequestered VB2 via protease activity, or to activate a cryptic VB2 biosynthetic pathway? This seems like an issue that should be addressed (see comments 5 and 6, below). Alternatively, it's possible that the &quot;rescued&quot; worms only grow a little bit, but we can't tell because we are never told the size of the gonad in an adult. More on this below (specific comments #4, 5, 7).</p><p>2) How do the authors know that sensory neurons are not involved?

Conversely, it's not clear to me why, in the same section, they say that the micronutrients were provided &quot;likely through secretion&quot;. In fact, the two sentences seem to contradict one another.</p><p>4) The authors say, in the first paragraph of the subsection “Proteases ASP-13 and ASP-14 and GATA factor ELT-2 play critical roles in VB2-promoted protease activity and food usability”, that asp-13/14 OE improved larval growth, but in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> they show only gonad length.

More on this below (specific comments #4, 5, 7).</italic> </p><p>The reviewers have raised several very interesting questions. First, VB2 level is very low but may not be entirely missing in heat-killed (HK) bacteria. To address this, we have now measured VB2 level in bacteria (in addition to the measurement in worms shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and find a trace amount of VB2. These data are now added to the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>. This small amount VB2 may be enough for essential biochemical reactions to happen, and may be able to provide a small amount of ATP to support very slow and unhealthy growth under the “rescued” conditions (with over-expression of proteases or activation of TORC1). Such unwanted growth is prevented by the signaling system that senses the low level of VB2/ATP and shuts down the protease activity in wild type.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that the “rescued” growth is quite limited as the growth was very slow and the animals were very unhealthy. In fact, the “rescued” worms indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> grew to late larval stages but never reach adulthood. We also measured gonad length of wild type worms at several different stages when fed normal live OP50 (new data: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and mentioned the correspondence between the gonad length and stages in wild type. The low level of VB2 under the “rescued” condition is one reason why the “rescued” animals still grow slowly, given the broad roles of ATP in cellular processes. Moreover, as explained in the text, VB2 is only one of multiple factors missing in heat-killed bacteria, so adding back VB2 or FAD alone does not fully rescue the growth. We are developing new methods to investigate these other missing factors. However, in this study, we established the assay system to clearly detect the prominent impact of VB2.</p><p>We have modified text to clearly indicate that the “rescued” growth was slow (by days) and unhealthy. The new figures were added as mentioned above.</p><p><italic>2) How do the authors know that sensory neurons are not involved? There is precedent for sensory neuron activity affecting intestinal biology.</italic> </p><p>This is a good point. We do not have any data to exclude the involvement of sensory neurons. We have modified the writing in the Discussion to point out that we do not exclude the involvement of sensory neurons in this intestinal response system.</p><p><italic>3) The authors say: &quot;Further tests suggested that direct interaction with the live bacteria may be necessary for the worms to receive the benefit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).&quot; They show that the rescuing substance (VB2) is not volatile, but they don't show that direct contact with live bacteria is required. Conversely, it's not clear to me why, in the same section, they say that the micronutrients were provided &quot;likely through secretion&quot;. In fact, the two sentences seem to contradict one another.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the poor job we did in interpreting and explaining the data regarding this issue. First, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> (first 3 panels) simply suggest that the benefit was not through odorants. Second, the data from the last panel in the same figure and the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> suggest that worms likely obtained the benefit from a small amount of live bacteria by eating them. Finally, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> may suggest that live bacteria provide some micronutrients (which led to our screening of vitamins). We now realize that our use of “physical interaction” and “secretion” were confusing and have modified the writing.</p><p>Our hypothesis was that the trace amount of live bacteria, ingested by the worms, stayed in the intestine and might continuously secrete VB2 into the gut tract, very much like microbes in mammals. Since we do not have the evidence, we will discuss this as a speculative model in this section. We have modified the writing to improve in this regard (Results part-1, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) The authors say, in the first paragraph of the subsection “Proteases ASP-13 and ASP-14 and GATA factor ELT-2 play critical roles in VB2-promoted protease activity and food usability”, that asp-13/14 OE improved larval growth, but in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> they show only gonad length. How large is the adult gonad? How far in development do the experimental animals progress? This is a very important issue that needs to be addressed. Some clear analyses of rescue/larval staging should be performed.</italic> </p><p><italic>5) In the last paragraph of the subsection “Proteases ASP-13 and ASP-14 and GATA factor ELT-2 play critical roles in VB2-promoted protease activity and food usability”, the effect of elt-2 OE: Again, how large is the adult gonad? How far in development do the &quot;rescued&quot; worms progress?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer has raised a very valid question. In all the rescue conditions that we described, the animals never reach adulthood. As mentioned in the text and above, HK-bacteria is missing more than just VB2.</p><p>The reason we decided to evaluate the growth by measuring gonad length was because we found that determining gonad length was a better way to determine animal growth, which is indicative of food utilization, for animals fed HK-bacteria. In other words, under poor feeding conditions, animals were very unhealthy so that stage progression may not correlate with growth well (one pathway advances while others stall). In addition, determining larval stages is less quantitative regarding measuring growth even for healthy animals. In a previous study published in <italic>eLife</italic> that involves staging animals (Weaver et al. 2014), one reviewer, who seemed to be an expert in the developmental timing field, specifically instructed us to measure gonad length. We believe, for our study, the key is to learn about food usage rather than defining the stage from these growth measurements.</p><p>In light of this comment, we measured gonad length of wild type worms at several different stages (new data: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and mentioned the larval stages of VB2-fed worms based on the gonad length and vulval development in wild type. We also state clearly that animals with limited growth rescue (figure legend, growth day) by over-expressing protease or hyperactivating TORC1 never reach adulthood.</p><p><italic>6) Is the rescue by V2B and FAD/FMN more effective than rescue by the protease and elt-2 OE (perhaps because the vitamin cofactor is provided)? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>.</italic> </p><p>This is also a good question. The answer is yes. To compare them, we aligned all the bar graphs below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>), each with the respective control. Relative to wild type fed HK-bacteria, supplementation with VB2, FMN and FAD was more effective in rescuing growth than over expressing proteases or activating TORC1.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26243.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Gonad length of worm under different conditions.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26243.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26243.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-26243-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>7) Does increasing TORC1 activity restore VB2, FAD and/or FMN levels in HK-OP50? I suspect not, but this seems like an important experiment, since growth is improved. (How can growth be improved without Vitamin B2? Same question.)</italic> </p><p>Good question. We have done the measurement during the review. We found that increasing TORC1 activity with the <italic>nprl-3(ku540)</italic> mutation does not recover the level of VB2. The new data have been added to Figure 4—figure supplement E. The reason for growth improvement is explained in our response to question #1.</p><p><italic>8) The results are described in terms of a pathway, but in essence the authors show that the catastrophic nutritional results of VB2 deficiency result in ATP deficiency that impairs TORC1 function and downstream events. The only compensatory feedback mechanism (which would be expected of a &quot;sensing pathway&quot;) described is the foraging behavior. Is reduction in TORC1 activity or protease expression sufficient to lead to food-seeking behavior? The &quot;pathway&quot; terminology is technically correct but the simpler idea of an effect/response resulting from catastrophic nutritional failure may be more accurate.</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting and thoughtful comment. First of all, we think we have evidence to support that the activities of the “pathway” described in this paper has a rather specific physiological role. We have added new data to show that, when live-bacteria was added to worms grown on HK-OP50 plate for 30 days, the worms recovered to adults and produced progeny, which suggest that nutrient deficiency in heat-killed food induced a protective response. This data is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>. Such a role may not be consistent with the potential catastrophic nutritional failure theory.</p><p>We now also have the data to show that reducing TORC1 activity [<italic>daf-15(RNAi</italic>)] leads to defects in the food choice assay (new Figure: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Perhaps more telling is that the food-seeking defect in animals fed HK-food can be significantly suppressed by activating TORC1 or specific proteases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the data in this paper present a reasonable molecular pathway to explain the response. Previous studies have clearly established a linear relationship between VB2 and FAD, and between ATP and TORC1. We connected all of them to specific food-behavior and downstream activities. We also established the linear relationship between TORC1, <italic>elt-2</italic> and the expression of specific proteases. Therefore, using a pathway to describe this nutrient sensing response is still the best way. Many signaling pathways are known to have multiple inputs and outputs, as well as branch points.</p><p>Importantly, TORC1 sensing of various nutrients/chemicals including ATP has been extensively studied in mammalian cells, but few studies have connected it to animals’ response to nutrient deficiency in food or to specific physiological consequences. This study presents a good example of the usage of a common signaling pathway. Therefore, calling it a pathway has extra significance.</p><p><italic>9) Why was the ubiquitously-expressed rpl-28 promoter used for protease expression, when conclusions are made about the intestine? Is intestinal expression sufficient?</italic> </p><p>This is a valid question. We use <italic>rpl-28</italic> is because it is not likely to be regulated by TORC1 or other known regulatory mechanisms (e.g., we learned from previous studies that it is not regulated by miRNAs). We have not expressed the genes using an intestine specific promoter since we also worry that the commonly used <italic>ges<sup>-1</sup></italic> promoter could be regulated by TORC1 or ELT-2 which are low on heat-killed food condition. In fact, ELT-2 ChIP-seq data (Tobias et al., 2016) already shows that ELT-2 direct bind to the <italic>ges<sup>-1</sup></italic> promoter. That why we use ubiquitously-expressed <italic>rpl-28</italic> promoter.</p><p>To address this issue, we performed intestinal specific RNAi by using the VP303 strain (RNAi effective only in intestine). The new data (new figure: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) shows that intestinal specific RNAi of <italic>asp-13/14</italic> prevents the rescue effect of VB2 supplementation on worms fed HK-food, suggesting that intestinal function of ASP-13 and ASP-14 are essential for the VB2 effect. This is consistent with the previous finding that <italic>asp-13/14</italic> is highly expressed in the intestine (McGhee et al., 2007) and the results from our in vitro protease/protease inhibitor assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
