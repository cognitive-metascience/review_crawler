triacylglycerol (TG), as reservoirs of metabolic energy and membrane precursors. The Arf1/COPI protein machinery, known for its role in vesicle trafficking, regulates LD morphology, targeting of specific proteins to LDs and lipolysis through unclear mechanisms. Recent evidence shows that Arf1/COPI can bud nano-LDs (∼60 nm diameter) from phospholipid-covered oil/water interfaces in vitro. We show that Arf1/COPI proteins localize to cellular LDs, are sufficient to bud nano-LDs from cellular LDs, and are required for targeting specific TG-synthesis enzymes to LD surfaces. Cells lacking Arf1/COPI function have increased amounts of phospholipids on LDs, resulting in decreased LD surface tension and impairment to form bridges to the ER. Our findings uncover a function for Arf1/COPI proteins at LDs and suggest a model in which Arf1/COPI machinery acts to control ER-LD connections for localization of key enzymes of TG storage and catabolism.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01607.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01607.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01607.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Just like the body contains organs that perform different jobs, the cells within the body contain organelles that carry out different tasks. The endoplasmic reticulum, for example, makes proteins that are sent to other organelles or to destinations outside the cell. Each organelle is typically sealed within a membrane made from a double layer of phospholipids—molecules that have a phosphate ‘head’ group at one end, and two fatty acid ‘tails’ at the other. Proteins are shuttled between the organelles inside membrane-bound packages called vesicles.</p><p>There is, however, an exception to this rule. Lipid droplets are organelles that store fats and oils inside a single layer of phospholipids. This layer can include enzymes that break down the contents of the droplet, or make new fat molecules, depending on the needs of the cell and the organism. However, it is not clear how these enzymes get from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lipid droplet.</p><p>Previous work had suggested that a protein complex called Arf1/COP—which is also involved in the movement of vesicles around the cell—might recruit the enzymes to the lipid droplets. However, none of the other proteins known to be involved in vesicle transport were needed to transport the enzymes to the droplets, which suggested that the Arf1/COPI complex was using a previously unknown mechanism to move the enzymes.</p><p>Now Wilfling, Thiam et al. have shown that Arf1/COPI complexes trigger the establishment of membrane bridges between the endoplasmic reticulum and the droplets, which means that vesicles are not needed to get the enyzmes to the lipid droplets. It was also shown that the Arf1/COPI complexes could pinch off tiny droplets from full-size lipid droplets taken from living cells. Wilfling, Thiam et al. suggest that this ‘budding’ process changes the composition of the phospholipid layer around the larger droplet in a way that allows it to interact directly with the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>By providing new insights into the trafficking of proteins between organelles, the work of Wilfling, Thiam et al. reveals mechanisms that govern the composition of lipid droplets. In the future, these pathways could be manipulated to treat conditions that result from excessive storage of fat, such as obesity or cardiovascular diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01607.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01607.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>lipid droplet</kwd><kwd>protein targeting</kwd><kwd>ER-lipid droplet connection</kwd><kwd>lipolysis</kwd><kwd>triglyceride synthesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM097194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walther</surname><given-names>Tobias C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM099844</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farese</surname><given-names>Robert V</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>095927/A/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bewersdorf</surname><given-names>Jörg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marie Curie BFLDs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thiam</surname><given-names>Abdou Rachid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM096859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gould</surname><given-names>Travis J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilfling</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Gladstone Institutes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farese</surname><given-names>Robert V</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The G.

With its high energy content, triacylglycerol (TG) stored in lipid droplets (LDs) is the primary means of storing energy for many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Thiele and Spandl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujimoto and Parton, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brasaemle and Wolins, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Walther and Farese, 2012</xref>). LDs also store lipid precursors for membrane synthesis (e.g., cholesterol and glycerophospholipids) needed, for example, when cells exit quiescence and expand membranes for cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kurat et al., 2009</xref>). Due to their function in lipid storage, LDs are central to the development of pathologies associated with excess lipid accumulation, ranging from atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease to obesity and metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krahmer et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Unlike most organelles, LDs are not delimited by a bilayer membrane but instead are covered with a monolayer of phospholipid surfactant, which is important for their stability in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tauchi-Sato et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krahmer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2012a</xref>). In this sense, LDs constitute the dispersed phase of a cellular emulsion, with the phospholipid monolayer acting as a surfactant at the interface of the oil core with the aqueous cytosol (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Thiam et al., 2013b</xref>). Proteins specifically located at the LD surface execute many of the reactions of lipid storage or mobilization. For example, enzymes mediating TG synthesis and hydrolysis localize to LDs, where they mediate LD expansion and shrinkage, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kuerschner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schweiger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Murugesan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wilfling et al., 2013</xref>). How such enzymes are specifically targeted to LDs is a poorly understood, yet fundamental question.</p><p>Unbiased genome-wide screens in model systems, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, revealed factors that are required for LD targeting of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 2008</xref>). Specifically, members of the Arf1/COPI machinery, but not other proteins involved in secretory trafficking (e.g., COPII or clathrin), are necessary for normal LD morphology and for the targeting of some proteins to LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Soni et al., 2009</xref>). Depletion of Arf1/COPI proteins from cells leads to the formation of relatively uniform LDs of a characteristic size that exhibit impaired lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with this, Arf1/COPI proteins are required for LD localization of the major TG lipase ATGL (<italic>brummer</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Soni et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellong et al., 2011</xref>). ATGL was shown to behave, biochemically, as an integral membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Soni et al., 2009</xref>), and it was suggested that this lipase is transported to LDs from the ER by vesicular trafficking.</p><p>In vesicular trafficking, the best-characterized function of Arf1/COPI proteins is in retrograde transport, that is, retrieving ER resident proteins from the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nickel et al., 2002</xref>). In this pathway, Arf1 is loaded with GTP by a nucleotide exchange factor, such as GBF1 [<italic>gartenzwerg (garz)</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>]. The activated Arf1-GTP then recruits the coatomer, a heptameric protein complex, leading to the formation of a coated transport vesicle. Subsequent uncoating of the vesicle allows its transport and fusion to the target membrane (e.g., the ER).</p><p>It is unknown how Arf1/COPI proteins function in LD biology. Although one possibility is that Arf1/COPI proteins target proteins to LDs via bilayer vesicles, a variety of studies suggest a function directly at LDs. First, Arf1 and its GEF, GBF1, as well as other members of the COPI machinery, have been found on LDs in proteomic and cell biological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouvet et al., 2013</xref>). Second, the expression of dominant-negative Arf1T31N, which binds its exchange factor tightly, localizes to LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 2008</xref>). Third, Arf1Q71L that cannot hydrolyze GTP (and hence acts as a dominant-negative mutant in vesicular trafficking) activates lipolysis from LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 2008</xref>). Most recently, GTP-bound Arf1 and COPI proteins were shown to bud nano-LDs of ∼60 nm diameter from a phospholipid covered oil-water interface in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thiam et al., 2013a</xref>), indicating that this machinery can interact with monolayer interfaces such as what is found at LD surfaces. Collectively, these data suggest an alternative, so far untested model, in which Arf1/COPI proteins function in cells directly at LDs in a way that enables protein targeting.</p><p>Besides ATGL, other enzymes involved in TG metabolism also localize to LD surfaces. For example, at least one isoenzyme catalyzing each step of de novo TG synthesis from glycerol-3-phosphate (e.g., GPAT4, AGPAT3, and DGAT2) localizes to a subset of LDs. Each of these enzymes contains two hydrophobic segments likely forming a hairpin in the ER membrane or the LD monolayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wilfling et al., 2013</xref>). LD localization of these enzymes enables LDs to synthesize TG locally and expand their neutral lipid cores under conditions of excess energy (fatty acid) availability. Recent evidence indicates that these enzymes re-localize to a subset of LDs from the ER via abundant membrane bridges that form between the organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wilfling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thiam et al., 2013a</xref>). Intriguingly, this targeting reaction can occur rapidly at a particular LD, from which TG synthesis enzymes were absent for a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wilfling et al., 2013</xref>). How the targeting process is initiated and how bridges between LDs and the ER are established is unknown.</p><p>Here we investigate the mechanism of Arf1/COP protein function in cellular LD protein targeting by using a combination of cell biological and biochemical approaches. In contrast to the canonical role of these proteins in vesicular trafficking, we uncover a mechanism of action that relies on altering the surface lipid composition of LDs. Based on the presence of the Arf1/COPI machinery at LDs, we propose a newly identified function of Arf1/COPI proteins in modulating LD surfaces to enable protein targeting.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Arf1/COPI are required for lipid droplet targeting of triglyceride synthesis enzymes</title><p>Many cell types, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, contain two populations of LDs: a few rather large, expanding LDs, several microns in diameter, and many smaller (less than a micron diameter) LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wilfling et al., 2013</xref>).

We therefore reasoned that Arf1/COPI depletion, by causing increased PC levels on LDs, would affect the time course of CCT1 recruitment to LDs. Indeed, CCT1 localized to LDs at later times during LD expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>The model of Arf1/COPI removing primarily phospholipids from donor LDs predicts that the effects of Arf1/COPI depletion might be overcome by alternative treatments limiting the availability of phospholipids for LDs. To test this prediction, we decreased PC synthesis by depleting CCT1, either alone or in combination with Arf79F or βCOP. Depletion efficiency was equally efficient in single and double depletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected from previous studies, CCT1 depletion resulted in coalescence of LDs into giant LDs, due to limiting availability of phospholipids on LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krahmer et al., 2011</xref>).

Strikingly, when CCT1 was depleted concomitantly with Arf79F or βCOP, GPAT4 targeting to LDs was efficiently restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The ability of CCT depletion to complement deficient Arf1/COPI function was specific to the GPAT4 targeting to LDs, as CCT1 depletion did not restore the defect in protein secretion due to Arf79F or βCOP depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>If Arf1/COPI proteins function to remove phospholipids from LDs and thus allow membrane bridges to be established between the ER and LDs, then modulating the LD surface properties by other means should similarly alter protein targeting to LDs. To test this prediction, we added PC to cells. In agreement with the hypothesis, adding excess PC prevented GPAT4 targeting to the LD surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

We hypothesized that cholesterol (which in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells is normally only present in very low amounts), with its small head-group and pronounced cone shape, might act in this manner. As predicted, in vitro measurements confirmed that cholesterol addition increased the surface tension of a TG-buffer interface when added in the presence of phospholipids (PC and PE) mimicking the LD surface composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, emulsion stability was reduced by cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). When cholesterol was added to Arf1/COPI-depleted cells, the cholesterol content increased at LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Importantly, adding cholesterol to cells was sufficient to restore targeting of GPAT4 to LDs in Arf1/COPI-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and the number of GPAT4-positive LDs depended on the ratio of cholesterol and PC added to cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To test whether the effect is due to cholesterol’s physical properties, or alternatively, to some physiological change in the cells induced by cholesterol, we repeated these experiments with SR59230A and stearylamine. Both of these agents are surface active, amphiphilic molecules that normally do not occur in cells, but which induce LD destabilization in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Murphy et al., 2010</xref>), likely by increasing LD surface tension or by decreasing line tension of coalescence intermediates. In agreement with the findings with added cholesterol, adding SR59230A or stearylamine efficiently restored GPAT4 targeting to Arf1/COPI-depleted LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>To further test whether changes of LD surface properties, introduced by the action of Arf1/COPI, controls GPAT4 targeting to LDs through membrane bridges, we reconstituted this reaction in vitro with a microfluidic device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We introduced microsomes harboring GFP-GPAT4 into buffer-in-oil micro-reactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Mixing the content of the micro-reactors by flow through zig-zagging micro-channels led to localization of some GPAT4 to the monolayer delimiting the TG phase. The amount of GFP-GPAT4 at the monolayer depended on its composition and varied according to the surface tension. Similar to the situation in cells, monolayers rich in cholesterol and having higher surface tension, bound GFP-GPAT4 more efficiently than control monolayers of PC and PE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The Arf1/COPI machinery is important for governing LD morphology, protein targeting, and consequently lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Soni et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellong et al., 2011</xref>). However, how Arf1/COPI proteins act to affect LDs has been unknown. Recent evidence from in vitro experiments using artificially generated oil-water interfaces show that GTP-bound Arf1 and COPI proteins are sufficient to bud nano-LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thiam et al., 2013a</xref>), suggesting that the Arf1/COPI machinery might perform a similar function at the oil-water interfaces of LDs in cells.</p><p>The current studies show that Arf1/COPI machinery has an additional function other than its canonical function in forming bilayer vesicles namely that these proteins can control the formation of membrane bridges between LDs and the ER to mediate targeting of specific proteins (such as ATGL, GPAT4, and DGAT2) from the ER to LDs.</p><p>Taken together, our data are most consistent with a model for the function of Arf1/COPI in which these proteins act directly on LDs to remove phospholipids from the LD surfaces through the formation of nano-LDs. Budding of nano-LDs in turn, increases surface tension of the donor LD and allows membrane bridges to be established between this LD and the ER. These membrane bridges provide a pathway for the localization of membrane-associated proteins, such as ATGL and GPAT4, and it allows them to diffuse to the LD surface where they perform key steps in TG metabolism. Without functional Arf1/COPI, TG synthesis enzymes fail to target LDs, which as a consequence cannot expand to form large LDs. In addition, as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Soni et al., 2009</xref>), ATGL fails to target LDs leading to a defect in lipolysis and a mild increase in the size of small LDs. Consistent with this model, incubation of cells depleted for components the Arf1/COPI machinery with chemicals that increase LD surface tension, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or SR59320A is sufficient to restore GPAT4 targeting. Various proteomic, biochemical, and cell biological studies showing that components of the Arf1/COPI machinery are present on LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouvet et al., 2013</xref>) are also consistent with this model.</p><p>Calculations based on the size of the targeted LDs and the formed nano-LDs suggest that only a few nano-LD budding events are required to significantly increase the surface tension of the donor LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thiam et al., 2013a</xref>). Thus, Arf1/COPI activity that results in the budding of nano-LDs will cause a significant change in the surface properties of existing LDs, and these changes are required to enable interactions of the LD monolayer surface with bilayer membranes. Specifically, we posit that the increase in the surface tension of LDs allows for the formation of bridges with the ER, whereas the densely packed phospholipid shell on LDs with low surface tension, where Arf1/COPI have not acted, are refractive to forming a bridge with the ER.</p><p>In an alternative and possibly complementary model, Arf1/COPI might also function to maintain ER lipid composition or structure in a manner that allows for the formation of bridges with LDs. In other systems inhibition of the Arf1 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor led to collapse of the Golgi apparatus into the ER and ectopic cleavage and activation of the transcription factor SREBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Walker et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> SREBP up-regulates phospholipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dobrosotskaya et al., 2002</xref>), which could indirectly affect LD surface properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krahmer et al., 2011</xref>). However, in our experimental system, we did not detect increased SREBP cleavage, up-regulation of the SREBP target genes (such as CCT1, acetyl-CoA synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase) or changes in cellular PC or PE levels after Arf1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and MJO and TCW, unpublished observations).</p><p>Once ER-LD bridges are established, GPAT4, and presumably other enzymes (e.g., AGPAT3, DGAT2, or ATGL/<italic>brummer</italic>) rapidly migrate to LDs. The time course of enzyme relocalization, in our experiments triggered at some point during oleate loading or after adding back COPI by cell–cell fusion, suggests that, once LD-to-ER bridges are established, targeting is limited by diffusion across the bridges. It is unclear how cargo that migrates from the ER to LDs is selected. Intriguingly, the Arf1/COPI mechanism appears to operate specifically for proteins that are embedded in the membrane, such as GPAT4 and ATGL, which behaves similarly to GPAT4 as an integral membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Soni et al., 2009</xref>, and FW, MJO, RVF, and TCW, unpublished observations). It is also unclear why these LD-targeted proteins accumulate on LD surfaces. Accumulation could be mediated by partitioning into the oil phase, but the mechanism providing energy for the reaction is not yet known.</p><p>Our findings provide a number of new questions for investigation. It is unknown if the Arf1/COPI machinery is constitutively active stochastically on some LDs or if is regulated. Interestingly, data from in vitro budding reactions from oil-water interfaces indicate that Arf1/COPI can act only on membranes sufficiently covered by phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thiam et al., 2013a</xref>). Therefore, Arf1/COPI might be part of a system that detects LDs that are sufficiently coated by PC (i.e., have reached a sufficiently low surface tension) and thus are suitable for further expansion. It is also unclear how Arf1/COPI-mediated protein targeting is affected by lipolysis. Generation of surface-active lipids during lipolysis, such as fatty acids or diacylglycerol, might increase LD surface tension and subsequently augment the triggering of ER-LD bridge formation, thereby allowing more lipases to migrate to LDs. Also unclear is how the specificity of membrane bridge formation of LDs to the ER is controlled. Finally, it will be of interest to determine the fate of the nano-LDs formed by Arf1/COPI actions. Nano-LDs are similar in size to typical COPI vesicles. However, in contrast to vesicles, they are made up of a small oil core that is likely coated with a monolayer of phospholipids and may contain specific proteins.</p><p>The model emerging from our studies highlights how cells solved a fundamental problem—how to deal with LDs, which are essentially emulsified oils in the aqueous cytosol. Through the actions of the Arf1/COPI machinery, the surface properties of LDs can be altered such that proteins are able to access them. Among all coat complexes known to function in vesicular trafficking, the Arf1/COPI system has unique properties that make it ideally suited to function in this process. All other vesicular coat complexes require exchange factors that contain trans-membrane spanning protein segments, which are unlikely to be found on LDs. Arf1/COPI does not require such a factor. By this unique mechanism, cells can alter the surface properties of LD emulsions and enable them to interact with membranes, so that specific enzymes can gain access to LDs and facilitate dynamic changes in lipid storage or utilization. Our findings additionally provide evidence for a previously unrecognized cellular mechanism by which Arf1/COPI proteins can control protein trafficking.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Rabbit polyclonal antibodies used: anti-GPAT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wilfling et al., 2013</xref>), anti-CCT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wilfling et al., 2013</xref>), anti-GBF1 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), anti-KDEL-receptor (KDELR; gift from Dr JE Rothman; Yale University), anti-βCOP (gift from Dr JE Rothman; Yale University), anti-perilipin3 (TIP47; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), anti-αCOP (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-GRP78/BiP (ET-21) (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and anti-garz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) (gift from Dr A Paululat; University of Osnabrück).

Fluorescence from the sample was collected by the objective lens, de-scanned by the scan mirrors, separated from laser light using dichroic mirrors, bandpass filtered (FF01-685/40 for ATTO647N or FF01-593/46 for STAR470SX; both from Semrock), and focused onto 105 μm core diameter (ATTO647N: ∼0.7 Airy units; STAR470SX: ∼0.8 Airy units) multimode fibers (Thorlabs) connected to single-photon counting avalanche photodiodes (APD; ARQ-13-FC, Perkin Elmer). APD counts were acquired using a FPGA-based data collection board (PCIe-7852R, National Instruments) and custom acquisition software programmed in LabView (National Instruments). Recorded pixel values were linearized (on the DAQ card) to account for the sinusoidal velocity profile of the resonant mirror and normalized according to the pixel dwell times such that the center pixel was divided by unity. Dual-color imaging of ATTO647N and STAR470SX were performed using sequential frame acquistions similar to previously published reports using a long Stoke’s shift fluorophore as the second color channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schmidt et al., 2008</xref>). Laser powers (measured at the objective back aperture) were ∼16 μW of 510 nm excitation light and ∼130 mW of 760 nm STED light for STAR470SX and ∼17 μW of 640 nm excitation light and ∼130 mW of 770 nm STED light for ATTO647N. Images were acquired with a 20 nm pixel size in a 1024 by 1024 image format with 500 accumulations per line, resulting in a frame rate of 0.032 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Comparison of colocalization between the experiment and a random distribution</title><p>To assess whether the overlapping signals of βCOP, clathrin, KDELR (in NRK cells) and αCOP, garz (for S2 cell) with BODIPY was erratic a Matlab script was written.</p><p>The population of the immunostained foci was denoted <bold>A</bold> and BODIPY stained LDs were denoted <bold>LD</bold>.

The brightness contrast was adjusted for each channel of the picture using ImageJ. After applying a threshold binary images were generated for each channel. The total number of A-type particles, nA, and their corresponding radius, rA, were determined. For each LD particle, the distance of the first A-type neighbor was determined. Negative distances corresponded to overlapping of A and LD. The colocalized fraction of A-type particles with LD population was given by nexp/nA, where nexp was the number of colocalized A-type spots (number of negative distances).</p></list-item><list-item><p>2. The random distribution of A particles was based on an analytical model following a binomial distribution hypothesis. The choice of a binomial distribution model was adequate to assess overdispersion of A-type particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rosner, 2011</xref>). From the binary mask of the LD population, each LD of radius rLD was given a new radius rLD + rA. The probability of colocalization of A and LD can be formulated by the probability of having an A-type dot colocalizing to a LD of the new defined radius.

A buffer and oil stream was generated using a syringe pump. By flow focusing, defined buffer drops were generated in the oil stream. These buffer micro-reactors contained GFP-GPAT4 microsomes. The oil used was a mixture of TG with phospholipids and/or cholesterol (PC/PE each 0.25% (wt/wt); PC/PE/cholesterol 1/1/4 with 2% (wt/wt) cholesterol; cholesterol 0.5% (wt/wt); indicated lipid concentrations are compared to TG). To ensure the same frequency of interaction of the microsomes with the monolayer interface, the flow rate of the buffer and oil stream (150 and 30 µl/hr) was kept constant for all experiments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs Christopher Burd, Nora Kory, Natalie Krahmer, Gregory Lavieu, Lena Schroeder and Yuan Xue for critical discussions and Gary Howard for editorial assistance.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. We feel the following are essential changes that must be included in a revised manuscript:</p><p>1) Show the effect of Arf1/COP1 loss on the trafficking of another enzyme, preferably of the triglyceride synthesis pathway, to the LDs.</p><p>2) Is Arf1 working as a monomer or dimer? The biogenesis of COPI at the Golgi membranes is reported to require dimeric Arf1. Either way this data will help reveal the role of Arf/COPI in vesicle formation.</p><p>3) Quantitate epsilon COP depletion.</p><p>4) Improve the quality of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2A and 4D</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>: this is supposed to be a mathematical model describing the number of connections between the ER and a LD. To us, the panel on the left side looks like actual data, while the cartoon on the right references parameters (R,J,L) that are not described in the Figure legend or in the text of the manuscript. These are buried in the Methods, which is fine, but if the authors were hoping to convey some information through this figure they have failed.
