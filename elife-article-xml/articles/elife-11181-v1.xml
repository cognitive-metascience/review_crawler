Plant toxins, for example, often have a bitter flavor that animals can detect and avoid. Fruit flies have many bitter-sensitive nerve cells, but it is not known how the receptors on these nerve cells signal the detection of bitter-flavored compounds.</p> <p>Delventhal and Carlson have now used fruit flies to investigate how taste receptors of the so-called Gustatory receptor family detect bitter flavors. The experimental approach involved genetically modifying four different types of nerve cells that sense bitter compounds so that they produced higher levels of particular taste receptors than normal. Then, the flies were exposed to a range of bitter compounds while the electrical activity of each cell was measured.</p> <p>The analysis involved about 600 combinations of receptors, nerve cells and compounds. In some bitter-sensing nerve cells, increasing the number of taste receptors increased the cell’s responsiveness to bitter compounds. However, in other nerve cells, similar modifications suppressed an existing response or resulted in a new response.</p> <p>Delventhal and Carlson propose that these results suggest the specific response of a bitter-sensing nerve cell depends on the interactions between its different taste receptors. Furthermore, the ability of receptors to compete, inhibit or activate each other in different ways could have implications for evolution. For example, such flexible interactions might allow a taste system to evolve new, enhanced or diminished responses to new food sources and tastes in a changing environment. It now remains to be investigated how such receptor interactions take place at a molecular level.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11181.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11181.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>taste receptors</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>sensory systems</kwd><kwd>taste</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5F31DC012985</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delventhal</surname><given-names>Rebecca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carlson</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Expression of <italic>Drosophila</italic> bitter receptors in taste neurons produced increased, decreased, or novel responses, supporting a model in which the response profile is determined by activation, inhibition, or competition among receptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The sense of taste allows animals to identify food sources that are nutritious but not toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liman et al., 2014</xref>). Many toxins elicit a bitter taste and an aversive response that is widely conserved across phyla. Bitter-tasting compounds are of diverse structures and chemical classes. Many bitter compounds are synthesized by plants and deter insects from feeding on them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pontes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briscoe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salloum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sellier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Freeman and Dahanukar, 2015</xref>). Insects in turn have evolved gustatory systems that detect these compounds and signal the danger of toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wada-Katsumata et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The principal taste organ of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> head is the labellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The labellum contains ~31 taste sensilla that fall into morphological classes based on length: short (S; green and blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), intermediate (I; purple and red), and long (L; gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stocker, 1994</xref>). Each sensillum has a pore at its tip. When a sensillum makes contact with a potential food source, compounds from the food source diffuse through the pore and activate gustatory receptor neurons inside.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11181.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sensillum types on the labellum.</title><p>Left: The four bitter-responsive types, S-a (green), S-b (blue), I-a (purple) and I-b (red), are differently distributed on the labellar surface. L sensilla (gray) show little if any response to bitter compounds. Right: S-a and S-b have four gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), one of which is bitter-responsive, and I-a and I-b sensilla have two GRNs, one of which is bitter-responsive. The bitter-responsive neuron (B) of each sensillum type expresses a different combination of Grs. Five Grs, referred to as 'Commonly Expressed Receptors' (CERs; in rectangles), are expressed in every bitter neuron on the labellum. Many or all sensilla also contain a sugar-sensitive neuron (S). Mapping of Grs to neurons is based on <italic>GAL4</italic> driver expression. Figure adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weiss et al.

Four functional classes of bitter-sensitive sensilla were identified, two of short length, S-a and S-b, and two of intermediate length, I-a and I-b. Each class contains a neuron excited by bitter compounds, referred to as a 'bitter neuron,' with a distinguishable response spectrum.</p><p>Expression analysis of all 68 members of the Gustatory receptor (Gr) family identified four corresponding classes of bitter neurons, each expressing a distinct subset of receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>). The receptors expressed in bitter neurons are referred to for convenience as 'bitter receptors.' They show extensive coexpression: 29 are coexpressed in the bitter neuron of S-a; 16 in S-b; 6 in I-a; and 10 in I-b. In addition to the labellum, the legs and pharynx of the fly also have gustatory function, as does the larval head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meunier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oppliger et al., 2000</xref>). We note that expression analysis of Grs has been based primarily on <italic>Gr-GAL4</italic> drivers, since success in analyzing Gr expression with in situ hybridization has been extremely limited.</p><p>Loss-of-function studies have clearly shown that some Grs are required for the responses to certain bitter compounds. For example, <italic>Gr93a</italic> is required for the behavioral and physiological response to caffeine; <italic>Gr8a</italic> is required for response to L-canavanine; <italic>Gr66a, Gr33a</italic> and <italic>Gr32a</italic> are broadly required for the response to several bitter tastants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moon et al., 2009</xref>). However, the roles of individual Grs in bitter response have been difficult to discern in detail, in part because of the coexpression of bitter receptors and in part because of the difficulty of expressing bitter receptors in conventional expression systems such as cultured cells or oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liman et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In vivo expression studies provide a complementary approach for analysis of Gr function. Here, we analyze eight bitter Grs, most of which have not been functionally studied before. We express them in a natural laboratory: in bitter neurons of the labellum that either do or do not express them endogenously, which we refer to as overexpression or ectopic expression, respectively. Specifically, we express individual Grs in four different bitter neurons, three of wild type and one of a <italic>Gr</italic> mutant, and we measure the effects of their expression using electrophysiology and a panel of 21 bitter tastants. From an analysis of ~600 receptor-neuron-tastant combinations (n≥27,000 total recordings) we find several surprising results. While expression of Grs led to increases in many responses, expression of some Grs led to decreases in certain responses. Conversely, the deletion of one <italic>Gr</italic> from a neuron led to novel responses not observed in wild type. Overexpression of a Gr in some neurons led not only to increased responses but also to novel responses. A recurrent theme was that the expression of the same Gr in different neurons led to strikingly different results. Taken together, our findings provide support for a model in which bitter Grs interact, exhibiting competition, inhibition, or activation in different contexts. The results may have profound evolutionary implications: they suggest a rich source of means by which the taste system can evolve novel, increased, or decreased responses to new environmental opportunities and dangers, or modulate its response to accommodate changes in the internal state of the fly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Novel responses conferred by ectopic expression of Grs in I-a bitter neurons</title><p>To investigate the function of bitter Grs, we ectopically expressed them in bitter neurons of the labellum via the <italic>GAL4-UAS</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>).

The aim of this approach was to study bitter Grs in an environment similar to their native environment—that is, in bitter taste neurons, in taste sensilla, in vivo.</p><p>We initially expressed Grs in bitter neurons of I-a sensilla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, purple sensilla). These neurons were selected because they have the narrowest response spectrum of the various classes of labellar bitter neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>). These sensilla also express the smallest number of bitter <italic>Gr</italic> genes, as determined in a systematic <italic>Gr-GAL4</italic> expression analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>As an initial <italic>Gr</italic> gene we examined <italic>Gr22b</italic>, which in wild-type flies is expressed in S-a sensilla, but not I-a sensilla.

This decreased DEN response in S-a is in contrast to the increased DEN response in I-a produced by expression of the same receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). This suppression is particularly interesting because Gr22b is expressed endogenously in S-a sensilla; thus suppression of response is observed in a cell that has been engineered to overexpress one of its endogenous receptors.</p><p>Gr58c also suppressed the responses of S-a sensilla, in this case to UMB and ARI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Gr58c did not suppress the response to DEN; thus Gr58c and Gr22b both suppress responses to bitter compounds, but different compounds. Gr2a reduced responses in S-a to several tastants, including DEN, SPS, STR, and LOB. Gr10a also showed suppressive effects in S-a. Moreover, the profiles produced by Gr2a and Gr10a were very similar to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), as in I-a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).</p><p>We confirmed the suppression of S-a responses via an independent dose-response analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). At all concentrations tested, responses to SPS were lower in the line expressing Gr2a than in the parental control lines. Suppression of SPS response by Gr22b was observed at both 3 mM and 10 mM concentrations.</p><p>Suppression of responses was observed not only in S-a sensilla but also in I-b sensilla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Although Gr22b expression conferred novel responses to SOA, CUC and AZA, as it did in I-a sensilla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), it suppressed the responses to THE, CAF, TPH, and UMB. The ability of Gr22b to confer entirely novel responses and suppress endogenous ones in I-b sensilla is especially surprising given that Gr22b is endogenously expressed in I-b bitter neurons. Likewise, Gr58c showed reduced responses to CAF, TPH, and UMB, while conferring response to DEN and LOB, two compounds to which Gr58c expression also confers responses in I-a sensilla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Gr2a and Gr10a again behaved similarly in I-b sensilla, in that their expression had no effects. Their lack of effect in I-b sensilla is in contrast to their conferral of responses in I-a sensilla and their suppression of responses in S-a sensilla.</p><p>In summary, suppression occurred broadly: in both S-a and I-b, by several different receptors, and with several different tastants. Expression of an individual receptor in a given sensillum increased the responses to some tastants and decreased the responses to others (e.g. Gr22b; CUC and DEN in S-a). Expression of an individual receptor increased the response to a tastant in one sensillum type and decreased it in another (e.g. Gr22b; DEN in I-a and S-a). Suppression was observed both in cases of overexpression and ectopic expression, i.e. expression of a receptor in a neuron that either does (e.g. Gr22b in S-a) or does not (e.g. Gr2a in S-a) express it endogenously in wild type. Finally, in some sensilla a receptor produced decreased responses but no increased responses (e.g. Gr2a in S-a).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Deletion of <italic>Gr59c</italic> converts the I-a profile to one similar to that of I-b</title><p>The foregoing analysis concerned expression of Grs that are coexpressed in labellar bitter neurons with many other Grs, or that are not expressed in the labellum.

For example, in the S-a sensillum, expression of Gr22b increased some responses and decreased others; Gr58c only decreased responses; Gr36a had no effects on any responses. In the case of the Gr10a receptor, which is expressed in the antenna as well as a larval taste organ, expression in S-a sensilla increased some responses and decreased others; expression in I-a produced increased responses and novel responses but no decreased responses; expression in I-b had no effects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Models of direct or indirect interaction between bitter Grs</title><p>According to the simplest model of Gr function, one might have expected that expression of a Gr would simply add to the response profile of the neuron.

If the expressed Gr responded to a tastant that the endogenous Grs respond to, then the responses to that tastant would then increase.</p><p>The effects observed in this study are difficult to reconcile with this simple model of Gr function. A more complex model is required to explain, for example, the findings that: i) expression of some Grs decreased endogenous responses; ii) deletion of <italic>Gr59c</italic> increased the response to certain tastants; iii) expression of some Grs in neurons in which they are endogenously expressed caused novel responses; iv) the effects of expression of a Gr differed among neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figures 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The neuron at left shows an increase in response to a tastant whereas the neuron at the right shows a decrease. One model is that in the A neuron, the expressed Gr (blue) binds to an inactive Gr (red) specific to neuron A, and activates it (green). By contrast, in the B neuron, the expressed Gr (blue) binds to a different Gr (green) specific to neuron B, and inactivates it (red).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11181.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11181.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-11181-fig12-v1"/></fig></p><sec id="s3-3-1"><title>Suppression of endogenous responses</title><p>Expression of nearly all Grs decreased at least some responses, in at least one kind of neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Grs suppressed responses either when expressed ectopically or when overexpressed in a cell. We note that Ors can confer inhibitory as well as excitatory responses to olfactory receptor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hallem et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>A priori,</italic> one simple model for how a Gr could decrease the response of a neuron to a particular tastant is by binding it and inducing a current or a signal that counteracts the activity of another, endogenous Gr that binds the same tastant and independently excites the neuron. However, Grs decreased responses in a neuron-specific manner. For example, expression of Gr22b decreased the response to DEN in S-a but increased it in I-a. If the function of Gr22b were uniquely to bind DEN and produce an inhibitory response, it is difficult to explain how it would increase the response to DEN in I-a.</p><p>A second model for how some bitter Grs can suppress neuronal response is by competing with other Grs for a necessary signaling factor. For example, Grs might compete for binding to a common co-factor. In the olfactory system, most ORNs express one of ~60 Ors that are believed to bind odorants, along with a common co-receptor, Orco, which is required for function of the Or (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Larsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</xref>). Moreover, an RNA-Seq analysis was consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometry of Ors and Orco in the antenna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Menuz et al., 2014</xref>). It is conceivable that some bitter Grs compete within a taste cell for binding to a common co-factor. If so, some Grs might be more effective competitors than others, which could explain in part why expression of some Grs conferred many, strong suppressive responses, while others conferred few if any. This model does not specify the number or nature of co-factors, does not require a co-factor to be expressed in all bitter neuron types, and does not specify whether the co-factor acts in membrane-targeting, ligand-binding, or other functions.</p><p>A third model for suppression, related to the second and compatible with it, is that a bitter Gr inhibits another Gr directly by binding to it and inactivating it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12, i</xref>). Some bitter Grs may bind a tastant, conferring an excitatory response to a taste neuron, and also bind to and inactivate another Gr. Thus overexpression of a Gr in a neuron might increase the response of the neuron to the tastant that the Gr binds, but decrease the response mediated by another Gr to another tastant. Perhaps Gr59c, for example, confers a response to BER, LOB, and DEN directly, but inhibits a Gr that confers a response to TPH, UMB, and CAF, consistent with earlier results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>). This model would explain the paradoxical finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12, ii</xref>) that loss of a receptor, Gr59c, led to an increase in response to TPH, UMB, and CAF.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-2"><title>Novel and increased responses</title><p>The simplest model for how expression of a Gr might confer a novel or increased response to a tastant is by binding to it and transducing the signal so as to excite the neuron. Such excitation could confer a novel response or an increased response, depending on whether the neuron exhibited an endogenous response to the tastant.</p><p>This simple model does not easily explain how expression of some Grs in neurons that express them endogenously, <italic>i.e.</italic> 'overexpression,' led to novel responses (iii). One model, related to the third model of suppression, again entails the binding of one Gr to another Gr. In this case, however, binding would result not in inhibition but in activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12, iii</xref>). The binding of two Grs could result in an activated Gr—perhaps a heteromer of two or more subunits—that has a function not observed in the native neuron. According to this model, the response profile of the neuron would be sensitive to the relative levels of Grs; only after the level of a Gr exceeded a certain threshold by virtue of overexpression would levels of the heteromer become detectable in functional tests.</p><p>The concept of subunit interactions could also explain the finding that expression of individual Grs conferred different effects on different neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12, iv</xref>). Since each different neuron type contains a different roster of Grs, the interplay of subunits could easily differ in each type, leading to a different pattern of inhibition and activation of responses.</p><p>The possibility of interactions among bitter Grs, and in particular the formation of Gr heteromers, is consistent with the results of several previous studies. First, expression of single bitter Grs in sugar-sensitive neurons or heterologous expression systems has not yielded bitter responses, consistent with the possibility that a combination of bitter Grs is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liman et al., 2014</xref>). Second, the responses to some bitter compounds were reduced by mutation of any of multiple Grs, consistent with the notion that these Grs combine to form a functional multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2009</xref>). In the antenna, two Grs, Gr21a and Gr63a, are coexpressed and together confer response to carbon dioxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kwon et al., 2007</xref>). There is evidence for subunit interactions among sugar receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>), although elegant experiments have shown that responses conferred by expression of individual sugar receptor genes in an antennal neuron agree well with the responses lost by mutations of the same individual <italic>Gr</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Freeman et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications for the evolution and modulation of toxin detection</title><p>The diverse effects we have observed from expressing Grs may have profound evolutionary implications. A major challenge for <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other organisms is to respond to changes in the chemical environment. For example, as new plants move into the habitat of a fly, or as a fly moves into a new habitat, there are novel opportunities for nutrition but also novel dangers of toxicity. How can the fly adapt so as to exploit the opportunities but avoid the dangers? The ability of its taste system to encode and interpret new chemical signals is crucial. A classic means of detecting new signals is via changes in the amino acid sequence of taste receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ueno et al., 2001</xref>). A change in the binding site of a bitter receptor, for example, may allow the detection of a new toxin.</p><p>Our results suggest a rich, alternative means of generating variation in chemosensory signaling. We have found that changes in the expression of a taste receptor can generate a wide variety of effects: increased responses, decreased responses, and novel responses. Accordingly, simple alterations in regulatory sequences that govern the cellular specificity of expression, or the level of expression, could change the response specificities of taste neurons in dramatic and beneficial ways. Thus, the organization of the taste system—featuring the coexpression of many Grs in individual neurons—may provide numerous degrees of freedom for altering the response patterns of the neurons, via either the gain or loss of receptor function. Such alterations could meet a specific environmental challenge, or could in a more general sense expand the potential of the system to encode and perhaps distinguish among bitter compounds of differing toxicity or significance.</p><p>A network of coexpressed Grs, sensitive to relative levels of expression, could also provide a means of modulating taste sensitivity in response to short-term changes in either the environment or the internal state of the fly. We found that alterations in the expression of <italic>Gr59c</italic> in the mature fly induced changes in taste sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, short-term changes in <italic>Gr</italic> transcription or post-transcriptional processing could in principle be a mechanism of altering taste response to meet the short-term needs of a hungry or satiated fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prestia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether alterations in Gr expression may provide a mechanism for the evolution or modulation of taste responses, it will be of interest to examine the behavioral consequences of such alterations. For example, does the expression of Gr22b in I-a, I-b, or S-a sensilla, which produces increased or novel electrophysiological responses to SOA, increase the fly’s behavioral sensitivity or degree of aversion to SOA? Does expression of Gr58c in I-b and S-a, which suppresses electrophysiological responses to UMB, decrease the fly’s behavioral response to UMB? Increased aversion to a bitter tastant in a food source could be adaptive in environments that contain a particularly rich selection of more beneficial food sources. Decreased aversion to a bitter compound in a food source might be adaptive following the starvation of a fly with few alternatives.</p><p>In a more general sense, the functional organization of the taste system differs from that of the olfactory system in that the 60 <italic>Gr</italic> genes are more highly coexpressed in a smaller number of neuronal types than the 60 <italic>Or</italic> genes. This pattern of organization may in principle entail some loss of discriminatory power, but it could provide a degree of evolutionary and regulatory flexibility that may serve the needs of the animal well.</p><p>Finally, we note that the present analysis of eight <italic>Gr</italic> genes lays a genetic foundation for a detailed biochemical analysis. It will be of interest, for example, to test the possibility of association between tagged Grs in vivo.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p> <p>The reviewers (Yehuda Ben-Shahar and one other) have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>This paper represents a comprehensive analysis of the role of &quot;bitter&quot; receptor choice in determining the ligand specificity of labellar gustatory receptor neurons in the fruit fly. Overall, this is an important contribution to our understanding of the insect taste system. It is the first report that sheds light on how bitter taste ligand specificity might be determined. The novel and unintuitive results suggest an unappreciated complexity to Gr function that will require investigation.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>The paper is missing the behavioral context, which could clarify the possible ecological significance of some of the more puzzling results it reports. The reviewers noted that it would be of interest to assess whether alterations of physiological response profiles as a consequence of ectopic receptor expression have in fact behavioral consequences. While such measurements are felt to be outside the scope of the present study, they do deserve some discussion. This would also help build up the potential evolutionary implications of this study.</p></body> </sub-article> <sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11181.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub> <body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p> <p><italic>The paper is missing the behavioral context, which could clarify the possible ecological significance of some of the more puzzling results it reports.

While such measurements are felt to be outside the scope of the present study, they do deserve some discussion. This would also help build up the potential evolutionary implications of this study.</italic> </p> <p>We are grateful for the helpful suggestion that we discuss the issue of whether the alterations of physiological response profiles have behavioral consequences. We agree that this point is highly germane to the potential evolutionary implications of the study.</p> <p>Accordingly, we have added a paragraph to the Discussion that directly bears on this issue:</p> <p>“To investigate whether alterations in Gr expression may provide a mechanism for the evolution or modulation of taste responses, it will be important to examine the behavioral consequences of such alterations. For example, does the expression of Gr22b in I-a, I-b, or S-a sensilla, which produces increased or novel electrophysiological responses to SOA, increase the fly’s behavioral sensitivity or degree of aversion to SOA? Does expression of Gr58c in I-b and S-a, which suppresses electrophysiological responses to UMB, decrease the fly’s behavioral response to UMB? Increased aversion to a bitter tastant in a food source could be adaptive in environments that contain a particularly rich selection of more beneficial food sources. Decreased aversion to a bitter compound in a food source might be adaptive following the starvation of a fly with few alternatives.”</p></body> </sub-article> </article>
