is known about the organization of their inputs. Here using rabies tracing, electrophysiology and genetic tools, we compare the whole-brain inputs to these two types of striatal interneurons and dissect their functional connectivity in mice. ChAT interneurons receive a substantial cortical input from associative regions of cortex, such as the orbitofrontal cortex. Amongst subcortical inputs, a previously unknown inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus input to striatal PV interneurons is identified. Additionally, the external segment of the globus pallidus targets striatal ChAT interneurons, which is sufficient to inhibit tonic ChAT interneuron firing. Finally, we describe a novel excitatory pathway from the pedunculopontine nucleus that innervates ChAT interneurons. These results establish the brain-wide direct inputs of two major types of striatal interneurons and allude to distinct roles in regulating striatal activity and controlling behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>interneuron</kwd><kwd>rabies</kwd><kwd>ChAT</kwd><kwd>parvalbumin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS083815</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG047669</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001068</institution-id><institution>Dana Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000863</institution-id><institution>Ellison Medical Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391</institution-id><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A brain-wide mapping of the direct inputs to striatal cholinergic and parvalbumin interneurons reveals connectivity differences and implies their distinct roles in regulating striatal function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Successful behavior requires the proper control of actions based on the integration of a wide variety of information, including both environmental stimuli and internal state, being processed across numerous brain regions. The basal ganglia, particularly the striatum, its main input nucleus, is a major node in the integration of multiple cortical and subcortical inputs underlying action control and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Graybiel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hikosaka et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jin and Costa, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yin and Knowlton, 2006</xref>). The striatum is primarily composed of spiny projection neurons (SPNs), which consist ofÂ ~95% of total striatal neuronal population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerfen et al., 1990</xref>). Yet, intermixed throughout the striatum are local interneurons, which exert powerful regulation on SPN activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gittis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goldberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schulz and Reynolds, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Silberberg and Bolam, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tepper et al., 2010</xref>). This interneuron population includes large, aspiny choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive cholinergic interneurons as well as a multitude of GABAergic interneuron subtypes differentiated based on expression of parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin, calretinin and other neurochemical markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tepper et al., 2010</xref>). Numerous studies have suggested that striatal ChAT and PV interneurons exhibit different membrane properties, connectivity and effects on modulating SPN activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gittis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Silberberg and Bolam, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tepper et al., 2010</xref>). However, compared to the different subtypes of SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wall et al., 2013</xref>) or the interneurons in cerebral cortex or hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freund and BuzsÃ¡ki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wall et al., 2016</xref>), relatively little is known about the organization of inputs to striatal interneurons let alone their precise function.</p><p>While ChAT interneurons account for only 1â2% of the total striatal population, the striatum contains some of the highest levels of cholinergic markers in the brain. Dysfunction of striatal ChAT interneurons has been implicated in numerous psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, depression, and other mood disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scarr et al., 2013</xref>), yet we lack a complete understanding regarding the input architecture to ChAT interneurons and their role in modifying behavior. ChAT interneurons are tonically active and exhibit a pause and subsequent rebound firing in response to the presentation of a cue predictive of reward or aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">English et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kimura et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schulz and Reynolds, 2013</xref>). This conditioned pause is thought to encode the salience of external stimuli supporting the association of cue with action or outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aosaki et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kimura et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ravel et al., 1999</xref>). Recently, striatal ChAT interneurons have been linked with behavioral flexibility and monitoring environmental state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apicella, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradfield et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Okada et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Prado et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stalnaker et al., 2016</xref>). A vast majority of excitatory inputs to ChAT interneurons are thought to originate from centromedian and parafascicular nuclei of the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lapper and Bolam, 1992</xref>); however, cortical stimulation has been shown to increase ChAT interneuron firing as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting a wealth of underappreciated cortical inputs.</p><p>PV interneurons (also known as fast-spiking interneurons) constituteÂ ~1% of the total striatal neuronal population and their dysfunction has been implicated in multiple movement disorders and neuropsychiatric disorders including Huntingtonâs disease, dystonia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Touretteâs syndrome (TS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">BurguiÃ¨re et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kalanithi et al., 2005</xref>). Recent studies have suggested that PV interneurons increased their activity during action sequences and sensory-based decision making; however, their exact function in controlling behavior remains to be clearly determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gage et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jin et al., 2014</xref>). These neurons are capable of firing at very high rates <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gage et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jin et al., 2014</xref>) providing strong feedforward inhibition onto SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gittis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">KoÃ³s and Tepper, 1999</xref>). Striatal PV interneurons are believed to receive inputs primarily from cortex and globus pallidus, with minimal thalamic innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bevan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mallet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saunders et al., 2016</xref>). However, the inputs to striatal PV interneurons have not been exhaustively mapped, which might be crucial for understanding their function in controlling behavior.</p><p>Here using rabies-mediated monosynaptic retrograde tracing and electrophysiology with optogenetics, we compare and analyze the whole-brain direct inputs to striatal ChAT and PV interneurons. Overall, ChAT and PV interneurons receive a vast majority of their inputs from the cortex. ChAT interneurons were found to preferentially receive inputs from association areas of cortex and thalamus. Among a wealth of different input targets revealed in the tracing study, we focus on the functional validation of three novel or underappreciated inputs to ChAT and PV interneurons. Specifically, a previously unknown inhibitory input from the thalamic reticular nucleus targeting PV interneurons was identified and functionally characterized. Additionally, an inhibitory pathway from the external segment of the globus pallidus to ChAT interneurons is explored, which robustly generates a pause in ChAT interneuron activity. We also identify a direct excitatory input from the pedunculopontine nucleus that targets ChAT interneurons. These results provide cell type-specific anatomical and functional connectivity for two major types of striatal interneurons providing insight into their role in controlling behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Monosynaptic tracing reveals the inputs to striatal ChAT and PV interneurons</title><p>We used transgenic ChAT-Cre and PV-Cre mouse lines to target striatal ChAT and PV interneurons in the striatum. To validate Cre line specificity, a Cre-dependent AAV virus that expresses eGFP was injected into the dorsal striatum of either ChAT-Cre or PV-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Additionally, <italic>ex vivo</italic> electrophysiological recordings of GFP-expressing ChAT or PV interneurons show typical electrophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

While all four intralaminar nuclei had inputs targeting ChAT interneurons, our dG-rabies tracing revealed that PV interneurons also received significant projections from intralaminar thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Interestingly, ChAT interneurons have inputs from all intralaminar nuclei and associative thalamic nuclei like mediodorsal thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Together, these data suggest that like association cortex, associative thalamic nuclei and intralaminar nuclei also have a substantial proportion of inputs targeting striatal ChAT interneurons.</p><p>Our dG-rabies tracing surprisingly revealed that PV interneurons receive a projection from the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The TRN is a thin shell of GABAergic neurons that was thought to project within thalamus regulating thalamocortical and corticothalamic communications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Halassa and AcsÃ¡dy, 2016</xref>). The rabies-eGFP signal was clearly located within the TRN as evidenced by colocalization with parvalbumin (PV) or somatostatin (SOM) immunostaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clemente-Perez et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1e,f</xref>, PV: rabies-eGFP colocalization 33.44 Â± 6.08%, SOM: rabies-eGFP colocalization 43.73 Â± 3.88%), and was enriched in the most rostral pole of the TRN. Noticeably, the labeling of TRN was never observed in control experiments with either helper or rabies virus alone nor were TVA-mCherry starter cells observed in TRN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1h,i</xref>). In order to anatomically validate this projection from TRN to PV interneurons independently, three additional viral tracing experiments were performed. In the first approach, anterograde tracing from TRN in PV-Cre mice with a Cre-dependent AAV expressing eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), showed that labeled TRN neurons sent projections coursing rostrally into the striatum and form close appositions to PV interneuron somas and proximal dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Secondly, using a convergent intersectional approach to trace TRN projections, a retrograde AAV virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>) carrying Flp-recombinase was injected into dorsal striatum of a PV-Cre mouse, while a dual necessity Cre-/Flp- recombinant INTRSECT AAV virus was injected in TRN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Following transfection, eYFP-expressing cell bodies were seen in the anterior TRN, but not surrounding areas like GPe, with clear axonal projections observed in the dorsal thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Utilizing striatal PV immunostaining, eYFP fibers from TRN were observed to be in close apposition to PV cell somas in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). As an additional confirmation of TRN to striatal connectivity we injected Somatostatin-IRES-Cre mice with Cre-dependent AAV-FLEX-eGFP to label TRN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1gâi</xref>). TRN expressed eGFP selectively and eGFP-positive fibers can be seen near PV interneurons in striatum.

Brief paired blue laser stimulation of TRN ChR2-positive terminals in the striatum over PV interneurons, in the presence of AMPAR and NMDAR antagonists, exhibited fast latency, monosynaptic IPSCs in 53.8% (7/13) of the cells recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3hâj</xref>). These large, reliable, and paired-pulse depressing IPSCs were blocked by the GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist picrotoxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). Connectivity was not determined by location as PV interneurons in close proximity to other connected PV interneurons did not show connectivity in the same brain slice.

In contrast, we found that projections from associative regions of cortex, including the orbital and cingulate cortex, and the associative regions of the thalamus, including intralaminar nuclei and mediodorsal nucleus, preferentially targeted ChAT interneurons. The orbital cortex has been shown to be involved in decision making, reversal learning and shifting from goal-directed to habit learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McAlonan and Brown, 2003</xref>). The cingulate cortex has been described as an interface between motivation, cognition and action with roles associated with effort, action value, reward expectancy, and behavioral flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hadland et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hayden and Platt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Johnston et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paus, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shidara and Richmond, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Walton et al., 2004</xref>).

This preferential connectivity suggests a specific role of ChAT interneurons in context-dependent modulation of action and behavioral flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Matamales et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, recent work suggests cholinergic interneurons use orbitofrontal inputs to track current environmental state during behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stalnaker et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, we find a novel, functional excitatory pathway from the PPN to striatal ChAT interneurons. This pathway, part of the ascending reticular activating system, may coordinate with the basal forebrain to regulate levels of arousal in cortex and striatum concomitantly, representing a mechanism of context-dependent gain control of behavior (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref> for visual anatomical summary of ChAT and PV inputs).</p><p>When our current data are considered collectively with previous studies using monosynaptic rabies tracing from other striatal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wall et al., 2013</xref>), a general theme appears. Each cell type in the striatum appears to have access to the same inputs within a topographic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hintiryan et al., 2016</xref>), but significant preferences do exist for certain cell types, which imbues functional distinctions. In the case of direct and indirect pathway SPNs, it was found that the amygdala almost exclusively targeted direct pathway, but not indirect pathway SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wall et al., 2013</xref>). For the patch/matrix SPNs, the most prominent distinction was limbic subcortical inputs, primarily from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis preferentially innervating the patch compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). For ChAT and PV interneurons, our rabies tracing indicates a number of differences that lend insight into the differential role these interneuron subtypes in regulating striatal output to control action selection and learning. Interestingly, when analyzing the cortical laminar breakdown in associative versus sensorimotor cortices we observed more superficial layer projections from associative cortex versus more deep layer projections from sensorimotor cortex in both the ChAT and PV rabies tracing dataset, which was also observed in the patch/matrix rabies tracing data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smith et al., 2016</xref>).

However, additional interneuron subtypes will need to be tested to determine the precise mechanism of TRN-mediated SPN modulation. Traditionally, TRN is thought to send projections only within thalamus regulating thalamocortical communications and acting as an attentional spotlight or filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pinault, 2004</xref>).

Using <italic>in vivo</italic> striatal recordings with optogenetic stimulation of TRN terminals in striatum, we observed that putative striatal fast spiking interneurons (FSIs) were inhibited during optical stimulation, while a subpopulation of SPNs showed firing rate modulation either directly via PV interneurons or indirectly through a network effect. This subcortical pathway is well positioned to relay attention-related information directly to the striatum. By targeting striatal PV interneurons, we speculate that it might be possible to effectively bias action selection and coordinate an animalâs ongoing behavior with corresponding attentional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gage et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jin et al., 2014</xref>).

Our rabies tracing data confirmed these connections as well as demonstrated for the first time a functional connection from GPe to striatal ChAT interneurons. The GPe projections to striatal ChAT and PV interneurons draw from similar proportions of NPAS1, FoxP2 and a small minority of PV and ChAT neurons.

Utilizing whole-cell recordings, we confirmed that the GPe has a high degree of connectivity to both striatal ChAT and PV interneurons, as well as SPNs. In classical Pavlovian conditioning or stimulus-response learning, ChAT interneurons, which are tonically active, exhibits a pause in firing within a few hundred milliseconds after the presentation of the conditioned stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aosaki et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kimura et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ravel et al., 1999</xref>).

While the precise function of the pause response in ChAT interneurons remains to be elucidated at a behavioral level, it has been suggested to encode the salience of external stimuli and regulate local dopamine release in striatum. The neural mechanism underlying the pause has caused an extensive debate in the field. Several cellular mechanisms involving multiple sources have been proposed, including the contributions from the intrinsic cell membrane properties of ChAT interneurons, dopamine regulation or GABA co-release, and thalamic inputs with the involvement of an unidentified type of striatal GABAergic interneuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">English et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nelson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schulz and Reynolds, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Straub et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sullivan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>).

Considering recent studies implying that striatum-projecting GPe neurons play a crucial role during action cancelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mallet et al., 2016</xref>), our current results thus further reinforce that the GPe to striatal interneuron projections may be an important part of the feedback circuitry involved in context-dependent action control.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>An excitatory pedunculopontine nucleus input to striatal ChAT interneurons</title><p>In this study, we identified a novel, functional excitatory PPN pathway that was selectively enriched in it projections to ChAT interneurons, but not SPNs. Previous literature suggested a significant anatomical cholinergic PPN input to striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dautan et al., 2014</xref>). Co-release of glutamate from cholinergic terminals in striatum on ChAT interneurons may be one possible source of this excitatory signal. Yet, previous evidence does not lend strong support for the idea of co-release with a vast majority of cholinergic neurons in PPN lacking expression of vGluT2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang and Morales, 2009</xref>). Alternatively, the lack of rabies labeling of cholinergic cells in PPN may be attributed to a technical limitation with rabies labeling of neuromodulatory synapses. For example, several striatal rabies tracing studies using the same technique do not find significant rabies labeling of dopamine neurons in the substania nigra pars compacta (SNc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wall et al., 2013</xref>), despite the dense innervation of dopamine terminals from the SNc in dorsal striatum. Alternatively, ChAT interneurons may not receive direct cholinergic projections from PPN. Additional, studies will be needed to address the role of two sources of acetylcholine from ChAT interneurons or PPN terminals in striatum and determine what, if any, crosstalk occurs on striatal interneurons.</p><p>Our anatomical tracing data indicate that ChAT interneurons receive more projections from associative regions of cortex and thalamus (e.g. lateral orbital cortex, retrosplenial cortex, mediodorsal thalamus, etc.). Conversely, PV interneurons receive more inputs from sensorimotor regions, including primary motor and somatosensory cortical areas. These preferential inputs suggest a potential functional distinction for their role in controlling behavior, whereby ChAT interneurons may receive internal cognitive or external environmental information for context-dependent action modulation, while PV interneurons may integrate sensorimotor information for action learning and selection. Together, these data indicate a comprehensive revision of striatal circuitry with distinct, yet complimentary roles for striatal ChAT and PV interneurons in shaping striatal function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus)</italic></td><td>ChAT-IRES-Cre</td><td>Jackson Labs</td><td>stock #006410;

The brain was carefully extracted and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight (24 hr). The brain was then transferred to 30% sucrose/0.1M PB for 1â2 days until the brain equilibrated and sunk. The brain was then blocked with a brain matrix (Zivic Instruments; Pittsburg, PA) to obtain a true coronal plane and mounted on a freezing microtome. Additional ChAT-Cre and PV-Cre animals were cut in the sagittal plane to avoid missing any targets in rostral or caudal sites. Only neurons ipsilateral to the injection site were quantified. Coronal slices were collected at 50 Âµm resolution in 96 well plates containing cyroprotectant (0.1M phosphate buffer, ethylene glycol, glycerol) to maintain AP position. Every other brain slice was plated on super frost plus slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for a whole brain reconstruction at 100 Âµm resolution. Slides were counterstained with DAPI and cover slipped with aqua-poly mount mounting media (Polysciences, Inc; Warrington, PA). Slides were scanned on an automated slide scanner (Olympus VS120) at 10x in the blue and green channels. Images were batch converted to composite TIFFs and saved for image analysis.

To check the most rostral and caudal regions of the brain for expression additional mouse brains in the sagittal plane were analyzed.

For electrophysiological recording, we utilized electrode arrays (Innovative Neurophysiology Inc.; Durham, NC) of 16 tungsten contacts (2Â ÃÂ 8) that were 35 Âµm in diameter. Electrodes were spaced 150 Âµm apart in the same row and 200 Âµm apart between two rows. Total length of electrodes was 5 mm. Each array with an optic fiber directly attached was employed. The tip of the fiber wasÂ ~200 Âµm away from the tips of the electrodes and the optic fiber was firmly fixed to the array for the duration of each recording session.

After the recording session, the recorded spikes were further isolated into individual units by an offline sorting software (Offline Sorter, Plexon Inc, Dallas, TX). Each individual unit displayed a clear refractory period in the inter-spike interval histogram, with no spikes during the refractory period (larger than 1.3 ms).</p><p>To optogenetically stimulate GPe or TRN terminals within striatum, we injected non-floxed version of AAV-ChR2 virus (0.2 Âµl of AAV9-hsyn-ChR2-eYFP, Penn Vector Core) into the GPe (AP â0.46, MLÂ +Â â1.9, DV â3.3) or a Cre-dependent AAV-ChR2 in a PV-Cre mouse for TRN (AP â0.58, MLÂ +Â â1.25, DV â3.5) (0.1 Âµl of AAV9-Ef1a-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP, Penn Vector Core) (titerÂ ~2Ã10<sup>12</sup>). For each recording session, blue laser stimulation was delivered through the optic fiber from a 473 nm laser (Laserglow Technologies, Toronto, ON) via a fiber-optic patch cord, and the neuronal responses were simultaneously recorded. The stimulation patterns included 1 s constant light and 20 or 50 Hz (10 ms pulse width, 20 or 50 pulses in 1 s). The inter-stimulation interval was 4 s and each stimulation pattern was repeated for 30 trials.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas A Stalnaker (Reviewer #1); Jesus Bertran-Gonzalez (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript utilizes an array of techniques including viral tracing, genetics, and electrophysiology to characterize the inputs to and potential functional roles of the parvalbumin and cholinergic striatal interneurons. Identifying the distinct circuits and potential roles of these two striatal compartments is an important and long-standing question in systems neuroscience, and the current experiments were judged to be a valuable addition to this work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While all three reviewers appreciated the sheer amount and also the high quality of much of the data, they also felt that overall the paper came across as somewhat inconclusive or unfocused. On discussion, it was generally agreed that this was due to the lack of consistency in the behavioral approaches and the results. In contrast to the anatomical and ex vivo electrophysiological data, the behavioral experiments tended to suffer from major weaknesses (inconsistent designs, lack of opto controls, use of primarily excitatory methods, non-physiologic parameters) that made their interpretation difficult and/or there were inconsistencies across experiments that were difficult to resolve. These issues are evident across the reviews. While the authors may feel that these can all be resolved, the consensus of the reviewers was that the paper would be much better if it were refocused on the anatomical comparisons, with the behavioral results removed. This change, along with some adjustments to the comparisons (point #2, reviewer #3), were judged to be the essential revisions. We realize this is a large change, but if the authors are willing to do this, the reviewers felt a revision would be worthwhile.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript presents a wide array of experiments whose overarching object is to characterize the inputs to and functional roles of parvalbumin (PV) and cholnergic (CIN) striatal interneurons.</p><p>The experiments are technically sophisticated and the results are very thoroughly and clearly reported. There is a veritable mountain of interesting data in this manuscript. The anatomical tracing results are especially valuable and important. The one general weakness is that the functional experimental results are suggestive rather than constituting solid tests of the hypotheses in question. Below, I will try to specify what I mean. However, in spite of this weakness, I think that the data taken together, particularly the anatomical data, are of such importance and so thoroughly presented that the manuscript should be published with only minor revisions.</p><p>1) I don't think that the functional data regarding the thalamic reticular nucleus inputs to PV neurons say very much. Here the authors stimulated these inputs in freely moving mice and found that locomotion was increased. However, there is no way to tell what this might mean. In the Discussion, this result is linked to a role for this input in modulation of attention, biasing action selection, and coordinating sensory attention and action. But really the result does not provide evidence supporting any of those ideas one way or the other.</p><p>2) The external segment of the globus pallidus inputs onto CINs are suggested to be involved in generating CIN pauses and possibly in reinforcement learning. But pause-like responses occur when these inputs are stimulated continuously for nearly a second, which is unlikely to be a physiologically relevant mechanism. The authors also show that mice will learn to push a lever to stimulate these inputs and in a separate experiment to inhibit CINs. These results are interesting and suggestive. However, the latter effect is only about one tenth the magnitude of the former effect, suggesting that some other mechanism besides inhibiting CINs must be in play. I think the authors should comment on the disparity between the magnitude of these two results. What other mechanism (besides inhibition of CINs) might account for the highly robust self-stimulation of these inputs?</p><p>3) The behavioral effects of ablating CINs or PV neurons are suggestive and interesting, but again I think the conclusions reached are far from clearly supported. The PV-ablation effect on operant learning is very convincing. However, this does not seem consistent with what others have suggested in regard to PV neurons â e.g. a role in action selection. Can the authors clarify whether their data shed any light on why PV-ablation results in such an enormous learning deficit? In the case of the CIN-ablation effect on the go/no go task, can the authors shed any additional light on why they interpret this as a deficit in context-dependent control of actions? Under this interpretation, why would the effect on baseline responding appear on day 1, before any learning of context has occurred in control mice? Wouldn't an alternative interpretation be that these rats have an unconditioned increase in food-elicited hyper-activity that they slowly learn to suppress?</p><p>Finally, two other questions/issues that I think the authors should address:</p><p>a) They should clarify how many mice contributed to the rabies tracing experiment (sorry if I missed this), and where the placements were located. How did the authors confirm that the initial infusions of virus took place in identical locations in the PV-cre vs. Chat-cre mice? Furthermore, are there any data in this experiment speaking to whether associative cortical inputs to CINs occur more in the dorsomedial locations in striatum or sensorimotor inputs to PV neurons occur more in dorsolateral locations? The authors show that overall the number of originator neurons in dorsomedial vs. dorsolateral are similar, but doesn't that proportion vary in each brain, and if so, wouldn't that shed some light on my question?</p><p>b) Can the authors comment on why they might have found that the pedunculopontine inputs to striatum are not cholinergic, in contrast to previously published data?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript Klug et al. use viral tracing, genetics, and electrophysiology to map the inputs to parvalbumin (PV) and cholinergic (ChAT) interneurons in the dorsal striatum. They identify some previously unknown or underappreciated inputs, particularly the TRN input to PV interneurons, which will be of interest to the basal ganglia field. I found the input tracing part of their study (Figures 1, 2, 3, 6, and accompanying supplementary figures) compelling, novel, and believe it deserves to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The authors also use optogenetics to examine the function of three prominent inputs to PV or ChAT cells: a previously unknown GABAergic projection from the thalamic reticular nucleus, a projection from GPe, and a projection from the pedunculopontine nucleus. While I applaud the authors' intentions and recognize the huge effort that went into these experiments, I felt that these behavioral experiments were not well designed because there were some big inconsistencies in behavioral tasks, and the controls were sometimes not defined or poorly chosen. Additionally, in my reading the cell ablation study at the end seems to contradict some of the optogenetics results. For example, in Figure 4 they show that activating the GABAergic TRN projection to striatum-which preferentially targets PV cells-increases distance traveled. But in Figure 7 they show that genetically ablating PV cells doesn't affect distance traveled but it does affect time in center of arena (a measure of anxiety). Not only do these results seem contradictory, but the data the authors choose to plot in Figures 4 and 7 are inherently different. I was also confused why the authors used an ICSS task in Figure 5, but a food reward task in Figure 7. I also had a hard time finding information about number of animals or how the control experiments were designed. There were also few if any GFP or YFP control experiments for the optogenetics part. Finally, the authors over-relied on optogenetic excitation of different inputs, which raises the concern about showing sufficiency not necessity.</p><p>I don't think the manuscript in its current form can be published without major changes to the behavioral experiments, or elimination of the behavioral experiments section altogether and publication of just the input tracing part.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This study gathers an impressive range of techniques and presents a comprehensive anatomical, physiological and behavioural dataset aimed at determining the specific circuitry controlling cholinergic (ChAT) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons of the striatum. The authors start by identifying, at the whole-brain scale, the immediate circuitry inputting each interneuronal system through retrograde trans-synaptic tracing, which then use to confirm some of the suggested circuitry and, more importantly, identify previously unrecognised projections. The authors go on and characterise three of these new circuits (TRN to PV, GPe to ChAT and PPN to ChAT) and also conduct confirmatory behavioural experiments whereby each interneuronal subpopulation is selectively ablated using toxicogenetics. Overall this study is excellent and will significantly contribute to this field of research.</p><p>I have however a few observations that would be worth clarifying/discussing before this manuscript reaches its final form:</p><p>1) The finding that the same number of starter cells are present in the two Cre lines is puzzling (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E-G). Does this mean that the actual density is the same in both populations? This contrasts with the view that PV neurons are more frequent than ChAT neurons in the dorsal striatum. Perhaps it would be worth contrasting those numbers with those obtained in WT mice, just to rule out that Cre expression does not limit the proliferation of any of the two populations, as seems to be happening in certain lines (e.g. Harno et al. Cell Metabolism, 2013, 18 (1); 21-28). This is only a suggestion that might help reconciling with previous literature.</p><p>2) In many instances in the paper, the percent of total inputs to PV and ChAT interneurons is statistically compared across the two systems side by side (e.g. Figure 1âfigure supplement 2F-G; Figure 2B-F; Figure 3A-C; Figure S4A-L; Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A). I am unsure about the validity of this comparison. To me, even if the number of starter neurons is similar and the area is matching, these two subpopulations form entirely different systems with very dissimilar physiological and morphological characteristics (e.g. Kawaguchi, JNeurosci, 1993,13(11); 4908-23). Features like dendritic arborisation, synaptic density and overall cellular volume may influence to a large extent the efficiency of trans-synaptic infection, therefore providing a very different pattern of labelling in circuits inputting onto PV and ChAT neurons. While this provides very valuable information on the relative proportion of afferent projections from diverse brain regions to each interneuronal system separately, I fail to see how comparing across the two systems is informative. Thus, claims such &quot;ChAT neurons received significantly more inputs from the associative cortex than PV neurons&quot; would be misleading. I think that all data should be presented (and statistical comparisons done) in each system separately-comparisons like &quot;ChAT neurons received significantly more inputs from associative than sensorimotor cortices whereas PV neurons showed the opposite trend&quot; would be appropriate. This would also reduce the amount of statistical comparisons, and would allow using within-subjects analyses which can be more powerful.</p><p>3) In the TRN study (subsection âDifferent thalamic projections to striatal ChAT vs. PV interneuronsâ, second paragraph), it is not immediately evident that parvalbumin and somatostatin staining inform about the anatomical boundary of the TRN, while this is a critical point in later viral manipulations (i.e. Figure 3A). It would be helpful to clarify this a bit more in the text, perhaps providing citations that describe the PV and SOM markers in TRN.</p><p>4) While the full characterisation of the transgenic lines presented at the very start of the paper is appreciated, I find that some viral spread and/or multielectrode placement confirmation may be lacking in some of the in vivo experiments. For example the TRN and GPe multielectrode/optogenetics experiments (Figure 4, Figure 3âfigure supplement 3, Figure 5, Figure 4âfigure supplement 2) do not have placement verifications. Adding a diagram with the locations in each experimental animal could be helpful.</p><p>5) The toxicogenetics experiments seem very clean and are a very good option to expose the role of each interneuronal system in action control. In the case of ChAT ablation, the authors did not find any deficit in the initial acquisition of instrumental behaviours (Figure 7), and they found an increase of baseline lever-pressing rate which had no consequence on later stimulus-response learning. The authors argue that these data support that ChAT interneurons play a role in providing context to the modulation of action. However, I think that it is difficult to reach this conclusion with the data presented in this paper, although other studies could be mentioned to support it. It would be important to discuss the results in Matamales et al., 2016, where authors performed a very similar DTR-induced ablation of ChAT neurons in the dorsal striatum of mice, and they too studied its effects on action control. In that study it was also found that there was no change in the establishment of initial instrumental contingencies, but the ChAT-depleted mice were unable to update these contingencies upon reversal. This paper is relevant and supports the role of ChAT neurons in contextual modulation of action.</p><p>6) On the other hand, the authors found that PV ablation dramatically impaired instrumental behaviours (Figure 7K), and also reported that these mice show virtually no sensitivity to stimuli. However, would the primary impairment in instrumental learning not preclude performance during the go/no go test? Can the conclusion &quot;PV interneurons are important for stimulus-response associations&quot; be formulated if animals show very limited instrumental capacity? This is perhaps worth discussing a bit.</p><p>7) Figure 8F is not referred to in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35657.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While all three reviewers appreciated the sheer amount and also the high quality of much of the data, they also felt that overall the paper came across as somewhat inconclusive or unfocused.

We removed all behavioral experiments from the manuscript, removed nearly all statistical comparisons between ChAT and PV tracing datasets instead refocusing on within group comparisons and extensively revised the manuscript to address all the reviewersâ concerns. We have removed three main figures and updated three main figures. Additionally, we have removed two supplementary figures, updated one supplemental figure and added a new supplemental figure. More specifically, the manuscript has been updated in the following:</p><p>1) We have removed all behavioral data including TRN terminal stimulation locomotion and accelerometer data (Figure 4), ICSS data (Figure 5), and ChAT and PV diphtheria-mediated ablation data (Figures 7 and 8), as well as three supplemental figures including cortical layer breakdown by cortical subregion (Supplementary Figure 4) and two diphtheria-mediated lesion behavior supplementals (Supplementary Figures 9 and 10).</p><p>2) All statistical comparisons between ChAT and PV including main Figures 2, 3, 4 and Supplementary Figure 4 are removed (except for Figure 2A, see the explanation below) and we have emphasized only the within-ChAT or PV comparisons throughout the results.</p><p>3) We have extensively revised the manuscript from the title to Discussion to integrate all of the changes mentioned above.</p><p>4) We have added images of parvalbumin and somatostatin staining of TRN to address the reviewerâs concern on the expression of parvalbumin and somatostatin neurons in TRN (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E, F).</p><p>5) We have added a new supplementary figure to address in vivo recording array placement (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2).</p><p>6) We have added within group laminar cortical statistical comparisons (Results, subsection âMonosynaptic tracing reveals the inputs to striatal ChAT and PV interneuronsâ, last paragraph) and added some commentary on the similarities in the inputs of cortical laminar organization between interneuron and striatal D1-/D2- or patch-/matrix-projection neurons in associative and sensorimotor cortex (Discussion, subsection âDifferential excitatory inputs to ChAT and PV striatal interneuronsâ last paragraph).</p><p>7) We have added a new paragraph to the discussion on the PPN excitatory inputs to ChAT interneurons comparing and contrasting against known PPN cholinergic inputs to striatum (Discussion, subsection âAn excitatory pedunculopontine nucleus input to striatal ChAT interneuronsâ first paragraph).</p><p>We hope the reviewers now find that these revisions have addressed all the concerns and the manuscript is now suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[â¦] 1) I don't think that the functional data regarding the thalamic reticular nucleus inputs to PV neurons say very much.

Our intention was simply to functionally validate the inhibitory TRN projection to striatal PV interneuron in freely moving animals. We found stimulation of TRN terminals in striatum facilitates locomotion. Following the reviewerâs suggestion, however, we have now removed that figure and all the TRN behavioral data from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The external segment of the globus pallidus inputs onto CINs are suggested to be involved in generating CIN pauses and possibly in reinforcement learning.

The 1-s stimulation duration was initially chosen because we found that it is efficient for supporting ICSS learning behavior. While we agree that 1-s constant terminal stimulation is not necessarily physiologically relevant, we would like to point out that inhibition of tonic firing in ChAT and PV occurs within the first tens of milliseconds following laser on. We have confirmed that this is the case for suppressing tonic basal firing in ChAT with fast latency in both ex vivo brain slice (Figure 4D, E and Figure 4âfigure supplement 2H, I) and in in vivo recordings (Figure 4J). We have now removed the ICSS behavioral data based on reviewersâ suggestions and left only the electrophysiological data in Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also show that mice will learn to push a lever to stimulate these inputs and in a separate experiment to inhibit CINs.

We agree with the reviewer and have stated in the main text that direct ChAT inhibition only partially recapitulates the effects of GPe terminal stimulation in striatum in terms of ICSS magnitude. It is possible that GPe terminal stimulation inhibits many different striatal neurons including various interneurons and SPNs, and this inhibition works in concert with possible dopamine release evoked by ChAT interneuron rebound activity through nAChR on dopamine terminals (Cragg, 2006) for supporting ICSS behavior. In comparison, direct inhibition of ChAT interneurons will be restricted to a rather small number of ChAT cells due to the sparse distribution of ChAT interneurons in dorsal striatum (1-2%) and limited spread of light. However, we have decided to remove the ICSS dataset from the manuscript per the reviewersâ suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The behavioral effects of ablating CINs or PV neurons are suggestive and interesting, but again I think the conclusions reached are far from clearly supported.

We agree that striatal PV interneurons have been found to play a role in action selection (Gage et al., 2010). However, recent studies have expanded this role and suggested that striatal PV interneurons might be important in associative learning (Lee et al., 2017; Owen et al., 2018), consistent with what we found in our study.

In our ChAT ablation data, rates of lever pressing are comparable between controls and lesion mice over seven days of continuous reinforcement (CRF) training. However, the difference of increased baseline press rate and magazine headentry rate in ChAT lesion versus controls appears on the first day of Go/No-Go training. We have now removed the ChAT and PV cell ablation behavioral data from the manuscript based on the reviewersâ suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, two other questions/issues that I think the authors should address:</p><p>a) They should clarify how many mice contributed to the rabies tracing experiment (sorry if I missed this), and where the placements were located.

We have moved the number of animals included in the rabies tracing earlier in the Results section and in the Materials and methods section. ChAT (N = 6) and PV (N = 5) mice were used in the rabies tracing experiments (Results, subsection âMonosynaptic tracing reveals the inputs to striatal ChAT and PV interneuronsâ, second paragraph; Materials and methods, subsection âDelta G-Rabies Tracing Viral Injectionsâ). The coordinates and details for helper and rabies injections are found in the Materials and methods section under the header âDelta G Rabies Tracing Viral Injectionsâ. The coordinates used were AP +0.5, ML -1.8, DV -2.25 to target dorsal central striatum. ChAT-Cre and PV-Cre mice were stereotaxic injected using the same coordinates and volumes of virus following a precise levelling of the skull in respect to bregma and lambda. Mice from both groups were injected within the same day. Rabies expression throughout dorsal striatum was confirmed in all brains prior to whole-brain cell counting and only included in the analysis if starter cells were contained within the dorsal striatum (see Figure 1âfigure supplement 2 for example of starter cell confirmation and lack of cortical expression in negative controls).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, are there any data in this experiment speaking to whether associative cortical inputs to CINs occur more in the dorsomedial locations in striatum or sensorimotor inputs to PV neurons occur more in dorsolateral locations?

Our goal was to recruit as many starter cells as possible given that the interneuron types only make up roughly 1% of the total striatal neuron population. An additional complication for this quantification is the fact that striatal subdivisions are a gradient (ventral medial to dorsal lateral) defined more by the inputs then sharply demarcated territories with well-defined boundaries (Voorn et al., 2004). While there was variance in the number of starter cells, in our experiments the distribution of starters was similar across dorsal medial and dorsal lateral territories (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2, determined with a simple bisecting line between dorsal medial and dorsal lateral striatum).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Can the authors comment on why they might have found that the pedunculopontine inputs to striatum are not cholinergic, in contrast to previously published data?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. Our data does not preclude the existence of a cholinergic input from the PPN to striatum that has been previously reported in rats (Dautan et al., 2014). The lack of rabies labeled cholinergic neurons in this study using mice may potentially be due to a technical limitation with rabies tracing of neuromodulatory inputs because of their non-conventional synapses. For example, several striatal tracing studies using the same technique do not find significant rabies labeling of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) (Smith et al., 2016; Wall et al., 2013), despite the SNc densely innervating the dorsal striatum. We assume that one reason could be that cholinergic projections from PPN may not label well with the rabies transsynaptic tracing system. Alternatively, the PPN cholinergic projection may not synapse directly on striatal ChAT interneurons. The selectivity of this system may give some hints as to why there are at least two sources of acetylcholine in striatum. We have added a paragraph in the Discussion to address these points (subsection âAn excitatory pedunculopontine nucleus input to striatal ChAT interneuronsâ, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[â¦] The authors also use optogenetics to examine the function of three prominent inputs to PV or ChAT cells: a previously unknown GABAergic projection from the thalamic reticular nucleus, a projection from GPe, and a projection from the pedunculopontine nucleus.

Additionally, in my reading the cell ablation study at the end seems to contradict some of the optogenetics results. For example, in Figure 4 they show that activating the GABAergic TRN projection to striatum-which preferentially targets PV cells-increases distance traveled. But in Figure 7 they show that genetically ablating PV cells doesn't affect distance traveled but it does affect time in center of arena (a measure of anxiety). Not only do these results seem contradictory, but the data the authors choose to plot in Figures 4 and 7 are inherently different.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion on the behavioral data. Our intention was to assign some functional behavioral relevance to the brain-wide inputs to striatal interneurons. We thank the reviewer for the pointing out the possible inconsistency on the role of PV interneurons and the locomotion. One possible reason underlying this difference is the different time course of inhibition vs. ablation, which may play an important role in determining the final behavioral outcome. TRN facilitation of locomotion (potentially via inhibition of PV interneurons) occurs on the order of seconds, while PV cell ablation evolves over the course of weeks that might allow circuit-level compensation to occur. In regards to the differences in plotting the data in Figures 4 and 7, we intended to use accelerometer which samples at 1kHz, much faster than video tracking, to show transient locomotion initiations. Nevertheless, we have responded to the reviewersâ suggestions by removing all behavioral data in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I was also confused why the authors used an ICSS task in Figure 5, but a food reward task in Figure 7.

Our intention in choosing an ICSS task in the previous Figure 5 was due to the fact that optogenetic GPe terminal stimulation was sufficient to initiate a pause-rebound firing pattern in ChAT interneurons. Given the literature on acetylcholine-mediated dopamine release from dopamine terminals in striatum (Sulzer et al., 2016), we hypothesized that GPe terminal stimulation may trigger dopamine release as well.

However, we did use 5Hz optogenetic laser stimulation serving as a within animal control for laser stimulation in that particular experiment. We did not observe any significant changes in locomotion following 5Hz stimulation versus preceding baseline. Also, we have gone to great lengths to shield the light at the ferrule to optic fiber connection to avoid a visual laser light cue. We agree with the reviewer that in order to demonstrate the necessity besides sufficiency for different inputs, it would require optogenetic inhibition experiments, which in many cases might be harder to conduct due to the distributed input cells. Nevertheless, based on the reviewersâ suggestion, we have now removed all the behavioral data from the manuscript to keep it more focused.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I don't think the manuscript in its current form can be published without major changes to the behavioral experiments, or elimination of the behavioral experiments section altogether and publication of just the input tracing part.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.

Yet, those numbers have varied from study to study and are also dependent on species (Oorschot et al. 2013). While the absolute number is up for debate the overall comparison between the number between ChAT and PV is more similar than different. Unbiased stereological cell counts of immunostained striatum suggest minimum estimates of 1-2% of ChAT interneurons versus 0.7% of PV interneurons (Luk and Sadikot, 2001; Rymar et al., 2004). Yet others have found estimates of 0.43% ChAT interneurons versus 0.59% PV interneurons in the rat dorsal striatum (Oorschot et al. 2013). The total counts we obtained of immunostained ChAT and PV interneurons in dorsal striatum was not significantly different (average number of immunopositive neurons per brain slice in striatum, N=7 per group, taken from 10 brain slices (40Âµm thick) spanning the injection site; ChAT 207.6 Â± 12.63, PV 170.7 Â± 47.46; two-tailed unpaired t-test, p = 0.8048. Given the similar counts of interneurons, the fact we find a comparable number of starter cells seems consistent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In many instances in the paper, the percent of total inputs to PV and ChAT interneurons is statistically compared across the two systems side by side (e.g. Figure 1âfigure supplement 2F-G; Figure 2B-F; Figure 3A-C; Figure S4A-L; Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A). I am unsure about the validity of this comparison. To me, even if the number of starter neurons is similar and the area is matching, these two subpopulations form entirely different systems with very dissimilar physiological and morphological characteristics (e.g. Kawaguchi, JNeurosci, 1993,13(11); 4908-23). Features like dendritic arborisation, synaptic density and overall cellular volume may influence to a large extent the efficiency of trans-synaptic infection, therefore providing a very different pattern of labelling in circuits inputting onto PV and ChAT neurons. While this provides very valuable information on the relative proportion of afferent projections from diverse brain regions to each interneuronal system separately, I fail to see how comparing across the two systems is informative. Thus, claims such &quot;ChAT neurons received significantly more inputs from the associative cortex than PV neurons&quot; would be misleading. I think that all data should be presented (and statistical comparisons done) in each system separately-comparisons like &quot;ChAT neurons received significantly more inputs from associative than sensorimotor cortices whereas PV neurons showed the opposite trend&quot; would be appropriate. This would also reduce the amount of statistical comparisons, and would allow using within-subjects analyses which can be more powerful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the question regarding the validity of the anatomical comparison between percent of total inputs to ChAT versus PV interneurons. While we agree with the reviewer and acknowledge the differences in dendritic arborization, synaptic density and overall cellular volume between the two interneuron types, the side-by-side comparisons we conducted have been following a common practice in the field in which many researchers seemly still find normalized comparisons informative (Beier et al., 2015 Cell; Faget et al., 2016 Cell Reports; Kim et al., 2015 Neuron; Ogawa et al., 2014 Cell Reports; Smith et al., 2016; Wall et al., 2013; Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012 Neuron; Weissbourd et al., 2014 Neuron). Please refer to Figure 4G of Owaga et al., Figure 2D of Weissbourd et al. and Figure 3H of Faget et al.</p><p>However, following the reviewerâs suggestion, we have now removed all statistical comparisons between ChAT and PV interneurons throughout the main Figures 2 and 3, and completely removed the Supplementary Figure 4. In the manuscript we have now focused mainly on the within-group comparisons (Figure 2B-F and Figure 4âfigure supplement 1). However, we have left the significance markers in Figure 2A for the readers in the field to make their own judgments without us making any major claims in the main text. Please let us know if it is ok or if you would like us to remove it too.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the TRN study (subsection âDifferent thalamic projections to striatal ChAT vs. PV interneuronsâ, second paragraph), it is not immediately evident that parvalbumin and somatostatin staining inform about the anatomical boundary of the TRN, while this is a critical point in later viral manipulations (i.e. Figure 3A). It would be helpful to clarify this a bit more in the text, perhaps providing citations that describe the PV and SOM markers in TRN.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for calling this to our attention. TRN PV and SOM cells are seen throughout the AP axis of the TRN. The only unique topography is in the number of SOM-positive cells in the central tier of the middle sector of the TRN is lower than the number of PV-positive cells. Very few neurons display both PV and SOM markers (10-20%) in the somatosensory TRN (Clemente-Perez et al., 2017). We have added parvalbumin and somatostatin immunostaining of TRN to Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E, F. Additionally, we have added a citation referencing the two main types of TRN neurons (PV and SOM) in the Results section of the manuscript (Clemente-Perez et al., 2017) (subsection âThalamic projections to striatal ChAT and PV interneuronsâ, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) While the full characterisation of the transgenic lines presented at the very start of the paper is appreciated, I find that some viral spread and/or multielectrode placement confirmation may be lacking in some of the in vivo experiments. For example the TRN and GPe multielectrode/optogenetics experiments (Figure 4, Figure 3âfigure supplement 3, Figure 5, Figure 4âfigure supplement 2) do not have placement verifications. Adding a diagram with the locations in each experimental animal could be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have added Figure 3âfigure supplement 2 with representative in vivo recording sites for TRN to dorsal striatal recordings or GPe to striatal recordings to address this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The toxicogenetics experiments seem very clean and are a very good option to expose the role of each interneuronal system in action control. In the case of ChAT ablation, the authors did not find any deficit in the initial acquisition of instrumental behaviours (Figure 7), and they found an increase of baseline lever-pressing rate which had no consequence on later stimulus-response learning. The authors argue that these data support that ChAT interneurons play a role in providing context to the modulation of action. However, I think that it is difficult to reach this conclusion with the data presented in this paper, although other studies could be mentioned to support it. It would be important to discuss the results in Matamales et al., 2016, where authors performed a very similar DTR-induced ablation of ChAT neurons in the dorsal striatum of mice, and they too studied its effects on action control. In that study it was also found that there was no change in the establishment of initial instrumental contingencies, but the ChAT-depleted mice were unable to update these contingencies upon reversal. This paper is relevant and supports the role of ChAT neurons in contextual modulation of action.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment on our ChAT ablation behavior and the comparison to the Matamales et al. (2016) ChAT ablation behavior. While our diphtheria-mediated ChAT interneuron ablation mice are able to successfully learn CRF and the Go/NoGo task similar to controls, we noted a persistent elevated baseline press rate after transition from CRF to Go/NoGo training. This inability to properly modulate behavior following a rule change (each press leads to reinforcer versus one press within 10 seconds of âgoâ tone leads to reinforcer) may potentially signal an inability to update behavior given a change in context. We did perform reversal experiment where we switched the âgoâ and âno goâ tones in the presence of CNO activation of a Gi-coupled DREADD to suppress ChAT interneuron activity. However, we did not observe any significant differences following reversal between control and experimental ChAT inhibition groups in learning. It is difficult to completely interpret a negative result, including whether ChAT interneurons were significantly inhibited with CNO or clozapine during the experiment, so we did not include these experiments in the manuscript. Nevertheless, we have now removed all behavioral data from the ChAT- and PV-ablation experiments based on the reviewersâ advice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) On the other hand, the authors found that PV ablation dramatically impaired instrumental behaviours (Figure 7K), and also reported that these mice show virtually no sensitivity to stimuli. However, would the primary impairment in instrumental learning not preclude performance during the go/no go test? Can the conclusion &quot;PV interneurons are important for stimulus-response associations&quot; be formulated if animals show very limited instrumental capacity? This is perhaps worth discussing a bit.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment on the PV ablation data set. We concede that the PV ablation mediated disruption in CRF learning would preclude any subsequent stimulus response learning. However, due to variability in potentially the degree of lesion we had a subpopulation of PV ablation mice that were able to learn CRF, but were unable to learn the go/no go discrimination task. This role of PV interneurons in early associative learning is reinforced by two recent publications (Lee et al., 2017; Owen et al., 2018). However, we have now removed the diphtheria toxin-mediated ablation of PV interneurons experiments per the reviewersâ suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 8F is not referred to in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for noting.
