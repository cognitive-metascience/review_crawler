olive (IO) nucleus plays an important role in generating well-timed spiking activity. Here we combined electrophysiological and computational approaches to assess the functional organization of the IO nucleus in mice. Spontaneous fast and slow subthreshold events were commonly encountered during in vitro recordings. We show that whereas the fast events represent intrinsic regenerative activity, the slow events reflect the electrical connectivity between neurons (‘spikelets’). Recordings from cell pairs revealed the synchronized occurrence of distinct groups of spikelets; their rate and distribution enabled an accurate estimation of the number of connected cells and is suggestive of a clustered organization. This study thus provides a new perspective on the functional and structural organization of the olivary nucleus and a novel experimental and theoretical approach to study electrically coupled networks.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inferior olive</kwd><kwd>electrically coupled networks</kwd><kwd>spikelets</kwd><kwd>computational model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#1496_2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Segev</surname><given-names>Idan</given-names></name><name><surname>Yarom</surname><given-names>Yosef</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000324</institution-id><institution>Gatsby Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Segev</surname><given-names>Idan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Human Brain Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>604102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Segev</surname><given-names>Idan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Edmund and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lefler</surname><given-names>Yaara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006188</institution-id><institution>Einstein Foundation Berlin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yarom</surname><given-names>Yosef</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Non-synaptic electrical events recorded simultaneously from pairs of neurons in the inferior olive nucleus enables accurate estimation of the size and of the clustered organization of the electrically coupled network.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In recent years, research has confirmed that electrically coupled neural networks are found in every major region of the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Condorelli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett and Zukin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connors and Long, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hormuzdi et al., 2004</xref>). One common feature of these networks is their synchronized rhythmic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connors and Long, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett and Zukin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Connors, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coulon and Landisman, 2017</xref>), which has been shown to be correlated with higher brain functions such as states of arousal, awareness, cognition and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ritz and Sejnowski, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buzsáki, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steriade, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Uhlhaas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang, 2010</xref>). Recently, it has been demonstrated that the efficiency of electrical synapses is modulated by electrical and chemical activity, very much like chemical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O'Brien, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coulon and Landisman, 2017</xref>). It thus stands to reason that the functional architecture of these networks must undergo continuous modification to meet the system’s demands. This underscores the urgent need to determine the functional state of a network and associate it with the corresponding brain states. Since anatomical information is insufficient, this can only be done using physiological parameters that capture the functional architecture of a network at any given time.</p><p>The inferior olive network, which was among the first electrically coupled networks to be studied in the mammalian brain, provides primary excitatory input to the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eccles et al., 1966</xref>). There is a general consensus that the function of this network is to generate synchronous activity in olivary neurons, which provide temporal information for either learning processes, motor execution, sensory predictions or expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Llinás and Sasaki, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lou and Bloedel, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Welsh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Van Der Giessen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Llinás, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ohmae and Medina, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heffley et al., 2018</xref>). Temporal information is thought to be generated by the subthreshold sinusoidal-like oscillations of the membrane voltage that appear to emerge from an interplay between the membrane properties and network connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Llinás and Yarom, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lampl and Yarom, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Manor et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loewenstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Devor and Yarom, 2002b</xref>). Recently, this oscillatory activity was shown to be governed by chemical synaptic inputs that partially originate in the deep cerebellar nuclei and modulate the efficacy of the coupling by defining the spatial extent of the electrically coupled network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lefler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mathy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Turecek et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Early work on the morphological organization of the IO indicated that it is organized in clusters of up to eight neurons, whose dendrites are integrated in glomerulus structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sotelo et al., 1974</xref>) and are innervated by both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Zeeuw et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Zeeuw et al., 1989</xref>). This presumed clustered organization has been supported by dye coupling studies showing that each olivary neuron is anatomically coupled to roughly ten other neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devor and Yarom, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leznik and Llinás, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Placantonakis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Turecek et al., 2014</xref>), and by a recent detailed morphological study demonstrating the directionality of IO neuron dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vrieler et al., 2019</xref>). Physiologically however, the organization of the network has only been addressed in a few voltage-sensitive dye imaging studies which found ensembles of synchronously active neurons corresponding to a cluster size estimation of hundreds of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Devor and Yarom, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leznik et al., 2002</xref>). The documented synchronicity of complex spike activity in tens to hundreds of cerebellar Purkinje cells during motor tasks and sensory stimulation is also in favor of such ensemble organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloedel and Ebner, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Welsh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mukamel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ozden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schultz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kostadinov et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we describe a novel method to estimate the size and connectivity of a network by analyzing the all-or-none subthreshold unitary events known as ‘spikelet’. Initially, spikelets were considered as the manifestation of an action potential transmitted via electrical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Llinas et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacVicar and Dudek, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Valiante et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galarreta and Hestrin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mann-Metzer and Yarom, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chorev and Brecht, 2012</xref>). However other studies have also referred to spikelets as reflecting either local dendritic regenerative responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spencer and Kandel, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Golding and Spruston, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smith et al., 2013</xref>); action potentials in the initial segment or at an ectopic site along the axon that fail to invade the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stasheff et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avoli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Juszczak and Swiergiel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sheffield et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dugladze et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Michalikova et al., 2017</xref>); electrical coupling between axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schmitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Traub et al., 2002</xref>); or extracellularly recorded activity of nearby neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vigmond et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scholl et al., 2015</xref>). Here we show that the spontaneous unitary events recorded from olivary neurons can be classified into two groups that differ in their waveform and properties: fast events having identical waveforms with variable high amplitudes, and slow events having different waveforms and low amplitudes. We show that the low-amplitude slow events reflect the occurrence of action potentials in electrically coupled neurons, whereas the high-amplitude fast events are likely to represent internal regenerative responses. We then used slow events recorded simultaneously in pairs of neurons to estimate the size of the network (i.e. the number of neurons that are connected to each neuron) and the network connectivity profile. We found that each olivary neuron is electrically connected to an average of 19 other neurons and that the network is not randomly connected but rather composed of functional clusters of connected neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spontaneous unitary events recorded in neurons of the inferior olive</title><p>The subthreshold spontaneous activity recorded from IO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is composed of unitary unipolar events of varying amplitudes and waveforms. Such events were observed in 74.3% of the neurons (188 out of 253) with an average rate of 0.7 ± 0.6 Hz (calculated in 70 neurons).

The results obtained from a representative neuron are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>. One type (black to gray circles) had a relatively high amplitude (2.4–16.6 mV; average of 7.5 ± 3.1 mV) and fast kinetics (average rise time of 1.3 ± 0.3 ms and average half duration of 3.4 ± 0.3 ms) whereas the second type (green circles) had a relatively low amplitude (0.6–1.9 mV; average of 1.17 ± 0.3 mV) and slow kinetics (average rise time of 2.4 ± 0.4 ms and average half duration of 11.8 ± 5 ms). Plotting the duration as a function of the rise time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), which further supports the two-type scheme, failed to demonstrate a monotonous relationship between the rise-time and half-width that is expected from different dendritic locations of synapses (Rall’s cable theory; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rall, 1967</xref>). Thus, it seems unlikely that the two types represent signals arising from different locations along the cell's morphological structure. The distribution of rise-time and half-width in a population of 63 neurons (of which 49 neurons had the two types of events), which is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref>, confirms that there were indeed two distinct types of events. Whereas the high-amplitude events had a fast rise time (0.8–2.8 ms; average of 1.4 ± 0.4 ms) and short duration (2.5–8.3 ms; average of 4.2 ± 1.3 ms), the low-amplitude events had a longer rise time (1.3–4.3 ms; average of 2.5 ± 0.6 ms) and a longer duration (3.6–21 ms; average of 12.7 ± 3.9 ms). For the high-amplitude events, the broad distribution of amplitudes (ranging from 4.5 to 15.3 mV) and the somewhat limited distribution of rise-times and durations strongly indicates that these groups of fast events were generated by a similar mechanism. Overall, the frequency of slow events was four times higher (0.56 ± 0.62 Hz; n = 69 neurons) than that of the fast events (0.14 ± 0.18 Hz; n = 58 neurons).</p><p>To further distinguish between these two events, we examined the effect of the membrane voltage on the occurrence and waveforms of both types of unitary events. To that end, we used DC current injection, which on average set the membrane potential to a range of −33 to −90 mV. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref> shows the aligned superimposed traces of slow events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and fast events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) from one neuron. Normalizing the event amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>, right panels) shows that whereas the shape of the slow events was unaffected by the current injection (A), the fast events showed a slowdown of the late repolarizing phase with hyperpolarization (B). Quantifying the effect of the injected current (see Materials and methods) on the amplitude and duration at 20% of the amplitude in 16 neurons revealed no effect on the amplitude of either type of events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.0057 and 0.0035, respectively). The duration of the slow events was slightly, but not significantly, affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.44; one-sample t-test p=0.057). In contrast, DC current injection significantly increased the duration of the fast events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.712; one-sample t-test p=0.0005). Comparing the two sets of data revealed a significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; paired t-test p=0.017). Finally, we measured the effect of the DC current injection on the rate of occurrence of the subthreshold unitary events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>).

Both the spontaneous and the evoked events resembled the spontaneously recorded slow events depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. These events had an amplitude of 1.2 ± 0.12 mV, a rise time of 3.7 ± 0.9 ms and a duration of 14.9 ± 4.0 ms, thus well within the range of spontaneously measured slow events. Paired recordings from 30 neurons showed that the amplitudes of the events varied from 0.12 to 1.40 mV (average of 0.61 ± 0.35 mV) whereas the average rise times and half durations were 2.61 ± 1.09 ms and 14.31 ± 6.72 ms, respectively, in line with the measured distribution of spontaneously occurring slow events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, for rise time and duration p=0.58 and p=0.15 respectively, paired t-test).</p><p>In order to identify the source of the spontaneously occurring slow events, we characterized and compared three types of subthreshold events: the spontaneous slow events; the events triggered by action potentials in pair recording and the chemical synaptic potentials triggered by ChR activation in Thy1 mice. The responses to minimal light intensity is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>. The shapes of the evoked synaptic events differed significantly from those of the spontaneous slow events in the same neurons (p&lt;0.002 for all comparisons (rise time, half duration and amplitudes), paired t-test, n = 17 cells), as well as from evoked slow events measured in pair recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, black circles; p&lt;0.002 for all comparisons, paired t-test). This strongly suggests that the small and slow spontaneous events represent action potentials occurring in electrically coupled neurons. To further support this possibility, we measured the effect of excitatory synaptic blockers on the occurrence of the slow events. The chemical synaptic blockers drastically reduced the frequency of the slow events (from 2.27 ± 1.75 Hz to 0.068 ± 0.078 Hz) while amplitude, rise time and duration at half amplitude were not affected (p=0.8, 0.25 and 0.96 respectively; paired KS test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In addition, evoked slow events could readily be seen in pair recordings with DNQX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, n = 10 cells). The decrease in the frequency of the slow events could suggest that a subpopulation of slow events represent chemical synaptic potentials. However, the spontaneous spiking activity of olivary neurons is triggered by the fast events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), that are completely eliminated in the presence of chemical synaptic blockers (see above), causing a drastic reduction in spiking activity and their electrical posts-junctional presentation, the slow events.</p><p>We conclude that the slow events represent the post-junctional responses to action potentials in coupled cells and therefore we refer to them as ‘spikelets’.</p><p>The relatively broad range of spikelet parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) can be attributed to a wide range of coupling strengths, different locations of the gap junctions along the dendritic structure or different durations and shapes of the pre-junctional action potential, which is a well-known feature of olivary action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Llinás and Yarom, 1981a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Llinás and Yarom, 1981b</xref>). We first examined the effect of coupling strength by calculating the ratio of the amplitudes of the pre-junctional action potential to the post-junctional spikelet and compared it to the coupling coefficient measured by direct current injection (see Materials and methods). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, there was a significant positive correlation (with a slope of 0.134; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.614, p&lt;0.0001; Pearson correlation). Next, we examined the effect of the shape of the pre-junctional action potential on the spikelet parameters. To that end, we partially blocked the voltage dependent potassium current by adding TEA (10 mM) to the bath solution. In the presence of TEA, a variety of action potential waveforms were elicited by current injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In particular, the initial upstroke of the action potential was unaffected, but there was a significant broadening of the repolarizing phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, upper panel, blue) that often elicited a second calcium-dependent action potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, upper panel, cyan). This variety of action potential waveforms was always associated with electrical post-junctional responses that could be clustered into two distinct groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lower panel). The prolongation of the action potential was, as expected, followed by a matching increase in the duration of the post-junctional responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lower panel, blue traces). The appearance of the second component was associated with a slow wave of depolarization in the post-junctional cell (cyan traces). This suggests that the wide range of spikelet parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) can be accounted for by the variability in coupling strength and pre-junctional action potential waveforms.</p><p>Finally, we examined the occurrence of spikelets in neurons that exhibited subthreshold oscillatory activity. Since these oscillations occurred simultaneously in several neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lefler et al., 2013</xref>), it was expected that spikelet occurrence will be correlated with the oscillatory activity. About 50% of the olivary neurons showed spontaneous subthreshold oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Careful examination of the peaks of the oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) revealed that they were crowned with spikelets. To quantify this observation, we calculated the distribution of the inter-spikelet-interval (ISLI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, black bars), and found distinct groups appearing at intervals of 200 ms. We then calculated the autocorrelation function of the subthreshold oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, yellow line) and found that it matched the ISLI perfectly. It is important to note that a similar fit was observed in 60% of the oscillating neurons (n = 18) whereas in non-oscillating neurons (n = 70) the ISLI exhibited a Poisson-like distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). The strong correlation between oscillatory behavior and the occurrence of spikelets further supports the conclusion that these events represent activity in adjacent electrically coupled neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Estimating network connectivity from dual cell recordings of simultaneously occurring spikelets</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> depicts the spontaneous activity recorded simultaneously from two neurons. As described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) action potentials (diagonal bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) occurred irregularly in either of the two neurons and were always associated with spikelets in the paired neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The subthreshold activity was dominated by spikelets which appeared randomly in the two neurons. However, occasionally spikelets occurred simultaneously in both cells (marked in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and shown at high resolution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) which we refer to as ‘common spikelets’. Each of the three examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, which occurred without measurable time difference, have variable amplitudes. The first and the third spikelets had larger amplitudes in the red neuron (cell 2) whereas the middle spikelet had a larger amplitude in the black neuron (cell 1). Since action potentials in one neuron evoke very similar spikelets in the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>), the most likely explanation is that each of these common spikelets represents the action potential in an additional neuron that is coupled to both of the recorded neurons (see Discussion). On the population level, 18 out of 30 pairs had common spikelets (60%). Of these pairs, the occurrence of common spikelets varied from 0.02 to 1.1 Hz, which is 3.5–66% of the total number of measurable spikelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Common groups of spikelets during paired recording reveals the estimated number of neurons that are electrically coupled.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simultaneous recording from two electrically coupled neurons.

In this example of a paired recording, four different groups were identified (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), which indicates that at least four neurons were electrically coupled to both recorded neurons. Further analysis of these data provided an estimate of the total number of neurons connected to each of the two recorded neurons. In this example, a total of 16 common spikelets, organized in four groups, were recorded. The four groups thus represent four neurons that are coupled to the two recorded neurons. Each of these neurons fired on average four times during the recording period. Therefore, we can assume that each neuron in the network also fired on average four times during the recording period. In addition to the common spikelets, nine non-common spikelets were recorded in the black cell and 32 in the red one. These non-common spikelets thus represent spikes in ~2 additional neurons (9/4) connected to the black neuron and eight neurons (32/4) connected to the red neuron. The result of this numerical consideration is that the black neuron is connected to the red neuron, to four additional neurons that are connected to both recorded neurons and to estimated two additional neurons, totaling seven neurons. Similarly, the red neuron is estimated to be connected to 13 neurons. This analysis was performed on 18 dual recordings and the results, which are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, indicate that a neuron can connect to as many as 40 other neurons (average of 19.2 ± 10.3). It should be noted that the use of a slice preparation undoubtedly contributed to the wide range of connected neurons and to some degree of underestimation (see Discussion).</p><p>We re-examined the approach to estimate the number of connections per neuron by reconstructing a realistic olivary network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, see Materials and methods). The firing rate of neurons in the network was set to 0.058 Hz ±0.04 Hz (as observed experimentally) and the number of common spikelets in pairs of neurons occurring within 15 min of simulation was measured. Recordings from a sample pair are shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>. In this example, four groups of spikelets that appear 26, 16, 65 and 32 times were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). By applying the same calculation as performed in the experimental observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we concluded that the red neuron was electrically connected to 24 neurons whereas the black neuron was connected to 26 neurons. In this model, the red and black neurons were actually connected to 17 and 20 neurons, respectively (pink circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We performed the same calculation in 20 randomly selected pairs of neurons and plotted the estimated versus the real number of connections per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The results were distributed along the diagonal (with the average marked by + sign), demonstrating the validity of this approach in estimating the number of connections for each neuron. However, the accuracy of the estimation depends strongly on variability in firing rate and the recording duration. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> the difference between the estimated and real number of connections per neuron decreases as a function of simulation duration. Moreover, at high variability in firing rate (black curve), longer recording duration does not improve the error compared to low variability firing rate (light gray curve). However, the estimation of the mean number of connected cells (+ sign in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) is less sensitive to simulation duration or to variability in firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, see discussion).

The implementation of a variety of experimental approaches linked to computational simulation led to several important conclusions regarding the organization of the network of electrically coupled neurons in the inferior olive nucleus. We showed that there are two populations of unitary events that differ in their waveform and amplitude. The spikelets represent the occurrence of action potentials in a coupled neuron, while the fast events are likely to represent intrinsic regenerative responses at remote locations. It should be noted that in the scientific literature the word ‘spikelet’ refers to all non-synaptic subthreshold unitary events and thus creates a certain lack of consistency regarding their origin (see Introduction; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Michalikova et al., 2019</xref>). The uniqueness of our experimental system lies in its ability to differentiate between two types of non-synaptic unitary events and thus to characterize them. We then used the spikelets recorded simultaneously from two neurons to gain insights into the size and organization of the electrically coupled network within the IO nucleus. Analysis of the experimental results showed that each olivary neuron is connected to ~20 other neurons and theoretical considerations indicated that the neurons are not connected in a simple distance-dependent manner, rather that the network is organized into clusters of neurons, where the probability of connection within a cluster is higher than the probability of connection between clusters.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The electrically coupled network in the olivary nucleus</title><p>It is well-established that the olivary nucleus forms an electrically coupled network. It has been suggested that this network operates as a synchronous rhythmic device, capable of generating precise temporal patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jacobson et al., 2008</xref>). Both synchronicity and rhythmicity are generated by the delicate interplay between electrical coupling and ionic conductances. Thus, a single cell by itself cannot oscillate, whereas in a network formation the neurons generate subthreshold oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Manor et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loewenstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chorev et al., 2007</xref>). In this work, we studied the relationship between spikelets and subthreshold oscillatory activity and found that in oscillating cells the occurrence of spikelets coincided with the depolarizing phase of the oscillation whereas in non-oscillating cells they seemed to be randomly distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). This result strongly supports our previous hypothesis that the occurrence of subthreshold oscillations is a network phenomenon. Therefore, when the recorded cell is oscillating, the entire network is synchronously oscillating, thus generating action potentials at the peak of the oscillation that appear in the recorded cell as spikelets. Theoretically, by calculating the number of spikelets at the peak of the oscillatory activity, one should be able to calculate the number of coupled neurons in the oscillating network. Although tempting, this is practically impossible because spikelets, given their small amplitude and noisy environment, cannot be classified into groups. Therefore, we used the common spikelets to estimate the number of coupled neurons.</p><p>Recording from two olivary neurons revealed spikelets that occurred simultaneously in both recorded neurons. Given that the average rate of spikelets is 0.56 ± 0.62 Hz, the probability that these common spikelets reflect random occurrence is extremely low. Furthermore, the repeated appearance of common spikelets with the same relationships (amplitude ratio and waveforms) further supports the non-random occurrence of these events. Thus, the accurate timing of common spikelets can only be attributed to a common source; that is a single pre-junctional neuron. The number of neurons that were coupled to the two recorded neurons, which varied from 1 to 7, should be correlated with the size of the network; more common spikelets are expected in larger interconnected networks.</p><p>Our simple method of calculating the size of a coupled network is based on data obtained during simultaneous recordings from two neurons and on the assumption that the neurons display a similar rate of spontaneous spiking activity. Our simulations show that the accuracy of this method is mainly affected by variability in the firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). To minimize the error in estimating the firing rate of the neurons in the network, we used only the spontaneous rate of the common spikelets, and not the firing rates in the recorded neurons which are affected by the intracellular recordings. Under this assumption, we showed that neurons are connected to 3–40 other neurons. This is in line with other studies reporting 1–38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoge et al., 2011</xref>) or 0–33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Placantonakis et al., 2006</xref>) dye-coupled neurons. This broad variability can be attributed to the use of an in- vitro system, where differences in the number of cells and the integrity of the circuit are characteristic features. Alternatively, this large variability might reflect an innate feature of the IO nucleus where electrical coupling is under continuous modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lefler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mathy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Turecek et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition to calculating the number of connected cells, the distribution of common spikelets enabled us to study the connectivity profile within the nucleus. Our data showed that each two neurons had 1–7 common groups. However, there were a large number of paired recordings that failed to show common groups. Using a theoretical approach, we demonstrated that this distribution should not be expected if we assume that the probability of connection depends solely on the distance between the neurons. On the other hand, if the nucleus is organized into clusters where the probability of connection within the cluster is higher than between clusters, the observed distribution of common groups can be reproduced. Although the size of the clusters, as well as the probability of connection cannot be defined with the current data, this constitutes the first physiological study that supports the assumption of clustered organization of the nucleus deduced mainly from morphological studies.</p><p>This approach to analyze electrically coupled networks should not be restricted to the inferior olive network. Most of the studies on electrical coupling in central neurons used paired recordings, an essential procedure to demonstrate electrical coupling. In many of these recordings spontaneous spikelets are readily observed. In the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Curti et al. (2012)</xref> on the Mesencephalic Trigeminal Nucleus, the occurrence of a spikelet in only one of the neurons is taken as indication for additionally connected cell. Similarly, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Long et al. (2004)</xref> on the Thalamic Reticular nucleus demonstrates spontaneously occurring spikelets of different sizes in both recorded neurons. Thus, to implement our approach all one needs is paired recordings of spontaneous activity of cells in electrically coupled network.</p><p>In summary, we presented a comprehensive study that implemented a wide range of research approaches to unravel the functional architecture of the inferior olivary network. We showed that new insights into the organization of the network can be gained by analyzing spontaneous subthreshold events, thus paving the way for a novel experimental and theoretical approach to the study of electrically coupled networks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experimental procedures were approved by the Hebrew University’s Animal Care and Use Committee.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper provides novel insights on the properties and organization of neural networks in the inferior olive, and electrically coupled networks in the vertebrate CNS in general. In contrast to chemical synapses, networks formed by electrical coupling are more difficult to analyze because of their characteristic bidirectionality of transmission. Inferior olivary neurons are connected only by electrical coupling, thus providing an ideal structure to explore networks primarily organized by electrical coupling. The analysis presented makes the convincing argument that, rather than forming a single 'matrix' of electrically coupled cells, there exist clusters of functionally interconnected (electrically coupled) neurons. The authors arrive to this conclusion by disambiguating the nature of subthreshold responses and analyzing those representing coupling of action potentials, a step that allows them to estimate of the number of coupled cells with fair accuracy. These estimates were supported by computer simulations which provided novel insights into the organization of the network. The experiments are elegantly designed, and the paper is well illustrated. One of the important features of the work is that it presents a physiological framework for analyzing the functional architecture of other electrically coupled networks.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Using subthreshold events to characterize the functional architecture of electrically coupled networks&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alberto Pereda (Reviewer #1); Chris I De Zeeuw (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have studied subthreshold membrane fluctuations of inferior olivary (IO) neurons in vitro. They observed two distinct types of events: fast, relatively large &quot;Internal Regenerative Events (IREs)&quot; that they identify as intrinsically generated regenerative events, and slower, smaller &quot;spikelets&quot; that they identify as electrical synapse-mediated events. Using various electrophysiological and computational lines of evidence they conclude that the IREs are likely initiated at axonal spines near the somata of IO cells (a significant novel finding), while spikelets are electrical synapse (gap junction)-mediated events generated by presynaptic action potentials. The authors also use spikelet data to estimate the size and pattern of electrically coupled neuronal clusters.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The experiments and modeling are well done, the analyses are interesting, and the conclusions of the study are potentially very important. There are several concerns about the main findings – the origins of the IRE and the network (neuronal cluster) analyses that must be addressed in revision. The detailed comments of the reviewers amplify these major required revisions described below; the focus in revision should be on these major points and not on minor differences in the reviewer comments.</p><p>1) All reviewers agree the synaptic pharmacology needs to be better both for the IRE and spikelet stories. The authors state they tested 19 cells in CNQX/APV, so perhaps all that's left is to do more detailed analysis and document it in the paper.</p><p>2) Are axonal spines really as common and beautiful in mouse cells as De Zeeuw showed them to be in the cat? The authors have already dye-filled mouse IO cells, but didn't show them in the paper. These spines should be documented in the paper (LM level) and perhaps these data are already available.</p><p>3) Can the authors provide more direct evidence that the IREs are coming from spines? Modeling is not enough, especially when we don't even know if axonal spines exist. Most people believe spikes initiate at axon initial segments because of high Na channel density there, and there are nice markers for initial segment-specific protein complexes (e.g. immuno for ankyrin-G, or Na channels themselves). Such a demonstration in axonal spines (LM level) by itself would be enough. Better electrophysiology (glutamate uncaging, axonal recording) would also be great, but probably too time-consuming for revision.</p><p>4) Regarding the functional significance of the IREs, the authors never mention whether those big subthreshold IREs trigger electrotonically propagated events (small spikelets?) in coupled cells. These are data the authors should already have from their paired recordings. In general, it's not at all clear how IREs, spikelets, spontaneous oscillations, and full spikes interact in coupled networks of IO neurons; the authors should present a more holistic view of how all these membrane events interact.</p><p>5) The other major and potentially interesting but problematic part of the paper is about spikelets, coupling, and clustering. The authors might be able to strengthen this without doing more experiments, if they can address some of the technical issues raised in the reviews (about clarity of description, noise and detection thresholds, alternative connection schemes in the model, statistical reliability of modeling curve fits, etc).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>There are several concerns:</p><p>– The paper has two sections, the analysis of the subthreshold responses and the use of spikelets to analyze network connectivity. While the first section reads very well I had problems with the transition to network analysis. I found the two sentences at the start of paragraph two of subsection “Estimating network architecture from dual cell recordings of simultaneously occurring spikelets” very confusing. I had to read them several times. There is little information on how common spikelet amplitude and ratio is used to generate the groups. Although I understand the notion, the details still unclear to me. The criteria and usefulness of these values for grouping spikelets should be explicit and not let the reader guessing.</p><p>– Coupling between inferior olivary neurons is heterogenous and one cell can be differentially coupled to its various neighbors. I am not sure how this would impact the analysis performed by the authors, in particular the ratio between common spikelets. Was coupling heterogeneity incorporated into computer simulations? The authors should address this issue.</p><p>– I suggest making the title specific to the inferior olive, perhaps ‘Using subthreshold events to characterize the functional architecture of <italic>the inferior olive’</italic>. While the number of coupled cells was not a surprise and consistent with previous reports using different methodology, the analysis performed by the authors provides further insights on the organization of the networks (favors the existence of compartments of functionally connected neurons) and this should be reflected in the title. In addition, although theoretically possible, it is unclear if the method could be used to analyze other, less known, networks. Are the authors suggesting the method could be applied other networks? If so, they should specifically discuss this point in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I have several suggestions to improve the manuscript:</p><p>– The spike-rates of the IO cells were approximated, and thus a possible source of bias. Though the authors do say they estimated the firing rates based on spontaneous slow event-rates, and not on the spiking rate of the recorded cells as these are affected by the intracellular solution, I wonder to what extent the estimates of the variability and frequency of the cells' firing rates result from the cell-attached recordings.</p><p>– With regard to the source of the fast spontaneous events, or &quot;Internally Regenerative Events (IREs)&quot;, the authors find that these IREs do not depend on gap-junctions, but originate from spines in the axon hillock of the cell. I find this hypothesis quite plausible and attractive, but I wonder whether some additional electrophysiological experiments can be provided, either with glutamate uncaging or maybe glutamate or AMPA application with a secondary &quot;puffing&quot; pipette. This might confirm the effects of these &quot;overruling&quot; axonal spines on the IO neurons. More specifically, it would be nice to see an experiment with direct and/or solitary stimulation of the axonal spines.</p><p>– The authors suggest that the amplitudes of the IREs are predominantly determined by the neck length. However, I wonder why the observed amplitudes are not normally distributed but distributed in a sinusoid shape (see Figure 1B). I would assume that the spine neck lengths would be distributed normally. If the assumption is that the higher amplitudes are the result of summation, then I wonder why the sinusoid is so clean (because variable neck length would reduce the precision of the sinusoid shape, as the individual events that make up the summated event would be more variable as well). Additionally, as is mentioned in the text, De Zeeuw et al., 1990 showed that up to 8 spines emerge from the axon initial segment. Would the authors not expect a larger spread of amplitudes if that were the case?</p><p>– Given that the slow spikelets predominantly occur on top of the STOs, given that action potentials in one cell often lead to spikelets in electronically coupled cells, and given that IREs often induce action potentials, wouldn't the authors expect more spikelets outside of the normal STO-spikelet-window? Or do the authors assume that the afferents to the axonal spines are somehow also influenced by the STOs? Or do the effects of the IREs depend on the phase of the subthreshold oscillations?

Our current understanding of the cell mechanisms generating the oscillations suggests that STO's may be generated in a few high amplitude cells, with other cells either reporting that oscillation, or indeed, engaging in them. Possibly in a network in which cells are connected by gap junctions a combination of these two phenomena exists. In fact Leznik and Llinas, 2004, showed that STO's are maintained within single cells following gap junction blocking, though the network synchrony is disrupted. So in my view, it is a combination in which the level of coupling will contribute to the level of STO's, while the coupling is not absolutely essential.</p><p>– The manuscript gives the impression that cells are either oscillating or not, while the literature has reported intermediate cells 'conditional oscillators'. This is an important point, since dynamical system's analysis shows that a non-oscillating cell can promptly be led to oscillate upon perturbations (Schweighofer et al., 1999).</p><p>– While it is likely that oscillations are potentiated by coupling, 'network oscillations' of a couple of mV's could simply be a read-out of high amplitude oscillators.

If small spike-like events actually originate from spine-like structures on the axon initial segment, it would be a novel and unique observation as far as I know. If electrical synapse-generated spikelets can be used to reliably estimate the size and patterns of gap junction-coupled neuron clusters, that would be an important contribution to IO neurobiology and perhaps more widely. As presented here, however, I don't think either conclusion is strongly supported by the evidence.</p><p>1) This study rests entirely on the properties of small, subthreshold events, so clear reporting of their characteristics is critical. A first-order question is whether any of these events represent chemical synaptic input. Are they EPSPs? Are they triggered by EPSPs? The answers here are vague. The authors report that the application of CNQX reduced the rate of &quot;unitary unipolar events&quot; from an average of 0.7 Hz to &quot;below 0.02 Hz&quot; (Results paragraph one), but no details are provided. This control rate was apparently taken from a large group of cells, not from the 19 cells to which the drug was applied. The authors should report the data properly, with measurements from the same neurons before and after CNQX. They should also report the characteristics of the subthreshold events remaining after CNQX, including amplitudes and kinetics, and compare them to events from the same cells in the absence of the drug. Later on, the authors say that fast events are &quot;independent of chemical transmission&quot;, but they do not show any evidence for this. All of this bears on a key question: what, if anything, do EPSPs contribute to the subthreshold events and their properties?</p><p>2) Were all of the data in Figure 1 recorded in the absence of CNQX? If the answer is yes, and CNQX reduced the frequency of those subthreshold events by 97% (see previous comment), then shouldn't we expect a large fraction of the subthreshold events to be spontaneous EPSPs rather than spikelets?</p><p>3) The recording and analyses of subthreshold events are limited by detection thresholds and signal-to-noise ratios. Some of the events (spikelets and perhaps IREs) are presumably too small to see. This has implications for the inferences one can draw from the recordings, including the estimates of coupled-neuron cluster size. Noise levels are not reported here. The authors' modeling could provide estimates of the limits of their detection given signal-to-noise limitations, and perhaps support the reliability of their cluster estimates. The authors should discuss this issue.</p><p>4) As the authors say (twice), the origins of the IREs &quot;are a mystery&quot;. The evidence that the small spikelets are the postsynaptic result of a presynaptic action potential passing through electrical synapses is highly compelling. The smoking gun comes from paired-cell recordings that were demonstrated by various labs years ago. However, the evidence that the larger, faster &quot;IREs&quot; originate in axonal spines adjacent to the soma is weak, inferential, and indirect.</p><p>The modeling results about IREs are suggestive, but I agree with the authors that &quot;The locations and mechanism of generation of the IREs are not completely resolved&quot;. In fact, without some additional experimental evidence, I do not believe this part of the story is compelling. It certainly does not live up to the overstatement in the Abstract: &quot;fast events represent a regenerative response in unique excitable spine-like structures in the axon hillock&quot;. First, it is not even clear whether axonal spines exist in mouse IO cells. If so, they should be illustrated. The authors refer to original data on axonal spines from De Zeeuw, but that work was done on cat neurons. Second, some more direct evidence for the location of IRE generation would help to make the conclusion convincing, e.g. direct recordings from axon initial segments or spines using electrodes or photoindicators, or molecular/structural demonstrations of high-density sodium channels at axonal spines.</p><p>5) The analysis of groups of &quot;common spikelets&quot; in paired recordings (Figure 7) as a way to infer the size of electrically coupled clusters of cells is interesting and clever. I wonder, however, about the limitations of the data and what they mean for the cluster size estimates. One example pair is illustrated, from which four groups of common spikelets were claimed (Figure 7E). The spikelet amplitudes are small and variable, of course, and the samples of common (and noncommon) spikelets in each cell were also small (as few as two in the example pair). The Materials and methods are vague about the statistical reliability of this form of cluster counting. For example, the two spikelet clusters on the right of Figure 7E don't look very different to me, especially since the samples are so small and the spikelet sizes/shapes are so variable. The spikelet size distributions in Figure 1 also imply large and continuous variance (rather than the peaky distributions shown for the IREs). Loose criteria for spikelet clustering would lead to overestimates of the size of electrically coupled clusters. The illustrated cell pair (Figure 7E) has some of the smallest numbers of estimated connections (Figure 7F). It seems the problem of defining distinct common spikelet clusters (and estimates of connections) must also increase as the number of clusters increases in a cell. This issue requires more rigorous justification and discussion.</p><p>The modeling results in Figure 8 test the analysis in Figure 7, to some extent, by varying the sampling period and the firing frequencies. However the modeled data look much less variable (in amplitude) than the real data (cf. Figure 8B with 7B and E, for example). I also infer from the descriptions that the model network did not include noise.</p><p>6) The modeling in Figure 8 does not provide convincing support for the authors' hypothesized clustering of gap junction connectivity, as compared to a simple distance-dependent model of connectivity. This seems to boil down to another eyeball comparison of estimates from the spikelet analyses of Figure 7 to the results of a model (Figure 8). Specifically, the authors conclude that the distance model &quot;failed to reproduce the distribution of common groups as found experimentally (Figure 8F)&quot;, whereas the clustering model &quot;replicated the distance-dependent connection probability (Figure 8H)&quot;. To my eye the fits in Figure 8F and H seem about equally good (or bad). Interestingly, the authors conclude that the fits to data measurements in Figure 8E and H are about equally good, but to my eye the fit in Figure 8H looks about as good (or bad) as that in Figure 8F and H. In other words, the modeling results seem to be very weak evidence for deciding between these cluster vs. distance-dependence scenarios.</p><p>In this regard, it would seem that experimental studies of tracer-coupling among IO cells (as in Devor and Yarom, 2004; Placantonakis et al., 2006; Hoge et al., 2011) in the same slices as those analyzed with the common spikelet method would be a more reliable way to determine whether electrical coupling is random/distance-dependent or is determined by clustering.</p><p>7) The authors discuss the occurrence of &quot;common spikelets&quot;, but don't say much about IREs and electrical coupling. What happens in an electrically coupled cell when an IRE occurs in the paired cell? Are these events even detectable? The Discussion simply says, &quot;an IRE in one neuron never coincided with a spikelet in the other neuron&quot;, but I don't believe the paper tells us what does coincide with an IRE.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Using subthreshold events to characterize the functional architecture of the electrically coupled inferior olive network&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>.

I still think there are major shortcomings, however. The argument that IREs likely originate in axonal spines is unconvincing, in my opinion. The analysis and modeling of spikelets is a stronger story, but the modeling does not address the effects of noise in the cells. Also, the pharmacological results are still confusingly described. Specifically:</p><p>1) IRE origins and axonal spines. The authors' have slightly tempered their provocative conclusion that IREs are generated in axonal spines, although the Abstract still says: &quot;We suggest that the fast events represent a regenerative response in unique excitable spine-like structures in the axon hillock.&quot; In my opinion the data supporting this suggestion are still exceedingly weak, for these reasons:</p><p>A) The authors' evidence for even the existence of axonal spines in mouse neurons is unconvincing. Only a single image of one mouse IO neuron was provided in the authors' response to reviews (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The image resolution is low, and each putative axonal spine seems to be represented by a small number of pixels. The blow-up image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref> includes a dotted outline (hand-drawn?) that is an overly optimistic interpretation of the pixels, and the graphic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C</xref> is simply a cartoon version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>. I can appreciate that imaging these small structures is technically difficult, but without knowing if spines are common, how large they are, where they are placed, and how well they correlate with the IREs, the conclusion that IREs are generated by axonal spines is simply not convincing.</p><p>B) The authors did not provide any more morphological, molecular, or electrophysiological evidence that helps to connect the origin of IREs to axonal spines (as they replied: &quot;…we are working on this issue but currently we cannot provide this information. We hope that the demonstration of their existence is sufficient for the current report.&quot;) But their manuscript goes far beyond simply demonstrating the existence or IREs. Speculations about exotic mechanisms should wait for supporting evidence.</p><p>C) The authors simulated several possible mechanisms of IRE generation. They first showed that IRE-like events can be generated by modeling &quot;hot spots&quot; of excitability in the dendrites, or alternatively by simulating spike failures at increasingly distal axonal nodes. Then they dismissed these possibilities by saying &quot;it is difficult to envisage a biological mechanism that either specifically localizes channels in a restricted dendritic 'hot spot' or that simultaneously blocks two, three or more Nodes of Ranvier&quot; (fourth paragraph, subsection “Modelling the Intrinsic Regenerative Events (IREs)”). Perhaps so, although two papers the authors cite show evidence for relatively high densities of sodium channels in dendritic spines (Araya et al., 2007; Bywalez et al., 2015). I find it just as difficult to envisage hot spots of ion channels in biologically unique axonal spines that have not been clearly demonstrated either in the olivary cells under study or, indeed, in any other class of vertebrate neuron.</p><p>D) The modeling of spike generation in putative axonal spines (Figure 5) explored a very limited and biologically unjustified parameter space. The authors included high densities of sodium and potassium channels (identical to those in the axon initial segment) in both the spine heads and in the axon hillock, while the excitability of the axonal nodes of Ranvier was actually eliminated (the excitable hillock and the inexcitable axon are mentioned only in the Materials and methods, and not in the main text or legend). The consensus in the field is that channel densities in the axon hillocks of vertebrate neurons are quite low, especially compared to the initial segment. Perhaps mouse olivary cells are not like other neurons, but in the absence of evidence we just don't know. What was the rationale for making the rest of the axon entirely inexcitable while modeling excitable spines? Only a few results of this modeling are illustrated in the manuscript; how robust are these results? What are the consequences of varying channel densities and types, distributions, spatial patterns, spine morphology and number, etc.?</p><p>2) Network modeling and the absence of noise. The most novel and interesting conclusion from the network modeling is that the IO cells may be organized into electrically coupled clusters of cells (the connection probability predictions largely agree with the widely variable range suggested by previous studies). The clustering conclusion rests entirely on fits of the &quot;common spikelet&quot; distributions in recorded cell pairs to predictions of the network model. The authors note that the accuracy of the modeled connection distributions depend strongly on the cells' firing frequencies and the length of the recording samples. Should it not also depend on noise? An important feature of the biological preparation that is absent from the model is any source of noise or variability (apart from the Poisson timing of the somatic currents triggering spikes), especially in the subthreshold membrane voltages. The authors' recordings implied that blocking fast glutamate receptors reduced spontaneous spiking rates dramatically, so one can infer that there is normally a considerable of chemical synaptic noise in addition to other potential sources. How does the absence of noise in the model affect the network predictions and the fits to spikelet data, and in particular the prediction that cells are clustered?</p><p>3) Pharmacology. The pharmacology (synaptic blocker) data are still confusingly described and not very helpful. From the Results, subsection “Spontaneous unitary events recorded in neurons of the inferior olive”: &quot;However, application of synaptic blockers (see Materials and methods) completely eliminated the presence of the fast events (n=19 neurons; in 4 of these neurons where CNQX was added during recording the frequency changed from 0.017 ± 0.005 Hz to 0 Hz) whereas the frequency of spontaneous slow events decreased significantly (from 0.92 ± 0.73 Hz 163 to 0.26 ± 0.16 Hz, p=0.019, paired t-test, n=9 neurons).&quot; My questions:</p><p>A) What were the blockers? This Results sentence says just CNQX, the legend to Figure 2—figure supplement 1 says APV plus either CNQX or DNQX, and the Materials and methods simply list all the drugs.</p><p>B) The sample sizes tested are still ambiguous. The phrase about fast events says n=19, but then talks about n=4 &quot;where CNQX was added&quot;. Was the drug not added to the other 15 cells? The phrase about slow events then cites n=9. Were the same cells tested before and after addition of blockers? Are the 4 and 9 cells subsets of the 19, or different samples? Please clarify.</p><p>C) The authors say they did a &quot;thorough analysis&quot; of the effects of blockers on slow event waveforms, but they actually report data from only two example cells in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. These data showed rise-times and half-durations, but not amplitudes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43560.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The experiments and modeling are well done, the analyses are interesting, and the conclusions of the study are potentially very important. There are several concerns about the main findings – the origins of the IRE and the network (neuronal cluster) analyses that must be addressed in revision. The detailed comments of the reviewers amplify these major required revisions described below; the focus in revision should be on these major points and not on minor differences in the reviewer comments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your encouraging response. The reviewers did a thorough job that end with important comments that undoubtedly will lead to a significant improvement of the presentation and conclusion of this study. In the revised manuscript, we re-organized the description of the data, substantially increased the description of the statistical methods used for the pharmacological treatments and modeling approach and did our best to respond to all reviewers’ comments. However, this study is an attempt to investigate the structure of electrically coupled networks by analyzing subthreshold events that represent electrical coupling. Thus, a major issue is to identify these events. In our recordings from the inferior olive neurons we encountered electrically coupled spikelets, as well as other subthreshold events, the IREs, that had to be identified before excluding them from the analysis. We suggest that they represent regenerative responses in spines that are located at the axon initial segment. We do agree that this is “a significant novel finding” that require a thorough study. In fact, we started a new line of research where anatomical, physiological and imaging technique will be used to examine our suggestion on the origin of these events. Thus, currently we can provide only anecdotal observations of spines on the axon in the mouse. A through study of spike distribution in many neurons, as well as correlation between the number of spines and the number of IREs in a given neuron and the specific activation of these spines, all are absolutely needed, and cannot be provided at this stage. Nevertheless, we did our best to reply to the reviewers’ comments and we hope that it will meet your approval.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) All reviewers agree the synaptic pharmacology needs to be better both for the IRE and spikelet stories. The authors state they tested 19 cells in CNQX/APV, so perhaps all that's left is to do more detailed analysis and document it in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we provided a better and more comprehensive descriptionof the pharmacological experiments. We first compared the rate of occurrence of the spontaneous events demonstrating that although the rate of spikelets are drastically reduced (n= 9 cells), the IREs are completely absent (n=4 cells). As suggested, we added a thorough description of the synaptic blockers effect on spikelets’ shape, and on appearance of evoked spikelets (Figure 2—figure supplement 1; Figure 6—figure supplement 1) to show that the reduction in frequency is due to a reduction in excitability of the network, and not because some of the spikelets we record are of synaptic origin.</p><p>The IREs, which are intrinsic events, are not encountered in the presence of synaptic blockers, but are also not of synaptic origin, as presented in Figure 2 (Figure 3 in the original manuscript). Since most of the action potentials in IO neurons are triggered by IREs, in the presence of synaptic blockers, the frequency of action potentials is highly reduced, and thus the frequency of spikelets. However, the spikelets can still be evoked with synaptic blockers, when action potentials are evoked in a coupled cell (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We changed the order of appearance of Figures 2 and 3 of the original manuscript in order to explain and discuss these findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Are axonal spines really as common and beautiful in mouse cells as De Zeeuw showed them to be in the cat?

At this stage, we cannot provide a more detailed description of the axonal spines, as identifying the axon in IO cells is not a simple task, due to extensive bifurcations of the dendrites and the tendency of axons to emerge from a dendrite.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43560-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Can the authors provide more direct evidence that the IREs are coming from spines? Modeling is not enough, especially when we don't even know if axonal spines exist. Most people believe spikes initiate at axon initial segments because of high Na channel density there, and there are nice markers for initial segment-specific protein complexes (e.g. immuno for ankyrin-G, or Na channels themselves). Such a demonstration in axonal spines (LM level) by itself would be enough. Better electrophysiology (glutamate uncaging, axonal recording) would also be great, but probably too time-consuming for revision.</p></disp-quote><p>As we stated above, we are working on this issue but currently we cannot provide this information. We hope that the demonstration of their existence is sufficient for the current report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Regarding the functional significance of the IREs, the authors never mention whether those big subthreshold IREs trigger electrotonically propagated events (small spikelets?) in coupled cells. These are data the authors should already have from their paired recordings. In general, it's not at all clear how IREs, spikelets, spontaneous oscillations, and full spikes interact in coupled networks of IO neurons; the authors should present a more holistic view of how all these membrane events interact.</p></disp-quote><p>In the manuscript, we specifically reported that in pair recording we <italic>never</italic>encountered a correlated signal with the IRE.

While the first section reads very well I had problems with the transition to network analysis. I found the two sentences at the start of paragraph two of subsection “Estimating network architecture from dual cell recordings of simultaneously occurring spikelets” very confusing. I had to read them several times. There is little information on how common spikelet amplitude and ratio is used to generate the groups. Although I understand the notion, the details still unclear to me. The criteria and usefulness of these values for grouping spikelets should be explicit and not let the reader guessing.</p></disp-quote><p>We rephrased these sentences in the Results section and in the Materials and methods sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Coupling between inferior olivary neurons is heterogenous and one cell can be differentially coupled to its various neighbors.

In the model, the number of neurons connected were heterogeneous (Figure 8C). The conductance of each gap-junction was identical, but the position on the dendritic tree and the cells’ morphology and membrane properties were different, thus creating heterogeneity in spikelets, as shown in Figure 8B and in figure in response to reviewer #3 comment 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I suggest making the title specific to the inferior olive, perhaps ‘Using subthreshold events to characterize the functional architecture of the inferior olive’. While the number of coupled cells was not a surprise and consistent with previous reports using different methodology, the analysis performed by the authors provides further insights on the organization of the networks (favors the existence of compartments of functionally connected neurons) and this should be reflected in the title. In addition, although theoretically possible, it is unclear if the method could be used to analyze other, less known, networks. Are the authors suggesting the method could be applied other networks? If so, they should specifically discuss this point in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the title suggestion.

Though the authors do say they estimated the firing rates based on spontaneous slow event-rates, and not on the spiking rate of the recorded cells as these are affected by the intracellular solution, I wonder to what extent the estimates of the variability and frequency of the cells' firing rates result from the cell-attached recordings.</p></disp-quote><p>The comment is not clear to us.

I find this hypothesis quite plausible and attractive, but I wonder whether some additional electrophysiological experiments can be provided, either with glutamate uncaging or maybe glutamate or AMPA application with a secondary &quot;puffing&quot; pipette. This might confirm the effects of these &quot;overruling&quot; axonal spines on the IO neurons. More specifically, it would be nice to see an experiment with direct and/or solitary stimulation of the axonal spines.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see reply to editor point number 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors suggest that the amplitudes of the IREs are predominantly determined by the neck length. However, I wonder why the observed amplitudes are not normally distributed but distributed in a sinusoid shape (see Figure 1B). I would assume that the spine neck lengths would be distributed normally. If the assumption is that the higher amplitudes are the result of summation, then I wonder why the sinusoid is so clean (because variable neck length would reduce the precision of the sinusoid shape, as the individual events that make up the summated event would be more variable as well). Additionally, as is mentioned in the text, De Zeeuw et al., 1990 showed that up to 8 spines emerge from the axon initial segment.

Or do the authors assume that the afferents to the axonal spines are somehow also influenced by the STOs? Or do the effects of the IREs depend on the phase of the subthreshold oscillations? If that were the case, would the functionality of an emergent action-potential inducer that foregoes dendritic input not be somewhat hampered?</p></disp-quote><p>As demonstrated in Figure 2H (former Figure 3H), as opposed to spikelets, the frequency of IREs depend on membrane potential, thus an IRE is less likely to be evoked at the trough of the STO.

Thus, although it seems that “the afferents to the axonal spines are somehow also influenced by the STOs”, it is likely to be the results of the voltage sensitivity of these events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There is a dependency between the underlying oscillations and the number of slow spikelets.

Our current understanding of the cell mechanisms generating the oscillations suggests that STO's may be generated in a few high amplitude cells, with other cells either reporting that oscillation, or indeed, engaging in them. Possibly in a network in which cells are connected by gap junctions a combination of these two phenomena exists. In fact Leznik and Llinas, 2004, showed that STO's are maintained within single cells following gap junction blocking, though the network synchrony is disrupted. So, in my view, it is a combination in which the level of coupling will contribute to the level of STO's, while the coupling is not absolutely essential.</p><p>– The manuscript gives the impression that cells are either oscillating or not, while the literature has reported intermediate cells 'conditional oscillators'. This is an important point, since dynamical system's analysis shows that a non-oscillating cell can promptly be led to oscillate upon perturbations (Schweighofer et al., 1999).</p><p>– While it is likely that oscillations are potentiated by coupling, 'network oscillations' of a couple of mV's could simply be a read-out of high amplitude oscillators. Please discuss this point more extensively.</p></disp-quote><p>We are puzzled by these comments. Indeed, the mechanism of generation of STO in the olivary nucleus is debated, but it is not the issue of this study. In the analysis demonstrated in Figure 6 (former Figure 2), where only stable oscillating cells were used, we used the spikelets occurrence as an indication that in this electrically coupled network all the coupled neurons oscillate at a similar frequency, which is in agreement with the different views on the source of IO oscillations, and is not discussed further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would have been nice to see simulation runs with two alternate connectivity scenarios. One with fewer connections, the other with more – the latter reflecting the possible scenario in the intact preparation.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure if we completely understand the comment. In the response to comment 6 of reviewer #3 we present more connectivity scenarios.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The experiments and modeling were well done, the analyses are interesting, and the conclusions of the study are potentially important. If small spike-like events actually originate from spine-like structures on the axon initial segment, it would be a novel and unique observation as far as I know. If electrical synapse-generated spikelets can be used to reliably estimate the size and patterns of gap junction-coupled neuron clusters, that would be an important contribution to IO neurobiology and perhaps more widely. As presented here, however, I don't think either conclusion is strongly supported by the evidence.</p><p>1) This study rests entirely on the properties of small, subthreshold events, so clear reporting of their characteristics is critical. A first-order question is whether any of these events represent chemical synaptic input. Are they EPSPs? Are they triggered by EPSPs? The answers here are vague. The authors report that the application of CNQX reduced the rate of &quot;unitary unipolar events&quot; from an average of 0.7 Hz to &quot;below 0.02 Hz&quot; (Results paragraph one), but no details are provided. This control rate was apparently taken from a large group of cells, not from the 19 cells to which the drug was applied. The authors should report the data properly, with measurements from the same neurons before and after CNQX. They should also report the characteristics of the subthreshold events remaining after CNQX, including amplitudes and kinetics, and compare them to events from the same cells in the absence of the drug. Later on, the authors say that fast events are &quot;independent of chemical transmission&quot;, but they do not show any evidence for this. All of this bears on a key question: what, if anything, do EPSPs contribute to the subthreshold events and their properties?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see elaborated response to the editor comment 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Were all of the data in Figure 1 recorded in the absence of CNQX? If the answer is yes, and CNQX reduced the frequency of those subthreshold events by 97% (see previous comment), then shouldn't we expect a large fraction of the subthreshold events to be spontaneous EPSPs rather than spikelets?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, CNQX was not used in any of the neurons presented in Figure 1. Reduction in spikelets under CNQX is explained as reduction in firing in the network. We added a new supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) and discussed the issue further in the Result section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The recording and analyses of subthreshold events are limited by detection thresholds and signal-to-noise ratios. Some of the events (spikelets and perhaps IREs) are presumably too small to see. This has implications for the inferences one can draw from the recordings, including the estimates of coupled-neuron cluster size. Noise levels are not reported here. The authors' modeling could provide estimates of the limits of their detection given signal-to-noise limitations, and perhaps support the reliability of their cluster estimates. The authors should discuss this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the analysis is restricted by the signal to noise ratio. Indeed, we discussed that our results are likely to be an underestimation of the number of spikelets and common groups. However, this limitation could only significantly affect our conclusion that the connectivity is organized in clusters. In order to test whether this will hinder our ability to reject the distance dependent configuration we reduced by half (6 pairs) the number of pairs without common groups and distributed those 6 pairs in common groups uniformly (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). This modified data still rejects the distance-dependent model (A, p value&lt;0.002) and support the cluster organization (B, p value&gt;0.05). In addition, it should be noted that in the case of 12 pairs that did not have common groups, we carefully verified that spikelets in one cell never coincide with any voltage change in the other cell.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43560-resp-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As the authors say (twice), the origins of the IREs &quot;are a mystery&quot;. The evidence that the small spikelets are the postsynaptic result of a presynaptic action potential passing through electrical synapses is highly compelling. The smoking gun comes from paired-cell recordings that were demonstrated by various labs years ago. However, the evidence that the larger, faster &quot;IREs&quot; originate in axonal spines adjacent to the soma is weak, inferential, and indirect.</p><p>The modeling results about IREs are suggestive, but I agree with the authors that &quot;The locations and mechanism of generation of the IREs are not completely resolved&quot;. In fact, without some additional experimental evidence, I do not believe this part of the story is compelling. It certainly does not live up to the overstatement in the Abstract: &quot;fast events represent a regenerative response in unique excitable spine-like structures in the axon hillock&quot;. First, it is not even clear whether axonal spines exist in mouse IO cells. If so, they should be illustrated. The authors refer to original data on axonal spines from De Zeeuw, but that work was done on cat neurons. Second, some more direct evidence for the location of IRE generation would help to make the conclusion convincing, e.g. direct recordings from axon initial segments or spines using electrodes or photoindicators, or molecular/structural demonstrations of high-density sodium channels at axonal spines.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that the source and mechanism of IRE is far from being convincing, and will need a thorough work which we are now pursuing. However, in order to decide whether to include or exclude the IREs from the organization analysis of the electrically coupled network, we had to give enough indications that they do not represent electrical coupling potentials. We added a preliminary observation on the existence of axonal spines in mouse IO cell, and amended the phrasing in the Abstract. See our elaborated response to editor comment #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The analysis of groups of &quot;common spikelets&quot; in paired recordings (Figure 7) as a way to infer the size of electrically coupled clusters of cells is interesting and clever. I wonder, however, about the limitations of the data and what they mean for the cluster size estimates. One example pair is illustrated, from which four groups of common spikelets were claimed (Figure 7E). The spikelet amplitudes are small and variable, of course, and the samples of common (and noncommon) spikelets in each cell were also small (as few as two in the example pair). The Materials and methods are vague about the statistical reliability of this form of cluster counting. For example, the two spikelet clusters on the right of Figure 7E don't look very different to me, especially since the samples are so small and the spikelet sizes/shapes are so variable. The spikelet size distributions in Figure 1 also imply large and continuous variance (rather than the peaky distributions shown for the IREs). Loose criteria for spikelet clustering would lead to overestimates of the size of electrically coupled clusters. The illustrated cell pair (Figure 7E) has some of the smallest numbers of estimated connections (Figure 7F). It seems the problem of defining distinct common spikelet clusters (and estimates of connections) must also increase as the number of clusters increases in a cell. This issue requires more rigorous justification and discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that incorrect spikelet clustering will hamper our estimation of connected cells, and for this reason we took every effort to devise an analysis that will correctly cluster the traces. It is true that, as shown in Figure 1, the distribution of spikelets’ amplitudes is large. However, when taking the 3 parameters: amplitude of common spikelet in the first cell; amplitude of common spikelet in the second cell; difference between the two amplitudes, one gets a very clear spikelet clusters.</p><p>In both the experimental and modelling parts we initially used the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to cluster the common spikelets according to their peak amplitudes and differance between amplitudes. However, while the algorithm works well for the model, it is less ideal for the noisy experimental traces although the number of groups detected by the algorithm was not substantially different than the manual curation. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref> we compare the manual curation to the DBSCAN results in another example pair. Whereas the similarity of two modes of analysis are clearly seen, the algorithm predicted 7 groups whereas the manual analysis resulted in 6 groups. First, it is clear that the manual curation is more accurate. Second, as we demonstrate above (response to comment 3), a small change in the number of common groups did not affect the significance of our claim.</p><p>In the example shown in Figure 7, the two right clusters indeed have similar black traces, but the red traces could easily be grouped in two different clusters according to their amplitudes. We chose this example, since we believe it is an easy example to explain our methodological approach with.</p><p>We added a clearer description of the analysis in the Materials and methods section.</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43560-resp-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The modeling results in Figure 8 test the analysis in Figure 7, to some extent, by varying the sampling period and the firing frequencies. However the modeled data look much less variable (in amplitude) than the real data (cf. Figure 8B with 7B and E, for example). I also infer from the descriptions that the model network did not include noise.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, in the example given in Figure 8 there is little variance, however, this was not a common feature, as shown in another example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref>. The difference in spikelets’ amplitude was originated from the difference in GJ locations and the cells’ morphology and membrane properties. There was also noise originating from the difference in the mean firing rate of the cells, which effect we quantified in Figure 8—figure supplement 1. Noise was not added to the voltage traces.</p><fig id="respfig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43560-resp-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The modeling in Figure 8 does not provide convincing support for the authors' hypothesized clustering of gap junction connectivity, as compared to a simple distance-dependent model of connectivity. This seems to boil down to another eyeball comparison of estimates from the spikelet analyses of Figure 7 to the results of a model (Figure 8). Specifically, the authors conclude that the distance model &quot;failed to reproduce the distribution of common groups as found experimentally (Figure 8F)&quot;, whereas the clustering model &quot;replicated the distance-dependent connection probability (Figure 8H)&quot;. To my eye the fits in Figure 8F and H seem about equally good (or bad). Interestingly, the authors conclude that the fits to data measurements in Figure 8E and H are about equally good, but to my eye the fit in Figure 8H looks about as good (or bad) as that in Figure 8F and H. In other words, the modeling results seem to be very weak evidence for deciding between these cluster vs. distance-dependence scenarios.</p><p>In this regard, it would seem that experimental studies of tracer-coupling among IO cells (as in Devor and Yarom, 2004; Placantonakis et al., 2006; Hoge et al., 2011) in the same slices as those analyzed with the common spikelet method would be a more reliable way to determine whether electrical coupling is random/distance-dependent or is determined by clustering.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment.

What happens in an electrically coupled cell when an IRE occurs in the paired cell? Are these events even detectable? The Discussion simply says, &quot;an IRE in one neuron never coincided with a spikelet in the other neuron&quot;, but I don't believe the paper tells us what does coincide with an IRE.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not see any event or change in membrane potential in one cell while IRE was apparent in the other cell, nor we saw an IRE in one cell due to spike in the other cell. These evidences highly support the hypothesis that IREs are not evoked in the dendrites, as this will pass through gap-junction to coupled neurons. This was indeed our reason to search for other possibility to the origin of the IREs, after dismissing the direct-indirect spikelets possibility which is presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 1. This point was elaborated in the Result section and Discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>The major change of the current submission is a complete removal of the axonal spines and focus on the organization of the network.</p><p>In the current version we also answered the reviewer’s comments by:</p><p>a) Performed a new set of pharmacological experiments, showing that the fast events are blocked by synaptic blockers whereas the spikelets are still present and therefore are likely to reflect electrical coupling. As mentioned by the reviewers, the fact that the frequency of spikelets is significantly reduced by the drugs may suggest that some of the slow subthreshold events might be a chemical synaptic event, a possibility that will question the use of spontaneous events to study the network organization. To resolve this issue, we first compared the spontaneous spikelets to the evoked ones (in pair recordings) and show their similarity. Second, we analyzed a new set of experiments of light-evoked chemical synapses in the Thy1 mouse, demonstrating that their waveform and amplitude are different from the spontaneous and evoked slow events. Thus, we conclude that most, if not all, of the spontaneous slow events are indeed due to electrical coupling.</p><p>In addition, we discuss the reduction in spikelets activity under drug conditions, arguing that spontaneous spiking activity is triggered by the fast events and that blocking the fast events result in a reduction in the frequency of spikelets.</p><p>b) We study the role of noise in detecting common groups of spikelets by assuming either failure or over detections. This is summarized in Figure 7. We also added simulation of the expected distribution of common groups under different assumptions. In all these simulations it is rather clear that a network where the probability of connections is only distance dependent cannot account for the experimentally observed distribution. Thus the main conclusion of this study, that the inferior olive nucleus is organized in clustered of connected cells, is fully supported by the experimental observations.</p><p>In our opinion, it is convincing that we offer a novel experimental and theoretical approach to the study of electrically-coupled network and hope it will meet your approval.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors have addressed some of the weaknesses in the original manuscript. I still think there are major shortcomings, however. The argument that IREs likely originate in axonal spines is unconvincing, in my opinion. The analysis and modeling of spikelets is a stronger story, but the modeling does not address the effects of noise in the cells. Also, the pharmacological results are still confusingly described.</p><p>1) IRE origins and axonal spines. The authors' have slightly tempered their provocative conclusion that IREs are generated in axonal spines, although the Abstract still says: &quot;We suggest that the fast events represent a regenerative response in unique excitable spine-like structures in the axon hillock.&quot; In my opinion the data supporting this suggestion are still exceedingly weak, for these reasons:</p><p>A) The authors' evidence for even the existence of axonal spines in mouse neurons is unconvincing. Only a single image of one mouse IO neuron was provided in the authors' response to reviews (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The image resolution is low, and each putative axonal spine seems to be represented by a small number of pixels. The blow-up image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref> includes a dotted outline (hand-drawn?) that is an overly optimistic interpretation of the pixels, and the graphic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C</xref> is simply a cartoon version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>. I can appreciate that imaging these small structures is technically difficult, but without knowing if spines are common, how large they are, where they are placed, and how well they correlate with the IREs, the conclusion that IREs are generated by axonal spines is simply not convincing.</p><p>B) The authors did not provide any more morphological, molecular, or electrophysiological evidence that helps to connect the origin of IREs to axonal spines (as they replied: &quot;…we are working on this issue but currently we cannot provide this information. We hope that the demonstration of their existence is sufficient for the current report.&quot;) But their manuscript goes far beyond simply demonstrating the existence or IREs. Speculations about exotic mechanisms should wait for supporting evidence.</p><p>C) The authors simulated several possible mechanisms of IRE generation. They first showed that IRE-like events can be generated by modeling &quot;hot spots&quot; of excitability in the dendrites, or alternatively by simulating spike failures at increasingly distal axonal nodes. Then they dismissed these possibilities by saying &quot;it is difficult to envisage a biological mechanism that either specifically localizes channels in a restricted dendritic 'hot spot' or that simultaneously blocks two, three or more Nodes of Ranvier&quot; (fourth paragraph, subsection “Modelling the Intrinsic Regenerative Events (IREs)”). Perhaps so, although two papers the authors cite show evidence for relatively high densities of sodium channels in dendritic spines (Araya et al., 2007; Bywalez et al., 2015). I find it just as difficult to envisage hot spots of ion channels in biologically unique axonal spines that have not been clearly demonstrated either in the olivary cells under study or, indeed, in any other class of vertebrate neuron.</p><p>D) The modeling of spike generation in putative axonal spines (Figure 5) explored a very limited and biologically unjustified parameter space. The authors included high densities of sodium and potassium channels (identical to those in the axon initial segment) in both the spine heads and in the axon hillock, while the excitability of the axonal nodes of Ranvier was actually eliminated (the excitable hillock and the inexcitable axon are mentioned only in the Materials and methods, and not in the main text or legend). The consensus in the field is that channel densities in the axon hillocks of vertebrate neurons are quite low, especially compared to the initial segment. Perhaps mouse olivary cells are not like other neurons, but in the absence of evidence we just don't know. What was the rationale for making the rest of the axon entirely inexcitable while modeling excitable spines? Only a few results of this modeling are illustrated in the manuscript; how robust are these results? What are the consequences of varying channel densities and types, distributions, spatial patterns, spine morphology and number, etc.?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above this part has been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Network modeling and the absence of noise. The most novel and interesting conclusion from the network modeling is that the IO cells may be organized into electrically coupled clusters of cells (the connection probability predictions largely agree with the widely variable range suggested by previous studies).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We certainly agree with this description.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The clustering conclusion rests entirely on fits of the &quot;common spikelet&quot; distributions in recorded cell pairs to predictions of the network model. The authors note that the accuracy of the modeled connection distributions depend strongly on the cells' firing frequencies and the length of the recording samples. Should it not also depend on noise? An important feature of the biological preparation that is absent from the model is any source of noise or variability (apart from the Poisson timing of the somatic currents triggering spikes), especially in the subthreshold membrane voltages.</p></disp-quote><p>We study the role of noise in detecting common groups of spikelets by assuming either failure or over detections. This is summarized in the new Figure 7, showing that even if we assume a failure in detecting common group, or inaccuracy in the number of common groups detection, the clustered organization is still the only possible explanation. Furthermore, we examined several distance-dependent connectivity possibilities and none of them produce a distribution of common groups that fits the experimental results. Thus we can strongly conclude that the only explanation for the observed distribution is clustered organization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors' recordings implied that blocking fast glutamate receptors reduced spontaneous spiking rates dramatically, so one can infer that there is normally a considerable of chemical synaptic noise in addition to other potential sources.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, the reduction in spikelets activity is highly correlated with reduction in the fast events which in the IO trigger spiking activity (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Thus blocking the fast events will lead to a reduction in spiking activity followed by a reduction in spikelets. The synaptic potentials that trigger the fast events cannot be recorded at somatic location. Spontaneous synaptic events are rarely encountered. However, to examine the possible involvement of chemical synapses in the spontaneous activity we analyzed synaptic events that were triggered by ChR activation of excitatory axons projecting to IO neurons in Thy1 mice. Using minimal light duration we were able to activate putatively unitary events. We then compared the waveforms of the synaptic potentials to the waveforms of the slow events. As shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, the synaptic potentials’ waveform and amplitude are clearly different from the spontaneous slow event (n=17 cells). Furthermore, we demonstrate (Figure 2) that the spikelets are insensitive to membrane potential. This, which has been examined in large population of neurons, further supports our conclusion that most, if not all, of the slow events are a reflection of electrical coupling. One can argue that the insensitivity to membrane potential might be due to distal location of the synapse, however, the shape of the spikelets does not support such possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Pharmacology. The pharmacology (synaptic blocker) data are still confusingly described and not very helpful. From the Results, subsection “Spontaneous unitary events recorded in neurons of the inferior olive”: &quot;However, application of synaptic blockers (see Materials and methods) completely eliminated the presence of the fast events (n=19 neurons; in 4 of these neurons where CNQX was added during recording the frequency changed from 0.017 ± 0.005 Hz to 0 Hz) whereas the frequency of spontaneous slow events decreased significantly (from 0.92 ± 0.73 Hz 163 to 0.26 ± 0.16 Hz, p=0.019, paired t-test, n=9 neurons).&quot; My questions:</p><p>A) What were the blockers? This Results sentence says just CNQX, the legend to Figure 2—figure supplement 1 says APV plus either CNQX or DNQX, and the Materials and methods simply list all the drugs.</p><p>B) The sample sizes tested are still ambiguous. The phrase about fast events says n=19, but then talks about n=4 &quot;where CNQX was added&quot;. Was the drug not added to the other 15 cells? The phrase about slow events then cites n=9. Were the same cells tested before and after addition of blockers? Are the 4 and 9 cells subsets of the 19, or different samples? Please clarify.</p><p>C) The authors say they did a &quot;thorough analysis&quot; of the effects of blockers on slow event waveforms, but they actually report data from only two example cells in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. These data showed rise-times and half-durations, but not amplitudes.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a new cohort of data and simplified the description of the drug effect. As mentioned above, we show that the drug completely eliminated the fast events accompanied by significant reduction in spikelets activity. This has been added to the text, and to Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and we hope it is now clear.</p></body></sub-article></article>
