Across the animal kingdom, sleep has been found to have a beneficial effect on the consolidation of recently formed memories into long-term storage. However, the underlying mechanisms of sleep dependent memory consolidation are poorly understood. Here, we show that consolidation of courtship long-term memory in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is mediated by reactivation during sleep of dopaminergic neurons that were earlier involved in memory acquisition. We identify specific fan-shaped body neurons that induce sleep after the learning experience and activate dopaminergic neurons for memory consolidation. Thus, we provide a direct link between sleep, neuronal reactivation of dopaminergic neurons, and memory consolidation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42786.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Why do some memories fade after only a few seconds, whereas others last a lifetime? Studies suggest that part of the explanation has to do with sleep. Experiments in rodents show that neural circuits that are active during learning become active again when an animal sleeps. This process of reactivation, which may be akin to dreaming, helps strengthen specific memories and move them into long-term storage. But the complexity of the mammalian brain has made it difficult to pin down the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>One possible solution is to study the mechanisms in a simpler brain with fewer neurons, such as that of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Dag, Lei et al. have now used molecular genetic tools to explore how sleep supports a specific type of learning in male fruit flies, called courtship learning. Female fruit flies that have recently mated will reject the courtship efforts of other males. A male fly that experiences repeated rejections therefore learns to avoid mated females in future. This type of memory can last for at least a day – a long time in the life of a fly.</p><p>Dag, Lei et al. show that males that experience repeated rejections subsequently spend more time asleep than control males. Preventing this sleep hinders the males from learning from their experience. But how does this process work? During sleep, specific dopamine neurons that were active during the learning episode become active once again. Blocking this reactivation prevents the flies from learning from their rejections. By contrast, artificially activating the dopamine neurons enables flies with only limited experience of rejection to learn to avoid mated females. Dag, Lei et al. show that neurons called vFB cells control this process. The vFB neurons both induce sleep and reactivate the memory-inducing dopamine neurons.</p><p>These findings in fruit flies thus reveal a direct causal link between sleep, reactivation of memory traces, and persistence of memories. They also show that fruit flies are a valid model for exploring the neural and molecular mechanisms connecting sleep and long-term memory.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>long-term memory consolidation</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>neuronal reactivation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keleman</surname><given-names>Krystyna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Consolidation of long-term courtship memory in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is mediated by a novel class of sleep promoting neurons that reactivates dopaminergic neurons engaged earlier in memory acquisition during post-learning sleep.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals guide their behavior in part based on the memories of past learning experiences. Temporally, these memories can be either short- or long-lasting; short-term memory (STM) shapes future animal behavior within seconds, minutes to hours after a learning experience, whereas long-term memory (LTM) holds the learned information for hours, days or even a lifetime. STM is thought to rely on protein synthesis-independent covalent modifications and changes in weight of existing synaptic connections, whereas LTM is believed to reflect protein synthesis-dependent structural changes in specific synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kandel, 2001</xref>). Depending on the salience or duration of the learning experience, some STMs can be transformed into LTMs through the process of memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dudai et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies in vertebrates suggest that sleep has a beneficial effect on memory in various learning tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marshall and Born, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith, 2001</xref>). Studies in humans and rodents have shown that an insufficient amount of sleep impairs cognitive functions such as memory formation and retention, while an ample amount of sleep after a learning experience supports memory storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</xref>). In addition, several studies have found that animals, including humans, exhibit an enhanced amount and quality of sleep after experiencing a novel or enriched environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gais et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith and Wong, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Walker and Stickgold, 2006</xref>). One hypothesis is that sleep plays an active role in consolidation of newly acquired memories into long-term storage, that are critical for the animal future actions. To date, however, a mechanistic understanding of sleep function in this selective memory consolidation remains elusive.</p><p>Over the last two decades, studies of sleep and LTM have expanded from the almost exclusive studies in mammals to other animals, including insects. Sleep is now well-documented in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> exhibits almost all the hallmarks of sleep in mammals, including homeostatic regulation, diminished behavioral responsiveness, and the existence of different sleep stages as characterized by distinct electrophysiological signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dissel et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yap et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Alphen et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, a link between sleep and LTM has been established: sleep deprivation before and after learning impairs mnemonic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ganguly-Fitzgerald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seugnet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seugnet et al., 2009</xref>), whereas sleep induction enhances memory formation and retention in wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donlea et al., 2011</xref>) and restores memory in memory mutant flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dissel et al., 2015b</xref>). Moreover, flies that were exposed to a socially enriched environment, including courtship learning, exhibit an increased amount of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ganguly-Fitzgerald et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Courtship conditioning has been extensively exploited to study both memory and sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Courtship conditioning is an ethologically relevant form of complex learning whereby male flies learn to associate the outcome of their own behavior with multisensory cues presented by females during courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ejima et al., 2005</xref>). Naive <italic>Drosophila</italic> males eagerly court both virgin and mated females, which are generally receptive and unreceptive, respectively. However, after being repeatedly rejected by mated females, males become less likely to court other mated females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ejima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keleman et al., 2012</xref>). Like with other types of learning, the resulting memory can last from minutes to days depending on the training protocol.</p><p>We previously established that activity of the dopaminergic aSP13 neurons (DAN-aSP13s) is necessary and sufficient for STM acquisition via the dopamine receptor DopR1 in the γ neurons of the mushroom body known as Kenyon Cells (γKCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keleman et al., 2012</xref>), a neuropil in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central brain critical for memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heisenberg et al., 1985</xref>). Moreover, we recently demonstrated that the activity of the same DAN-aSP13s is also essential for the consolidation of courtship STM to LTM. This requirement is observed in a discrete time window after learning, and it is mediated via the dopamine receptor DopR1 in the γKCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krüttner et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examine the mechanisms of DAN-aSP13 post-learning activation. We show here that DAN-aSP13s are activated during sleep after courtship experience that induces LTM. We present evidence that the specific class of sleep-promoting neurons in the fan-shaped body (FB), a neuropil previously implicated in sleep regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donlea et al., 2011</xref>), activates DANs-aSP13 in the discrete time window after learning to consolidate courtship LTM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DAN-aSP13 neurons are activated during post-learning sleep</title><p>To investigate the role of sleep in post-learning activation of DAN-aSP13s, and hence LTM consolidation, we first asked whether DAN-aSP13s are active in freely behaving males after a prolonged experience with mated females, which induces LTM. To monitor activity of DAN-aSP13s for several hours in unrestrained males we employed a luminescence-based transcriptional reporter of neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). Using specific DAN-aSP13s GAL4 driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we expressed luciferase exclusively in DAN-aSP13s under the control of multimerized binding sites for the neuronal activity regulated gene Lola and FLP recombinase target sites (FRT) for its activity dependent cell specific expression (<italic>MB315B-GAL4&gt;UAS-FLP, Lola(FRT)stop(FRT)LUC</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). We measured luminescence as a proxy for neuronal activity in males that had undergone prolonged training with mated females and in naive males without prior courtship experience. As a control we used males after prolonged training with virgin females which does not induce memory when tested 24 hr later with mated females (our unpublished results). For training, single males were paired with a single recently-mated or virgin female for 6 hr. Afterwards, trained, naïve and control males were individually transferred to a 96-well luminescence reading plate. Luminescence measurements were taken every 15 min over 16 hr beginning at a common starting time for all males, at the hour seven from the onset of training. Notably, flies that had undergone training with mated females displayed a gradual increase of the luminescence signal, which was significantly different from naïve males between 7–10 hr from the onset of training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, control males that had undergone training with virgin females also displayed an increase in luminescence however, it was identical to that in naïve males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). That specific time window of DAN-aSP13 activation after onset of training with mated females was preserved in males that were trained in a later circadian time during the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Together, these data show that DAN-aSP13s are activated in a specific time window after a learning experience that leads to LTM.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42786.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DAN-aSP13 neurons are activated during sleep.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (left) Luminescence of DAN-aSP13 neurons expressing Lola-LUC reporter (MB<italic>315B-GAL4&gt;UAS-FLP; Lola&gt;stop&gt;</italic>LUC) normalized to luminescence of the genetic control (<italic>UAS-FLP; Lola&gt;stop&gt; LUC)</italic>. Mean luminescence of the wild-type males trained with mated female in single pair assays as indicated (red, n = 42) and naïve males (black, n = 40) is shown as a solid line with SEM indicated as thin vertical lines.

Both trained and naive wild-type males showed a significant amount of day time sleep, particularly during hours 7–10 when DAN-aSP13s are active. Importantly, males that had undergone training for LTM slept significantly more in this time window in comparison to naïve males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Both groups displayed the same amount of sleep throughout the night.</p><p>Notably, enhancement of post-training sleep occurs between 7–10 hr from the start of training regardless of the circadian time of training.

To evaluate their memory, we used automated video analysis to derive a courtship index (CI) for each male; CI is defined as the percentage of time over a 10 min test period during which the male courts the female. Memory is represented as a suppression index (SI), which is the relative reduction in the median courtship indices of trained versus naïve males: SI = 100*[1-CI<sup>train+</sup>/CI<sup>train-</sup>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keleman et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, males that were trained for 1 hr to induce STM did not exhibit an increased amount of sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Because neuronal reactivation occurs during sleep in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith, 2001</xref>), we hypothesized that post-learning activation of DAN-aSP13s involves a sleep-dependent mechanism. Using behavioral analysis and neuronal activity monitoring and perturbation approaches, we have shown here that DAN-aSP13s display an increased activity in freely behaving animals during sleep after a prolonged learning experience. We demonstrated that this sleep is necessary for LTM consolidation, and it can be mediated by a specific class of sleep promoting neurons in the ventral layer of the FB (vFB). These vFB neurons consolidate courtship LTM in a discrete time window and provide an excitatory input to DAN-aSP13s. Thus, the data we present here provide a causal link between sleep promoting neurons in the vFB, post-learning activation of dopaminergic neurons, and LTM consolidation.</p><p>Based on our data, we propose the following model for sleep-dependent consolidation of courtship LTM in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). During a prolonged learning experience, γKCs and DAN-aSP13s are repeatedly activated by olfactory and behavioral cues presented by an unreceptive female, respectively. Whereas prolonged wakefulness leads to an increase in homeostatic sleep drive in ellipsoid body neurons that in turn is conveyed to dFB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), we hypothesize that an extended learning experience generates a learning-dependent sleep drive that is transmitted to vFB. In turn, the vFB neurons enhance sleep after learning and provide an excitatory input back on DAN-aSP13s. We believe that one potential site of a learning-dependent sleep drive are the MB neurons since they have been implicated in both memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heisenberg et al., 1985</xref>) and sleep regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sitaraman et al., 2015b</xref>). Dopamine released upon DAN-aSP13 reactivation stimulates molecular processes in γKCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krüttner et al., 2015</xref>) that are different from those engaged during STM acquisition and involve protein synthesis that is essential for LTM formation and persistence.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42786.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Post-learning activation of DAN-aSP13 neurons mediates LTM consolidation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The MBγ and DAN-aSP13s are repetitively activated during 6 hr training by the olfactory and behavioral cues presented by a mated female, respectively. (<bold>B</bold>) Males display an enhanced amount of sleep after training for LTM. Enhanced sleep is mediated by the vFB neurons in response to a learning induced sleep drive while the remaining amount of sleep is regulated by dFB neurons in response to homeostatic sleep drive. Only vFB neurons activate DAN-aSP13s. Dopamine released as a result of DAN-aSP13s activation stimulates molecular processes in the γKCs neurons that involve synthesis of new proteins essential for LTM memory persistence.

Post-learning neuronal activity of the dopaminergic hippocampal inputs from the Ventral Tagmental Area (VTA) has been implicated in the consolidation of fear memory in rodents. Interestingly, this activity is critical during a discrete time window after learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rossato et al., 2009</xref>). Post-learning activity of the VTA dopamine neurons has been also implicated in the reactivation during sleep of the hippocampal cells involved earlier in encoding of the spatial experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gomperts et al., 2015</xref>). Here we show that post-learning activation of DAN-aSP13s mediates the consolidation of courtship LTM in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We propose that reactivation during sleep of the dopamine neurons that were previously active during memory acquisition ensures that spurious experiences are not admitted into LTM storage and thus only experiences that are either sufficiently salient or persistent become long-lasting memories. Specifically, reactivation of DAN-aSP13s during post-learning sleep enhances reactivation of the γKCs and cognate MBON-M6, which together with DAN-aSP13s form a recurrent circuit necessary for courtship memory acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). We consider two hypotheses to account for this selectivity. During sleep, vFB neurons might selectively reactivate only the relevant DANs, or alternatively, they might activate all DANs but only the relevant subset is able to consolidate LTM. The selective-reactivation model would require some marker to distinguish which DANs were activated, whereas the selective-consolidation model would require a marker in the synapses of the γKCs that were earlier active during memory acquisition, for example translational regulator Orb2, which regulates translation upon neuronal activity during LTM consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krüttner et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Activity of dopaminergic neurons regulates sleep-wake states in animals, including flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dzirasa et al., 2006</xref>). Artificial activation of DAN-aSP13s has been shown to increase wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sitaraman et al., 2015a</xref>). In contrast, the data we present here imply that activation of vFB neurons, although they activate DAN-aSP13s, do not promote wakefulness. These results suggest that activation of DAN-aSP13s by vFB neurons during sleep is qualitatively different from a direct optogenetic or thermogenetic activation used in previous studies. One potential explanation is that post-learning sleep involves activation of the vFB circuit, which provides both excitatory stimulus to DAN-aSP13s and inhibitory input to motor neurons. Another possibility is that post-learning sleep activates a subset od DAN-aSP13s that do not affect wakefulness.</p><p>We have identified here a class of sleep-promoting neurons in the ventral layer of FB that are distinct from the well-studied sleep-promoting neurons in the dorsal layer of FB, which regulate sleep homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donlea et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donlea et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pimentel et al., 2016</xref>). Given that vFB neurons enhance sleep and activate DAN-aSP13s for LTM consolidation, whereas dFB neurons are neither necessary nor sufficient for LTM consolidation, we hypothesize that dFB and vFB neurons promote distinct components of sleep that have different functions. Homeostatic sleep is thought to facilitate memory encoding by downscaling synaptic weights and clearing metabolites from the brain accumulated during wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bushey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>). In contrast, the function of learning-dependent sleep might be to facilitate memory consolidation by strengthening synaptic connections that were engaged earlier during memory acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frank, 2012</xref>). Thus, the co-operation of homeostatic- and experience-dependent sleep would facilitate optimal conditions for learning new information and, if appropriate, incorporating it into long-term storage.</p><p>Recent studies have implied that sleep in flies, as in humans and rodents, exhibits sleep stages characterized by distinct electrophysiological signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yap et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Alphen et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, the signature of sleep that is induced by activation of the dFB neurons seems to have a simpler oscillatory pattern, recorded by local field potentials, than sleep that is induced by activation of the FB neurons comprising both dFB and vFB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yap et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, these data support our hypothesis that dFB and vFB neurons promote sleep with different properties and likely different functions.</p><p>It is thought that sleep evolved in animals that are capable of complex learning which requires selective attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kirszenblat and van Swinderen, 2015</xref>). Courtship learning is a multisensory form of learning that requires selective attention of a male to associate multiple learning cues presented by the mated female with the outcome of his own behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kirszenblat and van Swinderen, 2015</xref>). Accordingly, studies in bees have shown that sleep affects a complex form of learning such as spatial memory but has no role in the simple learning paradigm of proboscis extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vorster and Born, 2015</xref>). Hence, it would be interesting to investigate whether post-learning sleep is involved in the consolidation of other types of memory in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, such as the well-studied Pavlovian olfactory associative learning whereby animals associate an individual learning cue with a behavioral contingency.</p><p>In this work, we establish a functional link between a novel class of sleep-promoting neurons in the FB, post-learning reactivation of dopaminergic neurons and consolidation of courtship LTM. Moreover, our data suggest that sleep promoting vFB neurons mediate a learning-dependent regulation of sleep that is distinct from the homeostatic control which is facilitated by dFB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we uncover a causal link between sleep-mediated neuronal reactivation and LTM consolidation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In addition, we establish courtship LTM in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a tractable model to investigate the mechanisms that link learning-dependent sleep, neuronal reactivation and LTM

Automated video analysis was used to derive a courtship index (CI) for each male, defined as the percentage of time over a 10 min test period during which the male courts the female. Memory was calculated as a suppression index (SI) that is a relative reduction in the mean courtship indices of trained (CI<sup>+</sup>) versus naïve (CI<sup>-</sup>) populations: SI = 100*[1-CI<sup>train+</sup>/CI<sup>train-</sup>].</p><p>To monitor sleep over a 24 hr time period, male flies were individually inserted into 65 mm glass tubes containing standard fly food, loaded into TriKinetics <italic>Drosophila</italic> activity monitors (DAM), and housed under 12 hr light:12 hr dark schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Donelson et al., 2012</xref>). Periods of inactivity lasting at least 5 min were classified as sleep. Total 24 hr sleep quantity (day time and night time sleep) was extracted from DAM system as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Donelson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To monitor sleep upon acute induction with csChrimson, individual males were reared at 25°C on retinal supplemented (0.1 mM) cornmeal medium in darkness for 4–5 days after eclosion. For sleep induction single males were placed in 10 mm diameter behavioral chambers in a temperature and illumination-controlled box and videotaped (Prosilica GT cameras, Allied Vison Technologies). The amount of sleep was scored manually with periods of inactivity lasting at least 5 min being considered as sleep.</p><p>For sleep deprivation, flies were subjected to intermittent mechanical perturbation method while housed in TriKinetics DAM monitors. Flies received mechanical perturbations on a horizontal shaker with a total cycle of 15 s/min delivered in eight pulses of 1–3 s each occurring intermittently at random times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Courtship assays</title><p>A MATLAB script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamyshev et al., 1999</xref>) (permutation test) implemented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keleman et al. (2012)</xref> was used for statistical comparison of SIs between two groups. Briefly, the entire set of courtship indices for both naïve and trained flies were pooled and then randomly assorted into simulated naïve and trained groups of the same size as the original data. A SI was calculated for each of 100,000 randomly permutated data sets, and P values were estimated for the null hypothesis that learning equals 0 (H<sub>0</sub>: SI = 0) or for the null hypothesis that experimental and control males learn equally well (H<sub>0</sub>: SI = SI<sub>c</sub>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Luminescence assay</title><p>Luminescence assay for detecting neuronal activity in freely behaving adult flies was modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al. (2017)</xref>. Flies were starved on filter soaked in water overnight prior to training. They were transferred to fresh chambers with filter paper containing 40 mM Luciferin (GOLDBIO) in a 2% sucrose solution. For luminescence measurements after training, flies were placed into 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-one) with 40 mM Luciferin in a 2% sucrose solution. CLARIOstar microplate reader (BMG Labtech) was used for luminescence detection. Luminescence was measured every 15 min over 16 hr. Relative Luminescence (R. Luminescence) was calculated by dividing the luminescence of the experienced and naïve groups by the luminescence of the genetic controls (males with luciferase reporter only, fed with luciferin) at every measurement time point.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Optogenetic activation in intact animals</title><p>Single housed male flies were reared at 25°C on retinal supplemented (0.1 mM) cornmeal medium in darkness for 4–5 days after eclosion. For sleep induction or memory consolidation specific classes of neurons were optogenetically activated in behavior chambers housed in a temperature and illumination-controlled box. During activation, the behavior chamber was illuminated with 617 nm LEDs (Red-Orange LUXEON Rebel LED—122 lm; Luxeon Star LEDs, Brantford, Ontario, Canada) with a 3 mm thick diffuser between the LED and flies. The LED was driven by a customized linear current controller. 20 HZ red light was used to activate neurons with intensity varying from 20 uW/mm2 to 70 uW/mm2. The LED board was cooled by a customized liquid cooling system to maintain the temperature in the chamber.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Optogenetic activation in explant brains</title><p>Single housed male flies were reared at 25°C on retinal supplemented (0.1 mM) cornmeal medium in darkness for 4–5 days after eclosion. Brains of the immobilized flies on ice were dissected out in saline (103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 8 mM trehalose, 10 mM glucose, 5 mM TES, bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) and mounted anterior up on the cover slip in a Sylgard-lined dish in a 20°C saline bath.</p><p>Brains were imaged with a resonant scanning two-photon microscope with near-infrared excitation (920 nm, Spectra-Physics, INSIGHT DS DUAL) and a 25x objective (Nikon MRD77225 25XW). The microscope was controlled by ScanImage 2015.v3 (Vidrio Technologies). Images of brain volume were acquired with ~ 157 μm x 157 μm field of view at 512 × 512 pixels resolution. Each frame and each volume was sampled by 42 frames with 3 μm per step, at approximately 1 Hz volume rate. Times series of volume images were acquired and the excitation power for calcium imaging ~ 12 mW.</p><p>For the optogenetic activation, the light-gated ion channel Chrimson88 was activated with a 660 nm LED (M660L3 Thorlabs) coupled to a digital micromirror device (DMD) (Texas Instruments DLPC300 Light Crafter) and combined with the imaging light path using a FF757-DiO1 dichroic (Semrock). On the emission side, the primary dichroic was Di02-R635 (Semrock), the detection arm dichroic was 565DCXR (Chroma), and the emission filters were FF03-525/50 and FF01-625/90 (Semrock). Photostimulation light was delivered in a pulse train that consisted of six 8 s or 15 s pulses (100% duty cycle during each pulse) with a 30 s inter-pulse interval. The light intensity was ~ 0.6 mW/mm2, as measured using Thorlabs S170C power sensor.</p><p>All image data were analyzed off-line. Region of interest (ROI) of DAN-aSP13 at mushroom body γ5 compartment was manually defined in Fiji or CircuitCatcher (a customized python program by Daniel Bushey) and the average GCaMP signal intensity within the DAN-aSP13 ROI was taken as the calcium activity of DAN-aSP13. Time series calcium activity of DAN-aSP13 (f(t)) was extracted from the image data and then analyzed with customized Matlab (MathWorks) programs. The normalized Calcium activity of DAN-aSP13 dF/F is defined as:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p> where the f(t) is the calcium signal intensity and the F0 is the mean F of the first 10 s of the image session before optogenetic activation. dF/F traces of six stimulation were aligned to the LED onset and averaged to represent the DAN-aSP13 activity upon neuron activation. To determine the connectivity from the activated neuron to DAN-aSP13, the mean dF/F during 10 s pre-stimulation and the mean dF/F during stimulation were taken as baseline activity and stimulated activity in a fly. Groups of baseline activities and stimulated activities of different flies were tested with student’s test or Wilcoxon rank sum test to determine if optogenetic activation had evoked significant calcium activity changes in DAN-aSP13 against the hypothesis that the baseline activity and stimulated activity were the same level. p value smaller than 0.05 was taken as the criteria of connectivity (either inhibitory or excitatory).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Correlation of determination</title><p>Correlation of determination (r<sup>2</sup>) was used to measure the correlation between the time series calcium trace (f(t)) of each voxel and a predicted model.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work uses <italic>Drosophila</italic> to test and advance the idea that long-term memory (LTM) consolidation involves reactivation during sleep of neurons that become activated during the period when the memory is created. The authors previously showed that activation of a particular group of dopaminergic neurons in the mushroom bodies (DAN-aSP13) is necessary for courtship short term memory (STM). Using a luminescent reporter, the authors found that the activity of DAN-aSP13s were increased in male flies exposed to mated females, relative to naïve males. They also showed that if they deprived males of sleep during a critical period following training with mated females their courtship was not suppressed. The same effect occurred if they silenced DAN-aSP13s during the same time windows following training. Moreover, activating sleep during the critical period following a very short training that is ordinarily not sufficient for LTM induced suppression, and this requires activation of DAN-aSP13s. The authors also show that activation of vFB neurons in turn activates DAN-aSP13s, and this contributes to LTM consolidation.</p><p>Thus, through an elegant set of experiments, the authors demonstrate that DAN-aSP13s neurons, which are active during courtship behaviour, must also be active during sleep for LTM formation. Learning-induced sleep pressure is mediated by vFB neurons, which provide an excitatory input to DAN-aSP13s neurons. The conclusions are consistent with unexpected previous findings from the same lab that there are two temporally distinct phases of dopaminergic activity required for LTM consolidation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and also with work showing multiple sleep phases in flies and mammals. The authors raise the very interesting and testable possibility that two phases of sleep in flies have different functions, while identifying a function for vFB driven sleep. Overall, this study is well done and will be of significant interest to the sleep field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Together, the authors suggest that &quot;reactivation&quot; of DAN-aSP13s neurons during sleep is comparable to neural replay in rodents. Neural replay in rodents involves the sequential activation of neurons, that represent a behavioural sequence. Replay detection is based on the very small probability that the sequence could reactivate by chance. The same cannot be said about &quot;reactivation&quot; of general neural activity (no sequence). This happens during sleep all the time (e.g. up and down states, spindles) and while this is not treated as reactivation, disrupting this type of activity would likely interfere with memory consolidation. For example, is DAN-aSP13 activation or silencing specific for the training task or all learning that occurred during that period. The idea of reactivation is that it is a specific memory that is replayed. In its current state, the data of dopamine neuronal &quot;reactivation&quot; in the fly doesn't seem comparable to rodent replay.</p><p>In all likelihood DANs represent emotional quality associated with experience, not the experience itself. For instance experience of odor A associated with a shock or odor B associated with a shock are not distinguished at the level of DANs. Given that the work monitors DANs, and does not monitor replay of experience, it is important to clearly acknowledge that the work does not directly address a function for experience replay during sleep.</p><p>2) Please explain and provide details on how MB315B-GAL4&gt;UAS-FLP, Lola&gt;stop&gt;LUC provides an activity dependent reporter. It should not be necessary to dig into the literature to understand this. Is MB315B only expressed when there is neuronal activity (how well has this been shown?) and is &lt;ola only expressed in DAN-aSP13s?</p><p>3) Figure 1A-E. Do explain why there is a one hour delay between exposure of the mated males to females and the beginning of the luminescence measurements. Why is there a delay in the increase in activity? Also, why is the activity increased in the naïve males, albeit with a delay. The AU are a bit unclear. Is there really a &gt;30x increase in activity in the males exposed to mated females? Why are there periods during the assays that are neither day nor night? It is not clear what would comprise such a condition.</p><p>4) It seems that the sham (naïve) males are males that are left alone rather than are exposed to virgin females. Therefore, another necessary control is to expose males to virgin females.</p><p>5) The statement that thermogenetic activation of vFB neurons with TRPA1 increases sleep is true during the day. However, as shown in Figure 4, nighttime sleep is reduced when there is increased sleep in the day. Why only these two mutants? It doesn't seem linked to exclusive vFB or dFB activation. Any comments on this?</p><p>6) The experiments monitoring DAN activity while stimulating FB neurons use a wide-spectrum DAN driver, not a specific for DAN-aSP13 as used in the earlier experiments. A sentence of two with arguments to rule out the possibility that alternative DANs being activated by vFB neurons somehow result in the same outcome is required (Despite Figure 3—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>7) The phrase &quot;necessary and sufficient&quot; is likely used inappropriately in at least two different parts of the text e.g. DAN neuron activity may be necessary but is certainly not sufficient for LTM consolidation – it is only sufficient when various other criteria including all the sensorimotor experiences associated with training have occurred and post training sleep has been induced. (Though I acknowledge that similar usage is common in the field see: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05418-0.)</p><p>8) Another control experiment that could be useful is to examine potential courtship suppression after DAN neurons have been activated during sleep in naive animals that have <italic>not</italic> been trained. This would rule out the possibility of non-specific fly-equivalent of &quot;anxiety,&quot; for instance being a confounding phenomenon.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42786.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Together, the authors suggest that &quot;reactivation&quot; of DAN-aSP13s neurons during sleep is comparable to neural replay in rodents.

Luminescence) by dividing the luminescence of trained and naïve males by the luminescence of the corresponding genetic controls at every measurement time point. Our data shows that experienced males display about 0.5x increase in activity in comparison to naïve males. We provide description of R. Luminescence in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Luminescence Assay”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why are there periods during the assays that are neither day nor night?

Males that had undergone training with virgin females displayed a small increase in luminescence which was identical to that in naïve males. These results suggest that luminescence increase in males that were trained with mated females reflects learning that leads to LTM (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, subsection “DAN-aSP13 neurons are activated during post-learning sleep”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The statement that thermogenetic activation of vFB neurons with TRPA1 increases sleep is true during the day.

Any comments on this?</p></disp-quote><p>Reduction of night time sleep after prolonged sleep induction is observed mainly in Figure 4B. This particular GAL4 driver in addition to vFB neurons drives expression in DAN-β’1s (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C) which were implicated in promoting wakefulness (Sitaraman et al., 2015). Accordingly, males upon activation of vFB with the same line while silencing DAN-β’1 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D) displayed a higher level of both day and night sleep (Figure 4C).</p><p>Similarly, acute optogenetic activation with CsChrimson for 1 hour significantly enhanced sleep but to a lesser degree than when DAN-β’1s were co-activated (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F) (subsection “vFB neurons promote sleep and activate DAN-aSP13s”, second paragraph). A small decrease of night sleep after sleep induction with the split line SS057264-GAL4 (Figure 4D, Figure 4—figure supplement 1E)might be the result of an increased homeostatic sleep drive to reduce sleep after prolonged sleep induction and the inability of the weaker split line to override it (split GAL4s are considered generally weaker than the standard GAL4 lines). Notably, acute sleep induction with the same line was very effective to induce sleep over short period of time (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F).</p><p>The effect of sleep increase upon thermogenetic activation seems to be specific to ventral and dorsal FB neurons. We have tested multiple FB neuronal classes in the course of this study but were able to induce sleep by activation of these two FB neuronal cell types only.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The experiments monitoring DAN activity while stimulating FB neurons use a wide-spectrum DAN driver, not a specific for DAN-aSP13 as used in the earlier experiments. A sentence of two with arguments to rule out the possibility that alternative DANs being activated by vFB neurons somehow result in the same outcome is required (Despite Figure 3—figure supplement 1A).</p></disp-quote><p>Since specific DANs innervate MB lobes in well-defined discrete areas, we used a broad PAM-DAN GAL4 driver (<italic>R58E02-LexA&gt;LexAop-GCamP6s</italic>). To monitor activity specifically in DAN-aSP13 upon activation of FB neurons we focused on the region of interest (ROI) at the tip of the MBg lobe which we demarcated in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A (subsection “vFB neurons promote sleep and activate DAN-aSP13s”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The phrase &quot;necessary and sufficient&quot; is likely used inappropriately in at least two different parts of the text e.g. DAN neuron activity may be necessary but is certainly not sufficient for LTM consolidation – it is only sufficient when various other criteria including all the sensorimotor experiences associated with training have occurred and post training sleep has been induced.

We tested their courtship with mated females after 24 hours. CIs of naïve males with DAN-aSP13 either activated or not were indistinguishable from each other but significantly different from CI of trained males when tested with mated females (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). These results suggest that consolidation of courtship LTM is a specific effect of DAN-aSP13 activation after training (subsection “Enhancement of sleep consolidates LTM”, last paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
