array and somatic expression of the <italic>DUX4</italic> retrogene. DUX4 is a double homeobox transcription factor that is normally expressed in the testis and causes apoptosis and FSHD when misexpressed in skeletal muscle. The mechanism(s) of DUX4 toxicity in muscle is incompletely understood. We report that DUX4-triggered proteolytic degradation of UPF1, a central component of the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) machinery, is associated with profound NMD inhibition, resulting in global accumulation of RNAs normally degraded as NMD substrates. DUX4 mRNA is itself degraded by NMD, such that inhibition of NMD by DUX4 protein stabilizes DUX4 mRNA through a double-negative feedback loop in FSHD muscle cells. This feedback loop illustrates an unexpected mode of autoregulatory behavior of a transcription factor, is consistent with ‘bursts’ of <italic>DUX4</italic> expression in FSHD muscle, and has implications for FSHD pathogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04996.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04996.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04996.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes are sequences of DNA that contain instructions for the cell that must be carefully controlled because it is not always appropriate or safe for these instructions to be followed. When genes are active, copies of the DNA are made using molecules of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and these can then be used as templates to make proteins.</p><p>One way genes can be controlled is by adding small chemical tags that mark them out to be activated or deactivated, known as epigenetic control. The muscle disease facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by the loss of the chemical tags that normally keep certain genes switched off in many cell types. One of these genes is <italic>DUX4</italic>, which in healthy males is normally only active in the testes, but in FSHD patients it is also active in other parts of the body.</p><p>Another way to control genes is by nonsense-mediated decay, where incorrect or incomplete RNA molecules are destroyed before they can be used to make defective proteins. In this study, Feng et al. show that when <italic>DUX4</italic> is activated following the failure of epigenetic control in FSHD patients, the effectiveness of nonsense-mediated decay is also reduced. This results in the build-up of incorrect RNA molecules inside muscle cells, which can harm the cell. In fact, 13% of the incorrect RNA molecules that are normally destroyed in cells were found at higher levels when <italic>DUX4</italic> was active.</p><p>To investigate how <italic>DUX4</italic> could work, Feng et al. focused on another gene called <italic>UPF1</italic> because cells without the protein encoded by this gene have similar defects in nonsense-mediated decay as cells with active <italic>DUX4</italic>. No difference was found in how often the <italic>UPF1</italic> gene is activated in FSHD cells and normal cells. However, the amount of the protein encoded by <italic>UPF1</italic> was lower in cells with FSHD than in normal muscle cells. The experiments show that the protein encoded by <italic>UPF1</italic> is broken down as a result of the activation of the <italic>DUX4</italic> gene, leading to problems with nonsense-mediated decay, which may result in the worsening of FSHD symptoms.</p><p>The twist in the tale is that <italic>DUX4</italic> itself is also controlled by nonsense-mediated decay under normal circumstances. Therefore, in diseased cells, a failure in epigenetic control allows <italic>DUX4</italic> to prevent its own destruction by tampering with nonsense-mediated decay. These findings offer new insights into the role of the <italic>DUX4</italic> gene in FSHD. The next step is to test whether these defects in nonsense-mediated decay can explain any of the symptoms of FSHD, such as muscle inflammation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04996.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04996.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>DUX4</kwd><kwd>facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy</kwd><kwd>RNA surveillance</kwd><kwd>nonsense-mediated decay</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFS 04-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bradley</surname><given-names>Robert K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000863</institution-id><institution>Ellison Medical Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG-NS-1030-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bradley</surname><given-names>Robert K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Friends of FSH Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tapscott</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR045203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tapscott</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01NS069539</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tapscott</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Expression of the disease gene <italic>DUX4</italic> inhibits RNA quality control in skeletal muscle, thereby stabilizing thousands of aberrant RNAs, including its own transcript.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Main text</title><p>Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is typically an adult-onset muscular dystrophy characterized by muscle weakness initially affecting the face (facio), shoulders (scapulo), and upper arms (humeral). FSHD is caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite array in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q, due to either D4Z4 repeat contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lemmers et al., 2010</xref>) or mutations affecting <italic>trans</italic>-acting epigenetic regulators of the D4Z4 repeat such as SMCHD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lemmers et al., 2012</xref>), which results in the misexpression of DUX4 mRNA in skeletal muscle and possibly other somatic tissues. <italic>DUX4</italic> encodes a double homeobox transcription factor that activates germline genes and repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Geng et al., 2012</xref>) and causes apoptosis and atrophic myotube formation when misexpressed in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kowaljow et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Vanderplanck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wallace et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mitsuhashi et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>DUX4</italic> is expressed in only a small fraction of nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Snider et al., 2010</xref>), likely due to occasional ‘bursts’ of <italic>DUX4</italic> expression. However, the mechanism(s) regulating <italic>DUX4</italic> expression and toxicity remain incompletely understood.</p><p>We previously ectopically expressed <italic>DUX4</italic> in immortalized (54-1) and primary (MB135) myoblasts and used RNA-seq to identify coding genes, repetitive elements, and non-coding RNAs induced by DUX4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Young et al., 2013</xref>). Further analysis of this data showed that <italic>DUX4</italic> expression also resulted in the increased abundance of many coding RNA isoforms containing premature translation termination codons upstream of splice junctions. These isoforms, which are predicted substrates for degradation by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), were present at very low levels in control myoblasts. Following <italic>DUX4</italic> expression, however, many such predicted NMD substrates increased in abundance and in many cases became the predominant mRNA product of the parent gene.

We transfected plasmids encoding either the wild-type β-globin open reading frame or β-globin with a premature termination codon that induces degradation by NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>). Relative levels of the β-globin NMD substrate were twofold higher in <italic>DUX4</italic>-expressing vs control myoblasts, indicating that NMD is indeed compromised by DUX4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>We then determined how reduced NMD efficiency affected global levels of predicted NMD substrates. Restricting to cassette exon splicing events where one isoform, but not both, was a predicted NMD substrate, we found that ∼13% of such predicted NMD substrates increased following <italic>DUX4</italic> expression, while ∼1.6% decreased, in 54-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Impaired NMD also caused accumulation of aberrant mRNAs resulting from mis-splicing or incomplete splicing, which are common byproducts of the stochastic nature of the splicing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Weischenfeldt et al., 2012</xref>). We identified and quantified alternative splicing of annotated constitutive junctions, finding that ∼13% of such junctions exhibited increased aberrant splicing in <italic>DUX4</italic>-expressing vs control cells, while only ∼0.25% exhibited decreased aberrant splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The vast majority of these novel products of annotated constitutive junctions were present at very low or undetectable levels in control 54-1 myoblasts.</p><p>We next extended this analysis to all classes of splicing events, including mis-splicing and intron retention of constitutive splice junctions. <italic>DUX4</italic> expression caused increased levels of predicted NMD substrates for all classes of splicing events in both 54-1 and MB135 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These increases were generally more extreme in 54-1 than in MB135 cells, likely due to the ∼15-fold higher <italic>DUX4</italic> expression achieved in 54-1 vs MB135 cells as well as the longer time period allowed for infection (48 hr vs 24 hr).</p><p>High levels of NMD substrates in <italic>DUX4</italic>-expressing cells were not simply a side effect of DUX4-induced apoptosis. <italic>TP53</italic> knock-down (KD) prevented apoptosis following <italic>DUX4</italic> expression in normal myoblasts, confirming previous reports that DUX4 toxicity is p53-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wallace et al., 2011</xref>). However, <italic>TP53</italic> KD did not prevent DUX4-induced NMD inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>DUX4 could potentially inhibit NMD by transcriptionally repressing components of the NMD machinery. However, no UPF or SMG NMD factors exhibited decreased mRNA levels following <italic>DUX4</italic> expression, and most were up-regulated by two- to fourfold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This expression pattern was reminiscent of a recent report that mRNA levels of most NMD factors increase following the knock-down of <italic>UPF1</italic>, encoding a central component of the NMD machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Huang et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that UPF1 mRNA and protein levels might be decoupled in <italic>DUX4</italic>-expressing cells. We measured levels of UPF1, which was not transcriptionally up-regulated in <italic>DUX4</italic>-expressing cells, and UPF3B and SMG7, which were transcriptionally up-regulated in response to DUX4. UPF1 protein levels were markedly lower in <italic>DUX4</italic>-expressing myoblasts than in control myoblasts, as were SMG7 levels, although to a lesser extent. In contrast, UPF3B levels were unaffected by <italic>DUX4</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04996.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>DUX4 destabilizes UPF1 via the proteasome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative mRNA levels of NMD factors in <italic>DUX4</italic>-expressing vs control myoblasts (54-1 cells).

DUX4 was robustly detectable 12–14 hr after lentiviral infection, coincident with the beginning of a sharp decrease in UPF1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). SMG7 showed a more modest decrease through the time course, while UPF3B levels were relatively constant.

The close temporal coupling between DUX4 protein production, decreased UPF1 levels, and increased levels of both endogenous and exogenous NMD substrates suggests that insufficient levels of UPF1—and perhaps additional NMD machinery components such as SMG7—may contribute to inefficient NMD in <italic>DUX4</italic>-expressing cells.</p><p>The rapid decrease in UPF1 levels that we observed suggested that DUX4 might trigger UPF1 degradation.

We focused on the constitutively spliced second intron within the 3′ UTR because it lies 100 nt downstream of the termination codon, and therefore it is predicted to trigger NMD. Transcripts from the chimeric construct containing the complete <italic>DUX4</italic> 3′ UTR increased twofold following <italic>UPF1</italic> KD in normal myoblasts—a substantial but smaller increase than we observed for the endogenous DUX4 mRNA, perhaps due to the chimeric nature of the β-globin + <italic>DUX4</italic> 3′ UTR construct—while transcripts from the construct lacking the second intron of the <italic>DUX4</italic> 3′ UTR increased only 1.5-fold. We conclude that the second intron of the <italic>DUX4</italic> 3′ UTR is important for NMD-induced degradation of the DUX4 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p><italic>DUX4</italic> exhibits variegated expression in FSHD muscle cells, with only a few percent of nuclei detectable as DUX4+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Snider et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, augmented DUX4 expression following <italic>UPF1</italic> KD in myotubes could be due to increases in DUX4 mRNA in nuclei that are already DUX4+ and/or increases in the fraction of DUX4+ nuclei. Immunostaining of FSHD myotubes revealed that the fraction of DUX4+ nuclei increased from 0.3% to 2.1% following <italic>UPF1</italic> KD, a substantial order-of-magnitude increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Together, our data show that NMD is an endogenous suppressor of DUX4 mRNA levels that contributes to the very low and variegated expression of <italic>DUX4</italic>, a characteristic feature of FSHD muscle cells.</p><p>As <italic>DUX4</italic> expression inhibits NMD and NMD degrades DUX4 mRNA, we hypothesized that <italic>DUX4</italic> and the NMD pathway might participate in a double-negative feedback loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This feedback loop predicts that DUX4 will indirectly stabilize its own mRNA by inhibiting NMD. To test this, we ectopically expressed DUX4 in FSHD1 and FSHD2 myotubes and measured levels of endogenously transcribed DUX4 mRNA. Ectopic DUX4 expression led to an approximately fivefold increase in endogenously transcribed DUX4 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We next tested whether <italic>DUX4</italic>'s spliced 3′ UTR, which is important for NMD-mediated degradation of DUX4 mRNA, contributed to this increase. We transfected our chimeric β-globin + <italic>DUX4</italic> 3′ UTR reporters into normal myoblasts and ectopically expressed <italic>DUX4</italic>. Levels of the NMD-susceptible construct containing the complete <italic>DUX4</italic> 3′ UTR increased 1.43-fold following ectopic DUX4 expression, while levels of the construct without the second intron of the <italic>DUX4</italic> 3′ UTR exhibited a more modest increase of 1.08-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

It is unclear whether NMD-mediated autoregulation is intrinsic to normal DUX4 function or instead an abnormal consequence of inappropriate DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle. However, it is interesting to consider that this mechanism might contribute to the spreading of <italic>DUX4</italic> expression between adjacent nuclei in a muscle fiber. Because muscle fibers contain arrays of closely spaced nuclei, the expression of DUX4 mRNA from one nucleus will distribute protein to the surrounding nuclei and induce a region of NMD inhibition. If one of the surrounding nuclei subsequently expresses <italic>DUX4</italic>, then that mRNA would be unusually stable due to locally inefficient NMD, thereby facilitating the spread of DUX4 mRNA and protein throughout the fiber.</p><p>The close temporal coupling between the onset of DUX4 expression, decreases in UPF1 protein, and increases in NMD substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) strongly suggests that DUX4-mediated degradation of UPF1 contributes to DUX4-induced NMD inhibition. In the absence of a direct mechanistic link between UPF1 degradation and NMD inhibition, we were unable to determine whether insufficient UPF1 protein levels are primarily responsible for DUX4-induced NMD inhibition or instead merely one of the several contributing factors. Nonetheless, as we are unaware of other reports of physiological stimuli triggering rapid UPF1 protein degradation, our data suggest that UPF1 proteolysis constitutes a potential new regulator of cellular NMD efficiency. DUX4 may prove a useful system to gain insight into the biological relevance of this mechanism for altering NMD efficiency. We previously observed that many of the most up-regulated genes following DUX4 expression in normal myoblasts are involved in the ubiquitin–proteasome system, including numerous E3 ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Geng et al., 2012</xref>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that DUX4-induced dysregulation of the ubiquitin–proteasome system is responsible for triggering UPF1 protein degradation. However, the precise mechanism by which DUX4 induces UPF1 proteolysis, and whether that mechanism is specific to the FSHD disease state, remains to be elucidated.</p><p>DUX4-mediated inhibition of NMD may contribute to FSHD pathophysiology through both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms. The accumulation of abnormal RNAs may cause direct or indirect toxic effects in muscle cells due to intrinsic toxicity of abnormal RNAs or a stress response to the production of abnormal proteins. FSHD muscle is frequently characterized by a T-cell infiltrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arahata et al., 1995</xref>), and it is possible that stabilized NMD substrates encode novel peptides with antigenic potential, contributing to an immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pastor et al., 2010</xref>). Production of antigenic peptides could potentially enable even a small fraction of DUX4+ nuclei to induce widespread pathology within a muscle fiber. Directly detecting or measuring DUX4-induced NMD inhibition in FSHD muscle biopsies or in bulk populations of cultured FSHD muscle cells is not feasible due to the low fraction of DUX4+ nuclei present at any given time in the absence of ectopic <italic>DUX4</italic> expression. With DUX4+ nuclei constituting only 0.3% of the bulk population of cultured FSHD muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), changes in the ratios of NMD and non-NMD isoforms in these DUX4+ nuclei are swamped by the normal levels expressed by the vast majority of DUX4− nuclei. Single-cell assays of NMD efficiency are likely required to demonstrate DUX4-induced NMD inhibition in unperturbed patient cells. However, future efforts to identify the downstream antigenic products or toxic effects of stabilized NMD substrates may prove fruitful even in a bulk cell population.</p><p>Consistent with the idea that NMD inhibition may contribute to DUX4 toxicity in skeletal muscle, it is interesting to note that the degree of NMD inhibition induced by DUX4 is comparable to that observed in previous studies involving genetic ablation of components of the NMD machinery. For example, a recent study of mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking <italic>Smg1</italic>, which encodes a kinase responsible for phosphorylating UPF1, found that 9% of predicted NMD substrates created by alternative splicing exhibited increased levels relative to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McIlwain et al., 2010</xref>). In comparison, we found that 13% of such substrates were up-regulated following DUX4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), suggesting that DUX4-induced NMD inhibition causes profoundly abnormal RNA metabolism. As RNA toxicity is the major pathophysiologic mechanism in myotonic dystrophy, it is interesting to consider that RNA-mediated disease mechanisms may also have important roles in FSHD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Accession codes</title><p>FASTQ files for the <italic>DUX4</italic> expression experiments were downloaded from the NCBI GEO database under accession number GSE45883 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Young et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Genome annotations</title><p>The UCSC knownGene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Meyer et al., 2013</xref>) and Ensembl 71 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Flicek et al., 2013</xref>) genome annotations were merged to create a single genome annotation.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this short paper, the authors provide evidence for reduced NMD activity playing a role in Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Previous work had shown that mis-expression in skeletal muscle of the double homeobox transcription factor <italic>DUX4</italic> causes FSHD. However, little was known about the pathways by which <italic>DUX4</italic> expression in muscle cells leads to the muscle damage observed in FSHD. Here, the authors show that ectopic expression of <italic>DUX4</italic> in immortalized and primary myoblast cell lines results in increased levels of transcripts that are known or predicted to be targets of NMD, suggesting an overall reduction of NMD activity. The authors speculate that this reduced NMD activity might lead to the expression of aberrant peptides in muscles that could either be toxic or activate an immune response against the muscle cells. The authors further show that concomitant with <italic>DUX4</italic> expression the abundance of UPF1 protein is reduced (but not the mRNA). Since treatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevented the <italic>DUX</italic>4-induced UPF1 protein reduction, while MG132 had no effect on UPF1 abundance in cells that did not express <italic>DUX4</italic>, the authors concluded that <italic>DUX4</italic> expression in muscle cells causes the proteasome-mediated degradation of UPF1.</p><p>In the second part of the paper the authors point out that the two <italic>DUX4</italic> mRNA isoforms both contain introns in the 3' UTR, which is a well-known feature of NMD targets. They go on the show that the <italic>DUX4</italic> mRNA is indeed targeted by NMD and that its 3' UTR is sufficient to induce NMD of a reporter gene. Together with the first part of the data, this results provide a possible explanation how occasional bursts of <italic>DUX4</italic> transcription can trigger and enhance <italic>DUX4</italic> mis-expression in these myoblast regions by an autoregulatory feedback loop that gradually inactivates NMD in the surrounding nuclei: <italic>DUX4</italic>-induced UPF1 degradation lowers NMD activity, which in turn leads to more <italic>DUX4</italic> mRNA and hence protein and thus further downregulation of NMD. This is an attractive model, and the data for the feedback loop between <italic>DUX4</italic> expression and NMD is compelling.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is of considerable and broad interest and worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there were several substantial concerns of the reviewers that should be addressed at least in the language of the manuscript:</p><p>1) The effects were overall modest, in particular in experiments with the 3' UTR intron and in the assessment of the fraction of nuclei expressing <italic>DUX4</italic> protein in FHSD myotubes.</p><p>2) Lack of connection between observations in primary myoblast cell lines with overexpressed <italic>DUX4</italic> and with authentic patient samples—perhaps too difficult to address, but perhaps it would be possible to ask whether authentic FSHD muscle cells contain increased proportions of predicted NMD substrates.</p><p>3) Lack of a potential molecular mechanism to explain how overexpression of a transcription factor leads to selective degradation of a set of factors involved in NMD. One possibility would be to more thoroughly evaluate the levels of other NMD factor (UPF2 etc.) or components of the proteasome itself. Without elucidation of some mechanistic link, this part of the story remains purely correlative and therefore less impactful.</p><p>Other more specific points follow:</p><p>1) Why is only a small fraction (13%) of predicted NMD targets affected by this mechanism?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>: Can the authors explain the transient nature of the upregulation of the PTC-containing beta-globin NMD reporter? In the light of the proposed feedback loop, one would anticipate robust and enduring inhibition of NMD (as is observed for <italic>SRSF2</italic> and <italic>SRSF3</italic> transcripts; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and thus the beta-globin PTC+ levels to remain elevated after 20 hours post transduction with the <italic>DUX4</italic> expressing lentivirus.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>: The data points for the half-life measurement of <italic>DUX4</italic> mRNA under siControl conditions scatter quite a lot; the authors should describe how they did the curve fitting. The conventional way would be to plot the RNA levels logarithmically and calculate the linear regression line through these data points. Furthermore, by limiting the time course to only 2 hours, the extrapolated half-life of 7.86 h in UPF1-depleted cells is most likely highly inaccurate. The time course should be expanded to 6 or 8 hours to get a more precise estimate of this half-life.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04996.010</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The effects were overall modest, in particular in experiments with the 3' UTR intron and in the assessment of the fraction of nuclei expressing DUX4 protein in FHSD myotubes</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the experiments with the chimeric Gl-DUX4-Intron2 constructs generally yielded modest effect sizes, such as increases of 2- and 1.4-fold following <italic>UPF1</italic> KD or ectopic <italic>DUX4</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figure 3G, 4C</xref>). These effects were substantially smaller than the corresponding 4- and 5-fold increases in endogenous <italic>DUX4</italic> mRNA levels that we observed following <italic>UPF1</italic> KD or ectopic <italic>DUX4</italic> expression. We are unsure why the chimeric construct exhibited more modest effect sizes than did the endogenous <italic>DUX4</italic> mRNA, although it may be due to a combination of its plasmid-based nature and the absence of sequence features of the <italic>DUX4</italic> mRNA other than its 3' UTR intron that contribute to its degradation by NMD. As the Gl-DUX4-Intron2 constructs are chimeric, we feel that the most realistic estimates of effect sizes stem from our measurements of the endogenous <italic>DUX4</italic> mRNA rather than the Gl-DUX4-Intron2 constructs.</p><p>Outside of the chimeric construct, however, many of the other changes that we observed were quite dramatic. For example, the reviewers mention the fraction of <italic>DUX4</italic>+ nuclei in a FSHD myotube culture following control or UPF1 knock down. <italic>DUX4</italic> exhibits a highly variegated expression pattern, with <italic>DUX4</italic> detectable in only 0.1-1% of FSHD muscle cells (Snider et al., PLoS Genetics, 2010; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> from this manuscript). Following UPF1 knock down, we found that the fraction of <italic>DUX4</italic>+ nuclei increased from 0.3% to 2.1%, a change of an order of magnitude. As the extremely low fraction of <italic>DUX4</italic>+ cells in FSHD muscle is a defining characteristic of the disease, we feel that an order-of-magnitude increase in the fraction of <italic>DUX4</italic>+ cells is a substantial effect size, consistent with NMD playing an important role in the regulation of <italic>DUX4</italic> levels. We have emphasized this effect size in the revised manuscript, and also updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to show additional microscopy fields.</p><p>To place these results in context, it is useful to compare our observations with previous studies where NMD was directly inhibited. For example, a recent study (Hurt et al., Genome Research, 2013), inhibited NMD with shRNAs against UPF1 or cycloheximide treatment, which prevents protein translation and thereby NMD. Hurt et al. then used RNA-seq to quantify global mRNA levels. Hurt et al. identified only 8, 14, or 40 predicted NMD substrates out of &gt;20,000 queried mRNAs that were up-regulated by at least 4-fold in cells treated with one of two distinct shRNAs against UPF1 (8 and 14 mRNAs identified) or cycloheximide (40 mRNAs identified). In the context of these results, we feel that the 4- and 5-fold increases in endogenous <italic>DUX4</italic> mRNA levels that we observe following UPF1 knock down or ectopic <italic>DUX4</italic> expression are quite substantial.</p><p>As discussed further below in specific point #1, we also note that the degree of NMD inhibition that is caused by <italic>DUX4</italic> expression is quite remarkable, matching the degree of NMD inhibition caused by genetic knock out of essential NMD factors.</p><p><italic>2) Lack of connection between observations in primary myoblast cell lines with overexpressed DUX4 and with authentic patient samples—perhaps too difficult to address, but perhaps it would be possible to ask whether authentic FSHD muscle cells contain increased proportions of predicted NMD substrates</italic>.</p><p>We agree that our conclusions would be even further strengthened by a direct demonstration that <italic>DUX4</italic> causes NMD inhibition in primary patient materials, in the absence of ectopic <italic>DUX4</italic> expression. However, <italic>DUX4</italic>’s variegated expression pattern—with <italic>DUX4</italic> detectable in only 0.1-1% of FSHD muscle cells (Snider et al., PLoS Genetics, 2010; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> from this manuscript)—typically renders such experiments infeasible. For this reason, most studies of <italic>DUX4</italic>’s molecular function have relied upon ectopic expression to ensure that the majority of assayed cells are <italic>DUX4</italic>+.</p><p>The challenge of detecting <italic>DUX4</italic>-induced NMD inhibition given <italic>DUX4</italic>’s variegated expression pattern can be readily seen with a statistical power estimation. For example, we used a poison exon-containing isoform of <italic>SRSF3</italic> as an endogenous marker of NMD. This isoform increased dramatically in abundance (from ∼10% to 65% of <italic>SRSF3</italic>’s mRNA population) following ectopic <italic>DUX4</italic> expression. It is therefore reasonable to expect that <italic>DUX4</italic>+ cells in a FSHD muscle cell culture may similarly express abnormally high levels of this <italic>SRSF3</italic> NMD substrate in the absence of ectopic <italic>DUX4</italic> expression. However, the variegated nature of <italic>DUX4</italic> expression prevents the direct detection of such signals of NMD inhibition simply due to statistical power limitations. <italic>DUX4</italic> expression is detectable in 0.3% of FSHD nuclei by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Assume that the <italic>SRSF3</italic> NMD substrate is present at isoform ratios of 10% and 65% in <italic>DUX4</italic>- and <italic>DUX4</italic>+ cells, respectively. Measurements of the <italic>SRSF3</italic> NMD substrate in a bulk FSHD cell population would therefore yield an isoform ratio of (0.003 x 65%) + (0.997 x 10%) = 10.165%. The difference between an isoform ratio of 10% for <italic>DUX4</italic>- cells and 10.165% for a mixture of <italic>DUX4</italic>+ and <italic>DUX4</italic>- cells is not detectable with RNA-seq or quantitative PCR.</p><p>In the future, we may be able to overcome the challenges presented by <italic>DUX4</italic>’s variegated expression pattern by studying single cells with assays such as single-cell RNA-seq or live cell imaging approaches. However, we feel that such assays are beyond the scope of this manuscript. We have added additional text to the discussion in which we briefly describe the challenges with detecting NMD inhibition in a bulk population of FSHD cells.</p><p><italic>3) Lack of a potential molecular mechanism to explain how overexpression of a transcription factor leads to selective degradation of a set of factors involved in NMD. One possibility would be to more thoroughly evaluate the levels of other NMD factor (UPF2 etc.) or components of the proteasome itself. Without elucidation of some mechanistic link, this part of the story remains purely correlative and therefore less impactful</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this aspect of the manuscript is correlative. Given the close temporal connection between decreased UPF1 protein levels and increased levels of NMD substrates, we do feel that it is reasonable to speculate that UPF1 degradation is a likely contributor to NMD inhibition. In the revised manuscript, we are careful to state clearly that the data is suggestive but purely correlative. Nonetheless, as rapid UPF1 protein degradation has not been previously described to our knowledge, we feel that this section of the manuscript is a significant addition to the field, as it suggests a potential new mechanism for the cell to alter RNA surveillance efficiency.</p><p>In a previous study (Geng et al., Developmental Cell, 2012), we noticed that many genes that were differentially expressed following <italic>DUX4</italic> expression were involved in protein ubiquitination, including numerous E3 ubiquitin ligases. It is possible, for example, that UPF1 is a substrate of one of the many E3 ligases that are up-regulated in <italic>DUX4</italic>-expressing muscle cells. While we do hope to eventually determine how <italic>DUX4</italic> expression triggers UPF1 degradation, we feel that such assays are beyond the scope of this manuscript given the many different ways in which a transcription factor could indirectly influence UFP1 proteolysis. We briefly discuss this in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Other more specific points follow</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) Why is only a small fraction (13%) of predicted NMD targets affected by this mechanism?</italic></p><p>We agree that it is interesting that only a minority of premature stop codon-containing mRNAs exhibit increased levels following <italic>DUX4</italic> expression and concomitant NMD inhibition. This could be due to imperfect annotation of NMD substrates, differential sensitivity of different NMD substrates to reduced UPF1 levels, or other factors.</p><p>It is important to note that this 13% is quite high when compared to other studies where NMD has been inhibited genetically or with RNAi. For example, a recent study (McIlwain et al., PNAS, 2010) used a gene trap to generate mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking <italic>Smg1</italic>, which is responsible for UPF1 phosphorylation, a required step in NMD. McIlwain et al. then used RNA-seq to characterize the transcriptomes of <italic>Smg1</italic>-deficient cells, finding that “in the absence of <italic>Smg1</italic>, approximately 9% of predicted PTC-containing AS events displayed changes of more than 10%, and approximately 2% showed changes of more than 20%” (PTC = premature termination codon; AS = alternative splicing). Other studies conducted in worms, flies, and mammalian cells found that similarly small fractions of predicted NMD substrates were affected by depletion of core NMD factors.</p><p>Therefore, we agree that it is interesting that only 13% of predicted NMD substrates are up-regulated in <italic>DUX4</italic>-expressing cells. However, as this degree of up-regulation is comparable to that observed in previous studies where NMD was directly inhibited genetically, we believe that this 13% is a remarkably high fraction. We comment on this in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref><italic>: Can the authors explain the transient nature of the upregulation of the PTC-containing beta-globin NMD reporter? In the light of the proposed feedback loop, one would anticipate robust and enduring inhibition of NMD (as is observed for</italic> SRSF2 <italic>and</italic> SRSF3 <italic>transcripts;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2F</italic></xref><italic>) and thus the beta-globin PTC+ levels to remain elevated after 20 hours post transduction with the DUX4 expressing lentivirus</italic>.</p><p>As the reviewers point out, levels of the NMD(+) β-globin reporter increase at the same time (∼12 h following infection) as the endogenous <italic>SRSF2</italic> and <italic>SRSF3</italic> markers, but the NMD(+) β-globin reporter up-regulation does not last for the entire time course. This is surprising because (1) <italic>SRSF2</italic> and <italic>SRSF3</italic> NMD substrates exhibit increased levels throughout the time course, (2) UPF1 levels decrease monotonically throughout the time course, and (3) our RNA-seq data from MB135 and 54-1 cells was obtained at 24 hours and 48 hours time points, respectively, and both samples exhibited obvious global increases in NMD substrate levels. Therefore, while we are confident that NMD inhibition occurs throughout the time course, we are unsure why this enduring behavior is not reflected in the NMD(+) β-globin reporter. We are unaware of a previous study that has used this reporter to study the dynamics of NMD efficiency along a time course. For unclear reasons, such a plasmid-based reporter may be a more useful tool for measuring NMD efficiency in a static, rather than dynamic, context.</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref><italic>: The data points for the half-life measurement of DUX4 mRNA under siControl conditions scatter quite a lot; the authors should describe how they did the curve fitting. The conventional way would be to plot the RNA levels logarithmically and calculate the linear regression line through these data points</italic>. <italic>Furthermore, by limiting the time course to only 2 hours, the extrapolated half-life of 7.86 h in UPF1-depleted cells is most likely highly inaccurate. The time course should be expanded to 6 or 8 hours to get a more precise estimate of this half-life.</italic></p><p>To estimate the half-life of <italic>DUX4</italic> mRNA, we computed the best-fit exponential model using untransformed data, which is mathematically identical to the reviewers’ suggestion of computing a best-fit linear model for log-transformed data. We apologize for not explaining this half-life estimation procedure more clearly in the initial submission.</p><p>We agree that the data points exhibit substantial variation, particularly for the siControl treatment. Unfortunately, this high level of variability is an unavoidable consequence of <italic>DUX4</italic>’s variegated expression. Since <italic>DUX4</italic> is detectable in only 0.3% of nuclei by immunostaining for the siControl treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), <italic>DUX4</italic> mRNA levels are very low even in large cultures of FSHD cells. Estimates of <italic>DUX4</italic> mRNA levels therefore are noisy and become increasingly so following transcription shutoff.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that extrapolating a ∼8 hour half-life from a 2 hour time course is prone to substantial measurement error. We accordingly repeated the <italic>DUX4</italic> mRNA half-life measurement multiple times with a longer 8 hour time course. However, due to the aforementioned difficulty of accurately measuring <italic>DUX4</italic> mRNA following transcription shutoff even in a large culture of FSHD muscle cells, we were unfortunately unable to obtain reliable data from the longer time courses.</p><p>As the <italic>DUX4</italic> mRNA half-life measurement was not an essential component of the manuscript—since we provide multiple other sources of evidence that <italic>DUX4</italic> mRNA is a NMD substrate, due in part to its spliced 3' UTR—we have decided to remove the half-life data entirely from the revised manuscript. We agree with the reviewers that this data is noisy, and feel that it is a distraction from the otherwise clean data that we present here.</p></body></sub-article></article>
