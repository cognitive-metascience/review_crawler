are influenced by their regulation. For example, the functions of membrane arachidonate that are independent of a precursor role for eicosanoid synthesis remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the lack of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) leads to drastic reductions in membrane arachidonate levels, and that LPCAT3-deficient mice are neonatally lethal due to an extensive triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation and dysfunction in enterocytes. We found that high levels of PUFAs in membranes enable TGs to locally cluster in high density, and that this clustering promotes efficient TG transfer. We propose a model of local arachidonate enrichment by LPCAT3 to generate a distinct pool of TG in membranes, which is required for normal directionality of TG transfer and lipoprotein assembly in the liver and enterocytes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06328.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06328.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06328.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Membranes made of molecules called lipids surround every living cell and also form compartments inside the cell. There are hundreds of different lipid molecules that can be found in membranes. The amount of each type within the membrane can vary, which affects the flexibility and other physical properties of the membrane.</p><p>One type of lipid found in membranes is called arachidonic acid. It is involved in cell communication and other processes, and is required for young animals to grow and develop properly. An enzyme called LPCAT3 is thought to incorporate arachidonic acid into membranes, but this has not yet been proven to occur in living animals.</p><p>Here, Hashidate-Yoshida, Harayama et al. studied the role of LPCAT3 in newborn mice. The experiments show that this enzyme is found at high levels in the intestine and liver. Mice that lacked LPCAT3 had much lower levels of arachidonic acid compared with normal mice. These mice also showed signs of severe intestinal damage due to the build up of lipids from their mother's milk, and died within a few days of being born.</p><p>The mice that lacked LPCAT3 had different amounts of another type of lipid—called triacylglycerols—in their intestine and liver. Normally, these lipids would be assembled into larger molecules called lipoproteins that are released into the blood stream and used in the muscles and other parts of the body. However, Hashidate-Yoshida, Harayama et al. found that in the mice missing LPCAT3, the triacylglycerols did not get assembled into lipoproteins and so they accumulated inside the intestine and liver cells.</p><p>The experiments also show that high levels of arachidonic acid and other similar lipids in the membrane enable triacylglycerol molecules to cluster together, which increases the production of lipoproteins. Hashidate-Yoshida, Harayama et al.'s findings suggest that LPCAT3 incorporates arachidonic acid into the membrane of intestine and liver cells, which enables triacylglycerols to be assembled into lipoproteins. The next challenge will be to find out if LPCAT3 is also important for the production of lipoproteins in humans. If it is, then developing new therapies that alter the activity of this enzyme might be beneficial for patients with abnormal levels of lipids in the blood (known as dyslipidemia).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06328.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06328.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>arachidonic acid</kwd><kwd>phospholipid</kwd><kwd>lipoprotein</kwd><kwd>triacylglycerol</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24229003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shimizu</surname><given-names>Takao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Special Research grant 2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shimizu</surname><given-names>Takao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26460380</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shindou</surname><given-names>Hideo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26860202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hishikawa</surname><given-names>Daisuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26870879</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hashidate-Yoshida</surname><given-names>Tomomi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Center for Global Health and Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24-001,25-201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shimizu</surname><given-names>Takao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Center for Global Health and Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26A105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okamura</surname><given-names>Tadashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CREST</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shindou</surname><given-names>Hideo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>LPCAT3 incorporates arachidonic acid into membrane phospholipids, which promotes lipoprotein assembly by enabling triacylgylcerols to cluster in the membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have important biological functions in health and disease. They are related to cardiovascular diseases, neuronal functions, metabolic syndromes, and many other pathophysiological events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poudyal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiao et al., 2014</xref>). Phospholipids containing PUFAs render the membrane more flexible, which reduces the energy required for deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rawicz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pinot et al., 2014</xref>). Although PUFAs in phospholipids affect membrane physical properties, the biological significance related to these different properties remain unclear. A recent elegant study showed that PUFAs in phospholipids facilitate endocytosis by reducing the energy required for membrane deformation and fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pinot et al., 2014</xref>). However, the requirement for PUFAs in other biological processes accompanying membrane deformation has to be demonstrated.</p><p>Arachidonate (C20:4; indicative of a fatty acid of 20 carbons with four double bonds) is one of the most studied PUFAs, since it serves as a precursor for biologically active eicosanoids (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, etc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shimizu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Narumiya and Furuyashiki, 2011</xref>). The functions of membrane arachidonate that are not related to eicosanoid synthesis remain largely unknown. We reported previously that arachidonate in membrane phosphatidylcholine (PC) suppresses Akt signaling in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koeberle et al., 2013</xref>), but it is unknown whether this occurs in vivo. Studies of mice lacking lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase 1 revealed that a decrease in phosphatidylinositol (PI) arachidonate has deleterious effects in neuronal development, probably related to PI poly-phosphate dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2013</xref>). However, the in vivo functions of arachidonate in the most abundant membrane phospholipids such as PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), as well as its effect on membrane physical properties, remained to be solved.</p><p>We recently reported that the levels of several PUFAs (such as linoleate [C18:2] and docosahexaenoate [C22:6]) in PC are affected by the substrate selectivity of lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases (LPAATs) during de novo biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harayama et al., 2014</xref>), but arachidonate levels seem to be regulated in a different manner. Pioneering studies suggested that arachidonate is incorporated into phospholipids after de novo synthesis during the remodeling pathway (also termed Lands' cycle), which consists of a phospholipid deacylation–reacylation cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill and Lands, 1968</xref>). The reacylation is catalyzed by lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hishikawa et al., 2014</xref>), among which lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) is the strongest candidate to incorporate arachidonate into membranes, due to its substrate selectivity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gijón et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hishikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsuda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, knockdown of LPCAT3 by RNA interference reduced the levels of several arachidonate-containing PC species, but additional PUFA-containing PC species were differently affected between studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hishikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rong et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, it remains unclear whether LPCAT3 is specific for the regulation of arachidonate, or it has a broader impact on membrane PUFA levels. In addition, the biological functions of LPCAT3 and membrane arachidonate remain to be fully established, since residual activity of LPCAT3 might affect the overall results in RNA interference experiments.</p><p>Since PUFAs affect the bending rigidity of the membrane, it is possible that the regulation of phospholipid arachidonate has effects on membrane shape change. When triglycerides (TGs) are synthesized by diacylglycerol acyltransferases, they accumulate between the two leaflets of the lipid bilayer and deform the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thiam et al., 2013</xref>). Molecular dynamics simulation showed that TGs between leaflets generate a ‘blister-like’ shape, where the membrane on its surface is highly curved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khandelia et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the ability of the membrane to form curved structures might affect the properties of the TG pool between the leaflets. This pool serves as a precursor for cytosolic lipid droplets in most cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thiam et al., 2013</xref>). In hepatocytes and enterocytes, this pool is also used for transport by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen to generate lipoproteins and luminal lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sturley and Hussain, 2012</xref>). MTP transfers TGs to nascent apolipoprotein B (apoB) to form primordial lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abumrad and Davidson, 2012</xref>). MTP also transfers TGs to generate apoB-free lipid droplets in the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kulinski et al., 2002</xref>), which are required for TG enrichment in nascent lipoproteins. MTP deficiency in humans leads to an impaired absorption of dietary lipids, which is called abetalipoproteinemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wetterau et al., 1992</xref>). Therefore, the normal luminal transfer of TG is critical in vivo, but factor(s) and environment enabling an efficient transport by MTP remain poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yao et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, using LPCAT3-deficient cells and mice, we report that LPCAT3 is critical and relatively specific for the regulation of arachidonate levels in membrane phospholipids in vivo. In addition, we show that LPCAT3 regulates the directionality of TG transfer into lipoproteins, preventing the over-accumulation of cytosolic lipid droplets in hepatocytes and enterocytes. Additional analyses suggest that membrane PUFAs facilitate TG local clustering, which enables efficient transport by MTP. This study identifies LPCAT3 as a major regulator of membrane phospholipid arachidonate, which is a critical factor affecting luminal TG transport.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LPCAT3 selectively incorporates arachidonate in membrane phospholipids</title><p>To investigate whether the remodeling pathway contributes to arachidonate incorporation into phospholipids, we analyzed the enzymatic properties of LPCAT3. We first examined whether LPCAT3 regulates the acyl-chain composition of the major phospholipid PC. We established rat hepatoma RH 7777 cells that stably overexpress FLAG-tagged murine LPCAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Control cells had an LPCAT activity selective for linoleoyl- and arachidonoyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The overexpression of LPCAT3 doubled LPCAT activity without affecting acyl-CoA selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The acyl-chain composition of PC in LPCAT3-overexpressing cells was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Chromatograms of 38:4 PC (PC species containing 38 carbons and four double bonds as a sum of the two acyl-chains) revealed two isomers with different retention times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The levels of 36:4 PC and the later-eluting isomer of 38:4 PC, but not 34:2 PC, were increased in LPCAT3-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Additional selected reaction monitoring (SRM, see ‘Materials and methods’ for detail) analyses were performed to resolve the two acyl-chains, and showed that 34:2 PC, 36:4 PC, and the later-eluting isomer (peak 2) of 38:4 PC correspond to 16:0–18:2 PC, 16:0–20:4 PC, and 18:0–20:4 PC, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and data not shown).

We first examined the expression pattern of LPCAT3 at the late embryonic stages (between embryonic days 18.5 (E18.5) and E19.5). LPCAT3 mRNA was ubiquitously detected, with high expression in intestine, followed by liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), consistent with the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Intestinal LPCAT3 mRNA expression was strongly induced during the late developmental stages, while the changes in the liver were relatively small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To examine intestinal LPCAT3 expression more in detail, we divided the whole intestine into three parts: the proximal small intestine, where lipid absorption is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abumrad and Davidson, 2012</xref>), distal small intestine, and colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

We measured tissue PC levels and found a slight reduction in the proximal small intestine of LPCAT3-deficient mice, but not in other tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Next, we analyzed the changes in acyl-chain composition of phospholipids from tissues of LPCAT3-deficient mice. LC-SRM-MS lipidomics analysis of four phospholipid classes (PC, PE, phosphatidylserine (PS), and PI) was carried out. The total of signals from all the detected molecules were comparable between genotypes, and were used for normalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The slight reduction in the proximal small intestine of LPCAT3-deficient mice was consistent with the reduced PC amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To detect the global differences in PC, we analyzed the ratio (as % of wild type) for each PC species in individual tissues, and then averaged the ratio values from all tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This analysis enabled us to detect the most common changes that occur under LPCAT3 deficiency. The most decreased species were 34:4 PC, 36:4 PC, 36:5 PC, and 38:4 PC (shown in green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that the reduction in arachidonate levels is most prominent. These decreases occurred in almost all tissues analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). The changes in species that might contain linoleate (34:2 PC and 36:2 PC) were small or absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). On the other hand, the most increased PC species were 40:4 PC, 40:5 PC, 42:4 PC, and 42:5 PC (shown in magenta in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which might contain fatty acids that arise from arachidonate metabolism (carbon chain elongation, desaturation, and partial β-oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmitz and Ecker, 2008</xref>] [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,F,G</xref>]). To investigate the acyl-chain composition of the changed PC species (34:4 PC, 36:4 PC, 36:5 PC, 38:4 PC, 40:4 PC, 40:5 PC, 42:4 PC, and 42:5 PC), we performed SRM analyses of PC from the proximal small intestine, using transitions that discriminate fatty acids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Each PC subspecies did not have a single acyl-chain composition, but was a mixture of various combinations. Interestingly, most of arachidonate-containing species were decreased in LPCAT3-deficient mice, as well as some species containing C18 PUFAs (C18:2 and C18:3) and other C20 PUFAs (C20:3 and C20:5). On the other hand, PC species containing C22 PUFAs (C22:4 and C22:5) and C24 PUFAs (C24:4 and C24:5) were increased, suggesting that the excess of arachidonoyl-CoA caused by LPCAT3 deficiency increases its metabolism (such as elongation) into C22 and C24 PUFAs, which were then incorporated into PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmitz and Ecker, 2008</xref>).

Histological analysis of multiple tissues from mice at P1.5 was performed, and the most significant difference between wild type and LPCAT3-deficient mice was seen in the small intestine.

Massive lipid droplet accumulation was confirmed by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E–H</xref>).

Oil red O staining revealed that this region compensatorily absorbs lipids in LPCAT3-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), probably due to the inability to absorb them at the proximal small intestine. Similarly to the case of the embryonic liver, the accumulation of lipid droplets was not due to MTP deficiency, since the protein levels of MTP and PDI in proximal small intestine were normal in LPCAT3-deficient mice at E18.5–E19.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Also, we detected chylomicron-like particles in the Golgi apparatus of proximal small intestine enterocytes at P0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Although the mRNA level of MTP was decreased in proximal intestine of LPCAT3-deficient mice at P1.5, this was explained as a secondary event by the damage of enterocytes, since villin levels also decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2D,E</xref>). On the other hand, the mRNA level of MTP was increased in distal small intestines of LPCAT3-deficient mice at P1.5, being consistent with the acquisition of an absorptive phenotype as stated above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1 fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplements 1A,B, 2D,E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The assembly of TGs into lipoproteins is limited in LPCAT3-deficient mice</title><p>Enterocytes and hepatocytes with lipid droplet accumulation secrete neutral lipids into plasma as apoB-containing lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abumrad and Davidson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sturley and Hussain, 2012</xref>).

Therefore, we analyzed plasma lipids at various stages. We found that TG levels, but not apoB, cholesterol, or PC levels, are significantly decreased in plasma of LPCAT3-deficient mice at E18.5–E19.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A–D</xref>). Plasma lipids were further analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. TGs are usually detected in chylomicron or VLDL fractions in adult plasma. However, in our samples, the elution profiles of both TGs and cholesterol suggested an association with particles of an intermediate size between VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A–H</xref>). This is consistent with the elution profiles in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Straten et al., 2009</xref>), and thus is a characteristic of this neonatal period. Therefore, we will regard this ‘VLDL/IDL/LDL’ fraction as the lipoproteins secreted from the liver. TGs in the VLDL/IDL/LDL fraction decreased in LPCAT3-deficient mice at all periods analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). In contrast, cholesterol levels were not decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>).

Since the chylomicron lipid levels vary largely due to the difficulty to synchronize suckling behaviors, the differences did not reach statistical significance. Chylomicron cholesterol levels were not largely affected in LPCAT3-deficient mice at all periods examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>). Therefore, a reduction in TGs, but not in cholesterol, was observed commonly in lipoproteins secreted from both liver and small intestine. Based on this observation, we calculated the ratio between TGs and cholesterol in chylomicron and VLDL/IDL/LDL fractions at different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10I,J</xref>). In the chylomicron fraction, the TG/cholesterol ratio increased gradually after birth in wild type, but remained constant after P0.4 in LPCAT3-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10I</xref>). A similar trend was observed in the VLDL/IDL/LDL fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10J</xref>).

Therefore, the local enrichment of membrane PUFAs by LPCAT3 might facilitate the clustering of TGs and their transport by MTP.

Although multiple LPLATs have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hishikawa et al., 2014</xref>), we found that LPCAT3-deficient mice lack most of the activity required for the remodeling of PC, PE, and possibly PS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2G, 4F</xref>, and data not shown). The remodeling pathway has been thought to modify the acyl-chain composition of phospholipids synthesized de novo and to be especially important for PUFA accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill and Lands, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">MacDonald and Sprecher, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lands, 2000</xref>). Analyses of LPCAT3-deficient mice revealed complex changes in the lipidome, but among the major fatty acids, the most commonly decreased one was arachidonate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5">Figures 3–5</xref>). Our results show that the remodeling by LPCAT3 is highly selective for arachidonate accumulation and that many PUFA species persist in membranes of LPCAT3-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5">Figures 3–5</xref>). Therefore, the remodeling by LPCAT3 does indeed modulate the acyl-chain composition of de novo synthesized phospholipids, but is not completely requisite for PUFA accumulation. The observation that C22 and C24 n-6 PUFAs that arose after arachidonate elongation accumulate in LPCAT3-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) shows that this enzyme utilizes arachidonoyl-CoA competitively with other enzymes. C22 n-6 PUFAs increased not only in phospholipids but also in neutral lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Since TG and phospholipids share phosphatidic acid as the same precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coleman and Lee, 2004</xref>), this suggests that in LPCAT3-deficient mice, the C22 n-6 PUFA-CoAs are utilized by LPAATs during de novo synthesis, together with one part of the excess of arachidonoyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). The unchanged docosahexaenoate in neutral lipid fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) suggests that its increase in phospholipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) is not due to an accumulation by LPAATs, but rather suggests that docosahexaenoate-containing phospholipids were not utilized for acyl-chain remodeling in LPCAT3-deficient mice. Therefore, we propose that the increased n-6 C22 PUFAs and C24 PUFAs in phospholipids of LPCAT3-deficient mice are due to increased incorporation during de novo synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>), although we cannot exclude the possibility that unknown LPCAT enzymes selective for these PUFAs exist. In addition to the changes in phospholipid acyl-chain composition, LPCAT3 deficiency induced changes in LPC (in liver and small intestine) or total PC (in proximal small intestine) levels, but only in tissues where LPCAT3 expression is high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2B, 3A,H</xref>).

Therefore, the fatty acid profile of neutral lipids is suggestive of incorporation during de novo synthesis of both TG and phospholipids, assuming that TG has a negligible degree of acyl-chain remodeling.

(<bold>A</bold>) In wild type mice, arachidonoyl-CoA is largely utilized by LPCAT3 to be incorporated into phospholipids. (<bold>B</bold>) In LPCAT3-deficient mice, an excess of arachidonoyl-CoA occurs, which is utilized by LPAATs for de novo synthesis of both phospholipids and triglycerides, either directly or after being metabolized into C22 and C24 n-6 PUFAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This pathway is less utilized in wild type mice.

Even in tissues such as the brain and heart, where LPCAT3 expression is relatively small, arachidonate levels were prominently reduced in LPCAT3-deficient mice. Therefore, LPCAT3 is required for accumulating arachidonate, but the expression level of this enzyme is not the single factor to explain different arachidonate levels in tissues. Rather, the different levels should be explained by both LPCAT3 activity and supply of arachidonoyl-CoA, suggesting that tissue arachidonate levels are regulated in the remodeling pathway with dependence on substrate supply, as we recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harayama et al., 2014</xref>).

LPCAT3-deficient mice display similar lethality and enterocyte lipid accumulation, and have less TGs in plasma lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig9 fig10">Figures 8–10</xref>). Therefore, we attribute the lethality of LPCAT3-deficient mice to the intestinal lipotoxicity caused by the intake of large amounts of milk TG under MTP inefficiency. Indeed, enterocyte damage was obvious in LPCAT3-deficient mice, and probably resulted in an inability to absorb nutrients, not limited to sugars and lipids. One difference between LPCAT3-deficient mice and MTP-deficient mice is that the former assemble cholesterol normally in lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F,H</xref>). This suggests that LPCAT3 deficiency does not directly inhibit MTP, but may affect the properties of the MTP substrate TG. The quenching assay supports this, and one of these properties is the clustering of TG between leaflets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). It is of note that TG absorption is normal in LPCAT3-deficient mice at P0.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G</xref>). This suggests that the difference in transport efficiency is apparent only when TGs are in high amounts and require to be densely clustered in the membrane for efficient transport. Therefore, it is possible that cholesterol absorption is also affected when feeding a high cholesterol diet.</p><p>Comparison with reports of LPCAT3 knockdown in liver led us to focus on the synthesis of PUFA-containing phospholipids in a ‘local membrane microenvironment’. In a previous report, LPCAT3 knockdown did not impair TG transport, but rather increased VLDL secretion by the liver, due to the induction of MTP caused by increased LPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Despite this opposite result, the changes in the lipidome had similarities; LPC increased and arachidonate-containing PC decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rong et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, these similar changes cannot explain the impaired TG transport in LPCAT3-deficient mice. LPCAT3 is ideal to generate a local high PUFA concentration, since the enzyme is very selective for linoleoyl- and arachidonoyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig13">Figures 1B, 13A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hishikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, the enzyme catalyzing the last step of PC de novo synthesis, diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase (CPT) is not selective for diacylglycerol species containing PUFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mantel et al., 1993</xref>), and thus is unable to do the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13C</xref>). Therefore, local PUFA-rich domains arise continuously around LPCAT3 in wild type mice, but not in LPCAT3-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A</xref>). Residual LPCAT3 in knockdown experiments might be sufficient for this local PUFA enrichment. The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> suggest that if TG synthesis by diacylglycerol acyltransferases occurs in proximity of a local PUFA-rich domain, TG clustering will occur, providing a pool for efficient transport by MTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B</xref>). Although further studies are required for a complete understanding, the different results between the LPCAT3 knockdown study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rong et al., 2013</xref>) and our present study might be due to the ability to accumulate PUFAs locally. The observation that not only arachidonate but also docosahexaenoate promote TG clustering and transfer, as well as the fact that total PUFA levels are not largely changed in LPCAT3-deficient mice, again suggest the necessity of considering a local high concentration. In the presence of LPCAT3, PUFAs might be unevenly distributed in the membrane, and this should be required to reach a sufficient high PUFA concentration for efficient TG clustering and transfer. Therefore, although docosahexaenoate can substitute arachidonate in in vitro TG transfer assays, its inability to be locally concentrated by LPCAT3 make this fatty acid incompetent for lipoprotein assembly.</p><p>Other mouse models that have abnormal PUFA metabolism are mice that are deficient in fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1) or FADS2. These enzymes induce double bonds at different steps of PUFA generation, and mice lacking either gene encoding them could not synthesize arachidonate from linoleate. Knockout mice of both FADS1 and FADS2 have been generated, and displayed multiple abnormalities such as lethality, decreased intestinal crypt proliferation, and sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stoffel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stroud et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2012</xref>). However, the accumulation of intestinal lipid droplets was not reported. It is possible that these mice might receive enough arachidonate from breast milk during the lactating period, making it difficult to analyze intestinal arachidonate functions at the perinatal period. Indeed, most studies report abnormalities of FADS1/2-deficient mice after weaning. We speculate that LPCAT3 is required for intestinal TG absorption especially when TG levels in food are high, as is the case in milk. Therefore, it is intriguing to observe phenotypes by feeding these mice with high-fat diet. It is of note that lipid droplet accumulation in the liver is seen in FADS2-deficient mice, and that arachidonate feeding reverses this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stoffel et al., 2014</xref>), which may fit with our proposed model. It will be important to compare these different models in detail to unveil more functions of membrane PUFAs in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanism of TG clustering by local PUFA enrichment</title><p>The quenching assay shows that a PUFA-rich membrane enables a dense clustering of TGs. This composition may favor the deformation of the membrane surrounding TGs in a ‘blister-like’ morphology, with high local curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khandelia et al., 2010</xref>). When compared with a membrane rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, a PUFA-rich membrane is more easily deformed when it is bent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vanni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pinot et al., 2014</xref>). Based on this theory, it can be imagined that when TG synthesis occurs intensively, there is a demand to generate a highly curved blister-like structure to store more TGs in a limited place for efficient transport by MTP, and that a PUFA-rich environment generated by LPCAT3 helps this process by making the membrane more flexible and mobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>).</p><p>Our model suggests that one benefit of regulating acyl-chain composition is to adapt membrane flexibility to a required curvature. When we analyzed plasma lipoprotein PC, we detected many monounsaturated species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). This composition is similar to that reported for PC surrounding cytosolic lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tauchi-Sato et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, in the case of a membrane surrounding TGs with a large diameter, the composition is shifted to one with more monounsaturated species, which makes the membrane less flexible. This suggests that membranes surrounding TGs acquire acyl-chains that fit well with the curvature required.</p><p>It is unknown how the local clustering affects TG transfer. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that when TG is clustered, the efficiency of its flip-flop between leaflets is accelerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khandelia et al., 2010</xref>). Since MTP is present only in the luminal side of the bilayer, it is likely that the accelerated flip-flop enables TG to be present in the leaflet that is accessible by MTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B</xref>). Future studies would clarify how MTP is acting at the membrane interface to answer how membrane PUFAs enable efficient TG transfer.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions and perspective</title><p>In cases where many lipids are ingested (as in the neonatal period), the efficient export of TG is important not only for nutrition, but also to prevent lipotoxicity on enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xie et al., 2007</xref>). The generation of an arachidonate-enriched membrane microenvironment by LPCAT3 might be required for efficient clustering of TGs and their correct transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B</xref>). Previously, the functions of membrane arachidonate that are not related to eicosanoids were largely unknown. In addition, the mechanism and factors that enable MTP to efficiently transfer TGs unidirectionally into the ER lumen were poorly understood. Our study reveals for the first time that membrane arachidonate and TG clustering are critical factors to regulate the correct luminal directionality of TG transport, which has lethal consequences when improperly regulated. Therefore, the present study identifies LPCAT3 as a novel key molecule involved in normal lipoprotein assembly. During the final editing of the revised manuscript, Rong et al. reported LPCAT3-deficient mice with similar conclusions. In the future, conditional ablation of LPCAT3 in different contexts will reveal other functions of arachidonate in phospholipids and will provide further critical insights into membrane biology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression plasmids</title><p>Expression plasmids for FLAG-LPCAT3 and FLAG-LPCAT3 H374A were generated previously in a pCXN2 expression vector, which expresses the inserted construct under the control of a CAG promoter and contains a neomycin-resistance gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Niwa et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hishikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shindou et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Construction of single guide RNA expression vectors</title><p>The empty vector for the expression of single guide RNAs, pX459 was obtained from Addgene.

Fatty acid methyl esters were identified and quantified using a mixture of fatty acid methyl ester standards (Supelco 37 Component FAME Mix and DPA (n-3) from Sigma–Aldrich; DPA (n-6) from Nu-Chek Prep, Inc., Elysian, MN; DTA (n-6) from Cayman) for calibration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Lipid fractionation</title><p>Neutral lipids and phospholipids were separated by solid phase extraction using InertSep NH2 aminopropyl columns (GL Sciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Lipids were extracted using the method of Bligh and Dyer, dried in a centrifugal evaporator, dissolved in chloroform, and applied to the columns. Flow-through was collected and combined with the fraction eluted by chloroform:isopropanol (2:1 by volume) as the neutral lipid fraction. After the removal of free fatty acids by 2% acetic acid in diethyl ether, phospholipids were eluted using 2.8% ammonia in methanol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Measurement of eicosanoids</title><p>For quantification of eicosanoids, internal standards were spiked in methanol extracts, and samples were purified with solid phase extraction with an Oasis HLB column (Waters) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kita et al., 2005</xref>). Eicosanoids were quantified by a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer LCMS-8040 (Shimadzu). Separation was performed on a Kinetex C8 column (2.6 μm, 2.1 × 150 mm, Phenomenex) with a binary mobile phase of the following compositions: 0.1% formic acid/water (mobile phase A) and acetonitrile (mobile phase B). Pump gradient [time (%A/%B)] was programmed as follows: 0 min (90/10)–5 min (75/25)–10 min (65/35)–20 min (25/75)–20.1 min (5/95)–28 min (5/95)–28.1 min (90/10)–30 min (90/10). Flow rate was 0.4 ml/min and column temperature was 40°C. SRM transitions were: 369.3 → 245.2 for 6-keto-PGF<sub>1</sub>α, 373.3 → 249.2 for 6-keto-PGF<sub>1</sub>α-d4, 351.2 → 271.2 for PGE<sub>2</sub>, 355.2 → 275.2 for PGE<sub>2</sub>-d4, 319.2 → 219.2 for 15(<italic>S</italic>)-HETE, and 327.2 → 226.2 for 15(<italic>S</italic>)-HETE-d8. Signals were compared to those of standard curves for quantification as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kita et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Measurement of TG and cholesterol in plasma and tissue</title><p>Tissue lipids were obtained as described above in the lipid fractionation (before column separation). The dried lipid samples were dissolved in 5% Nonidet P-40 (Nacalai tesque), and heated at 95°C for 5 min followed by vortexing. This process was repeated to increase the solubility of neutral lipids. TG and cholesterol levels were measured using LabAssay Triglyceride Kit and LabAssay Cholesterol Kit (Wako), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Histological analysis of paraffin or frozen sections</title><p>Collected tissues were fixed using 10% neutral buffered formalin (Wako) or 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Wako) for 24 to 48 hr. After fixation, tissues were embedded in Tissue-Tek paraffin wax II 60 (Sakura Finetek Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and sectioned by a sliding microtome REM-700 (Yamato Kohki Industrial, Saitama Japan). Otherwise, tissues were embedded into NEG50 frozen section medium (Thermo Scientific), frozen, and sectioned by Cryostat CM3050 S (Leica Biosystems GmbH, Nussloch, Germany). The following dyes were used for staining the sections: hematoxylin (Wako)/eosin (Muto Pure Chemicals Co., LTD., Tokyo, Japan), Periodic acid-Schiff (Muto Pure Chemicals)/hematoxylin (Wako), or oil red O (Sigma–Aldrich)/hematoxylin (Vector).

Blood glucose was measured using the blood glucose meter Glutest Neo Super (Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho Co., Ltd., Aichi, Japan). Plasma insulin levels were measured using the ultra sensitive mouse insulin ELISA Kit (Morinaga Institute of Biological Science, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan). Plasma lipoproteins were analyzed using a lipoprotein profiling service, LipoSEARCH (Skylight Biotech Inc, Akita, Japan). This analysis consists of gel filtration chromatography followed by an on-line enzymatic method for simultaneous quantification of cholesterol, TG, and PC, according to the procedure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Usui et al. (2002)</xref> with slight modifications. The nomenclature of the fractions was based on the elution pattern of control plasma that was used for quality check. Glycogen content in liver was analyzed using Glycogen Colorimetric/Fluorometric Assay Kit (BioVision, Inc., Milpitas, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Lipoprotein precipitation</title><p>ApoB-containing lipoproteins were precipitated from pooled plasma (approximately 40 μl) using the LDL/VLDL and HDL Purification Kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Precipitated samples were used for apoB, TG, cholesterol, and PC measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Measurement of apoB</title><p>ApoB levels in plasma were measured by ELISA. Chicken monoclonal anti-apoB antibody (HUC20, Hiroshima Bio-Medical Co., Ltd., Hiroshima, Japan) was used for capture and rabbit anti-apoB antiserum (Abcam plc., Cambridge, UK) was used for detection. Capture antibody was coated on a Costar 96 well EIA/RIA Easy Wash Clear Flat Bottom High Binding Plate (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY) overnight at 4°C, and a blocking buffer (1× Reagent Diluent Concentrate 2, R&amp;D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) was plated to inhibit nonspecific binding for 2 hr at room temperature. All the following steps were performed at room temperature. Diluted samples were then added to the plate and incubated for 2 hr. Next, the detection antibody was incubated for 2 hr, followed by an incubation of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (GE Healthcare) for 2 hr. Wells were washed with PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 for three times after all the incubation steps. TMB (3, 3′, 5, 5′-tetramethylbenzidine, Kirkegaard &amp; Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) substrate was added to the plate, and the reaction was stopped with 2 N sulfuric acid (Nacalai tesque). Absorbance at 450 nm was measured on a plate reader ARVO X3, and absorbance at 544 nm was subtracted to normalize background. A standard curve was prepared with plasma from mice at E18.5–E19.5 for the relative quantification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>NBD-TG quenching assay</title><p>The quenching assay based on a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Athar et al., 2004</xref>). 180 nmol of PC (eggPC from Sigma–Aldrich, DPPC, POPC, PLPC, PAPC, and PDPC from Avanti) and 5.6 nmol of NBD-TG (Setareh Biotech, LLC, Eugene, OR) were mixed and dried in glass vials under a stream of nitrogen gas. Then, drying was completed in a centrifugal evaporator for 15 min. The dried lipid film was resuspended in 400 μl assay buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EDTA), freeze-thawed five times, and then filtered 21 times through a 50 nm pore size polycarbonate membrane (Nucleopore Track-Etch Membrane, GE Healthcare) using a mini-extruder (Avanti). The solution was centrifuged at 16,100×<italic>g</italic> (18°C, 10 min), and the supernatant was used as PC/NBD-TG vesicles. Fluorescence of vesicles was measured with a plate reader (ARVO X3) using 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission wavelengths. Total fluorescence was determined by adding 97 μl of isopropanol to 3 μl of vesicles. Quenching of NBD-TG was calculated as follows: % quenching = (total fluorescence—fluorescence of vesicles)/total fluorescence × 100. We noted that the TG to PC ratio largely affects the quenching efficiency, thus the optimal concentration (which is around 3% TG in our experience) might vary between vials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>Measurement of MTP activity</title><p>Approximately, 1 g of mouse liver was homogenized in 5 ml of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (1 mM Tris-HCl [pH7.4], 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> [Wako], and 1 mM EGTA [Sigma–Aldrich]) using a Potter-Elvehjem (Teflon/Glass) tissue grinder. After ultracentrifugation at 218,800×<italic>g</italic> (10°C, 1 hr), the supernatant was collected and used as an MTP source. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. The supernatant of boiled liver homogenate (95°C, 5 min) centrifuged at 16,100×<italic>g</italic> (18°C, 10 min) was used as a negative control. MTP assay was performed by a modification of previous methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atzel and Wetterau, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Athar et al., 2004</xref>). MTP activity was measured as the transfer of NBD-TG from donor to acceptor vesicles. PC/NBD-TG vesicles prepared for the quenching assay were used as donor vesicles. Acceptor vesicles were prepared with egg yolk PC (4.385 μmol) dried in glass vials under nitrogen gas stream and then under vacuum for 15 min. The dried PC was rehydrated in 500 μl of sucrose buffer (180 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EDTA), freeze-thawed five times, and then filtered 21 times through a 400 nm pore size polycarbonate membrane (Nucleopore Track-Etch Membrane, GE Healthcare) using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). Vesicles were diluted 10-fold in assay buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EDTA), pelleted at 16,100×<italic>g</italic> (18°C, 10 min), and washed with assay buffer. For each reaction, donor vesicles (containing 2.7 pmol of PC and 0.084 pmol of NBD-TG), acceptor vesicles (containing 43.5 pmol of PC), liver homogenate (100 μg), and 0.05 mg BSA (Sigma–Aldrich) were combined and adjusted to a total volume of 50 μl with assay buffer. Donor vesicle-free reactions were also prepared and used for blanks. The reactions were incubated in a Deep Well Maximizer incubator/mixer (Taitec Co., Ltd., Saitama, Japan) for 0 or 1 hr (60 rpm, 37°C) and then centrifuged at 16,100×<italic>g</italic> (18°C, 10 min). The supernatants (which contained the donor vesicles) were collected, and the acceptor vesicle-containing pellets were washed with 100 μl of assay buffer and then resuspended and collected in 10 μl of assay buffer. 100 μl of 10% assay buffer/90% isopropanol was applied to wash the tube walls and also collected. The collected supernatant and pellet fractions were diluted 10-fold with isopropanol and total fluorescence of supernatant (donor), pellet (acceptor), and tube wall washes were measured with a plate reader (ARVO X3) using 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission wavelengths. The fluorescence value of each fraction was corrected for background by subtracting blank well values. NBD-TG transfer was calculated by the differences in fluorescence between 0 and 1 hr incubation. Transfer was calculated as follows: % transfer = fluorescence of pellet fraction/(fluorescence of pellet + fluorescence of supernatant + fluorescence of tube wall wash) × 100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare two groups. Multiple comparisons were performed with Dunnett's multiple comparison tests, Tukey's multiple comparison tests, or Bonferroni's multiple comparison tests, depending on the combinations of comparisons, after one-way or two-way ANOVA. All analyses were done with GraphPad Prism 5 or 6 for Mac OS X software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful for the constructive comments of K Waku, S Narumiya, H Bito, K Ueki, H Okazaki, M Goto, S Takemoto-Kimura, M Matsumoto, T Dohi, and M Sakai.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Benjamin Cravatt (Reviewing editor); Charles Serhan (peer reviewer). A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers were uniformly in agreement that the manuscript reports significant findings that should be of broad interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. The conclusions are well-supported by the data. Both reviewers have provided some comments for the authors to consider in revision, which have been inserted below.</p><p>1) The role of membrane arachidonate in neurons was previously demonstrated (Mol Biol Cell. 2012 23(24):4689-700.; PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e58425). These papers should be properly referred, and the statement “the functions of membrane arachidonate that are not related to eicosanoid synthesis were unknown” in the Introduction and Discussion should be modified.</p><p>2) ∆6-Fatty acid desaturase (FADS2) converts linoleic acid (18:2n-6) to γ-linolenic (18:3n-6), and ∆5-fatty acid desaturase (FADS1) converts dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (20:3n-6) to AA. Both knockout mice cannot synthesize arachidonic acid and thus arachidonic acid-containing phosphatidylcholine. FADS2 knockout mice have been reported by two separate groups mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stoffel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stroud et al., 2009</xref>) The knockout mice show reduced content of PUFAs, including AA in tissues, and exhibit a variety of symptoms, including sterility, ulceration, and dermatitis. FADS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2012</xref>) knockout mice began to die gradually starting at 5-6 weeks of age, and show the perturbation in intestinal crypt proliferation and immune cell homeostasis etc. However, either study did not report the phenotype (i.e. accumulation of triacylglycerol in enterocytes). Is really arachidnoic acid-containing phospholipids is important for lipoprotein assembly in the enterocytes? These previous studies should be cited, and the discussion of apparent difference in the enterocyte abnormality between these knockout mice and the LPCAT3 knockout mice should be included. The possibility may exist that continuous remodeling of fatty acid chain is important rather than the amounts of arachidonic acid-containing phospholipids.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-H</xref>, the authors showed that LPCAT3 deficiency decreased the levels of 36:5 PC and 38:4 PE, while increased levels of 40:4 PC and 42:5 PC in the proximal small intestine. Which PUFA do these phospholipids contain? MS/MS analyses of these phospholipids should be performed to reveal acyl chain composition. The possibility that other acyltransferase(s) rather than LPCAT3 participates in the formation of 40:4 PC and 42:5 PC should also be discussed.</p><p>4) In Figure 4–figure supplement 2, the synthetic pathway of 22:5 is inappropriate. 22:5 is formed by partial β-oxidation of 24:5.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, PC with docosahexaenoate promoted TG quenching in liposomes and TG transfer in MTP assay as well as PC with arachidonate. This cannot explain the phenotype of LPCAT3-deficient mice in the proximal small intestine because the level of 22:6 was increased in compensation for the arachidonate decrease in the phospholipid fraction of the proximal small intestine of LPCAT3-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>).</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>, what is the mechanism of the TG transfer-promoting effect of PUFA-containing PC? If this is due to high surface curvature, does the diameter of donor liposomes affect TG transfer efficiency in the MTP assay?</p><p>7) In the MTP assay, are similar results observed if heavy donor liposomes and light acceptor liposomes are used?</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>, the authors showed that LPCAT3 deficiency increased LPC level in liver and small intestine. Is there any possibility that increased LPC level affects the clustering or transport of TG?</p><p>9) The experiments reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the authors discover that arachidonate levels are dramatically reduced in the LPCAT3-deficient mice, and importantly reached an increase in n-6 DPA (22:5) and AD (22:4 n-6) these are important observations the authors may choose to elaborate on this point on further in their discussion. Also, the increase in 22:6 n-3 in LPCAT3-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggests that the n-3 derived pro-resolving mediator pathways might be unregulated or enhanced with the production of resolvin and protectins in certain tissues in these mice, which the authors may choose to consider for their discussion.

These papers should be properly referred, and the statement “the functions of membrane arachidonate that are not related to eicosanoid synthesis were unknown” in the Introduction and Discussion should be modified</italic>.</p><p>We agreed to the comment, and added the appropriate references and modified the text with a modest and accurate expression in the Introduction.</p><p><italic>2) ∆6-Fatty acid desaturase (FADS2) converts linoleic acid (18:2n-6) to γ-linolenic (18:3n-6), and ∆5-fatty acid desaturase (FADS1) converts dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (20:3n-6) to AA. Both knockout mice cannot synthesize arachidonic acid and thus arachidonic acid-containing phosphatidylcholine. FADS2 knockout mice have been reported by two separate groups mice (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49"><italic>Stoffel et al., 2008</italic></xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50"><italic>Stroud et al., 2009</italic></xref><italic>) The knockout mice show reduced content of PUFAs, including AA in tissues, and exhibit a variety of symptoms, including sterility, ulceration, and dermatitis. FADS1 (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13"><italic>Fan et al., 2012</italic></xref><italic>) knockout mice began to die gradually starting at 5-6 weeks of age, and show the perturbation in intestinal crypt proliferation and immune cell homeostasis etc. However, either study did not report the phenotype (i.e. accumulation of triacylglycerol in enterocytes). Is really arachidnoic acid-containing phospholipids is important for lipoprotein assembly in the enterocytes? These previous studies should be cited, and the discussion of apparent difference in the enterocyte abnormality between these knockout mice and the LPCAT3 knockout mice should be included. The possibility may exist that continuous remodeling of fatty acid chain is important rather than the amounts of arachidonic acid-containing phospholipids</italic>.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, it would be interesting to compare the phenotypes of LPCAT3-deficient mice and FADS-deficient mice. It is important that in FADS-deficient mice, PUFA are provided from the breast milk, and the deficiency occurs only after weaning. Thus, the neonatal intestinal abnormalities might not be seen in FADS-deficient mice naturally. In addition, as intestinal lipid accumulation and enterocyte dysfunction occur only when high amounts of lipids are absorbed, it is possible that a high-fat diet might cause such abnormalities in FADS-deficient mice. In fact, lipid droplet accumulation in the liver has been reported in FADS2-deficient mice (Stoffel, 2008), which was rescued by arachidonate feeding. This observation appears consistent with our model. We also agree with the idea that continuous remodeling is important, as will be described below. These points are appropriately added in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C-H</italic></xref><italic>, the authors showed that LPCAT3 deficiency decreased the levels of 36:5 PC and 38:4 PE, while increased levels of 40:4 PC and 42:5 PC in the proximal small intestine. Which PUFA do these phospholipids contain? MS/MS analyses of these phospholipids should be performed to reveal acyl chain composition. The possibility that other acyltransferase(s) rather than LPCAT3 participates in the formation of 40:4 PC and 42:5 PC should also be discussed</italic>.</p><p>Since MS/MS analysis did not give sufficient signals for very minor species, we alternatively performed SRM analysis for selected PC and PE molecules, with selection of fatty acid fragments at Q3. In addition to those pointed out by the reviewer, we analyzed multiple PC and PE species with changed levels to be more complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C and 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1 tbl2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>). This revealed that these species are a combination of various isobaric species. Interestingly, this analysis revealed that the changes have different trends depending on the fatty acid composition, with phospholipids containing C20 PUFAs decreased, and those containing C22 or C24 PUFAs increased.</p><p>In answer to the second point, we show that in liver neutral lipid fractions (which reflect fatty acids incorporated during de novo synthesis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), the C22 PUFAs are increased. This strongly suggests that the increased C22 PUFAs were used by LPAATs during de novo synthesis, which explains the increased species such as 40:4 PC and 42:5 PC. We cannot exclude the possibility that other unknown LPCATs in the remodeling pathway have also incorporated these C22 PUFAs in PC and PE, although this sounds unlikely since most LPCAT and LPEAT activity is absent in LPCAT3-deficient mice. The SRM data is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1 tbl2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>, and an explanation of the formation of species such as 40:4 PC is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) In Figure 4–figure supplement 2, the synthetic pathway of 22:5 is inappropriate. 22:5 is formed by partial β-oxidation of 24:5</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out our mistake, which was adjusted in the revised manuscript. We moved the figure to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>, since it appears earlier, related to the new table in response to comment 3.</p><p><italic>5) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10"><italic>Figure 10</italic></xref><italic>, PC with docosahexaenoate promoted TG quenching in liposomes and TG transfer in MTP assay as well as PC with arachidonate. This cannot explain the phenotype of LPCAT3-deficient mice in the proximal small intestine because the level of 22:6 was increased in compensation for the arachidonate decrease in the phospholipid fraction of the proximal small intestine of LPCAT3-deficient mice (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8I</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>This is an important point of this study. This observation led us to propose the model of the “local accumulation” of PUFA-containing phospholipids caused by the continuous remodeling by LPCAT3. Since this concept might be difficult for broad readers to understand in plain text, we added a figure explaining this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A</xref>). We think that 22:6 (and also the other C22 PUFAs increased in LPCAT3-deficient mice) cannot compensate arachidonate, since they cannot accumulate locally and do not reach a sufficient concentration to promote TG transfer in lipoproteins.</p><p><italic>6) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10"><italic>Figure 10F</italic></xref><italic>, what is the mechanism of the TG transfer-promoting effect of PUFA-containing PC? If this is due to high surface curvature, does the diameter of donor liposomes affect TG transfer efficiency in the MTP assay</italic>?</p><p>This issue remains unclear and needs to be clarified in the future studies. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that local clustering promotes flip-flop of TG (Khandelia et al.). Therefore, we speculate that PUFA-containing PC promotes the clustering of TG (as shown by the quenching assay) and that the high flip-flop rate enables efficient TG transfer since MTP should have access for TG only in the luminal leaflet. Therefore the surface curvature might not necessarily be involved in transfer by, but rather in TG clustering. Indeed, although we analyzed TG quenching and transfer using liposomes of different diameters using different pore size filters (30-100 nm), we found no difference with statistical significance. However, we know empirically that pressure during liposome extrusion might affect NBD-TG quenching and that extrusion pressure changes depending on the filter pore size. Therefore, two factors (diameter and pressure) are changed in the experimental design, making it difficult to draw a precise conclusion, and we prefer not to include this data in the manuscript. In addition, it is also difficult to know how liposome diameter affects local curvature on the surface of clustered TG.</p><p><italic>7) In the MTP assay, are similar results observed if heavy donor liposomes and light acceptor liposomes are used</italic>?</p><p>According to the suggestion by the reviewer, we tried the experiment, but found problems in the experimental design. To enable heavy liposomes to be pelleted down during centrifugation, we needed a filter size of 400 nm in minimum. It is known that under these conditions, liposomes are multilamellar, which are inadequate as donors since only the outermost layer can provide TG. As expected, we could not observe TG transfer when using these multilamellar heavy donors. Unfortunately, this made it impossible to compare heavy donors with different PC composition.</p><p><italic>8) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3L</italic></xref><italic>, the authors showed that LPCAT3 deficiency increased LPC level in liver and small intestine. Is there any possibility that increased LPC level affects the clustering or transport of TG</italic>?</p><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we analyzed the effect of LPC on TG clustering and transport. We could not observe any difference when using up to 5% of LPC mixed with egg PC. We described it in the text under the subsection headed “Membrane PUFAs enable efficient clustering and transport of TGs”.</p><p><italic>9) The experiments reported in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4A</italic></xref><italic>, the authors discover that arachidonate levels are dramatically reduced in the LPCAT3-deficient mice, and importantly reached an increase in n-6 DPA (22:5) and AD (22:4 n-6) these are important observations the authors may choose to elaborate on this point on further in their discussion. Also, the increase in 22:6 n-3 in LPCAT3-deficient mice (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>) suggests that the n-3 derived pro-resolving mediator pathways might be unregulated or enhanced with the production of resolvin and protectins in certain tissues in these mice, which the authors may choose to consider for their discussion. This might be relevant in tissue inflammation and its resolution</italic>.</p><p>We added discussion about how these increased C22 PUFAs are incorporated into phospholipids. In addition, we added discussion about n-3 derived pro-resolving mediators and 18:2-derived lipid mediators. Since it is important that in contrast to the decreases in arachidonate, the changes in 18:2 and 22:6 are seen only in a subset of tissues, we added figures of GC-FID data showing the changes in these fatty acids to avoid misleading of the readers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B and 5C</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
