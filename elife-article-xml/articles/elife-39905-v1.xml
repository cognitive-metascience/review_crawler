involved. Here, we performed proteomic, transcriptomic, and electron microscopic analyses to demonstrate that mast cells are aberrantly activated in human and murine osteoarthritic joint tissues. Using genetic models of mast cell deficiency, we demonstrate that lack of mast cells attenuates osteoarthritis in mice. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we show that the IgE/FcεRI/Syk signaling axis is critical for the development of osteoarthritis. We find that mast cell-derived tryptase induces inflammation, chondrocyte apoptosis, and cartilage breakdown. Our findings demonstrate a central role for IgE-dependent mast cell activation in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis, suggesting that targeting mast cells could provide therapeutic benefit in human osteoarthritis.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

characterized by progressive degeneration of articular cartilage in the joints, is a major cause of disability and the most common form of arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felson, 2006</xref>). Current treatment approaches are limited to pain reduction and joint replacement, highlighting the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chevalier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wieland et al., 2005</xref>). While low-grade synovial inflammation is a widely recognized feature of osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atukorala et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hill et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Robinson and Mao, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sellam and Berenbaum, 2010</xref>), the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are not fully defined. Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulated activation of innate immunity involving macrophages and mast cells are likely involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Lange-Brokaar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kraus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu-Bryan and Terkeltaub, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raghu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Mast cells are sentinels of the innate immune system, poised to rapidly respond to exogenous pathogens and to endogenous danger signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bischoff, 2007</xref>). A wide variety of stimuli (e.g., allergens that cross-link IgE-bound high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) or antibodies that directly cross-link FcεRI, cytokines such as IL-33, complement anaphylatoxins, immune complexes, neuropeptides, TLR ligands, etc.) can influence mast cell degranulation and release of pre-formed mediators including histamine, tryptases, pro-inflammatory lipids, cytokines and chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Theoharides et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, different activation stimuli are capable of inducing distinct mast cell responses in both physiological and pathological settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enoksson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaudenzio et al., 2016</xref>). In allergic disease—a setting in which mast cells have been most extensively studied—these mediators promote chronic allergic inflammation which, if sustained, results in long-term tissue damage, fibrosis, and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galli and Tsai, 2012</xref>). Similar to the tissue remodeling in allergic diseases, human osteoarthritis and experimental osteoarthritis in rodents are characterized by abnormal and progressive bone and other tissue remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Remst et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have documented the presence of mast cells and their mediators in the synovium and synovial fluids of individuals with osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dean et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, it was reported that synovial mast cell numbers and degranulation status correlate positively with increased synovitis and cartilage damage in patients with knee osteoarthritis, suggesting that mast cells might contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Lange-Brokaar et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, the precise role of mast cells in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis has not been defined.

We compared tryptase levels in the synovial fluids from individuals with osteoarthritis with those from non-osteoarthritis controls with prior joint trauma &gt;6 months prior to sample collection but no radiographic osteoarthritis. Using Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNA-based quantification, we found significantly elevated levels of catalytically active tryptase in synovial fluids from individuals with osteoarthritis as compared to non-osteoarthritis controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We also directly visualized mast cell degranulation in osteoarthritis by performing immuno-electron microscopy on synovial tissue sections stained with gold particle-labeled anti-tryptase antibody. Mast cells exhibiting features including tryptase-containing granule matrices located outside of the plasma membrane and/or fusion of granule and plasma membranes were identified as actively degranulating or degranulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We found significantly increased percentages of degranulated mast cells in osteoarthritic synovial linings compared to those from non-osteoarthritic joints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Immuno-electron microscopy of these sections with a gold-labeled isotype-matched control antibody did not result in positive staining of mast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming the specificity of the anti-tryptase staining of mast cells.

Mast cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various non-allergic, chronic, inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Theoharides et al., 2012</xref>) including the etiologically-distinct inflammatory arthritides, including rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2002</xref>) and gouty arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reber et al., 2014</xref>). While it has been shown that mast cells and their mediators (e.g., histamine and tryptases) are present in osteoarthritic synovial tissue and fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckley et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dean et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakano et al., 2007</xref>) and that their numbers in osteoarthritic synovial tissue correlate with structural damage in knee osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Lange-Brokaar et al., 2016</xref>), their direct participation, mode of activation, and mechanisms by which they contribute to pathogenesis have not previously been shown. Here, we show that the activation and degranulation of mast cells via the IgE/FcεRI/Syk axis mediates inflammation and tissue damage in osteoarthritis, at least in part through mast cell-derived tryptase. Further, we demonstrate that pharmacologic interventions targeting mast cells at multiple levels reduce the severity of osteoarthritis in mice, including inhibition of (i) the mast cell growth factor receptor c-kit using imatinib (ii) mast cell-derived tryptases using APC366, (iii) IgE-mediated FcεRI-engagement through depletion of IgE, and (iv) FcεRI signaling by inhibiting its downstream signaling molecule Syk.</p><p>We demonstrate that the IgE/FcεRI/Syk signaling axis contributes to inflammation and cartilage damage in murine osteoarthritis. Given previous reports have shown that mast cells obtained from osteoarthritic synovial tissues express activating FcRs (e.g., FcγRI) as well as FcεRI at levels similar to those seen in rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), we propose a model wherein the IgE/FcεRI/Syk signaling axis in mast cells potentiates chronic inflammation in osteoarthritis.</p><p>While it is well documented that IgE is critical for initiating and sustaining chronic allergic inflammation, emerging evidence suggests that IgE-mediated cellular activation directly contributes to tissue remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galli and Tsai, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roth et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, therapeutic strategies targeting IgE, such as omalizumab, reduce airway and tissue remodeling in allergic inflammatory conditions including as asthma and atopic dermatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oettgen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Strunk and Bloomberg, 2006</xref>). Similar to the tissue remodeling in allergic diseases, human and murine osteoarthritis are characterized by abnormal and progressive bone and other tissue remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Remst et al., 2014</xref>) which result in altered joint biomechanics that further promote development of osteoarthritis. Phosphorylation of Syk is a critical downstream signaling event for the transmission of IgE/FcεRI signals. Here, we demonstrate that pharmacologic depletion of IgE, or blockade of IgE-mediated FcεRI signaling using a Syk inhibitor, reduce bone remodeling (as measured by osteophyte formation) and disease severity in the DMM murine model of osteoarthritis. Together, these findings strongly implicate IgE-mediated mast cell activation in bone and synovial tissue remodeling in osteoarthritis.</p><p>Previous reports found that IgE levels are not elevated in the synovial fluids of osteoarthritic joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hunder and Gleich, 1974</xref>), and in preliminary studies we observed only trends towards an association of increased total IgE in serum with osteoarthritis in humans. It remains possible that antigen-specific IgE contributes to mast cell activation in osteoarthritis, and future studies will be needed to further investigate the relative contributions of antigen-specific IgE-dependent and other mechanisms of mast cell activation in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.</p><p>While many classical IgE-mediated allergic diseases including asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema exhibit comorbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pedersen and Weeke, 1983</xref>), we are not aware of evidence of a clear link between osteoarthritis and allergic diseases. There is significant evidence that these classic allergic diseases are caused by antigen-specific IgE-dependent activation of mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galli and Tsai, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamelmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oettgen and Geha, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van der Heijden et al., 1993</xref>). If the role of mast cells in osteoarthritis pathogenesis is dependent on antigen-specific IgE, the target antigens could potentially be exogenous allergens. Another possibility is that in osteoarthritis the IgE target antigens are bone or cartilage breakdown products that give rise to neoantigens following joint injury or instability. Although we are not aware of evidence that osteoarthritis is associated with classic allergic and/or IgE-dependent diseases, an epidemiological analysis that addresses this important question is warranted. Antigen-specific antibody responses can also be generated in autoimmune responses, however osteoarthritic synovial linings do not exhibit histologic features consistent with an adaptive autoimmune response and we do not believe our findings suggest the presence of an classical adaptive autoimmune response. Future studies are needed to determine if IgE targets specific antigens, and to further characterize the role of IgE in osteoarthritis.</p><p>Mechanical instability and stresses likely contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis in a significant subset of patients. We do not believe that a role for mechanical stresses is inconsistent with a role for IgE and mast cells, and it is possible that mechanical stresses produce cartilage breakdown products and/or cellular responses that promote IgE-dependent mast cell activation.</p><p>In addition to IgE-mediated activation of mast cells, a wide range of physical, biological, and chemical triggers can contribute to mast cell activation, including products of complement activation, platelet-activating factor, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and a number of endogenous peptides (e.g., vasoactive intestinal polypeptide [VIP], and substance P [SP]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galli and Tsai, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaudenzio et al., 2016</xref>). We previously demonstrated that complement plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lepus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Activation of the complement system results in the production of C3a and C5a which serve as anaphylatoxins and activators of mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erdei et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaudenzio et al., 2016</xref>). It is therefore possible that complement, in addition to Fc(ε)RI, regulates the recruitment and activation of mast cells in the synovium to promote the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. We previously demonstrated that the cartilage breakdown product, fibromodulin, can activate the complement system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), and it is possible that mast cell tryptase-mediated cartilage degeneration produces fibromodulin and other cartilage breakdown products that reciprocally activate complement in the synovia in osteoarthritis. It will be important to define the temporal relationship between mast cell activation/degranulation and complement activation in the development and progression of osteoarthritis, including how activation of one affects the other and vice versa. Further, complement is capable of stimulating mast cells alone, and can also enhance IgE-dependent mast cell activation and degranulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schäfer et al., 2013</xref>). Future studies will be needed to further define the roles and relationships of complement activation, IgE, and mast cell activation/degranulation in the development and progression of osteoarthritis.</p><p>The development and survival of mast cells is critically dependent on signaling via the stem cell factor (SCF) receptor c-kit (CD117), a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family. While c-kit is widely expressed by hematopoietic progenitor and germ cells, in the context of the mature immune system only mast cells robustly express c-kit, and in the synovial compartment c-kit is predominantly expressed by mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ceponis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galli et al., 1993</xref>). Imatinib mesylate, an orally available small molecule with potent and selective inhibitory activity against several tyrosine kinases, including Abl, c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, has been shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production from mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paniagua et al., 2006</xref>) and to promote apoptosis of mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Juurikivi et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, long-term treatment with imatinib induced severe mast cell deficiency and reduced serum tryptase levels without inducing adverse effects in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cerny-Reiterer et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that imatinib suppresses mast cell production and/or survival. Treatment of severe asthmatics with imatinib for 6 months also reduced mast cell numbers, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and tryptase levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cahill et al., 2017</xref>). Further, it has been previously reported that imatinib reduces the development and severity of arthritis in two distinct mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koyama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paniagua et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we show that treatment with imatinib, reduces numbers of synovial tryptase-expressing mast cells in mouse knees and attenuates murine osteoarthritis. Indeed, imatinib may play a broader role in mitigating the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis as it can influence pro-inflammatory responses via receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition on cell types including macrophages, B cells, and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paniagua et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zitvogel et al., 2016</xref>). However, as shown here, attenuation of mast cell responses is likely responsible, at least in part, for the effectiveness of imatinib in preventing the development of osteoarthritis in mice.</p><p>Mast cells could participate in osteoarthritis through multiple mechanisms, including release of pre-formed mediators such as tryptases and de novo synthesis of cytokines that could further propagate inflammation, promoting a vicious cycle of inflammation and tissue damage. Because we found high levels of active tryptase in osteoarthritic synovial fluids and previous studies have shown tryptases can induce cartilage aggrecanolysis in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Magarinos et al., 2013</xref>), and promote inflammatory responses in mouse models of autoimmune arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McNeil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shin et al., 2009</xref>), we investigated the mechanisms by which tryptases could directly influence osteoarthritis-associated pathogenic processes. Our data suggest that mast cell-derived tryptases promote cartilage degeneration, support synovial fibroblast proliferation and release of pro-inflammatory and degradative mediators from joint tissues. Importantly, we demonstrate that inhibition of tryptase activity using the tryptase-specific inhibitor APC366 attenuates osteoarthritis in mice. Tryptases are natural agonists of proteinase activated receptor-2 (PAR2), which is expressed by a wide variety of cells including osteoarthritis synovial fibroblasts. Importantly, PAR2 deficiency significantly attenuates the development and severity of osteoarthritis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huesa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable but remains to be formally tested that tryptase signaling via PAR2 promotes inflammatory and degradative responses in osteoarthritis.</p><p>Although we have not formally demonstrated that mast cells are the source of tryptases that promote the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis, our data demonstrate that: (i) mast cells comprise 1–3% of synovial cells in synovial linings from both osteoarthritic joints and joints with prior injury but no radiographic osteoarthritis, (ii) mast cells are actively degranulating to release tryptase in human osteoarthritic synovial linings, and (iii) pharmacologic inhibition of typtase prevents the development of osteoarthritis in mice. However, mast cells are the predominant producer of tryptases, and to a much lesser extent basophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schwartz, 2006</xref>). Together, these data suggest that mast cells are the predominant cellular source of tryptase in human and murine osteoarthritis.</p><p>There are multiple potential limitations to this study. First, it was previously shown that mast cells are associated with joint pain in murine osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sousa-Valente et al., 2018</xref>) and that synovial mast cell numbers are associated with the degree of synovitis in human osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Lange-Brokaar et al., 2016</xref>). We and others previously demonstrated that following DMM in mice development of histologic osteoarthritis is associated with poor functional outcomes including pain and abnormal gait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huesa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). The studies presented in this manuscript demonstrate that mast cells and dysregulated mast cell activation contribute to cartilage and joint degeneration following DMM, and based on this prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huesa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2011</xref>) such pathologic changes are anticipated to result in pain and abnormal gait. Future studies will be needed to further characterize the role of mast cells in osteoarthritis-associated pain and joint dysfunction. Second, while our findings demonstrate a critical role for mast cells, mast cell activation pathways, and the mast cell product tryptase in the development of osteoarthritis following DMM, further investigation is needed to characterize the relationship between IgE-mediated mast cell activation and the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteases implicated in synovitis and cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis. Additionally, demonstration in vivo that IgE/Syk signaling is associated with increased tryptase production would further strengthen our findings.</p><p>Together, our results demonstrate that IgE/FcεRI/Syk axis-activated mast cells promote the development of osteoarthritis following mechanical injury (DMM) in mice. As the DMM model is most representative of osteoarthritis development following traumatic joint injury (PTOA) in humans, these findings suggest that PTOA arises as result of activation of the IgE/FcεRI/Syk axis. It is possible that non-traumatic osteoarthritis, calcium pyrophosphate crystal-associated osteoarthritis, or other subsets of osteoarthritis may arise from activation of other molecular pathways.</p><p>We propose a model wherein IgE-mediated mast cell activation via FcεRI and Syk which results in mast cell degranulation and the release of pro-inflammatory and degradative mediators, including tryptase, leads to cartilage and joint breakdown. This results in a vicious cycle of tissue damage, inflammation, and unchecked mast cell activation, and thus causes the development and progression of osteoarthritis. Our findings demonstrate a central role for IgE-mediated mast cell activation in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis, and provide the rationale for targeting mast cells or tryptase as a disease-modifying therapeutic strategy for osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"> Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (M. musculus)</td><td valign="top">Kit<sup>W-sh/W-sh</sup></td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock No. 012861</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (M. musculus)</td><td valign="top">Cpa3-Cre;Mcl-1<sup>fl/fl</sup></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lilla et al., 2011</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Dr. Stephen Galli (Stanford University)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (M. musculus)</td><td valign="top">Cpa3-Cre;Mcl-1<sup>+/+</sup></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lilla et al., 2011</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Dr. Stephen Galli (Stanford University)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (M. musculus)</td><td valign="top">Fcer1a<sup>-/-</sup></td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock No.10512</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (M. musculus)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock No. 000664</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Mast Cell Tryptase antibody</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">catalog #:ab2378 clone: AA1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse IgG1, kappa Isotype Control</td><td valign="top">Crown Biosciences</td><td valign="top">catalog #: c0005</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) Antibody</td><td valign="top">Cell signaling</td><td valign="top">catalog #: 9101</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) Antibody</td><td valign="top">Cell signaling</td><td valign="top">catalog #: 4695</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-beta actin antibody</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">catalog #: Ab8227</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Mast Cell Degranulation Assay Kit,</td><td valign="top">Millipore</td><td valign="top">catalog #: IMM001</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">imatinib mesylate</td><td valign="top">LC Laboratories</td><td valign="top">catalog #: I-5508</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">APC366</td><td valign="top">Tocris</td><td valign="top">catalog #: 2511</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">PRT062607</td><td valign="top">Synnovator</td><td valign="top">catalog #: 1370261-97-4</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human samples</title><p>All human samples were obtained and studied under protocols that included written informed consent and consent to publish and that were approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board (IRB) (approval #3780) and the University of Padova IRB (approval #39872).

The number of mast cells and degranulated mast cells was determined by an examiner blinded to the experimental group of each sample. Mast cells were identified based on the presence of electron dense granules containing gold-labelled tryptase particles. Degranulation was determined by assessment of fusion of granule plasma membranes, fusion of granule membranes with cell membranes, exteriorization of granules, and presence of tryptase particles outside the exteriorized granule. The percent of degranulating mast cells per total mast cells was calculated for each sample.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has highlighted the concerns that require revision and/or responses, and we have included the separate reviews below for your consideration. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Based on the findings that abnormally degranulated mast cells exist in murine osteoarthritis (OA), in this manuscript, authors have tried to clarify how the mast cell participates in OA. They presented evidence for involvement of IgE-FceRI-Syk axis in experimental OA in mice.

In this manuscript, the authors found abnormally degranulated mast cells in human and murine osteoarthritic joint tissue. Disruption of IgE/FceRI/Syk signaling axis ameliorated development of osteoarthritis. This signaling, along with histamine-releasing factor (HFR) promoted releases of tryptases from mast cell and induced inflammation and cartilage destruction in synovial tissues. Therefore, the authors concluded that the aberrant mast cell activation is critical for pathogenesis of OA. Despite potential importance of mast cell in OA, the present study has several concerns.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>In general, OA is induced by long lasting mechanical stresses and can be accompanied by chronic inflammation, whereas IgE mediates antigen-specific acute and drastic inflammatory responses in allergic diseases. Therefore, the authors need to provide very careful experimental data to show that IgE-mediated immune responses are implicated in OA pathogenesis and induction of chronic inflammation that accompanies OA. Also, antigen specificity of the IgE involved in the pathogenesis of OA is unclear. Thus, the authors have to give convincing explanation by clarifying the mechanism by which mechanical stress induces IgE production, and identifying the antigen specificity of the IgE.</p><p>1) If IgE is implicated in the pathogenesis of OA, diseases related to high level of IgE (asthma, atopic dermatitis, hay fever etc.) should be associated with the onset and severity of OA. Therefore, the authors should provide epidemiological evidence on this point.</p><p>2) A mechanical damage induced OA model does not always reflect all the features of human OA. To propose the surprising concept like IgE involvement, one model of OA is not sufficient. The authors should verify the observation as described in the manuscript by another OA model.</p><p>3) The quality of electron microscopy is too poor to distinguish the mast cell granules. The authors should provide better quality immune-electron microscopic images as shown in Figure 1.</p><p>4) The quantification of the infiltrated mast cells is only based on the unclear images (Figure 1). Likewise, mast cell quantification in destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)-induced mice were also determined by histological analysis in Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and is not performed in Figure 3, 4 and 5. The authors have to quantify the number of mast cells infiltrated into synovial tissues regarding patient with OA in Figure 1 and DMM-induce mice in Figure 2—figure supplement 3, Figure 3, 4 and 5 by use of FACS. In addition, morphology of the FACS-sorted mast cells from synovial tissues must be examined by appropriate staining.</p><p>5) It also remains unclear whether DMM induces accumulation of mast cell at the synovial tissues. The author should compare the number of synovial mast cells in the DMM-induced mice with those of sham operation.</p><p>6) The results shown in Figure 3 are not enough to support authors' conclusion because the experiment in which human cartilage explants are cultured in the presence of recombinant tryptase is too artificial. To prove whether the mast cell derived tryptases destroy synovial cartilage, the authors have to culture human cartilage explants with mast cells and examine the all parameters as shown in Figure 3 A-F as well as soluble glycosaminoglycans.</p><p>7) There is no evidence whether the mast cell derived tryptases are involved in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, proteases expression, fibroblast proliferation and soluble glycosaminoglycans in vivo. The authors have to check whether mast cell deficiency and APC366 administration reduce the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, proteases expression, fibroblast proliferation and soluble glycosaminoglycans in the synovial tissues under the DMM-induced condition.</p><p>8) The authors should show the evidence that chondrocyte undergoes apoptosis.</p><p>9) There is no evidence as to whether disruption of the IgE/FceRI/Syk signaling suppresses tryptases production in vivo. The authors have to measure the tryptase activity and soluble glycosaminoglycans in the synovial fluids in Figure 4 and 5.</p><p>10) The author must examine whether DMM induces increases in IgE concentration in synovial fluids in comparison to those of sham operation. If so, is it sufficient to stimulate synovial mast cells?</p><p>11) The authors must examine whether the DMM-induced cartilage destruction as well as the related signatures (proinflammatory cytokines, proteases expression, fibroblast proliferation and soluble glycosaminoglycans) are canceled in the Cpa3-Cre Syk-flox mice.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the revised manuscript, entitled &quot;IgE-mediated mast cell activation promotes inflammation and cartilage destruction in osteoarthritis&quot;.

Moreover, the authors carefully mentioned, for instance, &quot;using genetic and pharmacological approaches&quot; in the Abstract.</p><p>Please address the minor concerns of Reviewer #2 outlined below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors have answered a good part of the concerns of the reviewers.

The authors corrected some statements in the revised manuscript. However, as I mentioned below, the fundamental problems of this manuscript have not yet been solved. In addition, they did not perform additional experiments to strengthen their conclusion.</p><p>The authors showed that bulk IgE level in serum has no correlation with severity of osteoarthritis. ELISA analysis also demonstrated that synovial fluid IgE level in patients with OA was lower than that of patients with RA and PsA. (In addition, the ELISA analysis lacks appropriate controls such as healthy control.) These results made me feel that it is very unlikely that IgE is related to development of OA. The authors also referred to the possibility that antigen specificity of IgE rather than the amount of IgE may be involved in development of OA by showing the preliminary data. However, the data are too preliminary to convince us of the surprising finding that OA is an autoimmune disease caused by IgE against join antigen(s) and mast cells. The proposed mechanism is not well based on evidence. Taken together, I cannot recommend this manuscript for the publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) In general, OA is induced by long lasting mechanical stresses and can be accompanied by chronic inflammation, whereas IgE mediates antigen-specific acute and drastic inflammatory responses in allergic diseases. Thus, it is not easy to imagine that IgE-mediated immune responses are implicated in OA pathogenesis and induction of chronic inflammation that accompanies OA. The authors have to give convincing explanation.</p><p>2) Authors showed that IgE level does not corelate with OA onset or severity. I think that this is contradictory to authors' conclusion. Authors tried to explain this by the antigen-specific IgE, but it is unbelievable that OA is an autoimmune disease caused by IgE against join antigen(s). If so, they should identify the specific antigens recognized by IgE from the synovial tissues.</p><p>3) The authors could not analyze synovial derived mast cells by flow cytometry because enzymatic dissociation of synovium physically destroys mast cells. But many researchers succeeded in cell preparation from human and mouse synovial tissue. In particular, FACS analysis of mast cells in synovial tissues was previously shown (Lee et al., Arthritis Rheum., 2013). Therefore, the authors must show the accurate number of mast cell by FACS in Figure 1 to 5 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p>4) The authors cannot conclude that mast cell-derived tryptases promote osteoarthritis-associated pathology, since it remained unclear whether tryptase secreted by mast cells is sufficient to induce the destruction of the synovial cartilage. As I pointed out in the comment #6, addition of huge amount of tryptase is too artificial. The authors have to perform the co-culture experiment of mast cells with human cartilage explants. Furthermore, the authors have to show the evidence that chondrocyte undergoes apoptosis as I mentioned in comment #8.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39905.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) Functional assessment of the joint such as gait function or evaluating pain in mice OA model is required.</p></disp-quote><p>The primary goal of our study was to demonstrate that mast cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis, and specifically in the mechanisms that result in cartilage and joint destruction. Although it was previously reported that mast cells contribute to osteoarthritis joint pain in mice (Sousa-Valente et al., 2018) and that synovial mast cell numbers are associated with the degree of synovitis in osteoarthritic joints in humans (de Lange-Brokaar et al., 2016), mast cells have not previously been demonstrated to directly contribute to cartilage and joint tissue breakdown in osteoarthritis. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that IgE-mediated mast cell activation plays a critical role in cartilage degeneration, joint destruction and the development of osteoarthritis.</p><p>We and others previously established that the cartilage degeneration and joint destruction that develop following DMM in mice are associated with abnormal gait and increased pain (Huesa et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2011). Although we recognize the importance of pain and functional outcomes, we believe that histologic assessment of cartilage degeneration and joint destruction are the most definitive outcomes in mouse DMM osteoarthritis studies. Due to the large number of different murine experiments performed as part of the studies described in this manuscript, our analyses were focused on the definitive histologic outcome measures and we did not perform pain and function assessments. We now address this limitation in the Discussion:</p><p>“There are multiple potential limitations to this study. First, it was previously shown that mast cells are associated with joint pain in murine osteoarthritis (Sousa-Valente et al., 2018) and that synovial mast cell numbers are associated with the degree of synovitis in human osteoarthritis (de Lange-Brokaar et al., 2016). We and others previously demonstrated that following DMM in mice development of histologic osteoarthritis is associated with poor functional outcomes including pain and abnormal gait (Huesa et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2011). The studies presented in this manuscript demonstrate that mast cells and dysregulated mast cell activation contribute to cartilage and joint degeneration following DMM, and based on this prior work (Huesa et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2011) such pathologic changes are anticipated to result in pain and abnormal gait. Future studies will be needed to further characterize the role of mast cells in osteoarthritis-associated pain and joint dysfunction…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The relationship between IgE-derived mast cell activation and complement activation in the OA model should be, at least, properly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the connection between mast cell activation by IgE and complement should be discussed. We previously demonstrated that complement components are dysregulated in osteoarthritis and contribute to osteoarthritis pathogenesis, and it is possible that activated complement components stimulate mast cell recruitment and/or activation. We amended the Discussion section to address these possibilities:</p><p>“We previously demonstrated that complement plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (Lepus et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2011). Activation of the complement system results in the production of C3a and C5a which serve as anaphylatoxins and activators of mast cells (Erdei et al., 2004; Gaudenzio et al., 2016). It is therefore possible that complement regulates the recruitment and activation of mast cells in the synovium to promote the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. We previously demonstrated that the cartilage breakdown product, fibromodulin, can activate the complement system (Wang et al., 2011), and it is possible that mast cell tryptase-mediated cartilage degeneration produces fibromodulin and other cartilage breakdown products that reciprocally activate complement in the synovia in osteoarthritis. It will be important to define the temporal relationship between mast cell activation/degranulation and complement activation in the development and progression of osteoarthritis, including how activation of one affects the other and vice versa. Further, complement is capable of stimulating mast cells alone, and can also enhance IgE-dependent mast cell activation and degranulation (Schafer et al., 2013). Future studies will be needed to further define the roles and relationships of complement activation, IgE, and mast cell activation/degranulation in the development and progression of osteoarthritis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) If IgE is implicated in the pathogenesis of human OA, it is reasonable to speculate the relathinship between IgE level and higher OS risk in human. Thus, these epidemiological data should be examined and provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comment. However, previous data from others, as well as new data that we present in this response, suggest that levels of total IgE in either human sera or synovial fluids are not associated with osteoarthritis risk or severity. Previous reports found that IgE levels are not elevated in the synovial fluids of osteoarthritis joints (Hunder and Gleich, 1974). In addition, while increased serum levels of IgE can be detected in some atopic diseases, this is also not always the case (Novak and Bieber, 2003). Further, in allergic diseases it is antigen-specific IgE, and not bulk IgE, that plays a critical role in activating mast cells. Thus, it is possible that antigen-specific IgE, rather than bulk IgE, might play a role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.</p><p>To identify potential correlations of bulk IgE with osteoarthritis in humans, we analyzed the relationship between serum IgE levels and the presence and severity of osteoarthritis. In collaboration with David Felson and using serum samples from 1,200+ individuals in the Framingham Osteoarthritis Study (Felson et al., 1987), we measured levels of serum IgE and performed statistical analyses to determine whether bulk serum IgE was associated with the presence of osteoarthritis and/or osteoarthritis severity. At certain serum IgE thresholds (e.g. &gt;200 ng/mL), we detected trends towards more severe osteoarthritis in individuals with increased serum IgE, but these results were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>; p=0.08). We were not able to demonstrate a statistical association of bulk IgE levels in serum with the severity of osteoarthritis (based on KL score; data not shown). Further analyses using even larger patient numbers may enable demonstration of a modest association of serum IgE levels with osteoarthritis and/or osteoarthritis severity.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-39905-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We also used ELISA to measure bulk IgE levels in osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) synovial fluids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).

To provide further mechanistic data regarding the role of Syk in mast cell activation, we performed new in vivo experiments to examine the expression of a panel of mast cell mediators during treatment with the Syk inhibitor PRT062607 following DMM. We treated mice with either PRT062607 or vehicle for 6-weeks following DMM, and then harvested DMM joint synovial tissue and used qPCR to analyze expression levels of mRNAs encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteases. We found that expression of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases were reduced in DMM joint tissues derived from mice receiving pharmacologic treatment with the Syk inhibitor as compared to vehicle. We now include these data in new Figure 5I. The following text was added to the “IgE signaling through FcRI promotes pathogenesis of osteoarthritis” sub-section of the Results:</p><p>“We used qPCR to analyze the levels of mRNAs encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and degradative enzymes known to be produced by mast cells. Six-weeks following DMM, transcriptional expression of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteases including IL-1, CCL2, ADAMTS4 and MMP13 were significantly reduced in DMM joint tissues derived from mice treated with the Syk-inhibitor PRT062607 as compared to vehicle (Figure 5I).”</p><p>Together, the data in our manuscript demonstrate a critical role for mast cells and mast cell-derived tryptases in promoting cartilage degeneration and joint destruction following DMM in mice. We specifically demonstrate in DMM mice that mast cell-deficiency (Figure 2A-D), treatment with inhibitors of mast cell survival or signaling (Figure 2E-H; Figure 5E-H), deficiency or depletion of IgE (Figure 4), and treatment with the APC366 inhibitor of mast cell tryptase (Figure 3G-J), all reduce cartilage destruction (Figures 2B, 2F, 3H, 4B, 4F, 5F) and synovitis (Figures 2D, 2H, 3J, 4D, 4H, 5D). We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion for inclusion of additional data linking mast cells and mast cell activation pathways to the production of tryptase and other mast cell and inflammatory mediators, but believe our data provide compelling evidence for a critical role for mast cells and mast cell tryptases in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Further, the DMM model requires a protracted timeline – mice must be aged to 18-20 weeks prior to surgical DMM, followed by a 4 month in-life period following surgical DMM prior to harvesting of joint tissues, and then 1+ month is necessary for histologic processing of joint tissues – making it not logistically possible for us to perform the additional experiments necessary to address all of the reviewers’ suggestion in the time allotted. As a result, we now address the need for further investigation of the role of mast cells in promoting these changes as a limitation of our study in the Discussion:</p><p>“There are multiple potential limitations to our study… Second, while our findings demonstrate a critical role for mast cells, mast cell activation pathways, and the mast cell product tryptase in the development of osteoarthritis following DMM, further investigation is needed to characterize the relationship between IgE-mediated mast cell activation and the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteases implicated in synovitis and cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In regard to the data presented in this manuscript, both reviewers require more high quality, more quantification, and incorporation of suitable controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the manuscript to address these concerns from the reviewers.

We also now demonstrate that treatment of synovial fibroblasts with tryptase promotes pro-inflammatory signaling through activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway (new Figures 3J and K).</p><p>3) In response to Concern #6 from the Reviewing Editor and comment #11 from reviewer 2, we now provide mechanistic data supporting a key role for Syk signaling in mast cells in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis by showing that pharmacologic inhibition of Syk reduces mRNA levels of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and degradative enzymes in DMM synovial tissues (new Figure 5I).</p><p>4) In response to comment #4 from reviewer #2, we now present data quantifying the numbers of mast cells present in mouse joint synovia from multiple experiments presented in the manuscript. Specifically, we quantified the numbers toluidine blue-positive mast cells in the synovia of DMM joints from two strains of mast cell-deficient mice (<italic>Kit</italic><sup>W-sh/W-sh</sup> and <italic>Cpa3-Cre;MCl<sup>-</sup>1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>), including their levels following mast cell reconstitution (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B and D).

Although there are similar numbers of mast cells in human osteoarthritis and post-trauma non-osteoarthritis synovial tissue samples, we demonstrate that the mast cells in the osteoarthritis synovium are actively degranulating (Figure 1B and C) and releasing activated tryptase into the synovial fluid (Figure 1A).</p><p>6) We now include additional controls demonstrating that the observed downregulation of these cytokines and proteases is specific and not a general response (new Figure panels 3E and 5I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors present convincing evidence of the involvement of mast cells and the IgE/FceRI/Syk axis in inflammation and cartilage destruction in experimental Osteoarthritis (OA) in mice.

Nevertheless, the primary objective of this study was to identify molecular mechanisms underlying structural changes in osteoarthritis. As previously demonstrated in both Wang et al., (2011) and Huesa et al., (2016), the cartilage degeneration and joint breakdown that occurs following DMM results in both abnormal gait and increased pain. We believe that histologic demonstration of cartilage degeneration, joint breakdown, and synovitis is the most definitive outcome in the DMM model, and as a result this was the focus of our studies. Additionally, a prior study implicated mast cells in human osteoarthritis pain (Sousa-Valente et al., 2018), but did not demonstrate that they play a direct role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. In this manuscript, we provide extensive evidence based on histologic outcomes that mast cells and IgE play critical roles in the cartilage breakdown, joint tissue destruction, and synovitis that are characteristic of osteoarthritis. Given that we and others previously demonstrated that histologic osteoarthritis pathology is associated with pain and gait dysfunction in mice (Huesa et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2011), we do not believe that assessment of gait function or pain would significantly advance the conclusions of our study.

Cartilage degeneration, synovitis, and osteophyte formation were evaluated by two blinded observers using a modified version of a described scoring system (Kamekura et al., 2005) as we previously described (Wang et al., 2011). In brief: Cartilage degeneration was calculated by depth of cartilage degeneration (score of 0–4) × width of cartilage degeneration (with a score of 1 meaning one-third of the surface area, a score of 2 meaning two-thirds of the surface area, and a score of 3 meaning the whole surface area) in each third of the femoral-medial and tibial-medial condyles. The scores for the six regions were then summed. Synovitis scores were calculated as previously described (Blom et al., 2004): 0, no changes compared to normal joints; 1, thickening of the synovial lining and some influx of inflammatory cells; 2, thickening of the synovial lining and intermediate influx of inflammatory cells; and 3, profound thickening of the synovial lining (more than four cell layers) and maximal observed influx of inflammatory cells. Scores for synovitis were recorded for the femoral-medial and the tibial-medial condyles, and the scores for the two regions summed. Osteophyte formation was scored according to a previously described scoring system (Kamekura et al., 2005): 0, none; 1, formation of cartilage-like tissues; 2, increase of cartilaginous matrix; 3, endochondral ossification. Mast cells were quantified by a blinded examiner who determined the number of toluidine blue-positive mast cells per high power field of the joint sections.”</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease and is the most common form of arthritis. In this manuscript, the authors found abnormally degranulated mast cells in human and murine osteoarthritic joint tissue. Disruption of IgE/FceRI/Syk signaling axis ameliorated development of osteoarthritis. This signaling, along with histamine-releasing factor (HFR) promoted releases of tryptases from mast cell and induced inflammation and cartilage destruction in synovial tissues. Therefore, the authors concluded that the aberrant mast cell activation is critical for pathogenesis of OA. Despite potential importance of mast cell in OA, the present study has several concerns.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>In general, OA is induced by long lasting mechanical stresses and can be accompanied by chronic inflammation, whereas IgE mediates antigen-specific acute and drastic inflammatory responses in allergic diseases. Therefore, the authors need to provide very careful experimental data to show that IgE-mediated immune responses are implicated in OA pathogenesis and induction of chronic inflammation that accompanies OA. Also, antigen specificity of the IgE involved in the pathogenesis of OA is unclear. Thus, the authors have to give convincing explanation by clarifying the mechanism by which mechanical stress induces IgE production, and identifying the antigen specificity of the IgE.</p><p>1) If IgE is implicated in the pathogenesis of OA, diseases related to high level of IgE (asthma, atopic dermatitis, hay fever etc.) should be associated with the onset and severity of OA. Therefore, the authors should provide epidemiological evidence on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. The possibility of osteoarthritis being associated with allergic diseases is an interesting question. While an epidemiological analysis could provide important new insights, we believe an epidemiological analysis is beyond the scope of our current study. We now address these possibilities in the following text added to the Discussion:</p><p>“While many classical IgE-mediated allergic diseases including asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema exhibit comorbidities (Pedersen and Weeke, 1983), we are not aware of evidence of a clear link between osteoarthritis and allergic diseases. There is significant evidence that these classic allergic diseases are caused by antigen-specific IgE-dependent activation of mast cells (Galli and Tsai, 2012; Hamelmann et al., 1997; Oettgen and Geha, 2001; van der Heijden et al., 1993). If the role of mast cells in osteoarthritis pathogenesis is dependent on antigen-specific IgE, the target antigens could potentially be exogenous allergens. Another possibility is that in osteoarthritis the IgE target antigens are bone or cartilage breakdown products that give rise to neoantigens following joint injury or instability. Although we are not aware of evidence that osteoarthritis is associated with classic allergic and/or IgE-dependent diseases, an epidemiological analysis that addresses this important question is warranted. Further studies are also needed to characterize the antigen targets of IgE in osteoarthritis, which could reveal shared or distinct targets as compared to classical allergic diseases as well as provide insights into the mechanistic basis for the development of osteoarthritis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A mechanical damage induced OA model does not always reflect all the features of human OA. To propose the surprising concept like IgE involvement, one model of OA is not sufficient. The authors should verify the observation as described in the manuscript by another OA model.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. While no mouse model perfectly mimics osteoarthritis pathogenesis in humans, we chose to use the DMM model because it is highly representative of a significant subset of human osteoarthritis and is also the gold standard in the field for experimental investigation of osteoarthritis (Culley et al., 2015; Lorenz and Grässel, 2014). We, however, note that the DMM model is most representative of osteoarthritis development following traumatic joint injury (PTOA) in humans. It is possible that non-traumatic osteoarthritis, calcium pyrophosphate crystal-associated osteoarthritis, or other subsets of osteoarthritis may arise from activation of other molecular pathways. Thus, IgE-dependent mast cell activation may not contribute to development of all subsets of osteoarthritis disease.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that complement activation promotes osteoarthritis pathogenesis in both the medial meniscectomy (MM) and destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) mechanical injury mouse models (Wang et al., 2011), indicating that similar molecular mechanisms related to the complement system underlie osteoarthritis pathogenesis in both models. To test whether IgE activation similarly promotes osteoarthritis in multiple mouse models, we have now analyzed the effect of genetic deficiency of the high-affinity IgE receptor, Fcer1 (<italic>Fcer1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) on the development of osteoarthritis in the MM mouse model. Following MM, <italic>Fcer1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were protected from cartilage degeneration as compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>). This data recapitulates our results in the DMM model (Figures 4 and 5), indicating that IgE-signaling promotes osteoarthritis pathogenesis in multiple mechanical injury models.</p><p>We now clarify that based on our use of the DMM model, our data suggest a key role for IgE in the pathogenesis of PTOA. The following text was added to the Discussion:</p><p>“Together, our results demonstrate that the IgE/FceR1/Syk axis-activated mast cells to promote the development of osteoarthritis following mechanical injury (DMM) in mice. As the DMM model is most representative of osteoarthritis development following traumatic joint injury (PTOA) in humans, these findings suggest that PTOA arises as result of activation of the IgE/FceRI/Syk axis. It is possible that non-traumatic osteoarthritis, calcium pyrophosphate crystal-associated osteoarthritis, or other subsets of osteoarthritis may arise from activation of other molecular pathways.”</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Fcer1-deficient mice are protected against the medial meniscectomy (MM) model of osteoarthritis.</title><p>Representative toluidine blue stained medial stifle joint sections from Fcer1-deficient (<italic>Fcer1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) and wild-type (<italic>Fcer1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) mice; arrowheads show areas severe cartilage loss (upper panels).

Likewise, mast cell quantification in destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)-induced mice were also determined by histological analysis in Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and is not performed in Figure 3, 4 and 5. The authors have to quantify the number of mast cells infiltrated into synovial tissues regarding patient with OA in Figure 1 and DMM-induce mice in Figure 2—figure supplement 3, Figure 3, 4 and 5 by use of FACS. In addition, morphology of the FACS-sorted mast cells from synovial tissues must be examined by appropriate staining.</p></disp-quote><p>The images provided in Figure 1B are representative from the overall experiment presented as well as from 2 additional independent experiments that utilized independent osteoarthritis and non-osteoarthritis samples. In the legend for Figure 1, we indicate that for the representative experiment presented in the manuscript, mast cells and degranulation were quantified in samples from 5 individuals with osteoarthritis and 5 non-osteoarthritis individuals. Quantitation of the blinded scoring of mast cell degranulation in human osteoarthritis vs. post-traumatic non-osteoarthritis synovium is presented in Figure 1C (P &lt;0.01). Further, it is important to note that we also demonstrated increased levels of activated tryptase in human osteoarthritis as compared to non-osteoarthritis synovial fluids (Figure 1A), showing active and ongoing degranulation of mast cells in human osteoarthritis synovium, given the half-life of activated tryptase is approximately 2 hours.</p><p>In regard to the quantification of mast cell numbers in humans, others reported that synovial mast cell numbers are (i) elevated in osteoarthritis as compared to healthy synovium (Dean et al., 1993), and (ii) associated with the degree of synovitis in human osteoarthritis (de Lange-Brokaar et al., 2016).</p><p>Performance of FACS on synovial cells requires enzymatic digestion and dissociation of the synovium into single cell suspensions. We, and the NIH Accelerating Medicines Partnerships consortium of which we are a participating member, have found that such enzymatic dissociation of synovium (with Liberase TL and/or other enzymes, either with or without the gentleMACS Dissociator) physically destroys mast cells, thereby limiting their recovery. Such makes it technically difficult and likely inaccurate to quantitate synovial mast cells through FACS, and we believe electron microscopy and immunostaining represent more appropriate methods. To further assess mast cell levels in human osteoarthritis synovial tissues, we performed new immunostains for mast cells on synovium from joints with osteoarthritis (OA) and from joints sustaining traumatic joint injury but exhibiting no radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis (post-trauma, non-OA). These immunostains demonstrate similar levels of mast cells in the synovium from both groups (New Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We have not compared the levels of mast cells observed in osteoarthritis with normal synovium, nor with the degree of synovitis in osteoarthritis synovium, as reported by others (de Lange-Brokaar et al., 2016; Dean et al., 1993). We note that our studies reported in this manuscript are focused on mast cell activation and degranulation in osteoarthritis, and we provide evidence of ongoing mast cell activation and degranulation in human osteoarthritis through both electron microscopy demonstration of actively degranulating mast cells in osteoarthritis synovium and ELISA demonstration of increased activated mast cell tryptase (a mast cell degranulation product) in osteoarthritis synovial fluids (Figure 1A-C; Figure 1—figure supplement 3).</p><p>We now also provide new data quantifying the numbers of mast cells present in synovial tissues derived from our DMM experiments in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 for which images are presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 3. For this quantitation, a blinded examiner determined the number of toluidine blue-positive mast cells per high power field in synovium derived from each of the mice included in the experiments presented in Figure 2 (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). This analysis demonstrates statistically decreased mast cells in both the <italic>Kit</italic><sup>W-sh/W-sh</sup> and <italic>Cpa3-Cre;MCl<sup>-</sup>1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>mast cell-deficient mice as compared to both wild-type mice and the mast cell engrafted mice (P &lt; 0.01; new Figure 2—figure supplement 3 B and D). Toluidine blue staining of mast cells in DMM synovium was confirmed by anti-tryptase immunostaining (Figure 2—figure supplement 3E). We also demonstrate that imatinib-mediated protection against osteoarthritis following DMM was associated with reduced mast cell numbers in mouse DMM synovium (Figure 2—figure supplement 4 B – C). Further, we now provide new data quantifying the numbers of mast cells in the IgE-sufficient (<italic>Igh7<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) and IgE-deficient (<italic>Igh7<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice from our DMM experiments in Figure 4A-D. These data demonstrate decreased numbers of mast cells in <italic>Igh7<sup>-/-</sup></italic> as compared to <italic>Igh7<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (P &lt; 0.05; new Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It also remains unclear whether DMM induces accumulation of mast cell at the synovial tissues. The author should compare the number of synovial mast cells in the DMM-induced mice with those of sham operation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an important experiment. We now quantify the numbers of mast cells present in synovial tissues of wild-type mice 20-weeks following either sham or DMM surgery. For this quantitation, a blinded examiner determined the number of toluidine blue-positive mast cells per high power section for each of the mice in this experiment.

Figures 3G and H, in which treatment of DMM mice with the tryptase inhibitor, APC366, preserves cartilage in vivo, show that tryptases promote cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis. We have now moved the mouse DMM experiment with treatment of APC366 (originally g-j) to Figures 3A-D. We also added new experimental data demonstrating that pharmacologic inhibition of tryptase results in decreased transcriptional expression of inflammatory and degradative mast cell mediators in DMM joint tissues (new Figure 3E; see response to the next comment).</p><p><italic>7) There is no evidence whether the mast cell derived tryptases are involved in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, proteases expression, fibroblast proliferation and soluble glycosaminoglycans</italic> in vivo<italic>.

To address this, we performed new experiments measuring the mRNA levels in DMM joint tissues of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases following treatment with the tryptase inhibitor APC366. Six-week following DMM, transcriptional expression of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases was reduced in DMM joint tissues derived from mice treated with the tryptase inhibitor APC366 as compared to vehicle. We now include this analysis as new Figure 3E.</p><p>We further investigated the role of tryptase in promoting pro-inflammatory signaling in synovial fibroblasts by treating cultured primary synovial fibroblasts from individuals with osteoarthritis with purified tryptase. Western blot analysis shows that phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was stimulated following treatment with tryptase. We now include this analysis as new Figures 3J and K.</p><p>Based on the changes to Figure 3, we revised the “Mast cell-derived tryptases promote osteoarthritis-associated pathology” sub-section of the Results:</p><p>“Having established a pathogenic role for mast cells in osteoarthritis and because levels of the activated form of mast cell-derived tryptase are significantly elevated in the synovial fluids of individuals with osteoarthritis, a finding in agreement with previous reports (Nakano et al., 2007), we next investigated mechanisms by which tryptase might promote the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. We first tested whether selectively inhibiting the protease activity of tryptase with APC366 (Cairns, 2005) – an oral, selective tryptase small-molecule inhibitor previously used to alleviate allergic, inflammatory and fibrotic responses in multiple mouse models (Lu et al., 2014; Matos et al., 2013; Sevigny et al., 2011) – could effectively attenuate the progression and/or severity of osteoarthritis in mice. We found that following DMM, treatment with APC366 for 12 weeks significantly reduced cartilage damage (Figure 3A and B), osteophyte formation (Figure 3C, Figure 3 —figure supplement 2) and synovitis (Figure 3D, Figure 3 —figure supplement 2) compared to treatment with the vehicle-control mice, suggesting that tryptase inhibition can prevent the development of osteoarthritis in mice. We, additionally, measured the expression of pro-inflammatory and degradative mediators known to be produced by mast cells in DMM joints following treatment with the tryptase inhibitor APC366. Six-weeks after DMM, transcriptional expression of multiple mediators including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, CCL5, ADAMTS4 and <italic>MMP3</italic> was significantly reduced in DMM synovial tissues derived from tryptase treated as compared to vehicle treated mice (Figure 3E).</p><p>As tryptase has been shown to promote pathogenic properties in human rheumatoid arthritis-derived synovial fibroblasts (Xue et al., 2012), we examined whether tryptase could also induce pro-inflammatory and proliferative responses in primary synovial fibroblasts derived from remnant osteoarthritic joint tissue. Indeed, tryptase significantly increased the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 and degradative enzymes <italic>MMP3</italic> and ADAMTS4 (Figure 3F), increased the secretion of cytokines IL-1β (Figure 3G), IFN (Figure 3H), and increased synovial fibroblast proliferation in vitro, as demonstrated by increased expression of the activation marker Ki-67 by fibroblasts (Figure 3I). in vitro treatment of synovial fibroblasts with tryptase also promoted phosphorylation of Erk1/2, indicating that tryptase can activate pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in synovial fibroblasts (Figure 3J and K). Further, in vitro inhibition of tryptase activity with APC366 abrogated the pro-inflammatory and proliferative responses of synovial fibroblasts (Figure 3F-I).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors should show the evidence that chondrocyte undergoes apoptosis.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on this reviewer’s comment #6, we have now removed the data from our in vitro experiments treating cultured chondrocytes with tryptase (original Figures 3A and B).

However, the mouse experiments required to analyze the relationship between IgE/Syk signaling and tryptase production require significant amounts of time (&gt;6 months). As a result, we were unable to perform new experiments to address this question within the timeframe provided to respond to the reviewers’ critiques. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that genetic deficiency in IgE (Figure 4A-D), depletion of IgE with anti-IgE antibody (Figure 4E-H), or pharmacologic inhibition of Syk (Figure 5E-I), all protect mice against development of osteoarthritis following DMM. We now address this limitation in the Discussion of our manuscript:</p><p>Limitations paragraph: “There are multiple potential limitations to this study… Additionally, demonstration in vivo that IgE/Syk signaling is associated with increased tryptase production would further strengthen our findings.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The author must examine whether DMM induces increases in IgE concentration in synovial fluids in comparison to those of sham operation. If so, is it sufficient to stimulate synovial mast cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to compare IgE levels in DMM and sham-operated mouse joints. Prior data indicate that levels of bulk (total) IgE are not elevated in the synovial fluids of human osteoarthritic joints (Hunder and Gleich, 1974). In addition, as described in our response to the Reviewing Editor’s comment #3 (above), in preliminary studies we found that bulk IgE levels in both synovial fluids and sera are not significantly elevated in individuals with osteoarthritis. As described above, we did observe a trend towards increased levels of bulk IgE in sera derived from individuals with osteoarthritis as compared to individuals with healthy joints. Further, our preliminary data suggest that antigen-specific IgE might be present in human osteoarthritis synovial fluid and thereby might play a role in osteoarthritis pathogenesis (preliminary data provided in response to Reviewing Editor’s comment #3, above).</p><p>While we agree that further investigation of IgE levels in mice is an interesting question, obtaining synovial fluids from mice is technically difficult – particularly from sham operated joints (e.g. mouse joints with no osteoarthritis) in which there is not significant accumulation of excess synovial fluid. As a result, we were not able to perform these experiments. As outlined above, we believe investigation of the role of antigen-specific IgE in human osteoarthritis represents a more promising line of investigation (as compared to analysis of bulk IgE in mouse synovial fluids). We now address the need for further investigation of the role of IgE and antigen-specific IgE in the Discussion:</p><p>“Previous reports found that IgE levels are not elevated in the synovial fluids of osteoarthritis joints (Hunder and Gleich, 1974), and in preliminary studies we observed only trends towards an association of increased bulk IgE in serum with osteoarthritis in humans. It remains possible that antigen-specific IgE contributes to mast cell activation in osteoarthritis, and future studies will be needed to investigate the relative contributions of antigen-specific IgE and other mechanisms of mast cell activation in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors must examine whether the DMM-induced cartilage destruction as well as the related signatures (proinflammatory cytokines, proteases expression, fibroblast proliferation and soluble glycosaminoglycans) are canceled in the Cpa3-Cre Syk-flox mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Given that FcR1 signals via Syk (Benhamou et al., 1993), the experiment recommended above would further confirm a role for the FcR1 /Syk pathway in the DMM model of cartilage destruction. Based on our demonstration that both genetic deficiency of FcR1 (Figure 5A-D) and pharmacologic inhibition of Syk (Figure 5E-H) prevent cartilage degradation in DMM mice, we believe that this additional experiment is redundant and would not significantly advance the current findings. Nevertheless, we now provide new data on the transcriptional expression of multiple mast cell mediators, including pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteases, in the joints of DMM mice following treatment with the Syk-inhibitor PRT062607. Six-weeks following DMM, transcriptional expression of IL-1, CCL2, CCL5, IL-6, TNF, MMP13, and ADAMTS4 was significantly reduced in the joints of PRT062607-treated as compared to vehicle-treated mice.

We previously added the following text to the Discussion to address this preliminary finding as well as possible explanations:</p><p>“Previous reports found that IgE levels are not elevated in the synovial fluids of osteoarthritis joints (Hunder and Gleich, 1974), and in preliminary studies we observed only trends towards an association of increased bulk IgE in serum with osteoarthritis in humans.

While increased serum levels of IgE can be detected in some atopic diseases, this is also not always the case (Novak and Bieber, 2003) – demonstrating that even in diseases well established to be mediated by IgE (e.g. antigen-specific IgE), elevations in bulk IgE are not always present. Importantly, in such allergic diseases it is antigen-specific IgE, and not bulk IgE, that plays a critical role in activating mast cells. Thus, it is possible that antigen-specific IgE, rather than bulk IgE, might play a role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis; or that antigen-independent mechanisms are responsible for IgE-mediated mast cell activation in osteoarthritis. Thus, we are unsure of the significance of differences in bulk IgE levels between different diseases. We do not believe these potential differences are relevant to the mechanisms by which IgE contributes to the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.</p><p>We believe our conclusions are already well supported by our data.

However, the data are too preliminary to convince us of the surprising finding that OA is an autoimmune disease caused by IgE against join antigen(s) and mast cells. The proposed mechanism is not well based on evidence. Taken together, I cannot recommend this manuscript for the publication in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>As we stated in our prior response to review, we believe our initial data on antigen-specific IgE is too preliminary to include in the manuscript and as a result we have not included it – we agree with the reviewer on this point.</p><p>However, we respectfully disagree that our findings suggest that osteoarthritis is an autoimmune disease caused by IgE against joint antigens(s). A role for antigen-specific IgE, either against allergens or cartilage/synovial tissue breakdown products, is one of several potential mechanisms by which IgE could contribute to mast cell activation in synovial tissues and thereby the development of OA. We have now added to the following paragraph in the Discussion to address this consideration:</p><p>“While many classical IgE-mediated allergic diseases including asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema exhibit comorbidities (Pedersen and Weeke, 1983), we are not aware of evidence of a clear link between osteoarthritis and allergic diseases. There is significant evidence that these classic allergic diseases are caused by antigen-specific IgE-dependent activation of mast cells (Galli and Tsai, 2012; Hamelmann et al., 1997; Oettgen and Geha, 2001; van der Heijden et al., 1993). If the role of mast cells in osteoarthritis pathogenesis is dependent on antigen-specific IgE, the target antigens could potentially be exogenous allergens. Another possibility is that the IgE target antigens are bone or cartilage breakdown products that give rise to neoantigens following joint injury or instability. Although we are not aware of evidence that osteoarthritis is associated with classic allergic and/or IgE-dependent diseases, an epidemiological analysis that addresses this important question is warranted. Antigen-specific antibody responses can also be generated in autoimmune responses, however OA synovial linings do not exhibit histologic features consistent with an adaptive autoimmune response and we do not believe our findings suggest the presence of an classical adaptive autoimmune response. Future studies are needed to determine if IgE targets specific antigens, and to further characterize the role of IgE, in osteoarthritis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) In general, OA is induced by long lasting mechanical stresses and can be accompanied by chronic inflammation, whereas IgE mediates antigen-specific acute and drastic inflammatory responses in allergic diseases.

The authors have to give convincing explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that long-lasting mechanical stresses likely contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis in a significant subset of patients, and added the following text to the Discussion to address this point: “Mechanical instability and stresses likely contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis in a significant subset of patients. We do not believe that a role for mechanical stresses is inconsistent with a role for IgE and mast cells, and it is possible that mechanical stresses produce cartilage breakdown products and/or cellular responses that promote IgE-dependent mast cell activation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Authors showed that IgE level does not corelate with OA onset or severity. I think that this is contradictory to authors' conclusion. Authors tried to explain this by the antigen-specific IgE, but it is unbelievable that OA is an autoimmune disease caused by IgE against join antigen(s). If so, they should identify the specific antigens recognized by IgE from the synovial tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, there are examples of IgE-mediated allergic diseases in which bulk IgE levels do not correlate with disease severity, and this may also be the case in osteoarthritis. As described in our responses above, we do not believe our findings suggest that osteoarthritis is an autoimmune disease and added several sentences to the Discussion to address this possibility (see above for full response and new text added). We believe definitive characterization of the potential targets of IgE in osteoarthritis, and/or if other mechanisms promote IgE-dependent mast cell activation in osteoarthritis, is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors could not analyze synovial derived mast cells by flow cytometry because enzymatic dissociation of synovium physically destroys mast cells. But many researchers succeeded in cell preparation from human and mouse synovial tissue. In particular, FACS analysis of mast cells in synovial tissues was previously shown (Lee et al., Arthritis Rheum. 2013). Therefore, the authors must show the accurate number of mast cell by FACS in Figure 1 to 5 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We demonstrate that mast cells are present in human OA synovial lining by (i) immunostaining (New Figure 1—figure supplement 2), and (ii) electron microscopy (Figure 1B and C). In New Figure 1—figure supplement 2 we quantitate mast cells in human OA synovial linings and demonstrate that they represent approximately 1% of cells in the synovial lining.</p><p>The work of Lee et al. is already cited in the following sentence in the Introduction of our manuscript: “Several studies have documented the presence of mast cells and their mediators in the synovium and synovial fluids of individuals with osteoarthritis (Buckley et al., 1997; Dean et al., 1993; Lee et al., 2013).” We appreciate that the reviewer comments on the findings of Lee et al. (Arthritis Rheumatology, 2013), as their findings as well as the findings of the other groups cited all demonstrate the presence of mast cells in human osteoarthritis synovial linings and thereby support the findings presented in our manuscript. Further, these prior studies used multiple different experimental approaches and methods to demonstrate the presence of mast cells in human OA synovial linings – thus, these prior observations are consistent with and further support the findings reported in our manuscript. Even if technically feasible using other tissue digestion methods, we do not believe additional flow cytometry studies to analyze synovial mast cells would meaningfully strengthen or add to the findings presented in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors cannot conclude that mast cell-derived tryptases promote osteoarthritis-associated pathology, since it remained unclear whether tryptase secreted by mast cells is sufficient to induce the destruction of the synovial cartilage. As I pointed out in the comment #6, addition of huge amount of tryptase is too artificial. The authors have to perform the co-culture experiment of mast cells with human cartilage explants. Furthermore, the authors have to show the evidence that chondrocyte undergoes apoptosis as I mentioned in comment #8.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s questions, and now add the following text to the Discussion to address these considerations. “Although we have not formally demonstrated that mast cells are the source of tryptases that promote the pathogenesis of OA, our data demonstrate that: (i) mast cells comprise 1 – 3% of synovial cells in both OA and PT non-OA synovial linings, (ii) mast cells are actively degranulating to release tryptase in human OA synovial linings (Figure 1B and C), and pharmacologic inhibition of typtase prevents the development of OA in mice (Figure 3A-D). Mast cells are the predominant producer of tryptases, and to a lesser extent basophils (Schwartz, 2006), and histologic examination of human and mouse OA synovial linings and tissues for basophils did not reveal basophils. Together, these data suggest that mast cells are the cellular source of tryptase in human and murine OA.”</p><p>Regarding this reviewer’s prior comment #6, we agree with the reviewer that the in vitro human cartilage explant experiments represent a highly artificial experimental system. As a result, in the prior revision we removed the data and figure panels in which relatively large amounts of tryptase were incubated with cartilage explants (original Figures 3A and B – now removed). We note that in vivo treatment of DMM mice with the tryptase inhibitor, APC366, preserves cartilage (Figure 3A and B) – demonstrating that tryptases do promote cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis. In addition, as part of the prior revision, we performed new in vivo experiments that demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of tryptases results in decreased transcriptional expression of inflammatory and degradative mast cell mediators in DMM joint tissues (new Figure 3E). Specifically, we demonstrated that 6 weeks following DMM that treatment of mice with the tryptase inhibitor APC366 reduced the transcriptional expression of multiple inflammatory and degradative mediators including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, CCL5, ADAMTS4 and <italic>MMP3</italic>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
