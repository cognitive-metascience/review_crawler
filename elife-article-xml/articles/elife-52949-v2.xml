timing and location of excitation and inhibition (E/I) within active dendritic trees can significantly impact neuronal function. How synaptic inputs are functionally organized at the subcellular level in intact circuits remains unclear. To address this issue, we took advantage of the retinal direction-selective ganglion cell circuit, where directionally tuned inhibition is known to shape non-directional excitatory signals. We combined two-photon calcium imaging with genetic, pharmacological, and single-cell ablation methods to examine the extent to which inhibition ‘vetoes’ excitation at the level of individual dendrites of direction-selective ganglion cells. We demonstrate that inhibition shapes direction selectivity independently within small dendritic segments (&lt;10µm) with remarkable accuracy. The data suggest that the parallel processing schemes proposed for direction encoding could be more fine-grained than previously envisioned.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>excitation</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd><kwd>direction selectivity</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>dendritic calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>DSGC</kwd><kwd>starburst amacrine cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>159444</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Awatramani</surname><given-names>Gautam Bhagwan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Accurate direction-selective information is present within small sections of the dendrites, raising the possibility that single dendrites utilize parallel processing schemes to process motion information.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural computations often rely on interactions between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cafaro and Rieke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'amour and Froemke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denève and Machens, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wehr and Zador, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xue et al., 2014</xref>). While excitation can drive action potential firing, inhibition serves as an opposing force to gate excitatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grienberger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koch et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lovett-Barron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muñoz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murayama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poleg-Polsky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ranganathan et al., 2018</xref>). Such interactions between excitation and inhibition (E/I) form the basis for logical ‘AND-NOT’ computations, in which activity is only propagated when excitation is present but inhibition is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlow and Levick, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Major et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schachter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sivyer and Williams, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilson et al., 2018</xref>). The direction-selective ganglion cell (DSGC) circuit in the retina is a classic example of a circuit that performs AND-NOT computations: objects in the visual scene that move over a DSGC’s receptive field in its ‘preferred’ direction drive excitation onto its dendrites that trigger action potential firing, but for motion in the opposite or ‘null’ direction, excitation is ‘vetoed’ by coincident GABAergic inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). The spatial scale over which such computations take place could have important impacts on the computational capacity of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">London and Häusser, 2005</xref>), but has not been investigated in intact circuits.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Synaptic mechanisms underlying direction selectivity in DSGCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spiking, IPSCs, and EPSCs recorded from the soma of an ON-OFF DSGC in response to a positive contrast spot (200 µm diameter; 500 µm/s) moving in the DSGC’s preferred (PD) or null direction (ND).

The orientations of SAC dendrites can predict the PD of DSGCs, because SACs release GABA maximally for stimuli moving from their soma towards their dendritic tips. The known anatomy predicts variable and sometimes disorganized local tuning in DSGCs (blue region).</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig1sdata1"><label>Figure 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Currents and spiking responses in DSGCs.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-52949-fig1-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52949-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>It is well-established that direction-selective (DS) GABAergic signals in DSGCs arise from the distal varicosities located on the radiating dendrites of presynaptic starburst amacrine cells (SACs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Taylor and Smith, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vaney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wei, 2018</xref>). SAC varicosities are more effectively depolarized during centrifugal motion (from the soma to the dendritic tip), and thus the orientation of a given SAC dendrite provides an approximation of its preferred direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Euler et al., 2002</xref>). In a seminal study combining physiological recordings with serial block-face electron microscopy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggman et al. (2011)</xref> demonstrated that SAC dendrites with similar orientations—and therefore similar directional preferences—tend to make synapses with the same type of DSGC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This asymmetric wiring explains how individual DSGCs are biased to receive GABAergic inhibition in response to certain directions of motion but not others, which ultimately shapes their DS spiking responses (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vaney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wei, 2018</xref>). It should be noted that SACs also provide symmetrical excitatory cholinergic signals to DSGCs, which appear to be mediated by a diffuse synaptic mechanism that makes them insensitive to specific wiring patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brombas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sethuramanujam et al., 2017</xref>). The resulting spatial offsets in the GABAergic and cholinergic connectivity produce E/I timing differences that contribute to the overall tuning properties of DSGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koch et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Torre and Poggio, 1978</xref>).</p><p>Although the overall tuning properties of DSGCs are evident from both their anatomical connectivity with SACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>) and somatic inhibitory currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the nature of the DS information at the level of individual dendrites is not clear. A closer inspection of the orientation of presynaptic SACs shows that their dendritic orientation can change systematically throughout a DSGC’s dendritic field and can be disorganized in particular dendritic subfields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; see dendrites highlighted in blue). Thus, the anatomy predicts that the inhibitory input to DSGCs will be heterogeneous, and result in frequent inaccuracies in local tuning in dendrites. However, interpreting the wiring at the scale of individual dendrites is difficult for several reasons.</p><p>First, in the original study, only a limited number of SACs were reconstructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>), so the differences in connectivity throughout the DSGC dendritic arbor may arise from a sampling bias. Second, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging studies suggest that there is significant variance in the directional tuning of individual SAC varicosities with similar dendritic orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morrie and Feller, 2018</xref>), which is exacerbated by large trial-to-trial variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poleg-Polsky et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, it is also important to note that direction selectivity not only depends on the strength of SAC output, but also on its relative timing with excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cafaro and Rieke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanson et al., 2019</xref>), so only examining the anatomy provides an incomplete picture. Thus, direct functional measurements from DSGC dendrites are required to ascertain the properties of subcellular direction selectivity.</p><p>To this end, the first set of dendritic patch-clamp recordings carried out in rabbit ON DSGCs provided invaluable insights into the local organization of inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sivyer and Williams, 2013</xref>). Similar to reports in ON-OFF DSGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oesch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Trenholm et al., 2014</xref>), this study directly demonstrated that DSGCs fire TTX-sensitive dendritic spikes that are directionally tuned. Critically, their data suggest that dendritic spike initiation is driven by localized excitatory activity, and that dendritic spike suppression requires inhibition to act in close proximity to the site of excitatory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sivyer and Williams, 2013</xref>). Thus, the glutamate, acetylcholine (ACh), and GABA that contribute to dendritic E/I in DSGCs must be coordinated both spatially and temporally in order to produce accurate DS information in dendrites.</p><p>Previous modeling estimates based on the natural branching patterns and theoretical voltage length constants of ganglion cell dendrites support the idea that DSGCs integrate information over ‘subunits’ (up to 50–100 µm diameter) that are electrically isolated from each other but relatively isopotential within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koch et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schachter et al., 2010</xref>). If these dendritic subunits integrate synaptic inputs independently, the appropriate levels of E/I must be delivered to each subunit in a temporally precise manner in order to generate accurate DS responses locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sivyer and Williams, 2013</xref>). Here, we use 2-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to measure how direction selectivity is expressed locally in ON-OFF DSGC dendrites, the spatial extent of independence of those signals, and how that relates to our expectations from previous anatomical and functional studies. The data suggest that independent and accurate DS information is present within small dendrite sections, indicating that synaptic inputs may be processed over a finer spatiotemporal scale than previously thought.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evaluating local synaptic activity in DSGC dendrites</title><p>ON-OFF DSGCs were identified based on their extracellular spiking responses to positive contrast spots moving in eight different directions (200 µm diameter, moving at 500 µm/s). To monitor activity in individual dendrites, DSGCs were loaded with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive and -insensitive dyes (Oregon Green BAPTA-1 and Sulforhodamine 101, respectively) through a patch electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Activity was typically imaged in the ON arbors of these bistratified DSGCs, where signals tended to be stronger than those observed in the OFF arbors, likely because the stimulus was a bright spot on a dark background. To isolate local activity, a voltage-gated sodium channel (Na<sub>V</sub>) blocker was included in the electrode solution (2 mM QX-314; note, low concentrations were used to avoid significant Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockade; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Talbot and Sayer, 1996</xref>), or in some cases 1 µM TTX was included in the bath solution. If Na<sub>V</sub> activity was left intact, the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses would reflect the neuron’s global activity due to the propagation of dendritic spikes or back-propagation of somatic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oesch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yonehara et al., 2013</xref>), whereas our objective was to assess local synaptic activity. With Na<sub>V</sub> blocked, the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals arise from Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through both voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>) and NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poleg-Polsky and Diamond, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sethuramanujam et al., 2017</xref>), which we provide evidence for in several subsequent experiments (Figures 2–3 and 6).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Independent activity in dendritic branches in the presence of Na<sub>V</sub> blockers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 2-photon image of the ON-stratifying dendritic arbor of an ON-OFF DSGC, which was filled with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (Oregon Green Bapta-1, 200 µM), and a Na<sub>V</sub> channel blocker (QX-314, 2 mM) through a patch electrode.

Preferred motion, in which synaptic activity is mainly excitatory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), evoked a wave of activity as the stimulus traversed the dendritic arbor. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were first observed at dendritic regions of interest (ROIs) located closest to where the moving stimulus entered the DSGC’s receptive field. Sites positioned later in the stimulus trajectory had progressively delayed response onsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). Using the response latency and relative position of the dendritic sites, the stimulus speed was estimated to be 524 ± 28 µm/s (n = 6), close to the nominal stimulus speed (500 µm/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The sequential activation of dendrites was also observed when NMDA receptors were blocked (50 µM D-AP5). Since the relative timing of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses was similar to control conditions, we combined the data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). During NMDA receptor blockade, it is likely that the light-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are primarily mediated by Ca<sub>V</sub> channels, indicating that individual dendrites are depolarized in sequence as the stimulus crosses the DSGC’s receptive field.</p><p>The data suggest that the dendritic arbor is not acting as a single unit, but rather that individual dendritic branches process their synaptic inputs independently. This idea supports previous theoretical and experimental work suggesting that motion information is processed in parallel by DSGC dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brombas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koch et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koch et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oesch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schachter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sivyer and Williams, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Torre and Poggio, 1978</xref>). To examine whether different regions of the dendritic tree receive adequate levels of inhibition to veto local excitatory responses, we next examined responses evoked during motion in the null direction, where inhibition is the strongest. We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals evoked by null stimuli were significantly weaker or absent in the majority of sites throughout the dendritic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). Since the overall strength of excitation is similar to that evoked by motion in the preferred direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yonehara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanson et al., 2019</xref>), the lack of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals indicates the presence of strong and coincident inhibition at each dendrite.</p><p>However, we did occasionally observe activity in isolated dendritic ‘hot spots’ (FWHM = 3.0 ± 1.2 µm; n = 61 sites in 7 cells) during null motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–I</xref>). These Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were not consistently observed over multiple presentations of the null stimulus at any given site, suggesting that they arise from probabilistic transmission rather than from the absence of inhibitory synapses in that local dendritic region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–I</xref>). Such highly compartmentalized Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, which persist for hundreds of milliseconds, may be indicative of strong buffering mechanisms in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Awatramani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biess et al., 2011</xref>). While this reinforces the notion that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals reflect local synaptic activity, the highly localized signals evoked during null motion also raise the possibility that E/I interactions occur over a fine spatial scale.</p><p>Highly independent compartmentalized signaling was also apparent in response to orthogonal motion (i.e. motion 90° to the preferred-null axis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In this direction, where E/I levels are more comparable, the peak amplitudes of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses exhibited considerable trial-to-trial fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To quantitatively assess the independence of dendritic sites, we assessed how Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals between pairs of ROIs co-varied as a function of the cable distance between them. In order to avoid measuring stimulus driven correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we computed the residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations for each ROI by subtracting the mean response from the individual trials, over at least 30 consecutive trials in which the average response was stable. Using these ‘noise residuals’, cross-correlations were carried out between each ROI and every other ROI within the imaging window. Only nearby ROIs were significantly correlated with each other, and noise correlations measured in neighboring ROIs were absent when trials were shuffled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

As a more direct test of this hypothesis, we examined dendritic tuning after locally disrupting the inhibitory inputs arising from a limited set of SACs. To do so, we initially tried to apply local puffs of GABA receptor antagonists to block inhibition onto specific dendrites, but we found it difficult to keep the drug sufficiently localized. We also tried controlling GABA release from single SACs through a somatic patch electrode but found that the presence of light-evoked synaptic conductances made it extremely difficult to control SAC release. Finally, we resorted to single cell ablation methods using sharp electrodes to disrupt some of the inhibitory inputs mediated by SACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacoby et al., 2015</xref>). In a mouse line in which SACs were genetically labeled (ChAT<sup>Cre</sup> x nGFP mouse line; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vlasits et al., 2014</xref>), 3–7 SACs with somas located on the null side of the DSGC’s receptive field—which likely provide multiple strong GABAergic contacts to the DSGC—were targeted for ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). SAC ablation increased the spiking activity in the null direction and thus diminished direction selectivity, likely due to a decrease in inhibition from the ablated SACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

Many dendritic sites were well-tuned for direction, similar to control conditions, while others were poorly tuned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,E</xref>). To abbreviate these otherwise lengthy experiments, stimuli were only moved along the preferred-null axis (note that this causes the reported DSIs to be higher than that measured using eight stimulus directions). The overall DSI distribution was significantly different than that measured without SAC ablation (p=10<sup>−16</sup>, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Consistent with the idea that SAC ablation results in a reduction in local inhibition, the null direction Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at poorly tuned sites were large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). This contrasts with control conditions, in which poorly tuned sites had weak null and preferred responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Importantly, neighboring dendritic sites could have dramatically different DSIs after SAC ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). In some cases, we were able to measure the DSI before and after SAC ablation. Once again, clear changes in tuning strength occurred at many, but not all, sites throughout the arbor. Sites that were unaffected by SAC ablation were closely interspersed among strongly affected sites, suggesting that the inhibitory inputs to a given site have limited influence on the tuning of its neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F–G</xref>). These data demonstrate that local inhibitory inputs shape DS Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses within single dendritic branches.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>The functional organization of E/I in the dendritic arbors of DSGCs</title><p>Starburst dendritic varicosities are known to ‘wrap-around’ DSGC dendrites, and provide them with strong DS inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>). Functional imaging studies show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in SAC varicosities are well-tuned for direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Euler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poleg-Polsky et al., 2018</xref>). However, the presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals do not necessarily indicate the strength of the synapse or the extent to which GABA release shapes the postsynaptic response. To this end, our measurements of the tuning properties of postsynaptic DSGC dendrites provide several novel insights into the functional properties of inhibitory SAC synapses.</p><p>One of the central claims of this study is that SAC inhibition is highly directional and can act extremely locally (~5–10 µm scale). Inhibition vetoes local excitatory signals that appear non-directional, resulting in the production of small independent DS dendritic subunits throughout the DGSC’s dendritic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Accurate DS information was present within each subunit even on a single set of trials. Given that there are at most 1–4 SAC synapses within each dendritic subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bleckert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sigal et al., 2015</xref>), it is likely that the output of single SACs are graded according to direction, similar to their Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Euler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poleg-Polsky et al., 2018</xref>). This was not entirely expected since transmitter release is nonlinearly related to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dodge and Rahamimoff, 1967</xref>). Support for these hypotheses came from the SAC ablation experiments, where we found that removing inhibition arising from a few SACs on the null side of the receptive field resulted in the loss of direction selectivity in small sections of the dendrite (~10 µm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). After SAC ablation, robust DS and non-DS sites could be observed on the same dendritic branch, demonstrating the fine spatial scale over which inhibition can veto excitatory responses. It is also possible that some of the independence of DS subunits arises from variable levels of local excitation. However, since inhibition is thought to act as a shunt, its ‘visibility’ is expected to be more spatiotemporally constrained compared to excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koch et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rall, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Torre and Poggio, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Williams, 2004</xref>), and may have a dominant effect on the local variance. Taken together, these data suggest that SAC varicosities provide reliable, localized, and systematic DS inhibition throughout the entire DSGC dendritic tree.</p><p>Although excitatory signals alone may drive depolarizations over larger dendritic areas, it is by no means uniform across the dendritic tree when a stimulus sweeps over the DSGC’s receptive field—different dendrites are activated at different times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This makes the precise timing and placement of each inhibitory input from SACs more critical, since mistimed or misplaced E/I are not expected to strongly interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koch et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lowe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marlin and Carter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Müller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müllner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Polsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Williams, 2004</xref>). Thus, the presynaptic networks must deliver the ‘correct’ amount of E/I to each dendrite for each given direction with temporal precision.</p><p>The tight spatiotemporal coupling of E/I is especially important for motion in the null direction, in which inhibition is tasked with fully preventing the generation of dendritic spikes. In response to null motion, we only occasionally observed Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses that were localized to small dendritic segments, suggesting that E/I mostly arrive at the same time and place at each point in the dendritic arbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). While the precise temporal characteristics of E/I cannot be determined by Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, in a computational model based on the morphology of DSGCs, we found that even E/I delays in the range of ~10 ms could significantly compromise the directional spiking output of the DSGCs (deRosenroll and Awatramani, unpublished data). It is possible that spatiotemporally coordinated E/I naturally arises from the co-transmission of GABA and ACh from SAC synapses. ACh is released from SACs of all dendritic orientations onto DSGC dendrites, and input from a single SAC is capable of eliciting dendritic spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brombas et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, co-transmitting GABA from the same varicosity would ensure that during null motion, E/I is spatiotemporally synchronous. In other directions, coordinated E/I is less important, since full suppression of dendritic spiking is not required.</p><p>In addition to ACh, bipolar cells release glutamate onto DSGC dendrites as a second source of excitation. It is less clear how GABA effectively counters glutamatergic excitation though, since glutamate is expected to arrive slightly later than the GABAergic inputs during null motion due to the lateral offset of SAC receptive fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wei, 2018</xref>). However, the glutamatergic inputs—which are largely mediated by NMDA receptors—may not need to be as finely coordinated with GABA since they rely on ACh-mediated depolarizations in order to open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brombas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sethuramanujam et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, since inhibition is slow to decay it is expected to be significantly more tolerant of excitation that arrives late as opposed to that arriving early (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schachter et al., 2010</xref>). Since the apparent goal of null inhibition is to suppress spiking, why the retinal DS circuit drives null excitation in the first place is still not entirely clear. One advantage of non-directional excitation is that fewer excitatory neurons are required to drive the 4 types of ON-OFF DSGCs encoding different cardinal directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vaney et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Together, our data support a model of locally-generated direction selectivity, in which inhibition arrives spatiotemporally close to excitation as synaptic activity traverses the arbor in response to null motion. The requirements for tightly coordinated E/I may be less stringent for other directions of motion, in which full spike suppression does not occur. Although this hypothesis has existed for many decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koch et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koch et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Torre and Poggio, 1978</xref>), our study is the first to provide detailed experimental data as to the spatial scale over which accurate directional information exists in DSGC dendrites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional and anatomical comparisons</title><p>Our Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements are in general agreement with anatomical predictions that inhibition is applied throughout the DSGC dendritic arbor. That being said, the distribution of directional tuning that we observed was more homogeneous than expected given the anatomical and functional variance of presynaptic SACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poleg-Polsky et al., 2018</xref>). We did not observe systematic shifts in the tuning across different dendritic sectors as suggested by the anatomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and rarely observed sites that were tuned to the wrong directional hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>); 95% of the dendritic sites fell within ±31.6° of the DSGC’s true PD (two standard deviations). This is a tighter distribution than can be estimated from the anatomical connectivity, in which roughly 10% of SAC inputs pointed in the wrong directional hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>). However, predicting the precise directional preference of SAC dendrites from their anatomical orientation is a coarse and often inaccurate approximation, as demonstrated by recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morrie and Feller, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poleg-Polsky et al., 2018</xref>). It is also possible that in our study, sites with weaker Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses reflect some of the miswiring, since these sites tended to be poorly tuned. A further possibility is that the 5–10 µm integration area that our Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements report from is large enough to contain several inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bleckert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sigal et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, single inaccurate inhibitory inputs may be averaged with their immediate neighbors, resulting in more directionally accurate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for local dendritic integration and parallel processing</title><p>Dendritic subunits refer to regions of the dendritic tree that function semi-independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koch et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schachter et al., 2010</xref>). The spatial scale of DS subunits depends on several factors, including the branching patterns, the cable properties, and the expression of different voltage-gated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wybo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meier and Borst, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grimes et al., 2010</xref>). By contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlow and Levick (1965)</xref> defined a ‘DS subunit’ as the smallest subregion of a DSGC’s receptive field over which motion could elicit a DS spiking response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlow and Levick, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rivlin-Etzion et al., 2011</xref>). However, motion over spatially restricted regions of a DSGC’s receptive field may activate synaptic inputs over a much larger region of the dendritic arbor, owing to the spread of signals through laterally extending SAC dendrites. Thus, the Barlow-Levick DS subunits are only loosely related to the dendritic subunits described here, and thus both subunits define different aspects of the modular circuitry.</p><p>Although our data cannot speak to whether each dendritic site is capable of independently triggering Na<sub>V</sub>-dependent spikes, several pieces of evidence suggest that only a few inputs are required. First, paired recording studies in rabbit retina show that dendritic spiking in DSGCs can be triggered by the cholinergic synapses arising from a single SAC, which may only contact a few DSGC dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brombas et al., 2017</xref>). Second, similar to the sequential activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses that we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the general location of dendritic spike initiation is coupled to the position of the visual stimulus over the dendritic arbor, suggesting that local synaptic activity triggers dendritic spikes as a visual stimulus traverses the receptive field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brombas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sivyer and Williams, 2013</xref>). Third, in our study we found that activity is highly localized to a few distributed hot spots during null motion, implying that the few spikes that are often observed during null motion are likely generated by only a few synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In other directions, dendritic spikes are likely formed in a hierarchical manner through cooperative depolarizations from several smaller dendritic segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brombas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sivyer and Williams, 2013</xref>). Our work supports this hypothesis and extends it by showing that E/I within small dendritic segments hold highly accurate DS information. Locally accurate information may be a critical requirement for parallel processing of motion information, in which local synaptic activity can drive independent computations simultaneously at different locations in the dendritic arbor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schachter et al., 2010</xref>). A compelling prediction is that small integrative subunits would allow DSGCs to constantly resample motion information over their receptive fields, permitting fast adjustments in their spiking response to new or changing directional information.</p><p>The local dendritic integration model that the present data support contrasts with global integration schemes that have also been implicated in direction encoding. For instance, a recent analysis of subcellular glutamate transients in ON DSGC dendrites suggests that the glutamatergic excitatory input comes from kinetically distinct bipolar cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsumoto et al., 2019</xref>). Here, optimal temporal summation during preferred motion occurs over the course of the DSGC’s entire dendritic arbor. Further experimentation is required to determine whether global integrative mechanisms operate in different visual scenarios, or whether they work together with local mechanisms to reinforce decisions being made by individual dendrites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Since the theoretical studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rall (1962)</xref>, there has been broad interest in understanding the role of dendrites in neural processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stuart and Spruston, 2015</xref>). Being the receiving units of neural information, dendrites are well positioned to perform complex computations on their inputs that are critical for behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">London and Häusser, 2005</xref>). Previous work has discussed single dendrites as being the basic computational units of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Branco and Häusser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Branco and Häusser, 2010</xref>). Our data suggest that during natural patterns of activity, accurate DS information is present within small sections of the dendrites, supporting the possibility that single dendrites process complex visual information in parallel. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that DS neurons in the visual cortex also rely on E/I interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilson et al., 2018</xref>), and their circuits may be organized with more local specificity than previously envisioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scholl et al., 2017</xref>). Whether single neurons in cortical circuits require high spatiotemporal E/I coordination in order to prevent errant dendritic spiking remains to be determined.

A counterphase signal was used to turn on and off the projector LEDs during flyback and scan phases, respectively. This method prevents the bright projector light from contaminating the fluorescence signal from the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, and also minimizes the time that the tissue is exposed to the laser.</p><p>Photomultiplier tube (PMT) single photon currents were converted to voltages with a decay time constant of approximately 250 µs. These voltages were digitally sampled at a rate of 40 MHz, integrated for one microsecond through a custom time-integrating circuit (designed by Mike Delsey and Kerry Delaney, University of Victoria). This circuit outputs an analog voltage which was then digitized at 1 MHz (PCI-6110, National Instruments) for image formation. This helped decrease fluctuations in signal amplitude that arise from the asynchronous arrival times of single photons during the one microsecond dwell time at each image pixel, thereby improving signal to noise at low light levels characteristic of sparse synaptic activity.</p><p>Dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were extracted from small, 3–4 µm regions of interest (ROI). The ROI size was selected based on the typical spatial extent of isolated dendritic hot spots, and were made as small as possible while maintaining an acceptable SNR. Extracted signals were smoothed using a 2<sup>nd</sup> order Savitzky-Golay filter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>SAC ablation experiments</title><p>ON SACs on the null-side of the DSGCs, within 50–150 µm of its soma, were identified and targeted for physical ablation in <italic>Chat<sup>Cre</sup>::nGFP</italic> mouse line. Approximately ~3–7 identified SACs were mechanically ablated by injecting 20 nA current for 10–15 s until the SAC cell membrane was ruptured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacoby et al., 2015</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the ON arbor of the targeted ON-OFF DSGC were then measured in response to preferred and null motion. DSIs were calculated according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equation 6</xref> (see <italic>Quantification and Statistical Analysis</italic>). To compare these values to previous control experiments, control DSIs were recalculated using only preferred and null responses, rather than using all eight recorded directions. In some experiments, Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were measured in DSGC dendritic arbors before and after SAC ablation. In these experiments, DSGCs were loaded with OGB via single cell electroporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2016</xref>), and responses were measured in the presence of tetrodotoxin (0.5 µM TTX).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Computational modeling</title><p>A multi-compartmental model was coded in the NEURON environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hines and Carnevale, 1997</xref>). 177 pairs of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs were distributed across the dendritic arbor of a reconstructed ON-OFF DSGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poleg-Polsky and Diamond, 2016</xref>). Membrane capacitance and axial resistance were set to 1 µF/cm<sup>2</sup> and 100 Ω∙cm respectively. Membrane channels and noise were modeled using a stochastic Hodgkin and Huxley distributed mechanism. Non-voltage-gated leak conductances were set to reverse at −60 mV. Active membrane conductances were placed at the soma, primary dendrites and terminal dendrites with the following densities in mS/cm<sup>2</sup> (soma/primary dendrites/terminal dendrites): sodium (150/200/30), potassium rectifier (35/35/25), and delayed rectifier (0.8/0.8/0.8). This enabled the model DSGC to process inputs actively via dendritic sodium spikes. Sodium and potassium conductances were blocked for voltage-clamp recordings.</p><p>The membrane potential of 700 compartments across the dendritic arbor were recorded in response to a simulated edge moving across the receptive field at 1 mm/s. Onset times of each synaptic site varied around a mean value determined by the time at which the simulated edge passed over it. Random selections from Gaussian distributions determined whether or not synaptic release of inhibition and/or excitation was successful. For inhibition, the limits defining successful or unsuccessful release depend on the direction of motion, with more stringent limits during preferred motion when the probability of release is low, and broader limits during null motion when the probability of release is high. The release probability for excitatory synapses was held constant across all directions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>All analysis and statistical comparisons were done using Igor Pro (WaveMetrics). All population data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise specified. Angular data were expressed as angular mean ±angular standard deviation (σ<sub>θ</sub>). The preferred direction and strength of the directional tuning was defined as the vector summation of the component responses for the eight stimulus directions, which was computed as:<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">cos</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">sin</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ4"><label>(4)</label><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃑</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:msqrt></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ5"><label>(5)</label><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃑</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">tan</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>R<sub>i</sub></italic> is the response for the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> stimulus direction (<italic>θ</italic>), <italic>R<sub>x</sub></italic> and <italic>R<sub>y</sub></italic> are the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> components of the response, and <italic>R<sub>t</sub></italic> is the summed total of all responses. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃑</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⃑</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> are the length of the vector sum and its angle, respectively.

This is an extremely well studied circuit, but several details of the computation remain to be understood. The key question in this study is whether imprecise directional tuning in the dendrites averages out at the soma or whether, instead, directional tuning is already precise in small dendritic segments. The authors argue for the latter, showing very precise tuning and suggesting independent synaptic input down to the scale of ~5-10 μm. The results are consistent with a biophysical picture in which (1) Ca transients in the DSGC are spatially confined on a scale &lt;10 µm, and (2) synapses separated by ~10 μm receive input from different SAC dendrites, and (3) those SAC dendrites are tuned to within 30<italic>°</italic> (SD) of the same null direction.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) Framing of the study.</p><p>These observations about the spatial structure of SAC inputs to the DSGC are interesting and mostly consistent with expectation from the known anatomy. However, the authors frame the report in a very different light: as a study of spatially and temporally precise excitation-inhibition interactions within dendrites, for example: &quot;which allowed us for the first time to directly infer the degree to which the presynaptic excitatory and inhibitory inputs to DSGCs are functionally organized at a subcellular level&quot;; &quot;suggest that presynaptic excitatory and inhibitory inputs are precisely organized&quot;; &quot;patterns of presynaptic activity are coordinated with enough precision to support computations based on fine scale E/I integration&quot;; &quot;suggests that the underlying excitatory and inhibitory inputs are highly coordinated throughout the DSGC's dendritic tree&quot;; &quot;underlie the high fidelity of excitation and inhibition&quot;; &quot;tight spatial and temporal E/I coordination&quot;.</p><p>These claims are only half-supported. In the conventional wisdom, the excitatory input is almost entirely untuned and direction selectivity results from the inhibitory inputs. All the interesting dynamics of integration that produce direction-selectivity have been accomplished by the SAC already. Consistent with this conventional picture, the present experiments primarily report on inhibitory inputs to the DSGC, rather than any precise interaction of excitation and inhibition. There are multiple indications in this work that the details of excitation matter little, other than offering a baseline signal that can be inhibited: First, the overall excitatory input to the DSGC is untuned (Figure 1A). Second, when the authors perturb the excitation by blocking NMDA receptors the dendritic tuning remains the same (Figure 4). Third, the experiments do not manipulate the relative timing of excitation. In fact, one suspects that the dendritic tuning would be identical if they supplied the excitatory input entirely through the recording electrode. By contrast, when the inhibition gets removed, by knockout of vGAT (Figures 5C,D, Figure 6G) or with SAC ablation (Figure 8), the fluctuations and the DS in the Ca response mostly disappear. So the report is primarily about inhibition, not any detailed functional organization between excitation and inhibition.</p><p>We recommend that the authors reframe the study to emphasize what has been learned about the spatial distribution of inhibitory inputs. In general the observations seem to accord remarkably well with prior expectations from the anatomy of SAC-DSGC connections and the literature on presynaptic direction tuning at that same synapse (e.g. Poleg-Polsky et al., 2018). This itself may be a satisfying conclusion, but any deviations from those expectations could be highlighted as well.</p><p>As an alternative the authors might actually test whether there is any high-fidelity coordination of excitation and inhibition on a small scale, but that will require different experiments: separate manipulation of excitation and inhibition, and releasing the block on the dendritic sodium channels to observe any threshold nonlinearities that process the summed signal. A conventional picture of dendritic integration would suggest that E and I signals get summed over distances much greater than 10 μm before a spike is initiated.</p><p>2) The study seems to focus entirely on directional encoding in the ON arbors of the ON-OFF RGC without a clear justiﬁcation or explanation as to why. The spike recordings show responses to the leading and trailing edges of to the moving spots, are the resultant calcium signals conﬁned to their respective arbors? Do OFF dendrites show motion signals on a similar spatial scale?</p><p>3) The manuscript often refers to &quot;active conductances&quot; being blocked when in fact only Na<sub>V</sub> channels are blocked. Voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are essential for the measurement, and there is no discussion at all about possible roles of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels, or other active channels in the dendrites, if they exist. Some explanation would be helpful.</p><p>4) Subsection “Independent synaptic processing within small dendritic segments”, Figure 6: This analysis is about noise correlations, namely the fluctuations trial-to-trial that occur under the identical visual stimulus. Those fluctuations may well have a different origin from the systematic signal that produces directional tuning. The difference between noise and signal correlations and their interpretations and possible origins should be brought out better.</p><p>5) Subsection “Dendritic nonlinearities promote dendritic independence”: The model in Figure 7 seems poorly constrained. It is not clear how many free parameters there are, how they were chosen, and how robust the main ﬁnding is over parameter space.</p><p>6) Discussion section: Expand the section that relates known circuit anatomy to function. For example from the SAC coverage factor one can estimate how many null-side SACs connect to each OODS, providing additional context for the ablation experiments. Dramatic change in DSI in some spots and not others suggests that each hotspot might correspond to output from a single SAC. Similarly, the length scale of noise correlations may be related to the axonal arbor of a single bipolar cell. Non-specialists might not fully appreciate the size difference between an OODS RGC and the bipolar cells that are providing its excitatory input.</p><p>7) Subsection “Functional versus anatomical characterization of the circuit”: &quot;The directional tuning of dendritic sites was relatively homogeneous; 95% of the dendritic sites fell within 63° of the DSGC's true PD (two standard deviations). This is a much tighter distribution than can be estimated from the anatomical connectivity, which shows SAC dendrite orientations roughly equally represented across a 90° spread.&quot; Actually, the opposite seems to be the case and the anatomical connectivity sounds slightly tighter: a uniform distribution ranging over 90° has a standard deviation of 26°, less than the 31° reported here for dendritic tuning. Actually though, the close correspondence is another indication how well the observations in the present report accord with prior understanding from physiology and anatomy in this circuit.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52949.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) Framing of the study.</p><p>These observations about the spatial structure of SAC inputs to the DSGC are interesting and mostly consistent with expectation from the known anatomy.

We now illustrate the response variations at an earlier stage (Figure 3) and state this explicitly in the Discussion section (“since inhibition is thought to act as a shunt, its “visibility” is expected to be more spatiotemporally constrained compared to excitation (Koch et al., 1982; Rall, 1964; Torre and Poggio, 1978; Williams, 2004), and may have a dominant effect on the local variance.”)</p><p>B) However, we respectfully disagree with reviewer’s opinion that excitation is global (i.e. the dendritic tuning would be identical if the excitatory input was supplied through the recording electrode).</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>First, previous work has shown that inhibition is unable to shape excitation when excitation is provided through a dendritic recording electrode. Sivyer and Williams, 2013, demonstrated that dendritic spikes driven by a dendritic current injection are not suppressed by null motion (their Figure 7B-C) because the timing/location of the current injection (excitation) and the inhibitory input are not well matched.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Second, previous studies have shown that excitation does not act globally throughout the dendritic arbor of DSGCs. Using paired somato-dendritic recordings from ON DSGCs in rabbit, Sivyer and Williams, 2013, showed that the location of dendritic spike initiation is closely tied to the location of the visual stimulus (their Figure 1), indicating that dendritic spikes are triggered by excitatory activity local to the initiation site.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Similarly, in our study, we found the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals arise in dendritic branches are initiated at different times according to the location of the visual stimulus, confirming that excitation is acting locally in different dendritic branches. This result was originally a supplemental figure, but based on the reviewer’s comments, we moved it to a main figure (Figure 2 in the revised manuscript). We also support this result with further statistical analysis and discussion in the main text.</p></list-item></list><p>C) If excitation is non global, then it follows that SAC inputs would need to provide inhibition that is closely tied to excitation in space and time. Support for this idea comes from several studies described below:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>As mentioned about, dendritic spikes driven by a dendritic current injection are not suppressed by null motion because the timing/location of the current injection (excitation) and the inhibitory input are not well matched (Sivyer and Williams, 2013).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Schachter et al., 2010 also demonstrated the requirement of well-timed E/I at a given location, using a computational model.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cafaro and Rieke, 2010, demonstrated that excitation and inhibition were most strongly coordinated on a fine temporal scale for motion in the null direction (i.e. the strength of the noise correlations was highest for null motion). Poor E/I <italic>temporal</italic> coordination caused spurious spiking in the null direction and decreased the fidelity of stimulus encoding at the DSGC soma.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In our experiments, the tight <italic>spatial</italic> coordination of E/I is indicated by the sparsity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to null motion. If inhibition was placed at a distance, strong Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses would be expected to be consistently triggered at the points of excitation, which we did not observe in control conditions. This suggests the E/I are spatiotemporally co-activated as the stimulus crosses the dendritic arbor (except for a few instances, see text for detail). This result is now detailed in Figure 2 of the revised manuscript.</p></list-item></list><p>D) Finally, the reviewers refer to conventional DS models in which “the excitatory input is almost entirely untuned and direction selectivity results from the inhibitory inputs”, and conclude that “all the interesting dynamics of integration that produce direction-selectivity have been accomplished by the SAC already”. However, given the requirement for spatiotemporal E/I coordination, we argue that the SAC DS output only represents one important aspect of the circuit.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>In fact, in a recent study we found that abolishing DS in SAC dendrites leaves direction selectivity in the DSGC relatively intact. In the absence of DS SAC output the E/I timing differences alone can generate robust direction selectivity. Thus, the overall effectiveness of DS GABAergic inhibition in DSGCs depends <italic>both</italic> on the amplitude of SAC GABAergic output as well as on its relative timing with excitation (Hanson et al., 2019).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The direction-dependent timing differences in E/I are a natural outcome of the differential connectivity of GABAergic/cholinergic SAC inputs to DSGCs (Brombas et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2010; Yonehara et al., 2011). Thus, multiple specializations of the SAC circuitry underlie DS tuning at the level of DSGC dendrites. In the revised manuscript, we describe how timing differences can shape direction selectivity in more in detail.</p></list-item></list><p>In summary, given the narrow spatiotemporal window over which E/I is expected to interact, we argue that the dendritic tuning is not likely to be identical throughout the tree if the excitatory input was supplied through the recording electrode, as suggested by the reviewers. Thus, the strength of inhibition for each direction needs to be adjusted for each dendrite according to the amount of excitation it receives (if certain dendrites receive excess excitation, their Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses would be expected to be more poorly tuned).</p><p>Finally, the overall strength of DS inhibition that shapes dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in DSGC dendrites is determined by not only the strength of SAC output, but also how well coordinated it is with local excitatory signals at each dendrite, which is an important aspect of this study. While the precise temporal characteristics of E/I cannot be determined by Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, in a computational model based on the morphology of DSGCs, we found that disrupting tight E/I coordination could significantly compromise the directional spiking output of the DSGCs (deRosenroll and Awatramani, unpublished data; see Author response image 1). Here, the data show that the somatic currents cannot necessarily predict the spiking response, since the underlying E/I interactions are happening in the dendrites. We would be happy to include these data in the main manuscript if the reviewers feel that it brings clarity to this issue.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Correlated excitation and inhibition is critical for accurate and reliable direction selectivity.</title><p>These data are from a NEURON model (as described in the main manuscript) where the spatiotemporal correlation between the excitatory and inhibitory inputs was manipulated.

Precisely how inputs sum to generate dendritic spikes is an interesting question, but not the main issue that is being investigated in this study. Our data only emphasizes local postsynaptic E/I interactions as viewed through the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal nonlinearity, which gives us valuable insights into the presynaptic organization of the circuitry and the spatial dimensions over which direction selective information exists in DSGC dendrites.</p><p>We make this clear in the Discussion section (“Although our data cannot speak to whether each dendritic site is capable of independently triggering Na<sub>V</sub>-dependent spikes…”)</p><p>That being said, it is worth noting that the thresholding operation that triggers spiking may be quite similar to the thresholding operation associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, since the directional tuning of the spiking response and the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were significantly more similar to each other than they were to the subthreshold voltage (Figure 3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The study seems to focus entirely on directional encoding in the ON arbors of the ON-OFF RGC without a clear justiﬁcation or explanation as to why.

In our experiments, we used bright spots moving over a relatively dark ambient background, which generally produces stronger ON than OFF responses.

The model itself isn’t being fit to data—it is only a simulation—so there aren’t free parameters in that sense. We do test different voltage thresholds during our analysis of the model data, which is the only parameter that is varied. This should be clear from the main text and Materials and methods section. In the context of the current work, the point we wanted to emphasize with the model is that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are a nonlinear transformation of voltage, which will tend to encourage signal compartmentalization. While this has been shown to be the case in many systems (Grimes et al., 2010; Meier and Borst, 2019), we thought that showing this effect in the context of dendritic DS would help readers quickly grasp the concept.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Discussion section: Expand the section that relates known circuit anatomy to function.

We agree that the dramatic changes in local DSI suggest that each hot spot may be from a single (or a few) SAC inputs. As for the length scale of noise correlations, this likely reflects a combination of factors, rather than simply the size of the axonal arbor of bipolar cells (20-50μm). For instance, a series of axon terminals from a single bipolar cell likely contact completely different dendritic branches on a DSGC, since they project over a 20-50 μm area. It is also important to note that excitation arises from both glutamate from bipolar cells and acetylcholine from SACs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Subsection “Functional versus anatomical characterization of the circuit”: &quot;The directional tuning of dendritic sites was relatively homogeneous; 95% of the dendritic sites fell within 63° of the DSGC's true PD (two standard deviations). This is a much tighter distribution than can be estimated from the anatomical connectivity, which shows SAC dendrite orientations roughly equally represented across a 90° spread.&quot; Actually, the opposite seems to be the case and the anatomical connectivity sounds slightly tighter: a uniform distribution ranging over 90° has a standard deviation of 26°, less than the 31° reported here for dendritic tuning. Actually though, the close correspondence is another indication how well the observations in the present report accord with prior understanding from physiology and anatomy in this circuit.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out; the statement that the anatomical data shows a uniform distribution across 90° is unclear. While a uniform distribution over 90° does indeed result in a 26° angular standard deviation, this number doesn’t take into account the remainder of the distribution, which for the anatomy is much broader than what we’ve recorded in our calcium measurements. We made the original statement trying to emphasize the difference in distribution width, but now can see how it is misleading. To be clearer, we have altered this statement, and now also describe our counts of oppositely tuned sites to show that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> data are more tightly bound to the preferred direction than the anatomy predicts.</p></body></sub-article></article>
