Recent work, however, has shown that movements can be initiated earlier than typically expressed without affecting performance; hence, the RT may be modulated by factors other than computation time. Consistent with that view, we demonstrated that RTs are influenced by prior experience: when a previously performed task required a specific RT to support task success, this biased the RTs in future tasks. This effect is similar to the use-dependent biases observed for other movement parameters such as speed or direction. Moreover, kinematic analyses revealed that these RT biases could occur without changing the underlying computations used to perform the action. Thus the RT is not solely determined by computational requirements but is an independent parameter that can be habitually set by prior experience.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28075.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Often, we need to make split-second decisions, be it to avoid an accident, outwit someone in an argument or to win a game. The time that it takes to respond to a signal, i.e., the reaction time, might be the crucial factor to help us succeed or even survive. Many people assume that the reaction time represents the time needed to prepare an action, and to respond sooner one must ‘think faster’.</p><p>However, what really happens in the brain is not well understood. While more complex tasks seem to require longer reaction times, recent evidence suggests that determining when an action begins may not depend on how long it takes to decide which specific action should be taken. Indeed, reaction times may be shortened without changing the accuracy of the planned movement.</p><p>Using different performance tests, Wong et al. now demonstrate that the reaction time can be influenced by prior experience. In the first task, participants had to respond quickly to catch a moving target. When they later had to move toward a static target, their reaction times were reduced. In the second experiment, the participants practiced a task that required them to plan movements around obstacles. Participants were then given a hint that made it easier to plan their movements, but reaction times did not decrease as expected. Wong et al. then analyzed their movements and demonstrated that although reaction times remained the same, the hint did ease movement planning.</p><p>This suggests that the reaction time did not always reflect how long it took to prepare a response, but was influenced by prior experience. A next step will be to test what other factors may influence the reaction time. A deeper knowledge of these factors will help to avoid misinterpretation of neural data.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>use-dependent plasticity</kwd><kwd>reaction time</kwd><kwd>habit</kwd><kwd>bias</kwd><kwd>trajectory planning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BCS-1358756</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haith</surname><given-names>Adrian M</given-names></name><name><surname>Krakauer</surname><given-names>John W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS097423</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldsmith</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HL123407</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldsmith</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Although reaction times are often assumed to reflect the time required to select and prepare a movement, they can be strongly influenced by prior experience.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The reaction time (RT) is arguably the most widely used measure in neuroscience and psychology for noninvasively assessing processing in the brain: it is assumed to reflect the time needed to complete the perceptual and motor-planning computations required to prepare a response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donders, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sternberg, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friston et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spivey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanders, 1998</xref>). This assumption appears justified by evidence that RTs are modulated by factors such as stimulus complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaswan and Young, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hick, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ratcliff, 2002</xref>), stimulus-response compatibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fitts and Seeger, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Simon and Rudell, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simon and Wolf, 1963</xref>), number of potential responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Henry and Rogers, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fischman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christina et al., 1982</xref>), or required response accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fitts, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fitts, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reddi and Carpenter, 2000</xref>). According to this assumption, any reduction in the RT should negatively affect the quality of the resulting response. Indeed, instructing participants to respond as rapidly as possible can lead to a decrease in accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fitts, 1966</xref>), consistent with changes in accuracy that occur through more direct manipulation of allowed preparation time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schouten and Bekker, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghez et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stanford et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haith et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>However, recent evidence showed that it was possible to reduce the RT considerably before any decline in movement accuracy was observed. For example, when individuals were placed under strict time constraints, movement accuracy and task success decreased only after the RT was shortened by ~80 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haith et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, startle by a loud acoustic stimulus could evoke initiation of a fully prepared action ~70 ms earlier than typically observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Valls-SoleSolé et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlsen et al., 2004</xref>). These findings suggest that the RT includes some additional time that is not required for computing the upcoming response, raising the possibility that other factors might also influence the RT.</p><p>An additional clue that the RT does not strictly represent computation time comes from evidence that the RT is influenced by context. This was illustrated in a recent study examining the planning of intentionally curved reaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, the RTs of simple point-to-point reaches were observed to be shorter than those of more complex curved movements, consistent with the idea that RT reflects computation time. However, when point-to-point movements were interleaved among curved reaches, the RTs of those point-to-point reaches were surprisingly prolonged by ~90 ms, matching the RTs of the curved reaches. A similar contextual effect has been observed during mental rotation: during a letter discrimination task, identifying letters that were presented upright occurred at much shorter RTs when all the letters were upright compared to when other letters in the same block of trials were rotated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ilan and Miller, 1994</xref>). These data suggest that RTs might be subject to experience-dependent biases – akin to other movement parameters such as speed or direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diedrichsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Verstynen and Sabes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammerbeck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2011</xref>) – rather than arising strictly from the outcome of computational requirements. That is, RTs may be subject to habit in the sense that an RT of a given magnitude may become more likely to be generated in the future simply because it has been generated in the past, regardless of current task requirements.</p><p>Here we present results from two experiments which demonstrate that the RT is subject to experience-dependent effects. In the first experiment – a target-interception task – we showed that experience with initiating reaches at a short or long RT exerts a corresponding bias on the RTs of subsequently performed point-to-point reaches. In a second experiment, we demonstrated that these RT biases can also occur for more complex curved reaches around barriers. This barrier task can be performed with or without the presence of a direct cue illustrating the appropriate trajectory, corresponding to greater or lesser computational requirements respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2016</xref>). We found that participants’ RTs in the cued condition depended strongly on whether or not they had previously experienced the uncued condition. Analysis of the kinematics of these curved reaches allowed us to determine that the observed experience-dependent changes in RT were not due to habitually ignoring the cue and planning the movements in a different manner, but instead to habitually adopting a longer RT despite using a briefer computation (i.e., taking advantage of the cue) to solve the task. Together, these two experiments reveal that the RT does not strictly reflect the time needed to complete the computations required for preparing responses, but may instead be selected habitually according to prior experience.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1: RTs were biased according to performance in a previous task</title><p>In Experiment 1, we tested whether performance of a task that encouraged movements to be generated with particular RTs could affect the RTs of subsequent movements performed in a different context. We asked participants to perform an interception task to hit a target that moved in a straight line toward or away from the participant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For one group of 10 participants, the target always moved outward, encouraging participants to initiate reaches at shorter RTs to intercept the target before it moved beyond an invisible boundary and disappeared (see Materials and methods). For a second group of 10 participants, the target always moved inward. This encouraged participants to increase their RTs, since they could reduce the effort required to complete this task by waiting for the target to move closer before reaching out to hit it. In both cases, participants were given no specific RT instruction. Additionally, because participants were not required to stop inside the target on interception trials, participants typically generated shooting movements through the target. Immediately before and after participants performed this interception task, we measured their RTs for simple point-to-point reaches (wherein the hand had to stop inside the target and move at a constrained speed) to assess any experience-related changes in RT.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28075.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Movement parameters for Experiment 1.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Reaction time (ms)</th><th valign="top">Peak velocity (m/s)</th><th valign="top">Endpoint error (cm)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"/><td colspan="3" valign="top">Outward Interception</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Pre-training</td><td valign="top">295.38 ± 14.98</td><td valign="top">0.66 ± 0.02</td><td valign="top">1.16 ± 0.10</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Last training block</td><td valign="top">255.20 ± 7.85</td><td valign="top">1.28 ± 0.10</td><td valign="top">n/a</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Post-training</td><td valign="top">273.20 ± 12.10</td><td valign="top">0.67 ± 0.01</td><td valign="top">1.32 ± 0.22</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td colspan="3" valign="top">Inward Interception</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Pre-training</td><td valign="top">290.76 ± 18.35</td><td valign="top">0.55 ± 0.02</td><td valign="top">1.09 ± 0.06</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Last training block</td><td valign="top">564.82 ± 112.11</td><td valign="top">0.27 ± 0.04</td><td valign="top">n/a</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Post-training</td><td valign="top">303.63 ± 17.25</td><td valign="top">0.57 ± 0.01</td><td valign="top">1.05 ± 0.04</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>RT, peak velocity, and endpoint error for the two groups in Experiment 1 for point-to-point movements measured before and after training, as well as for shooting movements during the last block of training.

These reductions in RT persisted in the final phase of the experiment when the target was again stationary: RTs during the post-training point-to-point reaching block were shorter than in the analogous pre-training block by 21.68 ± 6.32 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; paired t-test comparing post to pre, <italic>t</italic>(9) = −3.43, p=0.02). This change in RT from pre-training to post-training was on average 76.6% of the total reduction in RT associated with the outward-interception task (i.e., pre-training compared to the last outward-interception training block). Importantly, these changes in RT for point-to-point movements occurred with no significant change in either peak velocity (paired t-test comparing post to pre, <italic>t</italic>(9) = 0.98, p=0.70) or endpoint error (paired t-test comparing post to pre, <italic>t</italic>(9) = 0.95, p=0.70). Thus, repeatedly generating movements at low RTs led to a reduction of the RT on subsequent point-to-point reaches with no detectable decrement in performance.</p><p>Interception of an inward-moving target had the opposite effect on behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref> – Inward; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

This interaction was driven by a difference in RT only during the post-training block (post-hoc test, p=0.03), since RTs during the pre-training block were comparable.

Comparable to our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2016</xref>), we observed that participants provided with a path cue exhibited a large RT advantage of 52.94 ms compared to individuals performing the task without the path cue (initial cueing condition experienced by each group; uncued: 349.76 ± 8.81 ms; cued: 296.82 ± 7.68 ms; main effect of condition, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1)=500.61, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Although the RT difference is smaller than observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2016</xref>), this is likely attributable to the fact that there were fewer possible barrier configurations presented in the current task compared to the previous version, that is, consistent with Hick’s law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hick, 1952</xref>).</p><p>Each group was then exposed to a block of trials with the opposite cue condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>); that is, participants who first performed cued trials were next asked to perform the task without path cues, and vice versa. This switch revealed a similar experience-dependent effect as in Experiment 1. Specifically, whereas there was an RT advantage associated with the availability of a cue during the initial training block, when the conditions were switched the two groups exhibited similar RTs regardless of the presence or absence of the cue (cueing condition during the second block: uncued: 334.75 ± 8.17 ms, cued: 336.74 ± 8.01; <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1)=0.035, p=0.85; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This experience-dependent effect of path cues on the RT was confirmed by a significant main effect of the order in which the cued and uncued conditions were experienced (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1)=11.55, p&lt;0.001), as well as a significant interaction between condition and order (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1)=105.42, p&lt;0.001). This effect could not be attributed to changes in the RTs of uncued trials performed first compared to second (p=0.25); instead, this interaction arose because RTs were significantly longer on cued trials when participants had previously performed a block of uncued trials (p&lt;0.001). Hence participants actually exhibited longer RTs on less computationally demanding cued trials if they experienced this condition second, even though they had more experience performing a more challenging version of the task.</p><p>Interestingly, in Experiment 2A the RTs in the cued blocks (but not the uncued blocks) exhibited a slow asymptotic decline across trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The rate of decline was not different between the two groups (non-significant interaction between group and trial, <italic>t</italic> = −1.46, p=0.14). Power-law fits to the time series of latencies yielded similar exponents for both groups (cued trials experienced first: −0.025; cued trials experienced second: −0.029). This decline suggests that both groups were responding to the appearance of the path cues in a similar manner, perhaps by learning to take advantage of the cues when planning their movements (see the section below). Nevertheless, a constant RT offset remained across the entire block, reflecting a strong, persistent RT bias for the group that had prior experience with the uncued condition (<italic>t</italic> = 8.56, p&lt;0.001). Hence, even in this more complex task of generating reaches around barriers, RTs could be biased by prior experience.</p><p>In contrast to RT, task success in hitting the target while avoiding the barriers did not significantly vary with cueing condition or condition order (no effect of condition, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1)=2.26, p=0.13; no effect of order, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1)=2.50, p=0.11; non-significant interaction, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(1)=1.63, p=0.20). That is, participants who were exposed to the uncued condition first did not become more successful when they switched to the simpler, cued version of the task (uncued block: 81.97 ± 2.56% successful; cued block: 85.81 ± 1.62% successful; posthoc test, p=0.14); nor did participants who were first exposed to the cued condition become less successful when switched to the more difficult uncued task (cued block: 88.41 ± 1.66% successful; cued block: 88.02 ± 2.73% successful; posthoc test, p=1.00). Note that in all cases participants could have further improved their task success. Thus while participants who initially performed the uncued condition exhibited prolonged RTs in the subsequent cued condition, this RT increase did not confer any performance advantage (as measured by task success) as might be expected by a speed-accuracy trade-off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fitts, 1966</xref>).</p><p>We observed that RTs for cued trials were longer if participants had previously performed uncued trials, but not vice versa; RTs for uncued trials were independent of whether or not participants had previously performed cued trials. This asymmetry may have arisen because participants already had the minimum possible RTs for the uncued condition, but were free to increase their RTs in the cued condition. However, it is also possible that this asymmetry was simply due to participants in the uncued-first group happening to require longer RTs even when a cue was present. To address this issue, a separate group of 12 participants (Experiment 2B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) were first exposed to cued trials, which they completed at low RTs. We then asked these participants to complete two additional blocks: a block of uncued trials, followed by a second block of cued trials. We predicted that participants would increase their RTs during the first transition (cued to uncued) but, due to the asymmetric habit effect, would not return to their previously-expressed low RTs when the cues were reintroduced.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28075.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>RTs in Experiment 2B.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average RTs during each block, in the order that blocks were experienced in the experiment (from left to right).

One possibility is that participants might simply have adopted habitually long RTs regardless of the underlying computational demands of the current trial. Alternatively, participants that had initially been exposed to uncued trials might have ignored the cues when they became available and instead continued to plan the movement trajectories de novo – a more computationally demanding means of planning that requires prolonged RTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2016</xref>). To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined the kinematics of movements made with and without path cues, to find evidence of qualitatively different modes of movement planning. Specifically, we reasoned that the trajectories of movements planned using the cue should more closely resemble the path cues than movements planned de novo, regardless of the RTs at which these movements were initiated.</p><p>We found that the presence of path cues significantly influenced movement kinematics in a consistent manner across participants: the shapes of the average trajectories for the cued and uncued conditions (pairs of blue and green lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) were significantly different for at least one point along the length of the trajectory in 70% of all the target-barrier configurations performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, significant differences between trajectory pairs along the movement are denoted by yellow dots). For those trajectories where differences were observed, on average 21% of the movement was found to be significantly different depending on the condition. These differences often occurred near the start of the movement, wherein the hand passed closer to the starting barrier on cued trials. However, there was no significant effect of the order in which the conditions were performed; moreover, no kinematic differences were noted when comparing reaches performed in the same cueing condition (i.e., between cued trials experienced first or second, or between uncued trials experienced first or second). Thus cued reaches were always executed in a similar fashion regardless of whether participants had prior experience with the uncued condition.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28075.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Movement kinematics in Experiment 2A depended on the presence of the path cue.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average reach trajectories across participants for each barrier configuration for uncued (blue) and cued (green) conditions.

Together, these data suggest that participants used the path cue to simplify planning their movements whenever it was available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2016</xref>); that is, participants were changing how they planned their movements in response to the cue, which resulted in quantitative changes in the kinematics of their actions such that movements more closely resembled the cued paths. Similar effects were observed in Experiment 2B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for Experiment 2B kinematics analysis); in fact, the kinematics in the second cued block resembled the path cues more closely than even those of the initial cued block (effect of block: −0.04, 95% confidence intervals [−0.07,–0.02], Bayes factor = 0.39) – a finding that would be expected to reduce RTs as participants took advantage of the cue, not prolong them (e.g., consistent with Experiment 2A). Hence despite evidence suggesting that reaches were planned on a trial-by-trial basis in an experience-independent manner (in particular by relying on the cue to plan the action), RTs did not consistently reflect the computational benefit afforded by the path cue. Instead, RTs exhibited an experience-dependent bias that was unrelated to how these reaches were being planned and executed.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although the RT is typically assumed to directly reflect the computation time required to plan a movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donders, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sternberg, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friston et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spivey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanders, 1998</xref>), we demonstrated here that the RT may instead be influenced by previous experience. This was not simply a practice effect leading to more efficient planning of the same action; RT was influenced by recently generated RTs in the past even when those RTs were produced during another task with a different type of movement (e.g., in Experiment 1 the RTs of shooting movements to intercept a target biased the RTs of subsequent point-to-point reaches to stationary targets). This effect, while small, is comparable in magnitude to the RT changes previously observed in response to the addition of a delay period between stimulus and go cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>), or to changes in stimulus or response complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fitts, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fitts, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hick, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simon, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Henry and Rogers, 1960</xref>, for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Teichner and Krebs, 1974</xref>). Moreover, we showed that RTs can be modulated to be either shorter or longer than previously expressed depending on the nature of the interposed task, and that these effects persisted across a large number of subsequent trials. Thus in general, the RT expressed on any given trial may be lengthened or shortened (by 20–30 ms) strictly due to prior experience, with no other measurable impact on performance.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Changes in motivation cannot explain RT biases</title><p>Experiment 1 provides clear evidence that the RT can be modulated in an experience-dependent manner as if by a habit, and that such biases persist over a large number of trials. However, this paradigm was unable to ascertain whether these RT biases arose because of changes in the rate of computational processing, or because of effects on the non-computational portion of the RT. In the former case, changing the duration of computational processes could increase task success, particularly when shortening the RT in the outward-interception task. Thus there was a motivational incentive that could drive changes in the speed-accuracy trade-off in favor of shortened RTs while maintaining consistent accuracy (e.g., motivation could have driven an increase in the rate at which evidence accumulated in a drift-diffusion model of RT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ratcliff, 1978</xref>]), much in the same way that reward can reduce RT without affecting accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takikawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hübner and Schlösser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Salinas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manohar et al., 2015</xref>). This modified speed-accuracy trade-off may then have been retained when planning subsequent point-to-point movements. Alternatively, if RT biases simply reflect modulation of the non-computational portion of the RT, the manner in which movements are planned should remain unchanged.</p><p>Two pieces of evidence from Experiment 1 speak against the hypothesis that the observed changes in RT occurred through a motivational effect. First, the RT bias persisted across a large number of trials (e.g., the entire next block) with no obvious decay toward the initially expressed RT. This persistence stands in contrast to the short-lived effects of motivation, which appear to decay after only a few subsequent trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takikawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu-Wilson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). Second, the effect of motivation typically influences not just the RT, but also movement speed and accuracy; in general, these three parameters have often been observed to modulate together in response to motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takikawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). However, we observed no obvious changes in other movement kinematics such as movement speed or accuracy that accompanied the RT biases. On the other hand, speed and accuracy were constrained by task requirements during the point-to-point movement blocks. Nevertheless, these data suggest that motivation alone cannot account for the long-lasting RT biases observed in Experiment 1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Habitual initiation rather than habitual planning</title><p>The kinematically more complex trajectories required in Experiment 2 provided us with greater sensitivity to examine whether RT biases arose from effects on the computational or the non-computational portion of the RT. That is, we were better able to detect any execution-related differences that may have arisen from subtle changes in movement planning that were associated with changes in RT.</p><p>During Experiment 2, participants in the cued condition could have initiated their movements at short RTs; however, they exhibited persistently prolonged RTs when previously exposed to the more computationally demanding uncued condition. Such a bias in RT could have occurred for one of two reasons. Participants may have persisted in planning trajectories in the same manner as they had done without path cues, despite the availability of the path cue that would eliminate the need for this planning stage (<italic>habitual planning</italic>). Alternatively, participants may have used the path cue to reduce the computational load for planning but simply did not express their prepared actions earlier; that is, perhaps the RT does not strictly reflect computation time, but instead contains a manipulable, non-computational component that may be subject to habit (<italic>habitual initiation)</italic>.</p><p>The analysis of movement kinematics allowed us to distinguish between these two alternatives. In particular, we demonstrated that movement kinematics changed in a consistent manner in the presence or absence of the path cues, arguing that differences in movement kinematics do reflect changes in how these actions were being planned. However, we observed no effect of condition order on trajectory kinematics (i.e., reach kinematics were always influenced similarly by the path cues when they were available, regardless of whether participants had prior experience with uncued trials), suggesting that participants did not ever exhibit habitual cue-free preparation of the movement trajectory when generating reaches in the presence of a cue. This is particularly evident in Experiment 2B, when movement kinematics indicate a particularly strong reliance on the cue to plan the action in the second cued block even though the RT did not reflect such changes in movement planning. Moreover, reaches in the uncued and cued conditions were confined to different portions of the workspace, making it unlikely that participants habitually applied the identical motor plans from previously-performed uncued reaches. These findings stand in contrast to the RT, which did not consistently modulate according to the presence or absence of the path cue, but was instead experience-dependent. Hence these data suggest that unlike motor planning – which is determined by the current task at hand – movement onset may be influenced in a use-dependent manner consistent with the idea of habitual initiation, and therefore may not represent the actual time required to prepare a movement.</p><p>If the RT can be habitual, this implies that the time of movement initiation is not simply the end result of computational processing but may actually be represented as a separate movement parameter during the pre-movement period, analogous to movement speed. Indeed, previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brown and Robbins, 1991</xref>) has suggested that movement initiation may be independent of movement planning. Such a distinction between planning and initiation is consistent with recent data suggesting that an initiation signature can be observed in motor cortex preceding movement onset in a manner that is independent of the specific action being prepared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaufman et al., 2016</xref>). Our finding that movement initiation can be determined by prior experience, rather than the time when planning has completed, further supports this view.</p><p>Selection of RT based on prior experience rather than computation time implies that it should be possible to choose a RT that is too short to allow for all planning processes to be completed prior to movement initiation. Consistent with this idea, there indeed appear to be situations in which the RT is spontaneously chosen to be improperly short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orban de Xivry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haith et al., 2016</xref>). In such cases, however, online corrections and refinements that occur after movement initiation help ensure a successful movement outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orban de Xivry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kohen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wong and Haith, 2017</xref>). Hence, in the event that the RT is biased to be shorter than the time required to complete all necessary decision-making and planning-related computations, the motor system has online correction mechanisms in place to maintain overall task success.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A common feature of movement parameters is that they are subject to experience-dependent biases</title><p>Experience-dependent biases have been previously demonstrated for movement parameters such as speed or direction.

Repetition has also been shown to influence the direction of movement invoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Classen et al., 1998</xref>). In these cases, however, the influence of prior experience on movement biases appears for the most part to be short-lived, unlike the long-lasting effects seen here in the RT.</p><p>Why experience-dependent biases occur is still unclear. It has previously been proposed that such biases may simply be a result of Hebbian learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bütefisch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bütefisch et al., 2004</xref>): repetition of the same action presumably strengthens the neural circuits that give rise to that movement, making it more likely to be invoked in the future. From a theoretical standpoint, experience-dependent biases have been framed in the context of a normative Bayesian model in which repetition leads to the construction of a strong prior that influences the preparation of future responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Verstynen and Sabes, 2011</xref>). Regardless of whether one uses a mechanistic or computational framework, however, explanations for experience-dependent biases rely on the assumption that the parameter in question – e.g., speed or direction – is represented as a movement parameter that can be specified prior to movement. Therefore, experience-dependent biases on the RT imply that the RT is not simply the passive consequence of the time required to complete computational processing, but may instead be represented as a separate movement parameter that can be subject to habit.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, these data support the hypothesis that the RT should be considered a distinct parameter that is selected during the pre-movement period; that is, the RT may in part reflect, but is not strictly dependent upon, underlying computational processes. Thus, caution must be taken when interpreting differences in RT as indicative of the existence of computational stages with smaller or larger processing demands. Such RT differences may simply reflect carryover from RTs recently exhibited in the past (i.e., habit), regardless of computational demands.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Fifty-six right-handed, adult (average age, 23.27 years old; 26 males) neurologically healthy participants were recruited for this study. Twenty individuals participated in Experiment 1 (10 individuals in each group); 24 individuals participated in Experiment 2A (12 individuals per group), and 12 individuals participated in Experiment 2B. Group sizes were chosen based on findings from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2016</xref>). All participants provided written informed consent and were naive to the purposes of the study. Experimental methods were approved by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine institutional review board.</p><p>Participants made planar reaching movements with their right arm along the surface of a glass table. Their wrist was restrained in a wrist splint, and supported by pressurized air jets to allow frictionless movement of the elbow and shoulder. Vision of the arm was obscured by a mirror through which participants observed an LCD monitor (60 Hz), which displayed targets and a cursor representing the position of the index finger in a veridical horizontal plane. Movement of the index finger was tracked using a Flock of Birds magnetic tracking system (Ascension Technology, VT, USA) at 130 Hz.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental paradigms</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Experiment 1: Interception task</title><p>Targets appeared at any of 4 possible positions uniformly spaced every 90° along a circle centered on the start position. After a brief delay of 100 ms, the target immediately began moving, and the participant was required to intercept the target before it vanished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the outward-interception task, the target appeared 4 cm from the start position and moved outward until it was either intercepted or it reached 26 cm away from the start position, at which point it disappeared. Blocks consisted of 60 reaches (15 to each of the 4 target directions presented in a pseudo-randomized order); the target moved at a speed of 0.15 m/s in the first block, 0.225 m/s in the second block, and 0.3 m/s for the remaining 4 blocks. In the inward-interception task, the target appeared 24 cm away from the subject and began moving inward at a velocity of 0.12 m/s during each of the 5 blocks of 60 trials until it was intercepted or it reached the starting position. Participants had only one attempt to hit the target; the trial ended when the hand stopped moving (velocity &lt;0.05 m/s) or the hand exceeded the current target radius from the starting position.</p><p>Prior to and following these interception blocks, participants completed 60-trial blocks in which they were required to make point-to-point reaching movements to stationary targets located 15 cm away from the start position, uniformly spaced every 90°. Participants were also encouraged to satisfy a velocity criterion on each trial (between 0.6 and 0.9 m/s for the outward interception task, or between 0.5 and 0.8 m/s for the inward interception task), although no trials were excluded from analysis based on movement velocity. These differences in velocity criterion were deliberately chosen to encourage reaches at speeds that were comparable to those made during the interception training. Encouraged adherence to a velocity criterion simply allowed for an assay of changes in RT due to training on the interception task independently of any potential changes in movement speed. For both the pre- and post-training blocks, the first 10 trials were discarded from analysis to ensure that block averages for each participant reflected steady-state behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Experiment 2: Barrier task</title><p>Experimental methods were similar to a barrier-avoidance task reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2016</xref>) in which participants were required to generate a reaching movement toward a target while avoiding barriers that appeared around both the start position and the goal target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Targets appeared at any of eight positions uniformly spaced every 45° along a circle of radius 12 cm; barriers consisted of three-sided boxes that could be oriented at any of eight angles (rotated in 45° increments). Participants initiated a trial by moving their hand into a central start position; after a random delay (600–1600 ms), the goal target and two barriers appeared (one around the start position and one around the goal target). Participants were instructed to begin their movement as soon as possible, and to reach toward the goal target while avoiding the barriers. As soon as participants initiated their reach, all visual information except the start position and the hand cursor disappeared. Participants stopped moving when they thought they reached the target location; upon conclusion of the movement they received visual feedback about their movement trajectory. In Experiment 2A, participants completed two blocks of 128 trials; in Experiment 2B, participants additionally completed a third block of 128 trials.</p><p>During one of the two blocks (or for Experiment 2B, the first and third blocks), participants were given a path cue in the form of a line drawn between the start position and goal target that navigated around the barriers. Additionally, in each block targets were confined to either the upper left or the lower right half of the screen such that all movements for a given block were confined to specific portions of the workspace. The direction of targets was different in the first and second block; thus, participants never performed the identical movements with and without a path cue, although cued and uncued reaches were rotationally symmetric (affording kinematic comparisons). The target direction associated with a given block was counterbalanced across participants (in Experiment 2B the target direction was the same for the first and third blocks for any given participant).</p><p>The presented path cues represented the average hand path taken to avoid the barriers from a prior experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2016</xref>). The participants in Experiment 2A were subdivided evenly into two groups; in one group, participants performed uncued trials first to establish a history of performing a computationally difficult task, followed by cued blocks of trials (Group 1: uncued trials first, cued trials second) while the remaining participants were given the opposite order of blocks (Group 2: cued trials first, uncued trials second). This allowed us to examine whether experience at performing reaches in the presence or absence of a path cue could bias future RTs. In Experiment 2B, all participants performed a block of cued trials, a block of uncued trials, and a final block of cued trials. Note that for both Experiment 2A and 2B, an equal number of participants within each group experienced cued reaches to the upper left as experienced cued reaches to the lower right; thus, kinematic differences across subjects could not be attributed to any movement direction-specific biases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed offline using programs written in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA) and in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">R Development Core Team, 2016</xref>). Analysis code and data are available on GitHub at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/BLAM-Lab-Projects/RT_habit">https://github.com/BLAM-Lab-Projects/RT_habit</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wong, 2017</xref>). A copy is archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/RT_habit">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/RT_habit</ext-link>. Reaches were selected according to a velocity criterion (tangential velocity greater than 0.05 m/s) and verified by visual inspection. For each movement, RT was computed as the time between target onset and movement initiation. Inherent delays in the system were estimated to be 105 ms on average; all RTs have been corrected to compensate for this delay. Velocity was calculated by taking the numerical derivative of the hand position after smoothing using a second-order Savitzky-Golay filter with a frame size of 19 samples. Endpoint error was calculated as the absolute radial distance between the final position of the hand and the center of the target. All values are reported along with S.E.M.</p><p>In Experiment 1, RT, peak velocity, and interception amplitude were measured during interception training blocks. The amplitude of the target at the time of interception was calculated as the distance of the target away from the central starting position at the first time the hand entered the target; if the participant was not successful at intercepting the target, no target amplitude was recorded for that trial. During pre- and post-interception blocks, RT, peak velocity, and endpoint error were measured for point-to-point reaches. These three metrics were compared within groups using paired t-tests, with p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni-Holm corrections. RT was also compared across groups using a mixed-effects model in R using the <italic>lme4</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bates et al., 2015</xref>), with post-hoc pairwise tests performed using the generalized linear hypothesis testing function in the <italic>multcomp</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hothorn et al., 2008</xref>) and adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni-Holm correction.</p><p>In Experiment 2, trials were excluded if participants did not complete their reach within 1200 ms. Additionally, since most barrier configurations had more than one possible solution (e.g. above or below a barrier), we pre-selected one possible path as ‘canonical’ and presented that solution on path-cued trials; any ‘non-canonical’ reaches were excluded to allow for a fair comparison of RTs for movements of comparable kinematics. Reaches were not excluded if participants simply hit one of the barriers or did not reach close enough to the target to be considered successful on that trial but otherwise satisfied the inclusion criteria noted above. On average across participants, about 7.5% of reaches were excluded from uncued blocks and 3.0% of reaches were excluded from cued blocks.</p><p>RTs were compared in R with mixed-effects models using the <italic>lme4</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bates et al., 2015</xref>). For Experiment 2A, this model treated order (uncued reaches first or cued reaches first) and condition (cued or uncued) as fixed effects and barrier configuration and participant as random effects. Significant effects were determined using a likelihood ratio test to compare pairs of models (with and without the factor of interest). In Experiment 2B, there was only a main effect of block (1, 2, or 3), with post hoc tests performed in R using the generalized linear hypothesis testing function in the <italic>multcomp</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hothorn et al., 2008</xref>). All <italic>p</italic>-values obtained from post hoc tests were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni-Holm corrections.</p><p>The time course of the change in RT during path-cued blocks was compared across groups by fitting generalized linear models in R with factors of group and trial using the <italic>nlme</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pinheiro et al., 2014</xref>) to account for the autocorrelated covariance structure across time within participants. These models remove any autocorrelation structure across trials for each participant individually prior to examining main effects; the form of the autocorrelation structure was selected by fitting Autoregressive-Moving Average (ARMA) models to the data and selecting the model fit that yielded the lowest Aikake Information Criterion on average across participants; this led to a choice of an ARMA(1,1) process.</p><p>Movement kinematics were examined using two methods. First, movements were compared using tools of functional data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldsmith and Kitago, 2016</xref>). Briefly, trajectories were time-normalized and evenly resampled. For each trajectory, mean pairwise differences were examined using a function-on-scalar regression model fit using a Bayesian method that allows for correlations in the errors. A 95% simultaneous posterior credible interval was used to identify significant differences between conditions, accounting for the multiple comparisons made across time points within a single trajectory but not for multiple comparisons across trajectories.</p><p>Second, movement trajectories were also examined by comparing the shape similarity of each movement to the path cue using a Procrustes distance metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goodall, 1991</xref>). The Procrustes distance finds the best combination of translation, rotation, and scaling to match a shape to its template, then estimates the remaining dissimilarity normalized between 0 and 1, where 0 implies the two shapes are perfectly matched. For each movement, the Procrustes distance was estimated; then the overall distributions of Procrustes distances for the cued and uncued conditions were compared using a generalized linear mixed model with a log-normal link function using <italic>brms</italic>, an R interface to the Stan language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buerkner, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carpenter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoffman and Gelman, 2014</xref>). This generalized linear mixed model had main effects of order (uncued reaches first or cued reaches first) and condition (cued or uncued); significant effects were estimated by calculating Bayes factors to test the null hypothesis that the effect coefficient is equal to zero (according to whether the confidence intervals of the effect included zero).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NSF grant BCS-1358756 to John W.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom, Jennifer L Raymond (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mark M Churchland (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Reaction time (RT) is one of the most widely used metrics in studies of primate behavior, based on the idea that it is an external reflection of internal neural processing time. This idea has been very influential, and had extensive impact on how neural data are interpreted. The present study challenges this view, by making a compelling case that RT is significantly affected by previous experience, and hence is not necessarily a reliable indicator of the time required for computation on the current trial. The study is simple and well designed. The results are appropriately analyzed and have broad implications for the interpretation of the widely used RT measure. The few concerns of the reviewers can be addressed with editing of the text for clarity.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This study makes a case that reaction time (RT) is a free parameter that can be affected by past experience, rather than a simple consequence of the time required for computation in the current trial. The results have broad implications for the interpretation of the widely used RT measure. In general, the study appears to be well designed, and the results appropriately analyzed. My main reservation is that some of the effects sizes are quite small, making the results less convincing. Also, the presentation could be improved in some places to make this relatively simple study easier to digest by the reader.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the increase in RT was not significant, and hence should not be described as an increase in subsection “Experiment 1: RTs were biased to be longer or shorter according to performance in a previous task”, and other places in the text.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>: differences in trajectory are small, and inconsistent between subjects.</p><p>Subsection “Experience-dependent RT biases were observed for curved reaches around barriers”: Success in hitting the target while avoiding barriers should be reported. If the success rate is already close to 100% for uncued, then a ceiling effect could be what is preventing detection of an effect on performance despite the altered reaction time.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is a pretty straightforward study, whose conclusions might almost be considered too simple. However, given that the RT is one of the most heavily studied aspects of human behavior, it is essential to understand the factors that influence it.</p><p>Historically, the RT has been heavily used because it is one of the few external measures of internal processing time. Without neural recordings, one cannot view internal processes such as movement planning / preparation. However, it is generally believed / assumed that one can at least use the RT to measure how long those processes take. In the simplest version of this idea, movement planning / preparation are key events whose culmination results in movement onset. The simplest version would be activity rising to a threshold. Under this conception, the time from stimulus to movement onset by definition reflects the time for movement preparation. A more nuanced (and probably more accurate) view is that preparation is independent from movement triggering, but that triggering normally waits for preparation to finish. In this view, the RT is typically still assumed to mostly reflect the time for preparatory processing to complete, because it is assumed that motivated subjects (humans or animals) pull the trigger almost immediately upon completion of preparation. The idea that the RT is a behavioral window on processing time has been very influential, and has extensively impacted how neural data are interpreted. For example, the ability to relate pre-movement neural activity to RT has been important in understanding the role of that activity, and in making the case that it is preparation-related.</p><p>The present study makes a strong case that the RT reflects enough different factors that it shouldn't necessarily be considered a reliable indicator of computational processing time. The changes in RT due to these 'non-processing-time' factors are not large, but they are as large as the processing time that is usually inferred from changes in RT with delay period (20–100ms depending on task difficulty). I was persuaded by the experiments that the RT is indeed often driven by factors other than processing time. This might seem kind of obvious, but it isn't considered that often (or if it is, it tends to be ignored as an inconvenient fact). The present work is compelling, and relates to other recent work from the same lab that argued that the time of movement onset can be chosen independently of the time for preparation to complete. The present work demonstrates that this is perhaps the normal state of affairs, with the RT reflecting a variety of history-based effects. This is in some ways inconvenient and annoying: it means that the RT should be used with caution as a metric of computation time. On the other hand, the present work opens up new avenues to studying the factors that determine when the 'movement trigger' is pulled, and how that process is or isn't influence by the progress of movement preparation. Both these contributions (the caution, and the new avenue) are important.</p><p>The manuscript is generally well written, but could be tightened and clarified in places. I found the 'Changes in motivation' section of the Discussion a bit rambling and confusing. I kept being confused regarding whether increased motivation was being proposed to be the same thing as a speeding of the computational process. I would have usually thought of these as different (e.g., I might really want to solve the problem faster, but there is a limit) but I can see others as thinking they are the same. This section read as a bit reactionary against a potential criticism I didn't really understand. The clearest part of the Discussion is definitely the conclusions, which lay out a clear set of statements regarding how the present findings should be interpreted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28075.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</italic></p><p><italic>Reaction time (RT) is one of the most widely used metrics in studies of primate behavior, based on the idea that it is an external reflection of internal neural processing time.

Hence, although these effects comprise only a fraction of the total RT, they have an important bearing on the interpretability of other studies that attempt to draw conclusions about processing time based on changes in RT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p> <italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the increase in RT was not significant, and hence should not be described as an increase in subsection “Experiment 1: RTs were biased to be longer or shorter according to performance in a previous task”, and other places in the text.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the wording as appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>: differences in trajectory are small, and inconsistent between subjects.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there are inconsistencies between different movement trajectories, but this may be due to idiosyncrasies with particular curved-movement shapes themselves that makes them more or less difficult to execute, for which we did not have a strong <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis. However, this figure and our findings summarize a repeated-measures analysis across participants per trajectory; thus, any significant point (i.e., yellow dot) indicates a consistent difference in the manner in which that trajectory was executed across all participants. Since these effects appear fairly small, we also performed the procrustes distance analysis to allow us to better quantify how different these trajectories were from each other in comparison to the path cue. We have now clarified this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p> <italic>Subsection “Experience-dependent RT biases were observed for curved reaches around barriers”: Success in hitting the target while avoiding barriers should be reported.

The success rate is fairly high, but is not close enough to 100% to suggest that there is a ceiling effect preventing detection of a performance difference on cued trials that would reflect the observed differences in RT. If anything, there is a bigger difference in success between groups than across conditions within group, again suggesting a ceiling effect is unlikely. In any event, our kinematic analysis is a far more sensitive measure of changes in performance than task success. While we can see a clear change in how movements were executed depending on condition, there was no effect of order (group) or interaction between group and condition. This more strongly supports the argument that modulations of RT do not impact performance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p> <italic>This is a pretty straightforward study, whose conclusions might almost be considered too simple.
