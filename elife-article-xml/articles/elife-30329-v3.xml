Classically, two stimuli have been used to trigger a beiging response: cold temperatures and β3-adrenergic receptor (<italic>Adrb3</italic>) agonists. These two beiging triggers have been used interchangeably but whether these two stimuli may induce beiging differently at cellular and molecular levels remains unclear. Here, we found that cold-induced beige adipocyte formation requires <italic>Adrb</italic>1, not <italic>Adrb3</italic>, activation. <italic>Adrb</italic>1 activation stimulates WAT resident perivascular (<italic>Acta2</italic>+) cells to form cold-induced beige adipocytes. In contrast, <italic>Adrb3</italic> activation stimulates mature white adipocytes to convert into beige adipocytes. Necessity tests, using mature adipocyte-specific <italic>Prdm16</italic> deletion strategies, demonstrated that adipocytes are required and are predominant source to generate <italic>Adrb3</italic>-induced, but not cold-induced, beige adipocytes. Collectively, we identify that cold temperatures and <italic>Adrb3</italic> agonists activate distinct cellular populations that express different β-adrenergic receptors to induce beige adipogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30329.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Excess accumulation of a type of fat called white fat is associated with obesity and metabolic problems. White fat cells store energy. White fat tissue also contains some beige fat cells, which burn fats and sugars to produce heat. Cold temperatures trigger the production and activity of beige fat cells, which allows the body to stay warm. People with obesity tend to have less beige fat and more white fat. This has led scientists to test whether treatments that increase the number of beige fat cells a person has could reduce fat mass and improve metabolism.</p><p>To develop treatments that increase beige fat, scientists must first understand where it comes from and how cold and other factors stimulate its growth. Recent studies have shown that smooth muscle cells, which surround blood vessel walls, make cold-induced beige fat cells. A widely used drug that turns on the β3 adrenergic receptor, which is found in the cell membrane, also boosts the creation of beige fat cells. Yet, it was not clear exactly how cold or this drug triggers the production of beige fat.</p><p>Now, Jiang et al. show that drugs that target β3 adrenergic receptors cause white fat cells in mice to change into beige fat cells. The experiments also showed that cold turns on a different receptor called the β1 adrenergic receptor on smooth muscle cells causing them to make beige fat cells. This shows that there is more than one source for beige fat cells in the body and that different strategies for increasing beige fat cell numbers do not work the same way.</p><p>More studies are needed to learn whether beige fat cells produced after exposure to cold or drugs behave in the same way and have similar affects on metabolism. This could help scientists determine if one of these strategies could make a better treatment for obesity or other metabolic disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>beige adipocytes</kwd><kwd>adipose</kwd><kwd>cold exposure</kwd><kwd>beta adrenergic receptors</kwd><kwd>Brite</kwd><kwd>SMA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01 DK109027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berry</surname><given-names>Daniel C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01 DK111771</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yuwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK088220</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Graff</surname><given-names>John M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK064261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Graff</surname><given-names>John M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK066556</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Graff</surname><given-names>John M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The activation of beige adipocyte thermogenesis by cold temperatures and β3-adrenergic receptor agonists induce beige adipocyte formation, function and perdurance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to defend core body temperature in response to cold environments is, in part, mediated by non-shivering thermogenesis, through the recruitment and activation of brown and beige/brite (brown-in-white) adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>). Beige adipocytes are activated in white adipose tissue (WAT) by cold exposure or by beta3-adrenergic receptor (<italic>Adrb3</italic>) agonists via the sympathetic nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Young et al., 1984</xref>). Activation of beige adipocyte thermogenesis requires the induction of numerous thermogenic and mitochondrial genes such as uncoupling protein 1 (<italic>Ucp1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>). To perform thermogenic function, beige adipocytes, like classical brown adipocytes, take up substantial amounts of glucose and free fatty acids and convert these molecules into heat rather than ATP. This uncoupling ability is clinically desirable because it has the potential to lower body fat percentage, reduce blood sugars and increase metabolic rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sidossis and Kajimura, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blondin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blondin et al., 2017</xref>). Using radiolabeled glucose uptake and positron electron tomography (PET) imaging, brown/beige fat has been identified in cold-exposed adult humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cypess et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Marken Lichtenbelt et al., 2009</xref>). These imaging studies have indicated that glucose uptake occurs often in the supraclavicular region. Furthermore, supraclavicular WAT biopsies from cold-exposed humans have shown the presence and activation of brown/beige fat, which appears to resemble rodent beige fat rather than rodent brown fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shinoda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to cold exposure, <italic>Adrb3</italic> agonists also stimulate and promote beige adipocyte formation and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Himms-Hagen et al., 1994</xref>). However, clinically used non-selective <italic>Adrb3</italic> agonists have led to off target side-effects such as tachycardia and hypertension, which precludes the use of these <italic>Adrb3</italic> agonists as beiging agents in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arch, 2011</xref>). Yet, recent efforts by Cypess and colleagues have identified a more selective <italic>Adrb3</italic> agonist, mirabergon (MB), which is clinically used to treat overactive bladder conditions, as a potential human ‘beiger’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cypess et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies have proposed various origins of beige adipocytes. For example, the notion that white adipocytes can transdifferentiate into beige adipocytes has been a conventional notion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbatelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smorlesi et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, several recent perivascular genetic fate-mapping studies have indicated that cold-induced beige adipocytes are generated from blood vessel-derived progenitors within WAT. For instance, perivascular smooth muscle cells that express <italic>Myh11</italic>, <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> and <italic>Acta2</italic> have been shown to be a progenitor cell pool for cold-induced beige adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Long et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shao et al., 2016</xref>). Also, platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (<italic>Pdgfra</italic>) positive fibroblasts can form some <italic>Adrb3</italic>-induced beige adipocytes within the perigonadal adipose tissue (PGW) but not within the subcutaneous inguinal adipose (IGW) WAT depot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Yet, <italic>Pdgfra+</italic> cells do not appear to serve as a cold-induced beige progenitor pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, it is unclear if smooth muscle cells are the major contributing cellular source for <italic>Adrb3</italic>-induced beige adipocytes.</p><p>Mechanistically, studies have also suggested that both cold and <italic>Adrb3</italic> stimulate brown adipocyte activation and beige adipocyte recruitment similarly through the activation of <italic>Adrb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ramseyer and Granneman, 2016</xref>). Norepinephrine signaling, via <italic>Adrb3</italic>, not only stimulates thermogenic action in mature brown adipocytes but also recruits and activates beige adipocytes within WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grujic et al., 1997</xref>). Further, norepinephrine signaling through <italic>Adrb3</italic>-cAMP activation upregulates thermogenic genes such as <italic>Ucp1</italic> potentiating the beiging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2001</xref>). However, cellular expression studies have indicated that <italic>Adrb3</italic> expression is restricted to mature white and brown adipocytes and is not expressed within the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), the proposed site of both white and beige progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Adrb3</italic>, <italic>Adrb</italic>1 is expressed in the SVF, not in mature adipocytes, and is thought to mediate the proliferation and differentiation of classical brown adipocyte progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bronnikov et al., 1992</xref>). Thermogenically, <italic>Adrb</italic>1 null mice are unable to defend their body temperature in response to the cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ueta et al., 2012</xref>); whereas, transgenic overexpression of <italic>Adrb</italic>1 showed robust cold-induced beiging potential within WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Soloveva et al., 1997</xref>). Overall, several studies suggest mechanistic differences between cold- and <italic>Adrb3</italic>-induced beige adipocyte formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vosselman et al., 2012</xref>). But whether these two receptors mediate or recruit beige adipocytes similarly remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we show that smooth muscle/mural cells (<italic>Acta2</italic> and <italic>Myh11</italic>) do not fate-map into <italic>Adrb3</italic>-induced beige adipocytes rather most <italic>Adrb3</italic>-induced beige adipocytes emanate from pre-existing white adipocytes. White adipocyte beiging necessity tests demonstrate the requirement of white adipocytes to form a significant percentage of beige adipocytes. Moreover, we find that that cold-induced beiging requires <italic>Adrb1</italic> activation but not <italic>Adrb3</italic> signaling. These data suggest that several cellular sources exist for beige adipocyte formation, which could provide mechanistic insight and clinical utility into enhancing beige adipocyte formation, function and perdurance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Difference between cold- and <italic>Adrb3</italic>-induced beiging</title><p>To begin to explore possible differences between cold-induced and <italic>Adrb3</italic>-induced beiging, we evaluated the relative appearance of in vivo beige adipogenesis. <italic>C57BL/6J-</italic>inbred mice were randomized to room temperature (23°C), cold (6.5°C) or CL316,243 (CL, 1 mg/Kg), a <italic>Adrb3</italic> selective agonist, for 1, 3, or 7 days.

These potential cellular energy sinks could help address the worldwide epidemic of obesity and its associated metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoneshiro et al., 2013</xref>). Several studies have indicated the presence and induction of metabolically relevant beige adipocytes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cypess et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saito, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van der Lans et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoneshiro et al., 2011b</xref>). For example, administration of mirabegron (MB) increased the resting metabolism of patients and induced the formation of beige adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cypess et al., 2015</xref>). Other studies using cold exposure have seen a similar phenomenon including the induction of beige adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cypess et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoneshiro et al., 2011a</xref>). The full therapeutic potential of beige adipocytes has not been fully realized due, in part, to the lack of genetic tools to mark, track and manipulate the beige adipocyte progenitor cell source; however, the current study appears to overcome some of these barriers.</p><p>The cellular sources for cold- and <italic>Adrb3</italic>-induced beige adipocytes have attracted much attention but whether these two beiging stimuli trigger the same or different progenitor sources has remained ambiguous. The same set of tools, used herein, allowed us to identify that <italic>Acta2+</italic> perivascular progenitor cells could serve as an indispensable source of cold-induced beige adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2016</xref>). However, using two independent <italic>Acta2</italic> genetic tools, we were unable to observe <italic>Acta2</italic> beige adipocyte fate mapping in response to <italic>Adrb3</italic> agonists. In addition, we were also unable to observe noticeable fate mapping of <italic>Myh11+</italic> smooth muscle cells, which also serve as a cold-induced beige adipocyte source, into <italic>Adrb3</italic>-induced beige adipocytes. These data suggest that <italic>Adrb3</italic> agonists do not engage smooth muscle-perivascular cells. These findings also correlated with our gene expression data that <italic>Acta2+</italic> cells express <italic>Adrb</italic>1 not <italic>Adrb3</italic>. Moreover, our pharmacological studies indicate that cold-induced beige adipocyte formation relies primarily on <italic>Adrb</italic>1 activation rather than ARDB3 stimulation, which agrees with both our fate mapping and gene expression studies. These findings echo with a recent genetic study that showed that cold-induced beiging is intact in <italic>Adrb3</italic> null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Jong et al., 2017</xref>). However, other studies have demonstrated that <italic>Adrb3</italic> null mice have less beiging potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbatelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jimenez et al., 2003</xref>). The underlying differences between these studies may be, in part, due to genetic backgrounds of the null mice, further studies would be required.</p><p>Our studies support the notion that <italic>Adrb3</italic>-induced beige adipocytes originate from white adipocytes. Using <italic>Adiponectin<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup>; RFP</italic> fate mapping studies, we found that the majority of <italic>Adrb3</italic>-induced beige adipocytes emanate from these pre-existing adipocytes. However, cold relies on <italic>Acta2+</italic> mural cells. WAT necessity tests using <italic>Adiponectin<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup>; Prdm16</italic> demonstrated that pre-existing white adipocytes are required for <italic>Adrb3</italic>-induced beige adipocyte formation. A previous study demonstrated that deleting <italic>Prdm16</italic> within the WAT lineage sufficiently blocked beige adipocyte formation from both cold exposure and <italic>Adrb3</italic> agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2014</xref>). The major difference between the two studies is the use of the temporal <italic>Adiponectin<sup>Cre-</sup></italic><sup>ERT2</sup> genetic tool compared to the global <italic>Adiponectin<sup>Cre</sup></italic> genetic tool. In our studies using the <italic>Adiponectin<sup>Cre-</sup></italic><sup>ERT2</sup>, <italic>Prdm16</italic> is specifically deleted in all pre-existing adipocytes (beige and white) and not in newly generated adipocytes. In contrast, using <italic>Adiponectin<sup>Cre</sup></italic> model, <italic>Prdm16</italic> is continuously deleted in all pre-existing and newly developing adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jeffery et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), meaning that under all conditions, cold or <italic>Adrb3</italic> agonist, beige adipogenesis is disrupted. Yet, fate mapping limitations aside, the <italic>Adiponectin<sup>Cre</sup></italic> tool identified the critical role of <italic>Prdm16</italic> in beige adipogenesis.</p><p>Classical biochemical and pharmacokinetic studies have indicated that <italic>Adrb1</italic> activation is not coupled to thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. In agreement, our data imply that <italic>Adrb1</italic> is critical for <italic>Acta2+</italic> perivascular cells to leave their vascular niche and form beige adipocytes. However, using pharmacological agents such as talinolol, could have systemic affects that may alter beiging potential independent of <italic>Adrb</italic>1 blockade within WAT. Pharmacokinetically, talinolol is highly hydrophilic with a half-life of 6–7 hr and has difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neil-Dwyer et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sourgens et al., 2003</xref>). Of note, mice were exposed to the cold or CL, 24 hr post talinolol treatment. Further investigation into the downstream signaling of <italic>Adrb</italic>1 in <italic>Acta2+</italic> cells in response to the cold could provide important insight into potential mechanisms and therapeutic targets to stimulate cold-induced beiging perhaps in the absence of cold treatment.</p><p>The current study demonstrates that several cell types can form multilocular beige-like adipocytes within white adipose depots. This is consistent with other reports that <italic>Pdgfra+</italic> perivascular cells as well other non-adipocyte sources generate beige adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, other studies have suggested that beige and white adipocytes are bi-potential; that is beige adipocytes become white adipocytes but can revert to beige adipocytes in response to a beiging stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rosenwald et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altshuler-Keylin et al., 2016</xref>). Our studies resonate with these previous findings; however, the data herein suggest that a majority of <italic>Adrb3</italic>-induced beige adipocytes are generated from mature white adipocytes. A potential limitation of these study is that we cannot decipher if these white adipocytes that converted to <italic>Adrb3</italic>-induced beige adipocytes were once beige. Further studies into genetic program and memory could help elucidate how these cells interconvert in response to sympathetic activation. These studies also raise another interesting question; do beige adipocytes that form in response to cold exposure or by <italic>Adrb3</italic> agonists activate thermogenesis in an analogous manner? That is; does cold temperatures invoke the same thermogenic program as <italic>Adrb3</italic> agonist? More studies directed at examining beige metabolic properties could provide pivotal insight into which beige stimuli would be more clinically germane regarding energy utilization. Also do these differently induced beige adipocytes have different genetic signatures? Towards this end, a recent study showed that beige adipocytes generated by CL compared to beige adipocytes produced by roscovitine/rosiglitazone had unique genetic signatures suggesting that not all beige adipocytes are created equally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, further research into the genetic regulation and programs could yield answers to these questions.</p><p>In summary, using several genetic models encompassing several proposed sources of <italic>Adrb3</italic>-induced beige adipocytes, we found that white adipocytes generate most <italic>Adrb3</italic>-induced beige adipocytes. Further, we found that cold-induced beiging relies on <italic>Adrb</italic>1 activation, and not <italic>Adrb3</italic>, to engage and license smooth muscle cells to form beige adipocytes. These data highlight that several cellular sources exist for two different beiging stimuli and that not all beiging stimuli should be considered equal.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animals were maintained under the ethical guidelines of the UT Southwestern Medical Center Animal Care and Use Committee according to NIH guidelines under the protocol number 2016–101336.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Mark McCarthy (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.

These cells are inducible, and most studies have used cold as a stimulus to promote beige fat biogenesis. However, other stimuli are also capable of inducing beige fat, such as β3 adrenergic agonists. Here the authors show that while cold-induced beige adipocytes come from perivascular SMA+ cells, β3 agonists promote beige fat through a different mechanism: conversion from mature white adipocytes. Moreover, the authors show that cold seems to induce beige fat via β1 adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) activation, another distinction between these two stimuli.</p><p>The reviewers were in agreement that the work was potentially of interest to the general audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. The studies were judged to be technically sound and the reviewers believed that the majority of the conclusions drawn were supported by the data. At the same time, the review process identified several opportunities to strengthen the work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) For the fate mapping experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> the authors use an approach in which animals are pulse labeled with tamoxifen at p 60 and then a treatment is administered 14 days later with subsequent analysis. Since we do not know the rate of development/turnover of beige adipocytes, how can the authors be sure this is the appropriate time point to sample? For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, they conclude that β3 agonists do not promote beige fat via the development of SMA+ cells. However, isn't it possible that with a longer time interval, they might actually see a number of SMA+/UCP1+ cells? If data in any of these experiments is different at longer time points, it could change the conclusions of the paper dramatically. For that reason, it would be more convincing if at least some of the experiments were also done with a longer time interval between pulsing and analysis.</p><p>2) Related to the above point, a longer-term cold exposure experiment is particularly important. Cold exposure causes release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves, which will act on both ADRB1 and ADRB3. If the current manuscript is correct, in cold exposure, beiging should have a rapid phase of ADRB3-mediated white-to-beige conversion, followed by a slower de novo ADRB1-mediated beige adipocyte differentiation phase. This is not clear from their data because they only look at the effect of cold at 1 week. They should do a longer time course experiment to see if cold induces a biphasic response, as would be predicted.</p><p>3) The images shown throughout the paper are relatively high power, focusing on a limited portion of the tissue. It would be helpful, at least in some cases, if lower power images could also be shown to ensure that these conclusions are not biased by just focusing on the region that best proves a certain point.</p><p>4) The authors state: &quot;cold exposed Adpn-PRDM16 mice showed normal beiging, as expected from previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) (Berry et al., 2016)&quot;. However, there are no data from PRDM16 KO mice in Berry et al. (2016). In addition, Cohen et al. (2014) showed that Adpn-PRDM16 mice are defective in both cold- and CL<sup>-</sup>induced browning in iWAT.

Our previous work identified that SMA marks both the white and beige lineages or a common precursor. Fate mapping studies from tamoxifen induced SMA-CreERT2; RFP mice, showed that within 30 days, post labeling of SMA+ mural cells, white adipocytes were generated from this source. The reviewers adequately questioned whether waiting longer after tamoxifen injection might allow SMA+ perivascular cells to commit to an ADRB3 induced beige progenitor. However, given the information above, if tamoxifen were administered and then several weeks or months passed then new SMA-labeled white adipocytes would be generated under room temperature (23-25C) conditions throughout the fat tissue. Subsequently, if mice were then subjected to CL316,243 after this longer duration then new beige adipocytes could emanate from an SMA-labeled white adipocyte or from an SMA+ mural cells. Therefore, the conclusions generated from these experiments could not solely be based on progenitor or adipocyte sources but rather mixed and uninterpretable. We apologize that we could not perform these experiments due to the ambiguous nature of the genetic tools and because we do agree with the reviewers that is an important notion.</p><p>However, we did try to address the reviewer’s comment in another manner which was to label SMA cells at various ages (postnatal day-P30, P60, P90 and P180) and then administer CL316,243 14 days later. Again, we found that under our conditions that no beige adipocytes were generated from an SMA cell source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Since both SMA and Myh11 cells are used in cold induced beiging, we tested a longer time interval in Myh11; RFP fate mapping mice. We administered TM at P60 and waited 30 days prior to administration of vehicle or CL for seven days. Again, we did not observe fate mapping into ADRB3-induced beige adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>). As an extension of this and to test if a progenitor cell was required during these longer time intervals, we labeled, by tamoxifen, all adipocytes using Adiponectin-CreERT2; RFP and then administered CL316,243 two months later. We found that ~70% of all UCP1+ beige adipocytes generated by CL316,243 emanated from an adipocytes source. Together, this new dataset bolsters the notion that mature white adipocytes are the major contributor to the ADRB3 beiging process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the above point, a longer-term cold exposure experiment is particularly important. Cold exposure causes release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves, which will act on both ADRB1 and ADRB3. If the current manuscript is correct, in cold exposure, beiging should have a rapid phase of ADRB3-mediated white-to-beige conversion, followed by a slower de novo ADRB1-mediated beige adipocyte differentiation phase. This is not clear from their data because they only look at the effect of cold at 1 week. They should do a longer time course experiment to see if cold induces a biphasic response, as would be predicted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these suggestions. First, as recommended by the reviewers, to continue to test the requirement of mural cells to cold and ADRB3 induced beiging, we performed a 2-week cold exposure study and found that 60% of all UCP1+ beige adipocytes were from an SMA-RFP+ mural cell origin which is comparable to 1 week of cold exposure. Contemporaneously, we also treated TM-induced SMA-CreERT2; RFP mice for 2 weeks with CL316,243 to test if chronic exposure to ADRB3 agonist could stimulate these cells to leave their vascular niche and form beige adipocytes. We found that SMA-RFP+ cells did not form more than 5% of beige adipocytes throughout the adipose depots. Overall, the data appear to show that SMA+ mural cells are not a source for ADRB3 induced beige adipogenesis but function in response to cold.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for projecting a biphasic model of the beiging process. The reviewers noted that ADRB activation might be biphasic in that ADRB3 is activated first stimulating a white-to-beige adipocyte interconversion and then secondarily ADRB1 would be activated and simulate the progenitor cells. However, our ADRB3 pharmacological inhibition, as well as genetic studies (de Jong, AJPEM, 2017), demonstrate that ADRB3 has a minor role, overall, in cold induced beiging, irrespective of timing. Rather these data support the notion that ADRB3 activation, independent of cold exposure, mediates the conversion of white-to-beige adipocytes and suggest a different means to induce beige adipocytes formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The images shown throughout the paper are relatively high power, focusing on a limited portion of the tissue. It would be helpful, at least in some cases, if lower power images could also be shown to ensure that these conclusions are not biased by just focusing on the region that best proves a certain point.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added several lower magnification images throughout the manuscript to document cold-induced and ADRB3 induced beige adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors state: &quot;cold exposed Adpn-PRDM16 mice showed normal beiging, as expected from previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) (Berry et al., 2016)&quot;.

The authors need to clarify how their work fits into the scheme of what's been published previously.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the ambiguity and have removed this portion of the sentence. What we meant to emphasize in the original manuscript was that cold exposed Adpn-PRDM16 mice showed normal beiging, which was consistent with our previous Adiponectin-RFP beige adipocyte fate mapping studies which demonstrated negative tracing (Berry et al., 2016).</p><p>We thank the reviewers for noting the differences between our studies and several of our colleagues. The major difference being: straight Cre vs. tamoxifen inducible Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>. Cohen and colleagues used a global Adiponectin-Cre model to drive PRDM16 deletion thus it is not surprising that beiging was altered under both cold and CL316,243 conditions because all beige and white (new and pre-existing) adipocytes will express Adiponectin either in the mature state or as they differentiate into mature lipid+ cells (Wang eta l 2013; Jeffery E et al. 2014, Shao M et al., 2016). Therefore, PRDM16 would be deleted under any setting in which “new” adipocytes (white or beige) or interconverting adipocytes would be created. In our studies only pre-existing beige and white adipocytes, not progenitors or newly differentiating adipocytes, will be deleted in PRDM16 thus new cells are unaffected by the deletion.</p><p>This clarification has been added to the text. Thank you for pointing this out as it is an opportunity to highlight the differences between our studies and previous reports.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Conflicting data have been reported for beiging in Adrb3 KO mice (Jimenez, Eur.

Could any of the observations on beiging be secondary to other physiological changes?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we cannot rule out the potential systemic effects of talinolol on other tissues and organs. Talinolol is hydrophilic and has difficulty crossing the blood brain barrier (Neil-Dwyer et al. 1981 and Sourgens et al. 2003). The reviewers are correct the literature indicates that ADRB1 inhibition may have a role in blood pressure. However, in our studies, the drug was not administered during cold or CL316,243 exposure rather we administered the drug for 5 days at RT with a 24-hour window prior to administering the beiging stimuli. The half-life of talinolol is 6-7 hours thus the effects of heart rate should be minimal at the time of cold or CL316,243 exposure (1-day post treatment or ~3 half-life’s). But the effects are sufficient to alter the engagement of SMA+ mural cells to form beige adipocytes. Ongoing studies in the lab are focused on expanding and exploring the mechanism by which ADRB1 elicits its effects on SMA+ cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The title of the manuscript covers both cold- and ADRB3-induced beige cell formation, however the majority of the studies focused on identifying the origin of ADRB3-induced beige adipocytes.
