tissue damage, yet is not well understood, even at a basic phenomenological level. Developing <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells undergo highly efficient dedifferentiation, completed by most cells within 24 hr. We use this rapid response to investigate the control features of dedifferentiation, combining single cell imaging with high temporal resolution transcriptomics. Gene expression during dedifferentiation was predominantly a simple reversal of developmental changes, with expression changes not following this pattern primarily associated with ribosome biogenesis. Mutation of genes induced early in dedifferentiation did not strongly perturb the reversal of development. This apparent robustness may arise from adaptability of cells: the relative temporal ordering of cell and molecular events was not absolute, suggesting cell programmes reach the same end using different mechanisms. In addition, although cells start from different fates, they rapidly converged on a single expression trajectory. These regulatory features may contribute to dedifferentiation responses during regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dedifferentiation</kwd><kwd>reprogramming</kwd><kwd><italic>Dictyostelium</italic></kwd><kwd>induced pluripotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>cell plasticity</kwd><kwd>bet-hedging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Dictyostelium</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202867/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chubb</surname><given-names>Jonathan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U12266B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chubb</surname><given-names>Jonathan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Efficient dedifferentiation is characterized by robustness to mutation, flexibility in ordering of cellular events and reversal of developmental changes along a single gene expression trajectory.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dedifferentiation is the transition of a cell to a state characteristic of an earlier stage of development. This reversal of developmental programmes is a widespread response to tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Merrell and Stanger, 2016</xref>), allowing replenishment of stem cell populations, and has been implicated as a contributing process to cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedmann-Morvinski and Verma, 2014</xref>). Artificially triggered dedifferentiation is central to approaches to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) for tissue repair strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2016</xref>). Despite these important biological and clinical contexts, dedifferentiation is not well understood in any system – it would be fair to say that we do not even have an approximate conceptual framework for the main features of the process.</p><p>Previous studies have identified some candidate molecular players, including c-Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Parkinson et al., 2008</xref>), mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Willet et al., 2018</xref>), histidine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Katoh et al., 2004</xref>) and chromatin regulators such as CAF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheloufi et al., 2015</xref>), although these are isolated with respect to any large-scale regulatory network. A recurring feature in IPSC studies is the hypothesis that dedifferentiation somehow recapitulates developmental intermediates, but in reverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pasque et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cacchiarelli et al., 2015</xref>). The support for these models is based upon a few developmental markers detected within reprogramming intermediates, rather than any formal cell type classification. The possibility of a stereotypical programme has been the subject of some debate, with some evidence for multiple gene expression trajectories, at least during IPSC derivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). It is also not clear whether dedifferentiation should be considered as regulated in the sense of having checkpoints, monitoring the gradual activation of the necessary changes that make a stem cell.</p><p>These difficulties in understanding are for several reasons. Firstly, many of the characteristic models of dedifferentiation are slow – often taking days to weeks for effective return to the earlier developmental state. Dedifferentiation within a tissue context will be confounded by the mixed signatures from multiple cell types, and more often than not, by a lack of accessibility. Although IPSC generation in culture provides a more accessible model, the process is slow (weeks), a very small proportion of the starting population makes it back to the stem cell state (which means the cells one is interested in can be difficult to identify) and the process usually involves the forced expression of four transcription factors (TFs), two of which are proto-oncogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karagiannis and Yamanaka, 2014</xref>).</p><p>To begin to formulate a framework for understanding the control of dedifferentiation, it would be useful to investigate a model that dedifferentiates effectively. Developing <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells can completely reverse their differentiation in around 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Takeuchi and Sakai, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Finney et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Katoh et al., 2004</xref>). The normal developmental programme of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> is induced by starvation. Starving cells aggregate together into a multicellular mound, before differentiating into two major cell types – stalk and spore. Upon disaggregation and resupply of nutrients, at any time prior to terminal differentiation, the cells dedifferentiate, giving rise to cells that can feed, divide and develop as well as they could prior to the initial starvation process. Shortly after the onset of dedifferentiation, there is evidence for a critical decision phase. This phase – termed ‘erasure’ – corresponds to a loss of developmental memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Finney et al., 1979</xref>). Prior to this phase, re-removal of nutrients causes rapid re-entry into the forward development process, an ability that is quickly lost as dedifferentiation proceeds. Initial microarray studies on the dedifferentiation process implied the overall gene expression programme is distinct from development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Katoh et al., 2004</xref>), going against the grain of the mammalian IPSC reprogramming studies that have argued for developmental recapitulation. Two mutants have been shown to affect aspects of dedifferentiation: the spontaneous mutant HI4 showed impairment in the loss of development-associated cell-cell adhesivity during dedifferentiation, although other features of the dedifferentiation response were unperturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Finney et al., 1983</xref>). Loss of the histidine kinase DhkA delayed the onset of cell population growth during dedifferentiation, although erasure, the initiation of DNA replication and overall dedifferentiation potential were not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Katoh et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have carried out a detailed transcriptomic analysis of the dedifferentiation process in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and combined this with single cell imaging, to order the progression of gene expression and cell physiological changes occurring as cells dedifferentiate. Our data suggest that multiple phases of gene expression underlie the reversal of development, with a high degree of symmetry between the forward and reverse processes, but notable distinctions that can be explained by opposing biochemical processes required for nutrient rich or starvation conditions. Our overall analysis suggests a high degree of robustness to the dedifferentiation process, with strong mutations affecting cell growth still retaining relatively normal gene expression dynamics as cells return to the undifferentiated state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome scale features of dedifferentiation</title><p>To what extent do dedifferentiating cells retrace the gene expression trajectories they followed during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>)?

Dedifferentiation was initiated from the tipped mound phase of development (14 hr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), at which point cell type specialisation has commenced. Structures were gently disaggregated to single cells, which were inoculated into different types of growth media, or into phosphate buffer lacking nutrients. Cells were recovered at regular intervals from the dedifferentiation cultures, with RNAseq carried out on RNA extracted from these cells. We also prepared a reference forward developmental timecourse, to compare to dedifferentiation. Gene expression trajectories were summarised using principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>The gene expression state of the dedifferentiating cells had almost completely returned to that of undifferentiated cells within 24 hr of dedifferentiation. Rapid recovery was observed whether dedifferentiation was induced using liquid (axenic) medium, or bacteria, as a food source. Both types of nutrition caused cells to reverse development along similar gene expression trajectories in the PCA space of the major principal components 1 and 2. For dedifferentiation under both nutritional conditions, most of the transcriptional changes along the PC1 axis had occurred after 6 hr. Although these trajectories had similar start and end points to the corresponding developmental stages, they diverged from the trajectory used by cells undergoing development, primarily with respect to PC2 values. Cells inoculated into nutrient free buffer after disaggregation showed a different path, which separated rapidly from the dedifferentiating trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Although expression trajectories during dedifferentiation and development appear distinct, consistent with earlier microarray data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Katoh et al., 2004</xref>), analysis of the genes contributing most to PC1 indicates the major changes in gene expression occurring during dedifferentiation are a straightforward reversal of development. The heat map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows the results of an unbiased hierarchical clustering of 580 genes with the highest contribution to PC1 variance. The top cluster shows the genes activated during dedifferentiation. These are very similar between liquid medium and bacteria as a food source, although the bacterial response is slightly slower. These gene activation processes showed a strict reversal of the gene down-regulation occurring during development, although the timing was not strictly ‘mirror image’, insofar as 4 hr of dedifferentiation time did not correspond to 10 hr of developmental time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In other words, gene expression milestones appear to be reached with different rates during the forward and reverse processes. Similar conclusions are reached when considering the genes turned off during dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, bottom cluster). The process is a clear reversal of development as far as PC1 is concerned, although the reverse trajectory escapes the advanced developmental state faster than it was acquired. Cells disaggregated into non-nutrient buffer showed a strong impairment of the activations and repressions characteristic of dedifferentiation.</p><p>We then considered what cellular processes, based upon transcript signatures, are subject to change during dedifferentiation, and to what extent any changes are reversals of developmental changes. An early microarray study, carried out before high-level annotation of the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> genome, found a complex mixture of functional enrichments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Katoh et al., 2004</xref>). The use of current transcriptomic measurements, combined with a richer genome annotation, is expected to provide more resolution. We carried out enrichment analysis (GO) on genes with strong contributions to PC1 of a simplified principal component space lacking buffer-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Strong positive loadings to PC1 were enriched for terms related to translation and mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). In particular, a large panel of ribosome proteins showed strong positive PC1 loadings, corresponding to strong expression towards the end of the dedifferentiation trajectory and at the onset of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Strong negative loadings for PC1 were spread between processes related to terminal differentiation, cell adhesion, cAMP signalling and autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These terms would be expected of developing cells, which are starving, adhering and signalling using cAMP as they differentiate, and correspondingly mark the final portion of the forward development trajectory, and the beginning of the dedifferentiation trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Considering the portion of the trajectories with the biggest change in PC1 values, we found that from the 2428 genes up-regulated during dedifferentiation under both conditions, 62% were down-regulated during forward development. Similarly, of the 2172 genes down-regulated during dedifferentiation under both conditions, 60% were up-regulated during development. These data suggest a strong symmetry between the dedifferentiation and development trajectories, with most genes showing changes (above a two fold threshold) directly reversing their behaviour between the two processes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Overlapping and distinct transitions during dedifferentiation and development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simplified PCA: RNAseq timecourse data from forward development and dedifferentiation in liquid medium and bacteria.

To identify signatures specific to dedifferentiation or development, we identified the genes that contribute to PC2 variance. Genes with strong positive loadings for PC2 showed a more complex representation of functional classes, but were enriched with respect to transcription, secretion and the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In particular, proteasomal components are expressed throughout the developmental trajectory, and only weakly detected in the majority of the dedifferentiation trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). In contrast, negative loadings into PC2 are completely dominated by ribosome biogenesis (as opposed to general translation terms), with components expressed strongly throughout dedifferentiation, but not development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Although PC2 indicates differences between the forward and reverse processes, we note that proteasome and ribosome biogenesis are effectively the converse of each other – one degrading, one allowing synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). So although at the transcript level these differences in expression break the symmetry between dedifferentiation and development, consistent with earlier microarray data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Katoh et al., 2004</xref>), in terms of the final protein product, these transcript changes predict an effective reversal. This opposition of functions appears aligned to the differing needs of the cell under starvation or nutrient-rich conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Staging gene expression during dedifferentiation</title><p>A more specific example of developmental reversal is suggested by the strong reactivation of the <italic>csaA</italic> gene immediately after the induction of dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The gene is normally expressed when cells aggregate during development, before the transcript declines in the aggregate, and encodes a cell surface protein to facilitate cell adhesion during development. We also identified other well-characterised aggregation-specific genes showing similar dynamic behaviour, such as <italic>carA</italic> and <italic>pldB</italic>. These effects are consistent with ideas that cells may revisit specific developmental states during dedifferentiation. Is this re-induction a general feature of aggregation genes? To address this question, we defined a panel of 402 aggregation-specific genes using the criteria that the mean expression over 4, 6 and 8 hr of development must be more than two fold greater than both the initial expression (0 and 2 hr) and the expression in the mound (10, 12 and 14 hr). We then compared these genes to those strongly induced during early dedifferentiation (defined as maximally induced by more than 50% in the first 2 hr). For dedifferentiation in bacteria, we found a 41% overlap (165/402 genes) between the dedifferentiation and aggregation genes. This overlap was compared to a simulated scenario with 402 genes sampled at random (10,000 times) from the entire genome. In the simulations, the median overlap between the dedifferentiation genes and the randomly sampled genes was found to be only 22%, with the 41% value never observed. This implies a strong enrichment of aggregation markers in the early dedifferentiation gene set. However, this effect was specific to the bacteria-based dedifferentiation, with liquid medium cultures showing an effect in the opposite direction, with only 15% overlap between dedifferentiation and aggregation-induced genes. We conclude that the re-induction phenomenon is not consistently a feature of dedifferentiation trajectories. An alternative explanation is that genes such as <italic>csaA</italic> and <italic>carA</italic> are repressed by strong cAMP signalling in the mound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Van Haastert et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Masaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corrigan and Chubb, 2014</xref>). If this signalling is relieved (by disaggregation) then the repressive influence on transcription is removed, triggering re-induction.</p><p>Dedifferentiation is characterised by several distinctive classes of gene expression, occurring at different phases during the process (summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These phases are revealed by hierarchical clustering of the RNAseq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Early ‘off’ events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>) correspond to the down-regulation of genes encoding fruiting body components, in addition to other developmentally induced genes. Following this initial step are a series of transient inductions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>) starting with genes for protein degradation, then cytoskeletal components and regulators, before widespread induction of ribosome and mitochondrial biogenesis. After the transients come the stable long-term induction of translation and mitochondrial respiration components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>). A final grouping includes cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>), which are expressed initially (reflecting their role in development; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Muramoto and Chubb, 2008</xref>) before switching off, then re-inducing as dedifferentiation proceeds.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Genetic robustness of the dedifferentiation programme</title><p>More than 6000 genes changed their expression during dedifferentiation, under both conditions tested. To investigate the control of these genes, we identified six transcription factors (TFs) showing rapid induction in their expression during early dedifferentiation – BzpS, MybD, NfyA, DDB_G0272386, DDB_G0269374 and DDB_G0281091. To determine the genes regulated by these TFs, we mutated the coding sequences of their genes, then carried out RNAseq on the mutants during dedifferentiation. To our surprise, none of the mutants showed clear changes in gene expression compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This approach was clearly not a cost-effective strategy, so we next carried out an insertional mutagenesis screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kuspa and Loomis, 1992</xref>) to identify potential regulators of dedifferentiation. We generated an insertional library in an <italic>act8-</italic>mNeonGreen cell line. The <italic>act8</italic> gene (actin) is expressed in undifferentiated cells, but strongly repressed during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tunnacliffe et al., 2018</xref>). We enriched for mutants showing delayed induction of <italic>act8</italic>-mNeonGreen during dedifferentiation, by multiple iterations of flow sorting of low fluorescence cells. As an attempted proof of concept, we regenerated eight of the enriched mutants by homologous recombination in the <italic>act8</italic>-mNeonGreen cells. Unexpectedly, none of these mutants were consistently impaired in their ability to induce mNeonGreen during dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We therefore considered a different approach, this time using a focussed screen, mutating genes with strong induction early during dedifferentiation, but minimal expression during development. Induction was primarily defined using hierarchical clustering, identifying genes with a transient increase of more than 2-fold during dedifferentiation. We focussed on genes with signalling and gene expression functions, and those overlapping with the insertional screen, favouring genes with clear induction in both bacterial and liquid culture-based dedifferentiation. The <italic>dhkA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Katoh et al., 2004</xref>) did not fit these criteria, showing a strong induction during development and a rapid loss of transcript early during dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Molecular regulation of dedifferentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Testing the importance of transcription factors expressed early in dedifferentiation. Expression of <italic>bzpS</italic> and <italic>mybD</italic> during dedifferentiation in liquid medium alongside their developmental profiles (left).

This marker is strongly induced around 5 hr after the onset of dedifferentiation, with many other cell cycle transcripts. To our surprise, none of the mutants showed a defect in <italic>PCNA</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Overall, these investigations suggested an apparent resilience of the dedifferentiation programme to genetic perturbation.</p><p>Key features of dedifferentiation are a return to cell division and growth. With this in mind, we considered the possibility that mutants of genes that are required for dedifferentiation would not be recovered, since they would be required for division and growth – indeed 17 mutants were not recovered using homologous recombination (See Appendix). To test this reasoning, we measured dedifferentiation-induced gene expression in the <italic>forG</italic> (formin) mutant, which has a growth defect during both bacterial and liquid culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Junemann et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>PCNA</italic> expression was induced with relatively normal timing in <italic>forG-</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), however induction of a longer transcript was impaired. The identity of the longer transcript was not clear, but may relate to a potential alternative promoter around 400 bp upstream of the normal transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Clonal recovery on bacterial lawns of dedifferentiating <italic>forG-</italic> cells was reproducibly lower than that for wild types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), perhaps due to the strong phagocytosis defect of the mutants. Despite the slightly perturbed induction of <italic>PCNA</italic> and weakened clonal survival, other markers of dedifferentiation timing, such as the <italic>hspE</italic> and <italic>rpl15</italic> genes, showed normal induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left panels). At the whole transcriptome level, the <italic>forG-</italic> cells showed a slight delay in the dedifferentiation response, although the starting position of the mutants in the PCA space was slightly shifted with respect to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The <italic>rasS-</italic> mutant also has a strong growth defect in liquid medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chubb et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paschke et al., 2018</xref>). As with the <italic>forG-</italic> cells, the <italic>rasS-</italic> mutants showed a weakened induction of <italic>PCNA</italic>, however the induction of <italic>hspE</italic> and <italic>rpl15</italic> was again similar to wild type, suggesting no genome-wide impairment of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right panels). Unlike the <italic>forG-</italic> cells, dedifferentiating <italic>rasS-</italic> cells showed no defect in clonal recovery on bacterial lawns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), implying no absolute requirement for RasS in dedifferentiation. These observations indicate that defects in dedifferentiation gene expression can be detected in mutants with strong growth defects, however the gene expression dynamics still appear relatively robust.</p><p>Both the <italic>forG-</italic> and <italic>rasS-</italic> mutants have defects in macropinocytosis, which impair their growth in liquid medium. Even after 30 hr of dedifferentiation, when cell division is widespread in the culture and gene expression has returned to the undifferentiated state, the wild-type fluid uptake was only half the normal level of undifferentiated <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells. However, a small but reproducible increase in fluid uptake could be detected around 8 hr into dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This modest amount of macropinocytosis during the early phase of dedifferentiation suggests the process is not strongly required for most of the gene expression changes occurring early on, and might explain why mutants with strong defects in fluid uptake do reasonably well in activating dedifferentiation gene expression. These observations hint that processes other than macropinocytosis drive the response to nutrition. In line with this possibility, standard sensors of the nutritional state of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jaiswal and Kimmel, 2019</xref>) show rapid responses to the induction of dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), with cells showing rapid loss of the phosphorylated form of AMPKα and rapid induction in the phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate 4E-BP1, long before macropinocytosis could be detected.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Loose coupling between gene expression and cell physiology</title><p>As dedifferentiation appeared robust to genetic perturbation, we reasoned that any dependencies that dedifferentiation has on specific cellular processes might be revealed by studying the relative timing of cellular events. Potential scenarios for the temporal organisation of progression through dedifferentiation might reflect a strict sequence of gene expression and cell level processes, or a less strict ‘coming-into-being’. For a clear impression of the sequence of events, it is necessary to continuously follow individual cells through the dedifferentiation process.</p><p>We first addressed to what extent cell division was required for the gene expression changes of dedifferentiation, by scoring the first division time of individual cells. The first mitosis appeared considerably delayed compared to the onset of cell-cycle gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The median time of mitotic onset was 17.9 hr after dedifferentiation onset, contrasting the 5–6 hr at which cell cycle gene expression reached a plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>). More striking is that the division time corresponds to the stage at which the transcriptional changes of dedifferentiation are essentially complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These data suggest a considerable amount of post-transcriptional information processing is required before the first division can be activated, and indicates that division is not required for the majority of the transcript changes of dedifferentiation. After the first mitotic division, the overall duration of the second cell cycle (median 7.4 hr) was more similar to the undifferentiated cycle time (6.1 hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggestive of a near-complete return to the undifferentiated state, more in line with the gene expression time course data.</p><p>To what extent does the onset of division require the gene expression dynamics of dedifferentiation to unfold?

The rate of act8 induction did not show a strong correlation with timing of the first mitosis across replicate experiments (r = −0.229, mean of four experiments), however the rate of <italic>act8</italic> induction was higher in dividing cells than in those that did not divide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Overall, these data suggest a strong degree of temporal coupling between the first mitosis and the onset of gene expression characteristic of the undifferentiated state, however the ordering of events is not absolute and the tendency of cells to carry out both processes either slow or fast is probably indicative of an overarching feature of cell state dictating dedifferentiation rate, rather than a strict sequence of events.</p><p>Another developmentally regulated property of cells is motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Varnum et al., 1986</xref>). As cells become aggregation competent, they initially increase their motility, until aggregation, when their motile behaviour becomes more suited to migration within a 3D tissue, and so cells show reduced motility on surfaces. This tendency reverses during dedifferentiation, with cells increasing their speed over the first few hours, before slowing transiently, then becoming more motile again as dedifferentiation proceeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Dedifferentiating cells showed considerable heterogeneity in their motility, with speed profiles falling into two clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The majority (around 70%) of cells showed very little motility, whereas a small subpopulation showed a strong increase in migration, in line with the population average behaviour. Persistence was similar between the two clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Monitoring the subsequent first mitoses of these cells revealed the motile population showed little tendency to divide during the 25 hr movie (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, most slow moving cells divided by the end of image capture. These observations of heterogeneity in the behaviour of cells reveal a slow moving dividing population and more rapid moving population that has deferred cell division. This might be consistent with some kind of bet-hedging response, with cells effectively speculating on staying put and proliferating, versus spreading in search of new habitats, reminiscent of heterogeneous motile behaviour in <italic>Bacillus</italic> and other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Henrichsen, 1972</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Coupling between cell motility and rate of dedifferentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Regulation of cell motility during dedifferentiation.

Cells were collected from dedifferentiation cultures that had been set up at intervals, with cells then pooled into a single sample for cell capture. An overview of the data, showing the first two principal components, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> for the replicate). The data show two major clusters, with the right cluster enriched for genes induced in the multicellular stage of development. Conversely, the left cluster of cells (negative PC1 values) shows a clear gradient of expression of genes repressed during development, such as ribosomal components. Comparing these data to the population transcriptomics data presented earlier implies PC1 reflects developmental time, with positive values corresponding to cells early in dedifferentiation, and negative values corresponding to cells closer to the undifferentiated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). There was no clear evidence in this PCA space for multiple trajectories. Overlaying stalk and spore marker expression onto the PC1-PC2 space suggested the two fates occupied slightly different regions of the space, however, cells from the two fates were essentially on a similar path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). To distinguish more clearly between the starting fates required analysis of the higher order component, PC3.</p><p>Stalk and spore fates showed clear separation in PC1-PC3 space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The set of prespore markers highlights different cells to the prestalk markers. Using PC1 as a proxy for developmental time, prespore markers rapidly switch off, whilst the prestalk expression persists in cells with negative PC1 values. These observations are reminiscent of the behaviour of the different cell types during forward development, in which the prestalk cells appear less responsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antolović et al., 2019</xref>). The differing behaviours of prestalk and prespore cells during dedifferentiation do not interfere with the convergence of cell states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). By corroboration with Northern blot data of the <italic>csaA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>), we find that the beginning of trajectory merging is around 3 hr after dedifferentiation onset. The later time points (3–6 hr) are relatively bunched, whereas the earlier time points are scattered. This implies, as suggested earlier, that most transcriptional changes occur early during dedifferentiation. Notably, the timescale of convergence is similar to that measured for the cell fate separation process during forward developmental progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antolović et al., 2019</xref>), implying no strong resistance to cell state change that is specific to dedifferentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>When compared to mammalian dedifferentiation contexts, the dedifferentiation response of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells is remarkable in its speed and reliability, with most cells reversing their development in around 24 hr, whilst retaining their ability to generate a full complement of cell fates upon re-induction of development. In this study, we have surveyed the cell and molecular level dynamics associated with this efficient dedifferentiation response. The majority of gene expression changes constitute an apparently straightforward reversal of those occurring during forward development. The forward and reverse trajectories are not strict mirror image processes, with differences in the relative timing of events, and key transcriptional differences, notably a strong induction of ribosomal biogenesis components as cells return to the undifferentiated state. Cells from both fates appear to converge on the same gene expression trajectory rapidly during dedifferentiation, with no clear difference in the dedifferentiation phenotypes of spore and stalk-directed cells. The gene expression programme of dedifferentiation is robust to mutation of genes induced early in the programme, with relatively normal gene expression in mutants otherwise displaying strong proliferation defects.</p><p>The efficiency and apparent robustness may be related aspects of the dedifferentiation response. Dedifferentiation is induced experimentally by disaggregation of cells, followed by a nutritional stimulus. Disaggregation means a loss of stimuli related to cell contacts and dilution of other signals, such as cAMP. The nutritional stimulus, whether the peptone-based medium or bacteria (the more natural food source), is a complex mix of food biomolecules, likely to enter the cellular metabolic network via many pathways. Given the obvious complexity of the overall stimulus to dedifferentiate, it may be unlikely that the cell, regardless of its fate tendency, has any real choice but to efficiently obey this overwhelming sensory input, and that perturbation of any single molecule will be insufficient to substantially arrest the process. Along these lines, although we observed that different events during differentiation (gene expression and mitosis) show a distinct temporal sequence, at the single cell level the temporal ordering can be reversed. This implies that cell programmes can unfold in different ways to the same stimulus, potentially contributing to robustness. This lack of a rigid dependency between temporal phases of dedifferentiation may also explain why mutants may have some impairment in individual aspects of reversing development, whilst leaving the majority of dedifferentiation responses unperturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Finney et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Katoh et al., 2004</xref>). This is exemplified by the phenotype of the <italic>dhkA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Katoh et al., 2004</xref>). These cells have a delayed increase in cell number during dedifferentiation. The nature of this defect is unclear – is the effect on cytokinesis, or cell viability during suspension culture? Based upon the strong induction of the gene during development, its rapid repression during dedifferentiation, and the strong developmental phenotype of the mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 1996</xref>), a possible scenario is one in which the perturbed cell state during development feeds forward into an effect during dedifferentiation. Despite this phenotype, as with our growth-defective mutants, other features of the <italic>dhkA</italic> mutant dedifferentiation response are normal. The <italic>dhkA</italic> mutants undergo erasure, replicate their DNA with normal timing and, based on plating efficiency of finger-stage cells, show wild-type levels of clonal recovery following dedifferentiation. Overall, these observations suggest the <italic>dhkA</italic> phenotype aligns well with the mutants described in our study (<italic>forG</italic> and <italic>rasS)</italic> that dedifferentiate fairly effectively despite an underlying cell health problem.</p><p>A recurring feature of the IPSC literature is the detection of developmental intermediates along reprogramming trajectories. These conclusions are usually based upon the expression of a few developmental markers. In <italic>Dictyostelium,</italic> we also identified the re-expression of markers from an early developmental time, in line with the mammalian literature, however the evidence was anecdotal, based on well-known genes, and did not stand up strongly to a more formal analysis. The idea that cells enter a pre-visited attractor state during reversal of development is an appealing idea if one wishes to understand how cells can navigate a path back to a progenitor- or fail to do so because they get trapped. The apparent lack of such a coherent developmental intermediate during dedifferentiation in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> may to a certain extent underlie the speed and efficiency of developmental reversal.</p><p>The differences between dedifferentiation in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and during IPSC generation appear to be systemic, and it seems unlikely at the present time that we could use knowledge from the former to improve the latter. The efficiency of dedifferentiation in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> may ultimately come down to the likelihood that it is a physiological response, whereas the generation of IPSCs is clearly not. In the migratory slug phase of development many cells fall out of the rear of the slug onto the substrate, where they are then able to re-enter the feeding part of the lifecycle, if bacteria are present, and then fully re-differentiate once the supply of bacteria is exhausted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kuzdzal-Fick et al., 2007</xref>). This is in effect a dispersal strategy, bet-hedging against the potential for a proliferative disadvantage occurring within the dormant spore state. Meaningful parallels between the dedifferentiation responses of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and mammalian cells seem more likely in situations where mammalian cells dedifferentiate as part of the normal course of events, such as during responses to tissue damage and metabolic stress.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p><italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells were grown in HL5 (Formedium).

For monitoring onset of <italic>act8</italic> expression in relation to cell division, we used Act8-mNeonGreen knock-in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tunnacliffe et al., 2018</xref>), transformed with an mCherry-PCNA expression plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miermont et al., 2019</xref>). Cells were plated at a density of 2.4 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells cm<sup>−2</sup> on chambered coverglass (Nunc) and imaged on an inverted microscope optimised for fast sensitive imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Muramoto and Chubb, 2008</xref>), with capture of 30 slice z stacks with a 0.5 µm step-size for at least 25 hr, using a dual GFP/mCherry filter set (Chroma 59022), with 50 ms exposure per slice, per channel.</p><p>For assaying cell motility during dedifferentiation, cells were imaged using phase contrast on a Zeiss Observer Z1 inverted microscope with automated Prior stage and Hamamatsu Orca-Flash4.0 camera using a 10x Plan-Neofluar Ph1 objective, with two frames captured per minute for 25 hr.</p><p>To compare cell fate to dedifferentiation features, we used a mNeonGreen knock-in reporter for the early prestalk marker CryS. The reporter was targeted into AX3 cells previously modified to express the fluorescent nuclear marker H2B-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corrigan and Chubb, 2014</xref>). Cells were imaged on a custom built inverted wide field microscope, equipped with Prime 95B CMOS camera (Photometrics), 10x UplanFL N objective (Olympus) and 470 nm and 572 nm LED light sources (Cairn Research). 3D stacks spanning 20 μm over five slices were captured every 2 min for 28 hr over a 3 × 3 grid of adjacent fields of view.</p><p>Comprehensive protocols for image analysis are documented in the Appendix.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Gene expression and signalling assays</title><p>Dedifferentiation of mutants in Act8-mNeonGreen cells was assayed by monitoring mNeonGreen fluorescence at 0 hr and 24 hr of dedifferentiation by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences LSRII). Two independent clones of each mutant were both tested in two separate experiments, with &gt;50000 cells measured for each strain at each timepoint. FlowJo v10 software (FlowJo, LLC) was used for data analysis.</p><p>For assaying other mutants, we used RNAseq (see above) or more widely, Northern blotting of RNA extracted from cells during dedifferentiation in HL5 suspension. For analysis of AMPK and mTORC1 signalling, protein extracted from cell pellets of dedifferentiating cells was blotted using anti-pAMPKα (Thr 172, clone 40H9 rabbit mAb, CST#2535) and anti-p4E-BP1 (Thr 37/46, rabbit Ab, CST#9459). For a standard, we blotted parallel-loaded extracts using an antibody against the C-terminus of histone H3 (Abcam #ab1791). Further details regarding blotting can be found in the Appendix.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Macropinocytosis</title><p>Fluid uptake measurements were adapted from a standard protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilkins et al., 2000</xref>). Cells were dedifferentiated in HL5 suspension culture at 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells ml<sup>−1</sup>. At the indicated times, aliquots were removed and adjusted to 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells ml<sup>−1</sup> in 3 ml. In parallel, undifferentiated cells were taken from a mid-log suspension culture and adjusted to the same density. For both culture types, 2 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> TRITC-dextran (65–85 kDa, Sigma) was added, with a further 3 ml of each culture retained as an unlabelled control. After 1 hr labelling, fluorescence was quenched with Trypan Blue, while the unlabelled control was quenched immediately after addition of dextran. Cells were washed and resuspended at the same density in ice cold KK2. Internalised fluorescence was measured using a Fluoromax+ spectrofluorometer (Horiba). Fluorescence measurements of unlabelled cells were subtracted from measurements of labelled samples, and fluorescence uptake during dedifferentiation expressed as a percentage of uptake measured in undifferentiated cells.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by Wellcome Trust Senior Fellowship 202867/Z/16/Z to JRC and Medical Research Council (MRC) funding (MC_U12266B) to the MRC LMCB University Unit at UCL.

Fragmentation of isolated mRNA prior to first strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using incubation conditions recommended by the manufacturer for an insert size of 300 bp (94°C for 10 min). 13 cycles of PCR were performed for final library amplification. Resulting libraries were quantified using the Qubit 2.0 spectrophotometer (Life Technologies, California, USA) and average fragment size assessed using the Agilent 2200 Tapestation with D1000 screentape (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). A final sequencing pool was created using equimolar quantities of each sample with compatible indexes. 75 bp paired-end reads were generated for each library using the Illumina NextSeq500 in conjunction with a Mid-output 150-cycle kit or NextSeq500 v2 High-output 150-cycle kit (Illumina Inc, Cambridge, UK).</p><p>Read quality was checked using FASTQC. Reads were mapped to the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> genome (version obtained from Gareth Bloomfield, masking the duplication on chromosome 2) using Tophat v2.0.9. For mapping, the library type parameter was set to ‘fr-firststrand’, as appropriate for the dUTP method used in the library preparation kit. Mapped reads were assigned to gene models using HtSeqCount v0.5.4p3. Here we specified that reads came from a directional first-strand enriched library by setting the stranded parameter as ‘reverse’, so that read pairs had to be mapped in the correct orientation in order to be assigned to a feature. For handling overlapping features, we used HtSeqCount in ‘union’ mode. This means that reads mapped wholly or in part to multiple features were treated as ambiguous and as a result were not assigned to a feature. To visualize the location of mapped reads we used IGV (v2.6.3).</p></sec><sec id="s10" sec-type="appendix"><title>Single cell RNAseq</title><p>Cell suspensions were loaded to the 10X Chromium Single Cell A Chip (PN-1000009) using the Chromium 3’ Library and Gel Bead Kit v2 (PN-120267) as described by the manufacturers (10X Genomics, California). 14 cycles of cDNA amplification were performed on the purified GEM-RT product, and cDNA was examined for quality using the Agilent 2200 Tapestation with the High-sensitivity D5000 screentape and reagents (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany), and the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies, California, USA). 35 µL of cDNA was used to prepare the 10 × 3’RNA library and 12 and 11 cycles were used for sample index PCR of replicates 1 and 2 respectively. Final cleaned libraries were quantified using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit and average fragment size checked using the Agilent D1000 screentape and reagents.

Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Thermo) and equalised between samples by addition of RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. LDS sample buffer (1x final, Invitrogen) and β-mercaptoethanol (5% v/v final) were added and samples denatured by boiling for 5 min. 30 μg total protein per sample was used for SDS-PAGE in 1x MES SDS running buffer (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose (Protran 0.2 µm pore size, GE) at 35V for 1.25 hr in a Nupage transfer system (Invitrogen). Equal loading and transfer of total protein was assessed by Ponceau S (Sigma) staining of the membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) BSA in TBS-T, then incubated with primary antibody diluted in TBS-T with 5% (w/v) BSA overnight at 4°C. For detecting phospho-AMPK we used a 1/500 dilution of anti-pAMPK alpha (Thr 172, clone 40H9 rabbit mAb, CST#2535). For detecting the mTORC1 substrate p4E-BP1, we used a 1/500 dilution of anti-p4E-BP1 (Thr 37/46, rabbit Ab, CST#9459). After washing in TBS-T, membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked secondary antibody (whole antibody from donkey, GE healthcare) in TBS-T + 5% (w/v) BSA.

Little is known about the process except in very artificial systems, so anything learned about it in a natural system has the potential to be very significant. To address this, the authors use Dictyostelium discoideum, which will halt and reverse its starvation-mediated developmental program if the cells in the mound are dissociated and provided food. With this system, they ask a basic question: Is dedifferentiation simply differentiation in reverse, or something different?</p><p>While this question has been examined in Dictyostelium, the authors do a much more thorough an in depth examination into the transcriptional changes associated with differentiation and dedifferentiation. It is the power of this approach that makes their finding that in general dedifferentiation correlates with a reversal of developmental gene expression valuable and worthy of publication.</p><p>Unfortunately, their attempts at identifying the genetic regulators of the process were unsuccessful. The genetic screen using act8-mNeonGreen was inspired, even though it did not work. However, the remainder of the focused didn't seem as logical. While the choice of protein types (signaling, transcription, cell division and growth) made sense, the chosen genes seemed random. There were much more rational choices within these groups. DhkA is a developmentally regulated signaling protein that is known to be involved in dedifferentiation. ChdA, ChdB and ChdC are supposed chromatin remodeling proteins that are master regulators for developmental gene expression. There are multiple G α proteins that are known to be involved in food sensing during growth. Almost all of the mutants of all of these gene are able to reach the mound stage of development, so can be examined in this dedifferentiation system. While I am not suggesting that the authors perform these experiments in order to have this manuscript published, I would like a clearer rationale for the mutants that they did choose and why they are better choices than others.</p><p>I would also be wary of claiming that the dedifferentiation programme is genetically robust for the same reasons. Even though the multitude of mutants they tested didn't show large effects on dedifferentiation, they left out some fairly obvious ones. It would be safer to say that dedifferentiation is more genetically robust that differentiation, since there are a lot more genes that disrupt differentiation. However, this probably has more to do with the fact that development and differentiation requires a higher degree of temporal coordination than dedifferentiation. For dedifferentiation, it makes sense that it doesn't matter whether regulated cAR1 expression occurs before or after adenylyl cyclase expression or G α 2 expression. However, during development, the relative timing of expression is crucial.</p><p>The cryS experiments were critical in demonstrating that cell fate was not responsible for the two different populations of dedifferentiated cells identified based on motility and division speed. I would ask that the control be mentioned showing proper CrS-mNeonGreen expression in the mounds before dissociation otherwise we don't know whether the system worked well-enough to identify actual prestalk cells. I'd also request a reanalysis of the data to see whether the high/low CryS-mNeonGreen expressing cells had the same ratios of high speed/low speed cells as the entire population. It may be that there is an enrichment of one type of cell based on CryS-mNeonGreeen expression. The data should already exist. It would just need to be analyzed differently.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This work focusses on dedifferentiation, an overlooked but important process that is important for wound healing, stem cell replenishment and cancer progression.</p><p>The authors first use an RNAseq approach to compare forward development and dedifferentiation and find that while occurring at a slower pace, the reverse trajectory is the mirror image of the forward trajectory for most genes, but that this is less so for genes involved in protein degradation and ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>They investigate the hypothesis that dedifferentiation revisits earlier developmental stages, which is suggested by the behaviour of a relatively small number of developmental markers in both pluripotent stem cell induction and their current study. However, for a larger set of 402 genes involved in the aggregation process that precedes the chosen endpoint of forward development, the extent to which this holds true varies from 41% to 22% of genes, dependent on whether dedifferentiation is induced by exposure to bacterial food or to liquid nutrient medium. This suggest that also for animal cells this hypothesis needs to be revisited.</p><p>The authors use several approaches to show that the dedifferentiation process is robust and not easily perturbed by single gene deletions, such as those of transcription factors and signaling genes that are up-regulated at the onset of dedifferentiation, or identified from mutants that fail to up-regulate the act8 gene that is only expressed in undifferentiated cells.</p><p>A single cell RNAseq approach was used to determine the relationship between cell division and expression of cell cycle genes. This showed that cell division lagged 12 h behind and occurred when cells had almost completely dedifferentiated, which supported by additional experimentation indicated that cell division is not required for dedifferentiation.</p><p>Motility followed expression of motility genes more closely, but surprisingly only a fraction of the cells showed the expected increase in motility during dedifferentiation. This appeared unrelated to the prespore or prestalk cell fate that the cells had acquired. The latter also had no effect on the timing of cell division during dedifferentiation nor on the path taken by the two cell types to reach the dedifferentiated state.</p><p>These results contrast quite strikingly with forward development where cell fate is correlated with several parameters that vary in early stage cells, such as cell cycle phase and nutritional state.</p><p>All in all the study demonstrates interesting similarities and differences between forward and reverse differentiation in Dictyostelia, which can be expected to be true for other multicellular organisms as well. The experimentation and data analysis is of a very high standard with important conclusions being supported by complementary approaches.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55435.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Results subsections “Genome scale features of dedifferentiation” and “Staging gene expression during dedifferentiation” – since this seems to largely follow the Katoh paper, you should point out similarities and differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We have incorporated several additional references to the Katoh paper in this section, and in the manuscript as a whole, to better contextualize our studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Genetic robustness of the dedifferentiation programme” – the authors say they cannot find mutants that affect dedifferentiation, but Katoh et al. showed that the dhkA mutant strongly affects dedifferentiation, I'm very puzzled.</p></disp-quote><p>A closer analysis of the Katoh paper, together with further analysis of our own RNAseq data, provides an improved contextualization of the phenotype of the <italic>dhkA</italic> mutant:</p><p>1) All but one of the dedifferentiation features of the <italic>dhkA</italic> mutant showed wild-type behaviour.</p><p>2) The one phenotype apparent in the <italic>dhkA</italic> mutants was a delay in the increase in cell counts during dedifferentiation, although it was not clear from the Katoh data whether this apparent growth defect was specific to dedifferentiation, or a more general growth defect caused by loss of <italic>dhkA</italic>.

We checked the expression of the <italic>chdA, chdB</italic> and <italic>chdC</italic> genes in our RNAseq data and found they are strongly induced during development and rapidly repressed during dedifferentiation. These would not be candidates using our criteria. Of the G-α proteins, most showed no induction during dedifferentiation, although two of the genes did. However, the induction showed by these genes was not sufficient to satisfy our induction criteria, and the genes did not pass cutoff. We have expanded the rationale in the text for the selection of the genes we decided to test functionally.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would also be wary of claiming that the dedifferentiation programme is genetically robust for the same reasons. Even though the multitude of mutants they tested didn't show large effects on dedifferentiation, they left out some fairly obvious ones. It would be safer to say that dedifferentiation is more genetically robust that differentiation, since there are a lot more genes that disrupt differentiation. However, this probably has more to do with the fact that development and differentiation requires a higher degree of temporal coordination than dedifferentiation. For dedifferentiation, it makes sense that it doesn't matter whether regulated cAR1 expression occurs before or after adenylyl cyclase expression or G α 2 expression. However, during development, the relative timing of expression is crucial.</p></disp-quote><p>Exactly our view: we have described this in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The cryS experiments were critical in demonstrating that cell fate was not responsible for the two different populations of dedifferentiated cells identified based on motility and division speed. I would ask that the control be mentioned showing proper CrS-mNeonGreen expression in the mounds before dissociation otherwise we don't know whether the system worked well-enough to identify actual prestalk cells. I'd also request a reanalysis of the data to see whether the high/low CryS-mNeonGreen expressing cells had the same ratios of high speed/low speed cells as the entire population. It may be that there is an enrichment of one type of cell based on CryS-mNeonGreeen expression. The data should already exist. It would just need to be analyzed differently.</p></disp-quote><p>Good questions. CryS is a robust prestalk marker in mounds and slugs- we have shown this using multiple approaches (transcriptomics and live imaging) in an earlier study (Antolovic et al., 2019). We carried out the reanalysis requested by the reviewer and found no difference in the motility distributions of the high and low CryS cells. The KS test p-values of this analysis have been incorporated into the text associated with Figure 6.</p></body></sub-article></article>
