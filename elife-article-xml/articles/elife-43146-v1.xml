Cells contain thousands of different components that can be difficult to distinguish between when viewed using a microscope. It helps to have a method to tag the molecule of interest to make it more easily visible.</p><p>Electron microscopes can capture images that reveal much finer details than traditional light microscopes. To create an electron microscope image, a high-powered beam of electrons strikes the molecules in the sample being studied. Heavier atoms scatter electrons more strongly than lighter atoms, thus, fewer electrons reach the detector and the atoms appear darker in the images. Gold atoms are heavier than the atoms that make up biological molecules (mostly carbon, nitrogen and oxygen). ‘Tagging’ molecules that you want to study using clusters of gold atoms would therefore help to highlight them inside cells.</p><p>Azubel et al. have now developed a method to attach gold nanoparticles to small molecules, and used the technique to track the movement of a protein called fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in human fat cells. It had previously been discovered that rats fed a high fat diet live longer and do not gain weight when treated with FGF21. Understanding how FGF21 works could therefore help researchers to develop new treatments for obesity and type II diabetes.</p><p>Azubel et al. captured many electron microscope images of cells containing tagged FGF21 proteins. This revealed that two copies of the protein work together. First, each copy of FGF21 attaches to a receptor on the surface of the cell. The two FGF21-receptor pairs bind together to form part of a larger ‘complex’. The complex is engulfed by part of the nearby cell membrane, which pinches off from the rest of the membrane to form a compartment known as a vesicle. The FGF21-receptor complex stays bound together as the vesicle travels along the cell’s internal skeleton. Eventually, portions of the vesicle’s membrane ‘bud’ to form a new compartment called a multivesicular body. At this point, the FGF21 proteins and the receptors separate from each other.</p><p>Future work could build on these results in an effort to improve how we treat obesity and type II diabetes. The gold nanoparticle tracking technique developed by Azubel et al. could also be used to track other proteins using electron microscopy. This opens the way to determining the structures that proteins form when they are inside cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-ET</kwd><kwd>FGFR</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI 21144</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kornberg</surname><given-names>Roger D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 122588</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>Grant J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had role in study design, and the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Specific attachment of molecularly defined gold nanoparticles enables precise localization, critical for structural studies in vivo, of proteins of unknown structure within the cellular milieu by cryo-electron tomography.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Imaging of cell structure has been performed using fluorescence light microscopy at modest resolution on living cells in real time, and using electron microscopy at higher resolution on fixed, embedded, sectioned material. The power of fluorescence light microscopy has been extended by super-resolution techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baddeley and Bewersdorf, 2018</xref>), while advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have yielded structures of purified proteins at near atomic resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peplow, 2017</xref>), and have enhanced tomography of intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oikonomou and Jensen, 2017</xref>). Cryo-ET provides an opportunity to study proteins as they interact with a myriad of other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beck and Baumeister, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Irobalieva et al., 2016</xref>), often lost during protein purification. Very large multi-protein assemblies, such as ribosomes and chemoreceptor arrays, scatter electrons strongly enough that they can be recognized in electron micrographs of frozen hydrated specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briegel and Jensen, 2017</xref>). Our approach, employing AuNP conjugates, enables the identification and image processing of most molecules and molecular assemblies, which are too small to be detected against the background of scattering from the cellular milieu. To that end, we have developed defined heavy atom clusters, targeted to individual molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azubel and Kornberg, 2016</xref>). We report here on the application of such clusters to the fibroblast growth factor FGF21 in human primary adipocytes.</p><p>FGFs are essential in cell biology, either by their participation in cell proliferation, cell survival and cell motility (paracrine FGFs), or by their connection to metabolic processes (endocrine FGFs). These diverse activities share a common first step: binding of FGFs to cell membrane receptors. There are four genes for FGF receptors (FGFRs), which produce seven alternatively spliced variants. Paracrine and endocrine FGFs, totaling 15 and three secreted proteins, respectively, compete for binding to these seven FGFRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ornitz and Itoh, 2015</xref>). Binding requires co-factors: paracrine FGFs are assisted by heparan sulfate, and endocrine FGFs by either αKlotho or βKlotho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kilkenny and Rocheleau, 2016</xref>). Binding leads to FGFR dimerization and activation of FGFR tyrosine kinase activity, which triggers RAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and PLCγ1 signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ornitz and Itoh, 2015</xref>). Whereas signaling is commonly thought to occur at the cell surface, it continues in endosomal locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jean et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haugsten et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, signaling cascades are interrupted when endocytosis is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yaqoob et al., 2014</xref>). Endocytosis modulates signaling, as the specific endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mayor and Pagano, 2007</xref>) determines whether the receptor is recycled to the cell surface or destined for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haugsten et al., 2005</xref>). Signaling must therefore be studied in the context of membrane internalization and vesicle trafficking.</p><p>A fundamental question regarding the activation of the signaling cascade is the stochiometry of the ternary complex (FGF-receptor-cofactor). Competing models have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goetz and Mohammadi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yie et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pomin, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kilkenny and Rocheleau, 2016</xref>). The crystal structure of FGF2-FGFR1c (extracellular domains D2-D3) and heparan sulfate showed a 2:2:2 ternary complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schlessinger et al., 2000</xref>). αKlotho and βKlotho differ significantly in both size and shape from heparan sulfate, and also compete with some paracrine FGFs for the same regions to bind receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goetz and Mohammadi, 2013</xref>). Thus a different mode of binding that could lead to a different stochiometry for endocrine ternary complexes could not be ruled out. Indeed, subsequent studies of FGF21-FGFR1c-βKlotho have favored a 1:2:1 model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ming et al., 2012</xref>). Most recently, the crystal structure of a 1:1:1 complex of membrane proximal portion of extracellular FGFR1c, soluble αKlotho, and FGF23 was described, and dimerization of the αKlotho complex was observed in the presence of heparan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). The extracellular domain of βKlotho bound to the C-terminus of FGF21 was also determined by X-ray crystallography, revealing a 1:1 complex, suggested to lead to an overall 2:2:2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We focus here on the FGF21-FGFR1c-βKlotho ternary complex. In recent years, FGF21 has emerged as a potential candidate for treatment of obesity and type II diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kharitonenkov and DiMarchi, 2015</xref>). Pleiotropy of FGF21 includes effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in adipocyte tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Degirolamo et al., 2016</xref>). FGF21 signals through FGFR1c, FGFR2c and FGFR3c, provided that βKlotho is accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kilkenny and Rocheleau, 2016</xref>). Both FGFR1c and βKlotho are endogenously expressed in adipocyte tissue.</p><p>The pathway of FGF21-FGFR1c-βKlotho complex internalization remains an open question. Evidence for both clathrin-dependent (Jean et al.) and clathrin-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haugsten et al., 2011</xref>) pathways, for different combinations of FGF and FGFR, has been presented. Regarding the FGF21-FGFR1c-βKlotho complex, dynamin-dependent endocytosis has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yaqoob et al., 2014</xref>). However, dynamin has been found associated to both clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mayor and Pagano, 2007</xref>).</p><p>With the use of gold-labeled FGF21 (AuNP-FGF21) and cryo-ET, we captured different states of activation, internalization, and traffic of the FGF21-FGFR1c-βKlotho ternary complex, from binding and complex formation at the cell surface, to coated pits, to coated vesicles, to endosomes, and finally, to multivesicular bodies, in which the complexes were disrupted. These observations are clearly indicative of clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Finally, subtomogram averaging and helical reconstruction revealed structures of other important components, including putative AAA+ ATPases, actin filaments, and microtubules, giving a three-dimensional picture of the entire pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FGF21-FGFR1c-βKlotho ternary complex in membrane vesicles</title><p>A 144-gold atom nanoparticle (AuNP) was conjugated with an FGF21 variant bearing a surface-exposed cysteine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azubel and Kornberg, 2016</xref>). Interaction in ternary complexes was assessed using membrane preparations from three cell sources: parental CHO cells, in which neither FGFR1c nor βKlotho are expressed; transformed CHO cells overexpressing βKlotho and FGFR1c or only βKlotho; and human primary adipocytes, in which βKlotho and FGFR1c are endogenously expressed. Vesicles were treated at 4°C with either AuNP-FGF21 or a gold-labeled single chain antibody fragment (AuNP-scFv) that binds βKlotho, and washed to remove unbound gold conjugate. Grids for cryo-EM were prepared by plunge-freezing. Micrographs of vesicles from parental CHO cells membrane preparations treated with AuNP-FGF21 showed no associated AuNPs, whereas micrographs of vesicles from primary adipocytes membrane preparations treated with AuNP-FGF21 showed pairs of AuNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). AuNPs were distinguishable from other particles because of an effect of the contrast transfer function, producing a bright halo around the strongly scattering gold core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Pairing of particles cannot be determined from 2D images alone, as two particles in close proximity in the x-y plane may be far apart in z. Tilt series were therefore collected for membrane preparations from CHO cells overexpressing βKlotho and FGFR1c treated with AuNP-FGF21, followed by tomographic reconstruction, showing that 85% of AuNPs were in true pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a–g</xref>), indicative of two copies of FGF21 in the receptor complex.</p><p>Treatment of these CHO membrane vesicles with AuNP-scFv against βKlotho also resulted in a high percentage of pairs of particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3h</xref>), indicative of an overall 2:2:2 stoichometry for the receptor complex. When membrane preparations from CHO cells expressing only βKlotho were treated with AuNP-scFv against βKlotho, pairs of particles were not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3j</xref>), showing that βKlotho did not dimerize on its own. When the same vesicles were treated with AuNP-FGF21, however, pairs of particles were again observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3i</xref>). Either two molecules of FGF21 bind to one βKlotho, or FGF21 induces dimerization of overexpressed βKlotho, even in the absence of receptor.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43146.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-ET of a vesicle from human adipocytes membrane preparations, treated with AuNP-FGF21 conjugate.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Isosurface rendering of tomographic reconstruction, with membrane density in blue-gray, density on the outer surface of the membrane in brown, density on the inner surface of the membrane in red, and AuNPs in yellow.

The occurrence of most AuNP-FGF21 in pairs pertains to the stoichiometry of the ternary complex.

Not only were almost all AuNPs paired in both clathrin-coated vesicles and endosomes (89% and 88%, respectively), but they were also invariably adjacent to the inner membrane surface, pointing to persistence of the FGF21-FGFR1c-βKlotho complex. Finally, after overnight incubation at 37°C, AuNPs were observed in multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Among 44 AuNPs observed inside five MVBs in different cells, no two AuNPs were closer than 250 Å to one another. AuNPs in MVBs were not only unpaired but also unassociated with the vesicle membranes, indicating the disruption of the FGF21-FGFR1c-βKlotho complex in MVBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1f</xref>).</p><p>Our findings demonstrate a clathrin-dependent pathway, and point to accessory factors in the process. Thus, clathrin pits were seen to be associated with abundant actin filaments, including y-shaped filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), and with hexameric rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Clathrin nets were clearly resolved in 11 tomograms coming from nine different cells. In all cases the nets were surrounded by y-shaped actin. In 10 of the 11 tomograms, at least one hexameric ring was found within 50 nm of the net, and hexameric rings were observed in all cases if the search was expanded to 75 nm from the net. The number of hexameric rings within 75 nm varied among nets from one to 21. The association of hexameric rings with clathrin nets was supported by the orientation of the rings. The bottom surface of the rings was larger than the top surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) and the bottom was always oriented toward clathrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our findings are in keeping with the literature regarding the role of actin filaments and of y-shaped filaments in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaksonen et al., 2006</xref>), and also in keeping with the literature regarding p97-clathrin interaction and the involvement of p97 in endosomal sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings go further, showing persistence of the FGF21-FGFR1c- βKlotho complex in endosomes, and disruption of the complex in MVBs. The example of an MVB shown here lies in proximity to a long microtubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1f</xref>). As some FGFs travel all the way to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sørensen et al., 2006</xref>), and membrane vesicles are transported along microtubules, the MVB may be involved in transport of FGF to the nucleus.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43146.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Orientation and proximity of hexameric rings to clathrin nets.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Top view and (<bold>b</bold>) side view of 3D tomogramographic data from cell shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, with dual color hexameric ring as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.

They contribute to the emerging picture of the FGF signalling mechanism and trafficking inside cells. They show that two copies of FGF21 are present in the FGF21-FGFR1c-βKlotho ternary complex in cells, and that two copies of βKlotho are present as well, pointing to an overall 2:2:2 stochiometry. Second, FGF21-FGFR1c-βKlotho complexes undergo clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Information from multiple tomograms shows that the ternary complexes undergo clathrin-dependent endocytosis and gives a three-dimensional picture of the entire pathway. The same approach can be applied to other FGFs. Further study of both endocrine and paracrine FGFs would shed light on the complex regulation of FGFRs-induced signaling cascades.</p><p>With regard to methodological significance, our findings extend previous investigations by EM tomography of plastic-embedded sections and by cryo-EM of protein-receptor complexes in liposomes, performed with the use of commercial gold nanoparticle preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2009</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers all agree that this study represents a significant technical achievement, which should be published upon completion of the revisions requested. However, there was also a general consensus that publication in the 'Tools and Resources' category, as opposed to the 'Research Article' category, seems more appropriate, due to the limited conceptual advance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The work from Azubel et al. provides one of the most detailed examples of how a growth factor receptor engages an extracellular ligand and is subsequently transported from the cell surface via clathrin-mediated endocytosis to arrive at a multivesicular body, where the ligand dissociates. From these studies, it is now clear that FGF21 binds to its receptor and co-receptor with 2:2:2 stoichiometry (in cultured cells), and the complex remains assembled while trafficking via vesicular intermediates along cytoskeletal elements until reaching a mature, multivesicular compartment. The approaches chosen (cryo-EM combined with the use of gold nanoparticles) are ideal for studying this process. However, there is a lack of quantification throughout the study – in its present form, it is not even feasible to know how many times experiments were repeated to draw the conclusions made. Prior to publication, this issue must be addressed.</p><p>Specifically, the electron microscopy would be much more compelling if the authors supported their observations with quantitative analysis throughout the manuscript. They begin to do this in Figure 1—figure supplement 3 with the percentage of paired nanoparticles but subsequent statements are not backed by similar rigor. For example, what percent of nanoparticles were paired in coated vesicles and endosomes (subsection “Cytoplasmic structures and the FGF21 endocytotic pathway”) compared to MVBs, how often were clathrin pits associated with Y-shaped filaments and hexameric rings, and how many occurrences of hexameric rings oriented toward clathrin were observed? Even though pairs of Klotho were not observed without ligand or receptor (subsection “FGF21-FGFR1c-βKlotho ternary complex in membrane vesicles”, second paragraph) how many particles were observed and how many samples were analyzed? Also, what attempts were made to quantify the incidence of FGF21 gold nanoparticle uptake in CHO cells?</p><p>The addition of quantitative measurements for each figure should be included in the revised manuscript, and the manuscript should then be resubmitted under the 'Tools and Resources' category.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43146.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The work from Azubel et al. provides one of the most detailed examples of how a growth factor receptor engages an extracellular ligand and is subsequently transported from the cell surface via clathrin-mediated endocytosis to arrive at a multivesicular body, where the ligand dissociates.
