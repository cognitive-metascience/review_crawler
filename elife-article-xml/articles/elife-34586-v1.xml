between their neighbors. Previous research has focused on properties of cell<underline>–</underline>cell <italic>interfaces</italic>, while the function of tricellular <italic>vertices</italic> has remained unaddressed. Here, we identify a highly novel mechanism in which vertices demonstrate independent sliding behaviors along cell peripheries to produce the topological deformations responsible for intercalation. Through systematic analysis, we find that the motion of vertices connected by contracting interfaces is not physically coupled, but instead possess strong radial coupling. E-cadherin and Myosin II exist in previously unstudied populations at cell vertices and undergo oscillatory cycles of accumulation and dispersion that are coordinated with changes in cell area. Additionally, peak enrichment of vertex E-cadherin/Myosin II coincides with interface length stabilization. Our results suggest a model in which asymmetric radial force balance directs the progressive, ratcheted motion of individual vertices to drive intercalation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34586.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells need to come together to form tissues of different shapes and sizes. Cells can move about in different ways to shape the tissues. For example, a process called cell intercalation is vital for creating elongated structures like the spinal cord and inner ear. In intercalation, a cell slots itself between neighboring cells to lengthen tissues in one direction.</p><p>Most of the work to understand cell intercalation has examined the interfaces that form between two neighboring cells. But there are points called vertices where three cells make contact with each other. Vanderleest, Smits et al. have now used microscopy and computational analysis to examine these contact points, known as vertices, in fruit flies.</p><p>It was thought that vertices that are connected by a single interface coordinate how they move. However, Vanderleest, Smits et al. now show that these connected vertices move independently of each other. Instead, the movements of unconnected vertices on opposite sides of the cell show coordination.</p><p>Vanderleest, Smits et al. also found that two proteins build up at the vertices in the early stages of intercalation. One of these, called E-cadherin, enables cells to stick to each other. The other protein, called Myosin II, helps E-cadherin to localize to the vertices and also enables cells to contract. These results suggest that the vertices help to guide intercalation and changes in cell shape.</p><p>Tracking the vertices over time revealed that they slide around the surface of the cells. During this sliding the total length of the interfaces that meet at the vertex remains the same – so as one becomes shorter, neighboring interfaces will become longer. This creates a zipper-like movement of the vertices that tugs the cells into line and suggests a new mechanism by which interconnected cells can change shape. Future work will focus on identifying the molecules that specify these unique vertex behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>cell intercalation</kwd><kwd>tricellular vertices</kwd><kwd>cell ratcheting</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIGMS R01 GM090065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blankenship</surname><given-names>Todd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIGMS R15 GM126422</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blankenship</surname><given-names>Todd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001309</institution-id><institution>Research Corporation for Science Advancement</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loerke</surname><given-names>Dinah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R15 GM117463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loerke</surname><given-names>Dinah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tricellular vertices possess sliding behaviors that harness radial forces and drive cell shape changes and intercalation in an epithelial tissue.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A common characteristic of many tissues and organisms is an elongation along a primary dimensional axis. The oriented intercalation of cells is one of the fundamental mechanisms utilized to direct tissue elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Keller et al., 2000</xref>). Tissue elongation is essential to the shaping of an elongated body axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Keller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Irvine and Wieschaus, 1994</xref>), as well as the development of many internal organs, such as the palate, cochlea, gut, and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chalmers and Slack, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tudela et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lienkamp et al., 2012</xref>). Epithelial cell intercalation drives elongation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> body axis during gastrulation, in a process known as germband extension (GBE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Irvine and Wieschaus, 1994</xref>). The intercalary behaviors driving GBE occur through a remodeling of cell topologies, with cells contracting shared anterior-posterior (AP, vertical or T1) interfaces to a single point, followed by newly juxtaposed dorsal-ventral (DV) cells constructing horizontally-oriented interfaces between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Irvine and Wieschaus, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collinet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yu and Fernandez-Gonzalez, 2016</xref>). This is referred to as a topological T1 process, and results in a cumulative contraction of the embryonic epithelium along the DV axis, which helps to drive a perpendicular elongation along the AP axis.</p><p>Previous research into the genetic factors associated with GBE has shown that global polarizing cues from maternal AP patterning are translated into asymmetric protein distributions at the cellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Irvine and Wieschaus, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>). At AP interfaces, Myosin II forms both supracellular cables and smaller, transient networks. Protein populations associated with adhesion (E-cadherin, ß-catenin, Bazooka/Par-3) are found enriched at non-contracting interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>). This body of work led to a model in which actomyosin networks mediate higher line tensions along AP interfaces to direct contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rauzi et al., 2008</xref>). However, these studies have been limited to the molecular and mechanical characteristics of <italic>interfaces</italic> between two cells. The discrete regions where these interfaces overlap, <italic>tricellular vertices</italic>, have never been comprehensively examined.</p><p>As a result of the focus on cell-cell interfaces, many studies on force-generation during intercalation have addressed forces oriented along the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rauzi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rauzi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kasza et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Simões et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collinet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yu and Fernandez-Gonzalez, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). However, Myosin II populations are highly active and are transiently present in multiple locations in epithelial cells, including in medial and apical cell regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rauzi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernandez-Gonzalez and Zallen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sawyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). These medial actomyosin networks drive a number of morphogenetic processes by mediating oscillations in cell area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Roh-Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Simões et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, during GBE medial Myosin II flows direct apical area oscillations that contribute to AP/DV anisotropy within a cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rauzi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernandez-Gonzalez and Zallen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sawyer et al., 2011</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which they could be linked to cell-neighbor exchange have been unclear.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that vertices move independently of one another during T1 contraction, and exhibit distinct molecular dynamics that are required for effective intercalation. We show that intercalation proceeds through a sliding vertex mechanism that physically couples vertex motion to radially-oriented forces. E-cadherin and Myosin II are strikingly enriched at vertices, and this vertex enrichment coincides with length stabilization post-sliding. E-cadherin recruitment at vertices is coordinated with apical cell area oscillations, and is favored at vertices associated with AP interfaces. Finally, perturbing Myosin II function reduces E-cadherin enrichment and dynamics at vertices, and leads to a loss of productive intercalation. Together, these observations provide a mechanism by which area oscillations are coupled to cyclic molecular dynamics, and further introduce a link between the molecular properties of tricellular vertices and the emergent biophysical properties of the tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>E-cadherin is dynamic and enriched at tricellular vertices</title><p>To study in more detail how cell topologies are remodeled, we first examined the localization of endogenously tagged E-cadherin (E-cad:GFP) at the onset of intercalation. Strikingly, and in contrast to the previously reported homogenous distribution of E-cadherin along DV interfaces at mid-GBE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>), we found that E-cadherin was highly enriched at vertices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B and C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). This strong vertex-association of E-cadherin began at the onset of GBE, with E-cadherin diffusely present at apical cell interfaces prior to intercalation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and D’</xref>). Systematic quantification of vertex-associated E-cadherin averaged across the entire time of GBE (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) also revealed that E-cadherin maintains a higher vertex:interface ratio than does a control, plasma membrane-associated marker (Gap43:mCh; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Interestingly, although E-cadherin is enriched at vertices, it possesses a much wider distribution of intensities than the control marker, which suggested that vertex associated E-cadherin might undergo cycles of enrichment and dispersion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Analysis of vertex E-cadherin confirmed that the intensity of enrichment fluctuates in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). These results show that the vertex-specific localization of E-cadherin temporally coincides with intercalary movements, and suggest that vertex E-cadherin may function in directing GBE.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34586.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Enrichment and dynamics of E-cadherin at vertices.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Vertex enrichment of E-cadherin at the initiation of GBE.

A central physical expectation from previously described line-tension models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rauzi et al., 2010</xref>) is that the inward movement of vertices connected by a contracting interface should show evidence of mechanical coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, however, we observed no evidence of this hypothesized coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Indeed, in systematic pair-wise analyses of cell vertices, physical coupling could only be observed in <italic>radial</italic> directions (e.g. between vertices 3 and 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B’ and C</xref>). In other words, an inward correlation of vertex motion was only found between vertex pairs on opposite sides of the cell, with the largest correlations between those diametrically opposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results indicate that during the contraction of an AP interface, the motion of the two vertices toward the middle of the interface (referred to as ‘productive’ motion) occurs independently of each other, while all vertices undergo coupled motion into the radial direction. These results argue against a line tension-driven model of interface contraction, and suggest that intercalary movements should be reconsidered in terms of cell vertices and radially exerted forces.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34586.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Radial coupling and sliding of cell vertices during intercalation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing line tension model, in which tensioned springs pull across interface lengths on either side of a contracting interface.

This compensatory increase in adjacent interface length is contrary to what would be expected through canonical models of interface contraction, in which the contracting interface shortens while adjacent interfaces maintain a constant length. Additionally, analysis of the lengths of all contracting and adjacent interfaces throughout GBE demonstrated that this behavior is a systematic component of T1-associated vertex movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Under isotropic conditions, the expected theoretical behavior would be that interface lengths would oscillate along with oscillations in cell area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and C’</xref>; black). However, an intriguing behavior is observed when empirical interface lengths are plotted against cell phase. We observed a larger than isotropic <italic>decrease</italic> in vertical interface length during area contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and C’</xref>; blue; an individual example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Notably, this decrease is <italic>preserved</italic> even as area contractions are reversed. Conversely, transverse interfaces undergo a smaller than isotropic decrease in interface length, and appear to undergo a compensatory increase in interface length during area expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and C’</xref>; red). To account for the fact that area contraction and expansion generally are associated with decreases and increases in cell perimeter, we also plotted the effective length changes, or fractional length (defined as interface length divided by cell perimeter), of vertical and transverse interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The fractional length metric has the advantage that isotropic area changes do not result in changes of total fractional length. These results show that about 64% of the effective length contraction of vertical interfaces occurs during area contraction, while only 36% occurs during area expansion when absolute length is stabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, vertex sliding occurs opportunistically during area contraction phases in a ratchet-like fashion, so that shortened vertical interface lengths are stabilized during area expansion.</p><p>We also used this phasic analysis to examine cell contours during periods when cells are actively contracting in cell area as compared to periods when cells are expanding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). We generated a convexity/concavity cell shape metric by comparing the area ratio between a theoretical straight-line Euclidean geometry that connects cell vertices to the experimentally defined cell contours. Interestingly, cells possess concave cell contours during contraction, and convex boundaries during apical area expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref>). These results are consistent with cell vertices, but not cell interfaces, leading overall changes in cell shape and again suggest that cell vertices are key structures that govern cell topologies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>E-cadherin intensities are in phase with area oscillations and peak with vertex stabilization</title><p>We then examined the behaviors of E-cadherin in cells during observed oscillations in apical area. As cell areas contracted, we found specific vertices where E-cadherin became distinctly more enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, yellow arrowhead). In these instances, the associated T1 interface length decrease observed during area contraction was stabilized during subsequent area expansion. In contrast, other vertices had very little E-cadherin enrichment, and the interface length change of these vertices scaled with area oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, white arrowhead). A cross-correlation function relating E-cadherin intensity and cell area showed that as areas decreased, vertex-associated E-cadherin intensity systematically increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–A’’’</xref>). Interestingly, this cross-correlation also showed that vertex E-cadherin intensity peaks just before cell area is in its most contracted state and before the onset of area expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Together, this phase relationship suggests that E-cadherin intensity is coordinated with cell area oscillations, and that enrichment of E-cadherin acts to stabilize sliding vertices. These results further indicate a model in which area oscillations provide the force for intercalation, with E-cadherin dynamics functioning as a molecular ratchet to harness vertex-sliding into productive movement.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34586.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>E-cadherin stabilizes cell vertices.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of a cell contracting in area while vertical interfaces contract.

We therefore inhibited endocytosis by injecting embryos with a small-molecule inhibitor, chlorpromazine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levayer et al., 2011</xref>). This increased the total amount of E-cadherin at cell vertices and interfaces compared to control embryos; additionally, cells maintained a vertex-associated enrichment of E-cadherin throughout GBE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Importantly, endocytic inhibition prevented E-cadherin from oscillating to a lower enrichment state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Although E-cadherin dynamics were disrupted, oscillations in cell areas still occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). However, under these conditions we found that there was virtually no difference between the theoretical isotropic length change and the observed length changes for either vertical or transverse interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). To account for the possibility that vertex sliding is reduced due to other effects of endocytic inhibition we also measured length changes in E-cadherin overexpressing embryos and found that length ratcheting is also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C–C’’</xref>). Indeed, vertices in Ubiquitin-E-cadherin:GFP overexpressing embryos had displacements that were reduced by 41% as compared to control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C’</xref>’). Thus, stabilizing E-cadherin prevents vertex sliding and uncouples the ratcheted motion of individual vertices from the motive oscillations in cell area. This further suggests that increased E-cadherin levels restrict vertex sliding, and supports a model in which E-cadherin enrichment at the end of an apical area oscillation serves as a ratchet that stabilizes vertices post-sliding.</p><media id="video4" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-34586-video4.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34586.014</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Cell area oscillations in chlorpromazine injected embryo.</title><p>Time-lapse images of a cell (shaded blue) expressing the adhesion marker E-cad:GFP undergoing area oscillations (top) and a plot of the cell area (bottom) over time.

However, since vertices receive molecular and mechanical inputs from three different cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), we developed new computational approaches to study vertex motion with respect to the phases of all three involved cells. To do so, we first decomposed the displacement of a given vertex into two independent components: one tangential and one radial to the cell center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A’</xref>, cyan and blue lines, respectively). Since radial displacement would be expected from isotropic area contraction, productive sliding displacements were defined from the analysis of tangential motions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A’</xref>, cyan). This was then plotted against the phases of each cell that share a common vertex, permitting the measurement of the relative contribution of each cell to productive vertex motion. When tangential displacement rates were plotted with the phases of cells A and B (the two AP neighboring cells at a T1 interface, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C’</xref>), productive displacements occurred when both cells were contracting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, C’, E and E’</xref>).

Strikingly, the magnitude of displacement was much greater in this latter condition than in the first condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and E’</xref>). This demonstrates that the phase of cell C is more predictive of productive vertex sliding events than cells A or B, and provides a mechanism for how anisotropic, radial force balance between three cells sharing a common vertex could couple individual T1-associated vertex steps to cell area oscillations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34586.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Cell-specific phase anisotropy drives vertex displacements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of cell undergoing anisotropic apical area contraction.

As before, we observed a strong increase in E-cadherin intensity as cell areas contracted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Interestingly, this correlation was observed specifically in vertices with polar angles near 90˚, corresponding to vertices associated with T1 interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). Indeed, only contractile, T1-associated vertices show the maximal intensity increases that peak at the end of area contractions, while DV-associated vertices experienced reduced E-cadherin recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). Stabilizing E-cadherin by disrupting endocytosis reduced the correlation between area phase and vertex movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), again consistent with E-cadherin dynamics directing productive vertex sliding events.

This led us to examine whether medial Myosin II networks could similarly influence the localization and dynamics of E-cadherin at vertices. Simultaneous imaging of Myosin II:mCherry and E-cad:GFP revealed that, in addition to its previously described junctional and medial populations, Myosin II is highly, and dynamically, enriched at vertices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–A’’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B–B’’</xref> with Zipper:GFP). This unexpected population of Myosin II exhibited a strong colocalization with vertex-associated E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and A’</xref>). Furthermore, systematic quantitation of vertex Myosin II and vertex E-cadherin demonstrated a strong cross-correlation, showing that the dynamics of enrichment of both proteins are temporally coupled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–C’’’, D</xref>). Interestingly, this cross-correlation function also revealed a slight temporal offset, with Myosin II becoming enriched at vertices about 3.3 s before E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Similar to E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), phase-based analysis of Myosin II indicated an enrichment during periods of cell area contraction that is polarized to T1 associated vertices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and C’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref> with Zipper:GFP). However, these dynamics again subtly preceded those of E-cadherin (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and C’</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). As was previously described for interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rauzi et al., 2010</xref>), live imaging of individual cell behaviors showed that approximately 50% of medial Myosin II flows moved toward vertices, resulting in vertex enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). Taken together, these observations show that Myosin II dynamics at vertices are similar to, but temporally precede, those of E-cadherin, and suggest a role for Myosin II in clustering E-cadherin at vertices.

Injection of a high concentration of Y-27632 (100 mM) disrupted E-cadherin enrichment to cell vertices, as well as E-cadherin dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A, C and E</xref>). Additionally, analysis of <italic>sqh</italic><sup>AX</sup> mutant embryos produced a similar defect in vertex-associated E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). The phenotype of Y-27632 injected embryos was dose dependent, as injection of a lower concentration (25 mM Y-27632) preserved an enrichment of E-cadherin at cell vertices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and D</xref>). In this background, however, E-cadherin was not significantly polarized to T1 associated vertices, and it lacked cycles of vertex enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7D, F and G</xref>). As a consequence, vertex displacement was severely disrupted in Y-27632 injected embryos at both concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H and I</xref>). Interestingly, although productive vertex displacements are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H and I</xref>, red areas), these displacements are offset by backwards displacements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H and I</xref>, blue areas). These results are consistent with Myosin II functioning upstream of the ratchet-like behavior of E-cadherin at vertices. It is additionally important to note that cell area oscillations are highly disrupted in Y-27632 injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and that the observed lack of E-cadherin dynamics could represent a disruption of coupling between vertex populations of E-cadherin and medial actomyosin-dependent area oscillations.

These results also introduce a new functional unit capable of regulating cell topologies – tricellular vertices. We identify a new mechanism driving cell shape remodeling, in which tricellular vertices slide laterally in response to medial force generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Much of the previous focus in studying intercalary behaviors has been on changes in cell adhesion and force generation at cell interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rauzi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kasza et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Simões et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collinet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Munjal et al., 2015</xref>). While higher line tensions at AP interfaces clearly exist and direct distinct aspects of intercalary cell behaviors (such as interface alignment along the DV axis, recoil velocities upon laser ablation, and boundary element behaviors), it will be interesting to further explore the mechanisms regulating tricellular vertex function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rauzi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tetley et al., 2016</xref>). As vertices are connected to three (or more) interfaces as well as the radial coupling reported on here, their displacement will rely on the summed total of these local force contributions. Some of the mechanisms may involve the endocytic uptake of plasma membrane and adhesion proteins at interfaces which have been recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levayer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jewett et al., 2017</xref>). These molecular models of regulated adhesion are not necessarily dependent on line tensions, and could contribute to the biases in lateral vertex displacements in particular tangential directions. Although our data argue against a predominant function of interface-spanning line tensions in directing interface contraction, local regions of either medial- or interface-associated Myosin II are likely to impact vertex displacements as well. Indeed, although E-cadherin and Myosin II are primarily located at cell vertices early in GBE, by mid-GBE interface localization of both significantly strengthen and is consistent with interface as well as radial contributions to vertex displacements. Thus, cell vertices are well positioned to integrate the many different force-generating networks that will ultimately determine changes in cell shape and topology.</p><p>Our results also show that intercellular adhesion dynamics are required for vertex movement. Under conditions in which E-cadherin exhibited greater enrichment and/or stability than is present in wild-type embryos, AP and transverse interface lengths oscillated identically, suggesting that cell vertices were unable to slide productively due to increased adhesive stability. Stabilizing E-cadherin was achieved by inhibiting endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levayer et al., 2011</xref>), and suggests that endocytic events may underlie the dispersion phase of E-cadherin dynamics at cell vertices. Given that endocytic pathways centered on asymmetric planar behaviors of Clathrin, Dynamin, and Rab35-dependent functions have been previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levayer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jewett et al., 2017</xref>), it will be interesting to further explore if these same pathways function at or near cell vertices to direct E-cadherin dynamics, and whether endocytosis at vertices or at interfaces is more responsible for vertex E-cadherin redistribution. However, one interesting implication of our work is that these endocytic pathways should alter the balance of adhesion on either side of a vertex, potentially through the uptake of E-cadherin adhesion molecules, but the combined length of T1 and transverse interfaces would remain largely unchanged. This again suggests that the positioning of cell vertices will reflect the combined activities of contractile and adhesion elements that are located directly at the vertex as well as in local regions near the vertex. It also underlines the importance of cell vertices, and suggests a primary importance of vertices in determining cell topologies, which is further indicated by the strong enrichments of E-cadherin and Myosin II at cell vertices during early GBE. Regardless, it will require additional work to tease apart the contributions of E-cadherin stabilization and turnover pathways at cell vertices versus cell interfaces.</p><p>We have also shown that as cells contract their apical area, E-cadherin and Myosin II are preferentially recruited to AP vertices to provide the adhesive force necessary to stabilize vertex position and interface length during area relaxation. This, as well as anisotropy in cell area oscillations and local imbalances in interface-associated forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rauzi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernandez-Gonzalez and Zallen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sawyer et al., 2011</xref>), are likely responsible for enforcing the directionality of intercalation. Our results also suggest that, while radial forces in cells sharing a contracting AP interface are important for vertex displacement, vertex displacement has the strongest correlation with expansive motion in the adjacent, DV-oriented cells. This is intriguing, and suggests a homology to recent results during interface extension in which the adjacent cells provide motive force for extension rather than the cells that share the newly growing interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collinet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yu and Fernandez-Gonzalez, 2016</xref>). At the molecular level, AP vs DV anisotropy at the level of vertices could be a result of stress anisotropy and a mechanosensory feedback loop. Alternatively, vertices may also experience differentially positioned signaling networks, allowing for Myosin II and E-cadherin vertex enrichment.</p><p>While the planar sliding behaviors described here are a novel mechanism underlying intercalary behaviors, it is also interesting to note that a similar adherens junction sliding behavior has been observed during three dimensional epithelial folding events as well as during cell ordering in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> notum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curran et al., 2017</xref>). In the formation of the epithelial folds that occur on the dorsal surface of the embryo in response to GBE, there is a basal shift in adherens junction position in response to Rap1 signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Takeda et al., 2018</xref>). It will be intriguing to explore if a similar Rap1-dependent pathway operates on cell vertices during cell intercalation. It is also highly interesting that, in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal notum, a similar conservation of total junctional lengths, referred to as ‘continuous neighbor exchange’ has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curran et al., 2017</xref>). It may well be that the repositioning of junctional/vertex elements will represent a new and conserved paradigm in how cell topologies are re-shaped during development.</p><p>Finally, there is a growing body of work on tricellular vertices as unique epithelial structures. Previous studies have shown that cell vertices possess important molecular characteristics capable of coordinating complex cell morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Staehelin, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graf et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schulte et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ikenouchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byri et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, recent work has shown that tricellular junctions act as key sensors of cell shape that serve as landmarks to orient epithelial cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosveld et al., 2016</xref>), and intestinal stem cells require tricellular function to maintain appropriate homeostatic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Resnik-Docampo et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that vertices represent unique domains of the cell surface and that tricellular vertices have a special role as centers of functional signaling and physical networks within epithelial sheets.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Image and data analysis were performed in MATLAB.

Each contracting interface has two pairs of two transverse interfaces, those for cell A and for cell B, and both pairs were counted in the average.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Acquisition of instantaneous phase and amplitude from cell area</title><p>To get the instantaneous phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B’</xref>) of an oscillating signal such as the area of a cell, we used a method known as the Osculating Circle Method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>), which is based on the Hilbert Transform but better suited for signals with non-zero mean. To get meaningful results using this method, the signal must be filtered to remove the noise that will result in artificial high frequency oscillations. A Savitzky-Golay filter of polynomial order three and frame size 45 s (the exact number of frames varied based on the frame rate of the movies) was used because it performed best at removing noise and preserving true cell area oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–A’</xref>). Before applying the Savitzky-Golay filter, we de-trended the signal by subtracting a long time scale Gaussian filtered (sigma = 180 s) version of the signal. Instantaneous phase was shifted such that −180 to 0 degrees represents peak-to-trough and 0 to 180 degrees trough-to-peak. The Osculating Circle Method also generates an instantaneous amplitude, which was averaged over time to calculate each cell’s average oscillation amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Interpolation of a parameter with respect to phase</title><p>Once the instantaneous phase trajectory of a cell’s area oscillations is obtained, other time-dependent readouts of the cell dynamics, such as the length of an interface, motion of a vertex, or intensities of a vertex, can be remapped from the time domain to the cell phase domain to average how those parameters change over the course of a cell’s oscillation cycle; this averaging is difficult or impossible in the time domain due to variations in oscillation cycle length. Mapping into the phase domain results in a 2D scatter plot of parameter values versus phase values for multiple cycles of phase; we interpolated these data by Gaussian weighted averaging of the parameter to a grid of phase values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Interface length and fractional length with respect to area phase</title><p>To determine how interface lengths change over the course of an area oscillation cycle the data were mapped into the phase space of the adjacent cells, separately for the phases of cell A and cell B. For each phase cycle the interface length trajectory was shifted (by subtracting the initial length) so that it starts from L = 0 with each cycle. This ‘reset’ to zero with the start of each cycle was done so that positive lengths represent interface growth and negative lengths represent interface contraction with each phase cycle. The 2D set of data points (phases and shifted lengths) for all phase cycles (from both cell A and cell B, for all AP interfaces, and all movies) were combined and interpolated as described above. For the quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C’</xref>) we measured the average shifted length within two 10 degree phase bins: one bin centered at 0 degrees to capture the length change after the area decreasing phase and one centered at 175 degrees (170–180 degrees) to capture the average length change after a full cycle. From the values in the bin centered at 175 degrees we subtract the average of the 0 degree bin to get the length change over just the area expanding phase. The methods for fractional length are the same as above, except that interface lengths are replaced with the ratio of the interface length divided by cell perimeter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Contour over Euclidean area ratio</title><p>Contour cell area is defined as the area within the watershed segmentation lines plus half the area of the pixels that make up the watershed boundary lines (otherwise the contour areas would be artifactually small). The Euclidean area is defined as the area of the polygon whose vertices are the cell’s detected vertices. The contour over Euclidean area ratio (or cell shape metric) is a simple ratio of these two values. When interpolating the cell shape matric to phase space we used the phase of the Euclidean cell area. The quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> was done on 10 degree phase bins centered at ±180, ±90, and 0°.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Vertex displacement rate with respect to the phases of cells A, B, and C (or D)</title><p>To see whether individual vertex motion was correlated to apical cell area oscillation cycles, vertex displacements were tracked with respect to the phases of the three cells that make up the tri-cellular vertex. The particular type of vertex displacement measured was the cell-tangential component, which is perpendicular to the vector from the cell centroid to the vertex, and therefore independent, to the radial motion associated with cell area oscillations. Cell-tangential displacements were assigned a negative sign if the displacement contracted the vertical interface. For each vertex there are two tangential motion trajectories, one with respect to cell A, and one with respect to cell B, thus the methods described here were performed twice for each vertex, once with respect to each cell. For one vertex motion trajectory the instantaneous phases of cells A, B, and the other cell in the triad (C or D) are collected for each time point in the trajectory. Vertex displacements were interpolated to a 3D grid with the three cell phases on the three axes. To account for edge effects of interpolation, data near the edges (±180°) were wrapped around by adding or subtracting 360° to the phases.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Vertex intensity with respect to cell phase and vertex angle</title><p>Vertex intensities of Ecad:GFP and mCherry:Sqh were also interpolated into area phase space in a spatial angle resolved manner. Each vertex has an angle with respect to the centroid of each cell it borders, which also varies over time. These angles were measured with respect to a global reference angle, the angle along the dorsal-ventral axis of the embryo towards the ventral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The intensity trajectory of each vertex was normalized (zero mean and s.d. of 1). Normalized intensities were interpolated to a 2D grid of vertex angle and cell phase angle. To account for edge effects of interpolation, data near the edges (±180°) were wrapped around by adding or subtracting 360° to the phases.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Cross-correlation of intensity ratios of E-cad and myosin at vertices</title><p>To quantify the temporal correlation between E-cad and Myosin enrichment at vertices, we performed a cross-correlation of the rates of change of the vertex intensity ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Rates of change were calculated over 25 s to avoid correlating localization error. Signals were normalized such that mean and standard deviation were 0 and 1, respectively, and an unbiased cross-correlation was computed via MATLAB’s <italic>xcorr</italic> function. The temporal lag was estimated by calculating the centroid of the positive peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Measurement of myosin flows to vertices or interfaces</title><p>For medial myosin destination measurements, over 160 medial myosin flow events in 10 contracting cells were counted manually in the first 12 min of GBE in each of 3 E-Cad:GFP; mCh:Sqh movies. The flow of myosin to the area of 3 pixels radius around the tricellular vertex was considered as vertex destination, otherwise, it was considered as interface destination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Fly stocks and genetics</title><p>Stocks were kept at 25°C and maintained by standard procedures.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Vertex sliding drives intercalation by radial coupling of adhesion and actomyosin networks&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Guest Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Vanderleest et al. uses studies of germ band extension (GBE) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to introduce a new mechanism by which cells can intercalate with one another to lengthen an epithelial tissue. This intercalation process, which is called a T1 transition, has been extensively studied. The current model for this process is that myosin accumulates asymmetrically at vertical cell-cell interfaces and directly shortens them in a ratchet-like manner (line tension model). In this manuscript, the authors perform systematic, quantitative analyses on time-lapse videos of GBE, and then propose an alternate model for how junctional shortening occurs based on their observations. Specifically, the authors propose that myosin-dependent shape fluctuations at the apical surface of the cells surrounding the vertical interface cause one of the flanking tricellular junctions (vertices) to slide within the plasma membrane to shorten that interface. They further observe that E-cadherin and myosin undergo cycles of accumulation and enrichment at the vertices that correlate with the fluctuations in cell area and propose that high E-cad levels (stimulated by myosin accumulation) stabilize the vertex after a period of sliding.</p><p>The reviewers are impressed with the quantitative analyses performed in this study and find many of the key observations supporting the authors' model to be clear and compelling. The reviewers further feel that the newly proposed mechanism may have broad implications for our understanding of epithelial morphogenesis in a variety of systems. However, there are aspects of the data/model that need to be clarified, and some of the authors' conclusions are insufficiently supported by the data shown. We have the following suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In the list of essential revisions below, only points 11 and 12 require new experiments. Points 4, 7, 8, and 9 require further analyses of existing movies. The remaining points are all simply revisions to the text.</p><p>1) <italic>eLife</italic> requires that the title and/or abstract provide a clear indication of the biological system under investigation. Please revise your Title and/or Abstract to mention both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and germ band extension.</p><p>2) Subsection “Movement of cell vertices is physically coupled in the radial direction” – The following statement is problematic: &quot;the inward movement of vertices connected by a contracting interface should show evidence of mechanical coupling&quot;. The movement of a vertex is defined by the force balance between the 3 junctions connected to the vertex. Even if the vertices connected by contracting interfaces are pulled inward by the same contractility, if each vertex is pulled outward by different forces, the dynamics of 2 connected vertices could be different. Indeed, two recent studies showed that the medial myosin at the vicinity of vertex contributes to the horizontal junction elongation during GBE, suggesting the pulling by the neighboring cells contribute to the movement of vertex (Collinet, 2015; Yu, 2016). Thus, 2 connected vertices don't need to synchronize their movement, and this observation cannot be used as evidence to dismiss the line tension-driven model.</p><p>3) Figure 2B, B' – The authors should clearly state what the criteria are for imposing a grey or blue vertical bar over a region of the graph. In particular, it is confusing why the second blue bar in panel B' seems to sit over a local peak instead of a consistent downward slope.</p><p>4) Figure 2D-F – The cellular dynamics shown in Video 2 make a compelling case that vertex sliding can occur during GBE. However, the reviewers raised three concerns about these data:</p><p>- The authors should clarify how often the vertex sliding mechanism contributes to the shortening of vertical interfaces. The authors state that Figure 2F shows that &quot;analysis of the lengths of all contracting and adjacent interfaces throughout GBE demonstrated that this behavior is a systematic component of T1-associated vertex movements&quot; (subsection “Vertices slide independently one another”). However, the methods state that the analysis was limited to interfaces that took 5 minutes to contract (subsection “Vertex sliding shown through sum of contracting and transverse interfaces”). What percentage of total contracting interfaces do the data represent? If you looked at interfaces that took 3 minutes to contract, or 7 minutes, would the result be the same?</p><p>- The authors should show an example of vertex sliding that includes a full T1 transition. Video 2 only shows the partial shorting of an AP boundary. Moreover, the contraction slowed down over time (Figure 2E). Thus, this example may show junctional remodeling, but may not be a T1 transition.</p><p>- The authors should explicitly test whether there are differences between the contraction of junctions oriented from dorsal to ventral and the expansion of junctions oriented along the length of the embryo. More specifically, it is important to test the extent of junctional sliding (and ratchet) in DV and AP directions, since under their model such a difference is likely to be the major driver of morphogenesis. In addition, both expansion and contraction cycles should be studied in the context of junctional contractions (e.g. Figure 2). The model depends on Myosin II and E-cadherin fixing the junction in place at the end of a contraction cycle. However, the data are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6, as if contraction and expansion events are symmetrical. Additionally, the text states &quot;E-cadherin intensity peaks just before cell area is in its most contracted state&quot;. This is confusing.</p><p>5) Figure 3 – The observation that the flanking transverse interfaces grow as a vertical interface shrinks is interesting, and the data seem convincing. However, this observation appears to be at odds with their recent paper (Jewett et al., 2017). In this paper, the authors propose that Rab35 acts as part of the ratcheting mechanism that shrinks vertical interfaces by promoting the endocytic removal of plasma membrane from this location. Please discuss and try to reconcile these two models.</p><p>6) Figure 4 – The authors observe that E-cad intensities peak with vertex stabilization. They then use chlorpromazine to artificially stabilize E-cad levels and see that this disrupts vertex sliding and conclude: &quot;Thus, stabilizing E-cadherin prevents vertex sliding and uncouples the ratcheted motion of individual vertices from the motive oscillations in cell area&quot; (subsection “E-cadherin intensities are in phase with area oscillations and peak with vertex stabilization”). This conclusion is too strong based on the data shown. Injecting a general inhibitor of Clathrin-mediated endocytosis like chlorpromazine has far more effects on the cell than just stabilizing E-cad. For example, the Jewett et al. paper shows that the Rab35 compartments along vertical interfaces fail to terminate under these conditions. The authors should point out that a defect in Rab35 dynamics could provide an alternate explanation for their chlorpromazine results.</p><p>7) Figure 4B and Figure 6B – To help the reader, the two cross correlation analyses should be expanded to include additional data. First, please show the still images and associated graphs for still images and associated graphs for Figure 4B and 6B. Second, please include the cross-correlation between apical area and cadherin/myosin intensity, as well as the rates of change (note that the main text fails to state what is being correlated). This would help to show what happens at the end of each contraction cycle. How long do E-cadherin and Myosin II remain at the vertex to bias the expansion movement? It would also make it clear whether or not myosin drives the accumulation of E-cadherin at vertices as suggested. Finally, the authors should include data showing how junctional length variations like those shown in Figure 2B correlate with fluctuations in apical area.</p><p>8) Figure 5 – It is important to test whether the apical constriction events are isotropic along the two axes of the embryo. If they are not, then some of the measurements presented are misleading, since apical area changes represent changes of different magnitude in AP and DV axes.</p><p>9) Figure 6 – The authors show that myosin accumulates at the junctions just before E-cad. The reviewers listed the following concerns about these data:</p><p>- The dynamics of MyoII that are shown are very different from those previously presented (Rauzi, 2010), where MyoII moves toward the cell-cell interfaces and accumulates in a polarized manner. Moreover, MyoII distribution shown in Figure 6A (white dotted rectangle), with E-cad accumulation at the vertex, does not show a polarized MyoII accumulation. In the same data, the AP boundaries with high junctional MyoII aren't associated with high accumulation of E-cad at vertices (see the AP boundary close to the bottom left corner of the white dotted rectangle in Figure 6A). This indicates that there could be two types of AP boundary. It would be very important and interesting to report what fraction of AP boundaries shows (1) high junctional MyoII and low (?) E-cad intensity at the vertex, and (2) low junctional MyoII (high vertex MyoII) and high E-cad intensity at the vertex.</p><p>- The section of the results that discusses this figure is titled &quot;Myosin II directs phasic E-cadherin enrichment at cell vertices&quot;. This statement is insufficiently supported by the data shown. The correlation between myosin and E-cad accumulating at the junctions is clear, but the experiment involving the rok inhibitor are too pleiotropic to draw such a specific conclusion, both because multiple myosin-dependent processes are being affected in these cells, and because this drug also affects more proteins that just myosin.</p><p>- Based on the model, one would predict (as has been seen in the notum) that a loss of Myosin II, increasing junctional length fluctuations. Is this the case following Y27632 treatment?</p><p>10) Discussion – the authors need to discuss more fully how their data fit with the wealth of information already known about GBE.

The movement of a vertex is defined by the force balance between the 3 junctions connected to the vertex. Even if the vertices connected by contracting interfaces are pulled inward by the same contractility, if each vertex is pulled outward by different forces, the dynamics of 2 connected vertices could be different. Indeed, two recent studies showed that the medial myosin at the vicinity of vertex contributes to the horizontal junction elongation during GBE, suggesting the pulling by the neighboring cells contribute to the movement of vertex (Collinet, 2015; Yu, 2016). Thus, 2 connected vertices don't need to synchronize their movement, and this observation cannot be used as evidence to dismiss the line tension-driven model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree — this is a deeply interesting point to consider, and we hope our manuscript will have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. We have added to our Discussion section along some of these lines, but there are a number of interesting points in this comment. To our knowledge, all truly physics-based models currently proposed rely on interface-spanning line tensions. We also agree that in these physical models the movement of a vertex will depend on the forces exerted by the three (or more) connecting interfaces as well as radially-directed forces. Although this means there are multiple influences, if there are interface-spanning line tensions at contracting interfaces it is an absolute physical principle that there must be coupling between the two adjacent vertices (i.e., there is an equal and opposite force component on the two vertices toward the middle of the interface). It is therefore quite compelling that the only observable coupling is radial coupling. We examined this data with a variety of time windows and other criteria to eliminate potential hysteresis. However, we also agree that there are molecular models that do not rely on line tensions and include a new Discussion section on this. We believe that since line tension-based understandings of cell intercalation have been so prevalent that our findings are critical data for the field to grapple with. The cited work from the Lecuit and Fernandez-Gonzalez labs is highly interesting and important studies, but concerns the growth of horizontal, T3 interfaces and not the contracting T1 interfaces that involve proposed contractile line tension and which most GBE studies have been concerned with. We think these T3 behaviors are very intriguing but are currently beyond the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2 B, B' – The authors should clearly state what the criteria are for imposing a grey or blue vertical bar over a region of the graph. In particular, it is confusing why the second blue bar in panel B' seems to sit over a local peak instead of a consistent downward slope.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree – the shaded regions were manually defined based on highly active periods of inward or outward motion and these criteria are now stated in the figure legend. We also went through another 10-15 examples and selected a better vertex pair example for the figure. Two additional examples are shown in Author Response Image 1 to illustrate that the chosen example is representative and depict the strength of radial coupling.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34586.024</object-id><label>Author Response Image 1</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34586-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2D-F – The cellular dynamics shown in Video 2 make a compelling case that vertex sliding can occur during GBE. However, the reviewers raised three concerns about these data:</p><p>- The authors should clarify how often the vertex sliding mechanism contributes to the shortening of vertical interfaces. The authors state that Figure 2F shows that &quot;analysis of the lengths of all contracting and adjacent interfaces throughout GBE demonstrated that this behavior is a systematic component of T1-associated vertex movements&quot; (subsection “Vertices slide independently one another”). However, the methods state that the analysis was limited to interfaces that took 5 minutes to contract (subsection “Vertex sliding shown through sum of contracting and transverse interfaces”). What percentage of total contracting interfaces do the data represent? If you looked at interfaces that took 3 minutes to contract, or 7 minutes, would the result be the same?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this – this was phrased badly in the original text as the analysis was actually performed on all contracting interfaces with lifetimes of at least 5 minutes. This represents ~92% of interfaces, and we have edited the methods to reflect this as, “This sum was performed on the last 5 minutes of all contracting interfaces that had a lifetime of at least 5 minutes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors should show an example of vertex sliding that includes a full T1 transition. Video 2 only shows the partial shorting of an AP boundary. Moreover, the contraction slowed down over time (Figure 2E). Thus, this example may show junctional remodeling, but may not be a T1 transition.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we concentrated the video on a single sliding event to emphasize this behavior, as vertices will go through multiple sliding events/steps to complete a full T1 contraction. However, we have also added Figure 2G (image panels) and Figure 2H (interface length plots) that show vertex sliding for a full T1 transition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors should explicitly test whether there are differences between the contraction of junctions oriented from dorsal to ventral and the expansion of junctions oriented along the length of the embryo. More specifically, it is important to test the extent of junctional sliding (and ratchet) in DV and AP directions, since under their model such a difference is likely to be the major driver of morphogenesis. In addition, both expansion and contraction cycles should be studied in the context of junctional contractions (e.g. Figure 2). The model depends on Myosin II and E-cadherin fixing the junction in place at the end of a contraction cycle. However, the data are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6, as if contraction and expansion events are symmetrical. Additionally, the text states &quot;E-cadherin intensity peaks just before cell area is in its most contracted state&quot;. This is confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We are a little unclear on what is meant by this point. Figure 5 shows that vertex displacements are correlated with area oscillations. However, while area oscillations and cyclic changes in vertex E-cadherin and Myosin II are indeed symmetrical (Figure 3E, Figure 4B, Figure 5H and Figure 6C’), vertex displacements are not (Figure 3C and Figure 5C,E). What these data demonstrate is that cycles of area expansion/contraction are used as periods when cell vertices can displace in processive, ratcheted events. These vertex displacements are asymmetrical and produce interface shortening specifically in an AP shortening direction (the tangential motion that is plotted in Figure 5). The expansion and contraction cycles are represented in the -180 to +180 degree measurements Figure 5, but we welcome further clarification of this comment. On the other hand, if the reviewer is referring to comparing the role of sliding in T1 contraction (in DV direction) and T3 elongation (in AP direction), we agree that these T3 behaviors are very intriguing, but the manuscript became too complicated to also include T3 behaviors. We are currently planning on reporting these results in a separate work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 3 – The observation that the flanking transverse interfaces grow as a vertical interface shrinks is interesting, and the data seem convincing. However, this observation appears to be at odds with their recent paper (Jewett et al., 2017).

Please discuss and try to reconcile these two models.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is a nice insight – we have expanded on this point in the new Discussion section. There are several potential explanations, but we believe the most likely one is that the data in this study indicates that the endocytic pathways reported on in Levayer et al., 2011 and Jewett et al., 2017 act to alter the balance of adhesion on either side of a vertex through the uptake of E-cadherin adhesion molecules. When E-cadherin becomes cyclically depleted at cell vertices, this would permit the sliding of the vertex in productive directions in response. However, our data shows that the combined length of T1 and transverse interfaces remains largely unchanged, and this suggests that the overall uptake of the plasma membrane and lipids does not limit total cell perimeters and interface lengths, but rather these endocytic pathways primarily affect the uptake of E-cadherin and the balance of adhesion complex function. This was one of the possibilities we discussed in the Rab35 manuscript, but we were not able to follow E-cadherin endocytosis well enough to discriminate between these possibilities. We have added these ideas into the new Discussion section, and this will be a very interesting question to delve into further in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 4 – The authors observe that E-cad intensities peak with vertex stabilization.

The authors should point out that a defect in Rab35 dynamics could provide an alternate explanation for their chlorpromazine results.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, that is a good point – to address this we have examined E-cadherin overexpressing embryos. By increasing the overall genetic dosage of E-cadherin, we tested whether vertex behaviors would be altered. Indeed, in Ubiquitin (promoter)-E-cadherin:GFP; Gap43:mCh embryos, vertex displacements and ratcheting are reduced and trend in the direction of chlorpromazine-injected embryos, although, as expected, certainly not to the same degree (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C-C’’). This supports a likely requirement for periods of decreased E-cadherin during vertex movements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 4B and Figure 6B – To help the reader, the two cross correlation analyses should be expanded to include additional data.

If we understand them correctly, the reviewer raises a valid point in that it would be theoretically possible to create T1 interface contraction mechanism through an anisotropic radial constriction system alone, where all forces are directed only into the radial direction, but with different magnitudes in the AP vs DV directions; we agree, and this is why we are explicitly measuring the tangential vertex displacements (Figure 5C,D) to differentiate this motion from radial displacements that could arise from constriction anisotropy.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34586.025</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34586-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 6 – The authors show that myosin accumulates at the junctions just before E-cad.

Similar to Rauzi et al., we observe medial Myosin moving towards the cell periphery, and have added new quantitation (Figure 6E) showing that this Myosin has an essentially equal probability to merge with a vertex or interface. This data supports the reported relationship between medial Myosin and vertex enrichments but does not indicate that Myosin II is only also associated with cell vertices. We also mention aspects of this in the Discussion section, as it is possible that interface-associated Myosin, in additional to medial and vertex Myosin, plays a role in local force generation that may bias vertex displacements.</p><p>We also completed analysis to assess if there are two distinct Myo/E-cad populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>).

As the function of these populations is also reduced, we do not believe that increased vertex mobility would be observed. To look at this more closely, we have used junction length step detection and show that frequency (B) and magnitude (A) of junctional length steps is reduced in the Y27632 injected embryos.
