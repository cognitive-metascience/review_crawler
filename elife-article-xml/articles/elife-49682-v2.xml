However, little is known about how this vital ATP transport occurs across the ER membrane. Here, using three commonly used cell lines (CHO, INS1 and HeLa), we report that ATP enters the ER lumen through a cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-antagonized mechanism, or <italic>CaATiER</italic> (<bold>Ca</bold><sup>2+</sup>-<bold>A</bold>ntagonized <bold>T</bold>ransport <bold>i</bold>nto <bold>ER</bold>). Significantly, we show that mitochondria supply ATP to the ER and a SERCA-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient across the ER membrane is necessary for ATP transport into the ER, through SLC35B1/AXER. We propose that under physiological conditions, increases in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibit ATP import into the ER lumen to limit ER ATP consumption. Furthermore, the ATP level in the ER is readily depleted by oxidative phosphorylation (<bold>OxPhos</bold>) inhibitors and that ER protein misfolding increases ATP uptake from mitochondria into the ER. These findings suggest that ATP usage in the ER may increase mitochondrial OxPhos while decreasing glycolysis, i.e. an ‘<italic>anti-Warburg</italic>’ effect.</p></abstract><kwd-group

for all cells to perform their biochemical functions. Universally, ATP is the single most important energy-supplying molecule in every form of life. ATP regeneration from ADP takes place in mitochondria mainly through OxPhos, and in the cytosol through glycolysis. Despite its heavy demand for ATP to facilitate protein folding and trafficking, the ER is not known to possess an independent ATP regeneration machinery. A membrane protein, ‘<italic>ER-ANT</italic>’, is involved in the ATP translocation across the ER membrane, of which the biochemical properties are analogous to the mitochondrial <bold>A</bold>denosine <bold>N</bold>ucleotide <bold>T</bold>ransporter (<bold>ANT</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clairmont et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shin et al., 2000</xref>). Other than that, little is known about how ATP gets into the ER in a living cell or whether/how ATP consumption is regulated in the ER lumen. For example, only one report described the genetic identification of an ATP transporter <italic>ER-ANT1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> which is restricted to plants and its deletion caused a disastrous plant phenotype, characterized by drastic growth retardation and impaired root and seed development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leroch et al., 2008</xref>). The mammalian ER ATP transporter remained elusive until a recent publication identified SLC35B1/AXER as the putative mammalian ER ATP transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klein et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>ER ATP is essential to support protein chaperone functions for protein folding, such as BiP/GRP78, and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dorner et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braakman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dorner and Kaufman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wei et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rosser et al., 2004</xref>). In fact, the level of ER ATP determines which proteins are able to transit to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dorner et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dorner and Kaufman, 1994</xref>). Although the level of ER ATP is suggested to impact protein secretion, this has not been demonstrated, nor have the factors that regulate ATP levels in the ER been clearly elucidated, although an association with ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> pool was suspected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vishnu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klein et al., 2018</xref>). More recently, organelle specific ATP status determination was made possible with the genetically encoded FRET-based ATP reporter proteins targeted to select intracellular organelles, namely the mitochondrial localized <italic>AT1.03</italic> and the ER localized <italic>ERAT4</italic> probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vishnu et al., 2014</xref>). A recent study revealed that the regulation of mitochondrial matrix ATP is highly dynamic and complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Depaoli et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we studied ATP dynamics within the ER organelle in intact cells. Specifically, we monitored real-time changes in ATP levels inside the ER lumen in response to well-characterized OxPhos and/or glycolysis inhibitors in living Chinese hamster ovary (<bold>CHO</bold>), rat insulinoma INS1 and human Hela cells, at the single cell level using an ERAT-based FRET assay. In addition, we monitored the change in ER ATP upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER, and further evaluated the ER ATP status in response to varying cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. From our findings we propose that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> attenuates mitochondrial-driven ATP transport into the ER lumen through a <italic>CaATiER</italic> (<bold>Ca</bold><sup>2+</sup>-<bold>A</bold>ntagonized <bold>T</bold>ransport <bold>i</bold>nto <bold>ER</bold>) mechanism. This model was further validated by knocking-down <italic>Slc35b1</italic> in HeLa, CHO and INS1 cells, and under conditions of ER protein misfolding in CHO cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ER ATP comes from Mitochondrial OxPhos in CHO cells</title><p>Traditional ATP analytical methods based on biochemical or enzymatic assays inevitably require ATP liberation from endogenous compartments, and do not reflect compartment-specific ATP dynamics. Nevertheless, there is ample evidence supporting that differential ATP levels exist in membrane-bound organelles that use independent regulatory mechanisms in a compartment-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerboom et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Depaoli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vishnu et al., 2014</xref>). To detect ATP levels in the ER lumen in vivo, (note that we use in vivo to indicate in a live cell) we expressed an ER-localized ATP sensor ERAT (ERAT4.01<sup>N7Q</sup>) in H9 CHO cells engineered to induce mRNA expression of human clotting factor VIII (<bold>F8</bold>), encoding a protein which misfolds in the ER lumen, upon increased transcription promoted by histone deacetylase inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dorner et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Malhotra et al., 2008</xref>). Confocal analysis of ERAT fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, green) revealed nearly complete co-localization with the ER marker, ER-Tracker Red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, red), as well as with the endogenous ER-resident protein PDIA6 detected by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Induction of F8 by SAHA treatment, an HDAC inhibitor, for 20 hr did not change the ER localization of the ERAT reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Another protein ER marker, ER-RFP, also shows nearly complete co-localization with ERAT fluorescence although ER-RFP formed aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Merzlyak et al., 2007</xref>) upon SAHA induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>, with RFP aggregates indicated with yellow arrow heads). As there is no known ATP regeneration machinery in the ER, and intracellular ATP regeneration from ADP takes place in mitochondria through OxPhos, and in the cytosol through glycolysis, it is of key importance to determine whether the ER ATP status depends on OxPhos and/or glycolysis (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For this purpose, we analyzed ER ATP levels after OxPhos inhibition or glycolysis inhibition by monitoring the FRET signal through flow-cytometry, since this technique provides robust population statistics and circumvents photo-bleaching of the fluorescent probes. In order to achieve consistent ATP signal detection from a homogenous population of cells, we further constructed a clone of H9 CHO (<italic>H9-D2</italic> cell) with stably transfected ERAT4.01<sup>N7Q</sup> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B</xref> <italic>versus</italic> C and D). In addition, as inhibition of glycolysis may have adverse effects on OxPhos, we tested whether 2-deoxyglucose (<bold>2-DG</bold>) administration reduces mitochondrial respiration by measuring the cellular oxygen consumption rate (<bold>OCR</bold>) in H9 CHO cells using a <italic>Seahorse XF24</italic> respirometry platform. Importantly, with glucose and pyruvate supplemented in the medium to support mitochondrial respiration, 2-DG administration did not negatively affect the OCR, under both coupled and uncoupled respiration conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>), suggesting that glycolysis inhibition by 2-DG does not acutely impair OxPhos in CHO cells. Interestingly, oligomycin (<bold>Oligo</bold>) treatment immediately increased the extracellular acidification rate (<bold>ECAR</bold>) in H9 CHO cells, reflecting glycolysis upregulation to compensate for ATP shortage due to OxPhos inhibition, while 2-DG treatment inhibited this compensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49682.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ER ATP homeostasis is maintained by oxidative phosphorylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal microscopy confirms ER localization of the ER ATP FRET reporter, ERAT in H9-D2 CHO cells.

Oxygen consumption rates (OCR) in H9 CHO cells were measured by an <italic>XF-24</italic> platform (Seahorse BioScience), using serial injections of the compounds: first PBS or 2-DG followed sequentially by 1 µM oligomycin (Oligo), 1 µM FCCP and 1 µM rotenone together with 10 µM antimycin A (Rot + AA). (<bold>E</bold>) The effect of OxPhos inhibitors (oligomycin, rotenone and FCCP at the indicated concentrations) on ER ATP was examined by flow cytometry at four time points as indicated.

(<bold>F</bold>) Administration of OxPhos inhibitors for 15 min, represented by oligomycin, rotenone and FCCP, rapidly reduces ER ATP in H9 CHO cells.

More than ten thousand cells were sampled for every treatment condition, as indicated on the graph. (<bold>H</bold>) Glucose supplementation (5 mM) to DMEM medium with only OxPhos substrates (with 1 mM sodium pyruvate supplemented) does not affect ER ATP levels.

For the ‘1 µM Oligo’ group, oligomycin was added to cells for the last 20 min of incubation in glucose-free medium. <italic>Two-way ANOVA</italic> was applied for statistical analysis of geometric means of fluorescence intensity (gMFI), with significance levels expressed as: <italic>n.s</italic>: - not significant; * - p≤0.05; **- p≤0.01; ***- p&lt;0.001; **** - p&lt;0.0001.

All OxPhos inhibitors significantly decreased ER ATP levels immediately after administration, by analysis of ER ATP kinetics with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) or by analysis at a single time point (15 min post treatment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Importantly, the bio-energetic inhibitors used had no effect on ER localization of the ERAT probe, as shown by confocal microscopy in H9 CHO cells co-transfected with a cytosolic RFP-based reporter, Cyto TagRFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Merzlyak et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A–F</xref>), and was further reflected by no change in the <italic>Pearson</italic> correlation coefficient under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5G</xref>). As predicted by the chemical law of mass action, the decrease in ER ATP supply upon OxPhos inhibition should reduce ER ATP consumption. Furthermore, if we assume that the three OxPhos inhibitors do not stimulate ATP usage in the ER, the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>) indicate that the steady-state ER ATP supply is heavily dependent on OxPhos. Since the FRET signal generated from the ERAT reporter is ratiometric and does not provide a direct calibration corresponding to ATP concentration in the ER in live cells, we attempted to determine the effect of complete inhibition of cellular ATP regeneration thereby providing the lowest detection range of the ERAT reporter by treating cells for prolonged time (2 hr) with 2-DG, followed by oligomycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A and B</xref>). This condition successfully identified the lower limit of the dynamic range for the ERAT reporter when the ratiometric FRET/CFP signal no longer decreases.</p><p>In contrast to OxPhos inhibition, the interpretation of effects from glycolysis inhibition is rather complicated, as there is no pure ‘glycolysis inhibitor’ per se, for example 2-DG application consumes cytosolic ATP and may even increase intracellular ADP levels as a substrate to boost mitochondrial ATP production through OxPhos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). With this caveat in mind, it was particularly intriguing to observe that incubation with iodoacetamide (<bold>IAA</bold>), an inhibitor of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (<bold>GAPDH</bold>), for 2 hr increased steady state ER ATP levels in H9 CHO cells, in a dose-dependent manner (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In an effort to further measure the extent by which glycolysis-derived ATP contributes to the ER ATP pool, we found that glucose supplementation had no effect on ER ATP levels, in a defined medium with substrates supporting only OxPhos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), while oligomycin strongly decreased ER ATP under these conditions (p&lt;0.0001, with representative traces of raw FRET ratios shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7A</xref>). In contrast, a third widely used glycolysis inhibitor, 3-bromopyruvate (<bold>3-BrP</bold>), produced a similar ATP increase in the ER, in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7B</xref>). At the same time, the kinetics of the ER ATP increase by 3-BrP was distinct from that by IAA, suggesting compound-specific off-target effects by the ‘glycolysis inhibitors’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7C</xref>). Finally, the observations made in H9 CHO cells were completely reproduced in CHO cells that do not express human F8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Urlaub and Chasin, 1980</xref>), that is oligomycin or rotenone administration reduced steady state ER ATP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7D</xref>, indicated by red and orange curves). In contrast, inhibitors of glycolysis, 2-DG or IAA, immediately increased ER ATP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7D</xref>, indicated by dark green and light green curves).</p><p>To further determine whether and to what extend the intracellular ATP regeneration requires glycolysis, total cellular ATP content was further measured by luciferase assays under the same medium conditions. As expected, glucose supplementation significantly increased cellular ATP measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8A</xref>), and 2-DG decreased cellular ATP, while oligomycin only had a minor effect on cellular ATP compared to 2-DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8B</xref>). These observations are consistent with the notion that CHO cells are highly dependent on glycolysis to regenerate ATP, and that the OxPhos inhibition can be readily rescued by glycolysis upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Furthermore, 2-DG immediately decreased the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio measured by flow-cytometry using the ratiometric <italic>PercevalHR</italic> probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8C</xref>), while OxPhos inhibition by oligomycin did not significantly alter this ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8D</xref>), as previously shown by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tantama et al., 2013</xref>). These results provide strong evidence supporting the notion that distinct ATP supplying and regulatory mechanisms exist for subcellular compartments within a cell, as we reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Depaoli et al., 2018</xref>). During the flow cytometry data analysis, we noticed a reproducible decrease in steady-state ER ATP levels in the control group of H9-D2 CHO cells, especially after 30 mins of cell suspension (examples as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We suspect this baseline ATP drift could be caused by the flow cytometry procedure, as extracellular matrix-attachment is crucial for optimal mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grassian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schafer et al., 2009</xref>). We acknowledge this feature as a disadvantage for flow-based ER ATP assay, and therefore have also included single-cell fluorescent microscopy recordings to complement our findings.</p><p>To conclude, OxPhos-derived ATP constitutes the major ATP supply source for the ER compartment, while it is not possible to conclude whether ER ATP depends on glycolysis-generated ATP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ER ATP import requires a Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient across the ER membrane</title><p>Protein misfolding in the ER is experimentally induced with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (<bold>SERCA</bold>) inhibitors such as thapsigargin (<bold>Tg</bold>), which may disrupt ER ATP homeostasis. Consistent with this notion, application of the reversible SERCA inhibitor, 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)−1,4-hydroquinone (<bold>BHQ</bold>), caused a rapid decrease in ER ATP in rat insulinoma INS1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). INS1 cells were selected because they secrete large amounts of another protein, proinsulin and insulin. As we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vishnu et al., 2014</xref>), due to reduced ATP levels in the ER lumen, the FRET fluorescence intensity from the ERAT probe decreased while the corresponding CFP fluorescence intensity increased simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The average of FRET over CFP ratios in the population of INS1 cells decreased and reached a plateau after 10 min post BHQ perfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and simultaneous measurement of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> by the D1ER probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Palmer et al., 2004</xref>) in another set of INS1 cells confirmed the specific effect of BHQ on decreasing the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We observed that ER ATP levels did not completely recover after BHQ removal, while in the same time frame, the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration returned to its basal level (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–2D</xref>). It is particularly interesting that the ER ATP levels took longer to recover when we monitored the INS1 cells for up to 4 hr after BHQ withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Furthermore, the recovered ER ATP levels in the same INS1 cells were reduced by a second BHQ stimulation, in an extent proportional to the levels of ER ATP recovery (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). These phenomena suggest that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsiveness of the putative ER ATP transporter has a ‘memory’ that lasts longer than the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> perturbation. In a similar manner, SERCA inhibition by Tg, an irreversible SERCA inhibitor, rapidly decreased ER ATP levels in H9 CHO cells, reflected by a decrease in the ratio of FRET-to-CFP fluorescence intensity measured by flow cytometery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). SERCA inhibition by Tg decreased ER ATP, independent of whether the extracellular medium contained Ca<sup>2+</sup> (alpha MEM medium, 1.8 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) or no extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (by 4 mM EGTA chelation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). A third SERCA inhibitor, cyclopiazonic acid (<bold>CPA</bold>), induced a similar decrease in ER ATP at a dosage fifty times higher than Tg, presumably due to its low potency for inhibiting SERCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The decrease in ER ATP by Tg correlated well with ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion as monitored by the GEM-CEPIA1er probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Mechanistically, Tg disrupts the ER to cytosol Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient by inhibiting SERCA, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump that shuttles 2 moles of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol into the ER lumen at the expense of 1 mole of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">MacLennan et al., 1997</xref>). Since maintaining low cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (~100 nM under physiological conditions) also requires the action of plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps (<bold>PMCA</bold>) that consume ATP, it is possible that the decrease in ER ATP upon Tg treatment reflects mitochondrial ATP depletion due to excessive ATP usage in the cytosol. This possibility was tested by simultaneously measuring ATP levels in two sets of H9 CHO cells expressing either the ERAT probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>) or the mitochondrial ATP probe <italic>mtAT</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Comparison of the decrease in relative ATP levels triggered by Tg revealed that the decrease in ER ATP preceded the decrease in mitochondrial ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), refuting the notion that Tg decreases ER ATP by decreasing mitochondrial ATP. In contrast, when the cytosolic ATP/ADP status was monitored by a structurally unrelated reporter, <italic>PercevalHR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tantama et al., 2013</xref>), Tg treatment attenuated the decrease in cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio in H9 CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Reduced cytosolic ATP usage by SERCA or reduced ER ATP supply (see ‘<italic>CaATiER model</italic>’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) may explain the effect of Tg on cytosolic ATP/ADP. Tg-mediated depletion of the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store did not appear to increase ATP usage in the ER since oligomycin treatment together with Tg reduced ER ATP only modestly, albeit significantly, compared to oligomycin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). In addition, we investigated if Ca<sup>2+</sup> release mediated through IP<sub>3</sub>R channel opening can affect ER ATP status in single cells, using a perfusion system and FRET-based fluorescence microscopy. Extracellular ATP is a well-known physiological IP<sub>3</sub>-generating agonist through its engagement with purinergic receptors ubiquitously expressed on CHO cells. Indeed, exogenously supplemented ATP in the perfusion buffer noticeably decreased the ER ATP pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Furthermore, the effect of exogenous ATP was neither reversed by addition of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (indicated by the blue bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) or washout of the agonist, again demonstrating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization lowers ER ATP levels in a sustained manner and supporting a ‘memory’ effect of the putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> responsive ER ATP transporter. To summarize, ATP import into the ER apparently requires a Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient (Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>ER</sub> &gt; Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>cyto</sub>) across the ER membrane maintained by SERCA activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49682.011</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient across the ER membrane is required to maintain ER ATP homeostasis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SERCA inhibition reduces ER ATP levels in adherent INS1 cells.

H9 CHO cells were permeabilized with 75 µg/mL saponin in a bathing solution (referred to as ‘respiration solution’ hereafter). ATP production through OxPhos was supported by added pyruvate and malate (10 mM and 1 mM, respectively) as TCA substrates together with exogenous ADP (2 mM). The system was validated in two ways: First, the ATP store in the ER generated in permeabilized CHO cells was higher than that for the endogenous ATP pool detected in intact H9 CHOs (p&lt;0.0001 between the <italic>‘Intact’</italic> and <italic>‘Vehicle’</italic> group). In addition, the ER ATP store was released within 5 min after treatment with Tween-20 (0.02% vol/vol, p=0.0007 compared to <italic>‘Vehicle’</italic> group) or Triton X-100 (0.02% vol/vol, p&lt;0.0001), both after 25 min of respiration (<bold>A</bold>). Second, inhibition of OxPhos by oligomycin (1 µM) or rotenone (1 µM) reduces the ER ATP store to baseline levels. In addition, Ca<sup>2+</sup> supplemented (in the form of CaCl<sub>2</sub>) at 1 µM final significantly reduced the ER ATP store (<bold>B</bold>). (<bold>C</bold>). SERCA ATPase activity is blocked by pre-incubating intact H9 CHO cells with increasing concentrations of Tg (250 nM, 1 µM, and 4 µM) for 10 min. Subsequently, cells were permeabilized as described above to test if Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion affects ER ATP generated through OxPhos in permeabilized CHO cells. EGTA supplemented at 1 mM significantly increased the ER ATP store (p&lt;0.0001). No significant difference was observed for Tg pre-treated groups. (<bold>D</bold>). When ionomycin (10 µM) or Tg (1 µM) were added at the same time with PM permeabilization, EGTA significantly increased ER ATP while further Ca<sup>2+</sup> add-back in the form of CaCl<sub>2</sub> abolished the EGTA effect on increasing the ER ATP store. (<bold>E</bold>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> responsiveness of ER ATP levels was attenuated by siRNA-mediated <italic>Slc35b1</italic> knock-down in H9 CHO cells. Using the semi-intact cell system, CHO cells with <italic>Slc35b1</italic> knock-down by siRNA (24hrs post transfection) had significantly reduced ER ATP when no Ca<sup>2+</sup> was present in the buffer (****: p&lt;0.0001). With 1 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the buffer, ER ATP showed no difference between the control and the Slc35b1 knock-down group. (<bold>F</bold>).

Meanwhile the ER ATP decrease after BHQ addition was attenuated in the si-<italic>Slc35b1</italic> group.

However, the ER membrane is known to be quite ‘leaky’ to ions, with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient requiring maintenance by vigorous SERCA Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumping into the ER lumen. As a consequence, it is theoretically difficult for the ER membrane to build a significant chemical potential to drive ATP/ADP exchange. Alternatively, as Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion from the ER lumen is inevitably coupled with a cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase in an intact cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagur and Hajnóczky, 2017</xref>), the ER ATP transporter could respond to and be regulated by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in a process described as <italic>CaATiER</italic>.</p><p>To test whether ER ATP is sensitive to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we employed an independent classical ER ATP measurement for adherent H9 cells, facilitated by a standard luminescence-based ATP assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerboom et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgess et al., 1983</xref>). The plasma membrane (<bold>PM</bold>) was first permeabilized with low concentrations of saponin, a cholesterol solubilizing detergent, leaving the organelle membranes intact (as these membranes contains very low levels of cholesterol) to analyze ATP transport between mitochondria and ER. ATP was generated de novo by supplying mitochondrial respiration substrates (pyruvate plus malate) together with 2 mM ADP in the respiration buffer. At the end of the incubation, the respiration buffer containing ATP generated by OxPhos was removed by aspiration (which accounted for &gt; 75% of the total ATP, see below). Since the ATP pool trapped in the mitochondrial matrix cannot be eliminated technically, it is possible the mitochondrial pool of ATP contributes to the ‘trapped’ ATP pool. However, for the permeabilized CHO cell system, we found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Tg addition did not affect mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A to D</xref>), ensuring equal ATP generation. The same results further indicate that mito-matrix ATP content does not change in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Tg, as the ATP synthase is extremely sensitive to the ATP-to-ADP ratio in the mitochondrial matrix. This conclusion was further demonstrated by carboxyatractyloside (an inhibitor of ANT proteins, hereafter abbreviated as ‘<bold>CAt</bold>’) mediated respiration inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref> to <bold>D,</bold> post CAt addition). Theoretically, it is unlikely that OxPhos would respond to exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> added in our assays, since greater than 1 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> is needed to open the MICU-regulated MCU gating of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Waldeck-Weiermair et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the exogenously added ADP (2 mM) should effectively drive OxPhos-generated ATP out of the mitochondrial matrix into the ER lumen or the respiration buffer. Lastly, we verified that Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition did not affect total ATP generated in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>) calibrated by an ATP standard curve shown alongside for the absolute amount of ATP generated in our permeabilized CHO cell system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>Using this system, we confirmed that only ATP trapped in the ER compartment accounts for the changes of luminescence signals above background (i.e., <italic>ER ATP</italic>), which was readily liberated by brief treatment with lipid-dissolving detergents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, p&lt;0.001 and&lt;0.0001 for Tween-20 and Triton X-100, respectively). In addition, ATP generated by OxPhos from the permeabilized cells was evidenced by the higher <italic>ER ATP</italic> contents trapped inside PM-permeabilized cells, compared to the endogenous ATP found inside PM-intact cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, under ‘<italic>Intact</italic>’ group). We also verified that ATP produced in this system was through OxPhos, as addition of OxPhos inhibitors at the beginning of incubation reduced ATP luminescence to background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> µM <italic>‘Rotenone’</italic> or <italic>‘Oligomycin’</italic>). Interestingly, addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (1 µM) significantly decreased <italic>ER ATP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, p&lt;0.0001 for ‘<italic>0 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>’ vs. ‘1 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>’ bars in the ‘DMSO’</italic> group), suggesting that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibits ATP import from mitochondria into the ER. Alternatively, an increase in SERCA ATPase activity by increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> may reduce ATP available for the ER ATP transporter. To rule out this possibility, Tg was applied to intact H9 cells briefly before PM-permeabilization, at increasing doses from 0.25 µM to 4 µM, and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator EGTA was added to the respiration buffer to remove Ca<sup>2+</sup> leaked from the ER into the cytosol. While 1 mM EGTA significantly increased the <italic>ER ATP</italic> content, addition of Tg had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also tested another Ca<sup>2+</sup> releasing chemical, ionomycin – a mobile Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore that permits Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer down the gradient, with 1 µM Tg added as a control group without pretreatment of intact cells. Again, the only effect we detected was with Ca<sup>2+</sup> manipulation on the ‘cytosolic’ side of the ER membrane, that is EGTA chelation increased ER ATP and adding CaCl<sub>2</sub> back decreased the ER ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, with free Ca<sup>2+</sup> calculated to be 1 µM in presence of 1 mM EGTA).</p><p>A recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klein et al., 2018</xref>) identified SLC35B1/AXER as the putative mammalian ER ATP transporter, which enabled us to validate our model using an <italic>Slc35b1</italic> knock-down strategy. Consistent with the proposed role of an ER ATP/ADP translocase, knock-down of <italic>Slc35b1</italic> in CHO H9 cells significantly decreased the baseline ER ATP level only in assay buffer containing no Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but not in presence with 1 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, p&lt;0.0001 for ‘0 Ca<sup>2+</sup>’ and non-significant for ‘1.0 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>”, respectively). The specificity of the ER ATP change was further confirmed by measuring ATP partitioned into the supernatant of the semi-intact CHO H9 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and by comparison of ER ATP as percentage of total ATP produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>) where it was estimated the total ATP produced is about 0.2–0.5 mM using the ATP standard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). For CHO H9 cells, <italic>Slc35b1</italic> knock-down efficiency was &gt; 50%, in the presence or absence of Tm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Similarly, using FRET-based microscopy in intact HeLa cells, we observed that the ER ATP decrease, after an initial increase, upon BHQ treatment was attenuated in <italic>HeLa</italic> cells upon <italic>Slc35b1</italic> knock-down (by siRNA to 9.5%, compared to control siRNA treated cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In addition, we observed a transient increase in ER ATP shortly (0–10 min) after SERCA inhibition, probably due to ER ATP usage arrest as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vishnu et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Slc35b1</italic> knock-down also abolished the ER ATP decrease as a result of OxPhos inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, by oligo plus rotenone). A similar significant baseline ER ATP decrease after <italic>Slc35b1</italic> knock-down was also observed for INS1 and H9 CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) using microscopy, while <italic>CaATiER</italic> was proportionally attenuated. Furthermore, the varying <italic>Slc35b1</italic> knock-down efficiency may explain the difference in baseline ER ATP decrease for the three cell lines with HeLa &gt; H9 CHO&gt;INS1, as shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>), suggesting SLC35B1 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> ATP/ADP translocase for the ER confirming Klein et al. Interestingly, using semi-intact H9 CHO cells, the <italic>CaATiER</italic> mechanism responded to Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations ranging from 500 nM to 2 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A and B</xref>), with ATP content in the supernatant showing the opposite changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5C</xref>, calibration provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5D</xref>), further demonstrating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations tested in our assay affected only ATP partitioning between ER and cytosol, but not mitochondria ATP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Finally, the ER ATP decrease with increased Mg<sup>2+</sup>concentration was negligible within a physiological range from ‘<italic>5 mM</italic>’ to ‘<italic>10 mM</italic>’ (p=0.21 by <italic>post-hoc</italic> t-test), confirming the decrease in ER ATP was specific to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> cation. The effect of adding CaCl<sub>2</sub> back was not due to increased Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration, as Cl<sup>-</sup> in the form of MgCl<sub>2</sub> in great excess over CaCl<sub>2</sub> only had a minor effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>In summary, based on the above results, we propose that Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibits ER ATP uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). In the <italic>CaATiER</italic> model, ATP from mitochondria is preferentially transported into the ER, possibly through a family of ER ATP transporter proteins represented by SLC35B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klein et al., 2018</xref>), and the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration within this micro-domain attenuates ATP transport through a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing component. In addition, based on the <italic>CaATiER</italic> sensitivity to low µM of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A and B</xref>), we predict that SLC35B1 does not encode the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsiveness considering the lack of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsiveness from 10 to 50 µM when SLC35B1 was ectopically expressed in <italic>E Coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klein et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Protein misfolding in the ER increases both ER ATP dependence on OxPhos and Tg-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization into mitochondria</title><p>Protein misfolding in the ER is a cellular stress condition characterized by activation of the unfolded protein response (<bold>UPR</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schröder and Kaufman, 2005</xref>). Although ER stress is typically induced by pharmacological means, for example with Tg to deplete ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store, or with tunicamycin (<bold>Tm</bold>) to inhibit N-linked glycosylation, we applied an ER stress induction model by expressing a misfolded protein in the ER lumen. ER stress was successfully induced by treating H9 CHO cells with HDAC inhibitors, such as SAHA or sodium butyrate (<bold>NaB</bold>), to increase F8 transcription from an HDAC-sensitive artificial promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dorner et al., 1989</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To better understand this proteostasis stress, we investigated if ATP supply and Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis are affected upon induction of F8. As ER stress is often associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak from the ER (in addition to those deliberately induced with Tg), we first validated this observation by investigating ER-initiated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, by employing the mitochondrial matrix-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter, mtGEM-GECO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Pretreatment with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (<bold>APB</bold>) successfully blocked Tg-triggered mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, although we cannot rule out the ability of APB to block other Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bootman et al., 2002</xref>). As expected, the reporter promptly detected ionomycin-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Although ER stress induced by SAHA treatment did not alter mitochondrial matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels under resting conditions, Tg-triggered mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was significantly more prominent in ER stressed H9 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). From these results, we propose that ER protein misfolding stimulates ER to mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer. The increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer into mitochondria was not due to an increased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store since neither the O-cresolphthalein (<bold>OCPC</bold>) chromogenic method nor the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter (<italic>GEM-CEPIA1er</italic>) revealed a significant increase in the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content in SAHA-induced H9 CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>), suggesting that the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the mitochondrial matrix under ER stress conditions is either due to enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization from extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaufman and Malhotra, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rizzuto et al., 2004</xref>) or the close proximity between the ER and mitochondria under prolonged ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bravo et al., 2011</xref>). At the same time, oxygen consumption (by OCR) was not significantly different between ER stressed H9 CHO cells induced to express F8 and their un-induced counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Finally, when F8 expression was induced by SAHA treatment, ER ATP homeostasis became more dependent on OxPhos, as oligomycin treatment caused greater reduction in ER ATP for SAHA-treated H9 CHO cells compared to the un-induced H9 CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). This observation was not due to altered mitochondrial ATP supply (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) as mitochondrial ATP levels were not affected upon induction of F8 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Lastly, we verified the oligomycin-induced decrease in ER ATP in adherent single H9 CHO cells using FRET-based fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I&amp; J</xref>). Consistent with the ER ATP status measured by flow cytometry, the ER ATP decrease in response to complete OxPhos inhibition was significantly more pronounced in SAHA-induced ER stressed H9 CHO cells than in vehicle-treated CHO cells (quantified by maximal ER ATP reduction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, p&lt;0.05). Since ATP dependence on OxPhos suggested that ER stress could have caused an ‘anti-Warburg effect’ by inhibiting ATP production from glycolysis, we further tested if the cytosolic bioenergetic dependence on OxPhos was similarly affected by ER stress induced by Tm. Similar to the ER compartment, the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio decreased more quickly upon OxPhos inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), while no obvious difference was detected for the mitochondrial matrix ATP pool. Fully supporting the ‘<italic>anti-Warburg effect</italic>’, ER stressed H9 CHO cells had significantly reduced glucose uptake independently of the F8 inducer, measured by 2-NBDG fluorescence assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Notably, only H9 CHO but not 10A1 CHO showed a significant reduction in glucose uptake in response to SAHA, as the latter cells lack the HDAC inhibitor responsiveness and do not exhibit ER stress, as previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dorner et al., 1989</xref>). To summarize, ER stress induced by a misfolded ER luminal protein causes metabolic changes, characterized by increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange between ER and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagur and Hajnóczky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaufman and Malhotra, 2014</xref>), increased dependence on ATP produced by OxPhos and by decreased cellular glucose uptake.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49682.021</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Protein misfolding in the ER increases ER ATP dependence on OxPhos and increases ER to mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> trafficking.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) When treated with HDAC inhibitors, such as SAHA or sodium butyrate (<bold>NaB</bold>), F8 transcription is induced in H9 CHO cells accompanied by UPR activation.

In contrast, little is known about how ATP is transported into the ER, an obligate ATP consuming organelle with no known ATP regeneration machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braakman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dorner et al., 1990</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mitochondria supply ATP to the ER and cellular OxPhos is enhanced by ER ATP usage</title><p>By using a series of ATP and ATP/ADP ratio reporters to monitor real-time ATP changes in sub-cellular compartments and by complementary direct measurements of ER ATP, we observed that ATP in the ER is mainly supplied from mitochondria and that ATP homeostasis in the ER is maintained through a cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-antagonized ATP transport mechanism on the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). It was surprising that the ATP level in the ER is insensitive to transient glucose deprivation and inhibition of glycolysis, which causes an immediate reduction in cytosolic ATP. This result is consistent with our conclusion that OxPhos supplies ATP to the ER and a highly efficient ATP transport mechanism exists from mitochondria to ER. Considering the close proximity between the ER and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scorrano et al., 2019</xref>), it is possible that ATP exiting mitochondria immediately traffics through the ER ATP transporter(s), whereas ATP produced by glycolysis is spatially more distant to be efficiently captured by the ER. In addition, supporting the symbiotic evolutionary hypothesis of mitochondria, our findings suggest that the ER takes special advantage of ATP-producing mitochondria to fulfill the energetic demands for protein folding, trafficking and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scorrano et al., 2019</xref>), reflected by the exquisite sensitivity of the ER ATP levels to OxPhos inhibition. Therefore, an intimate cross-talk between ER protein misfolding and mitochondrial function could have evolved as a bioenergetic advantage for eukaryotes to develop into multi-cellular organisms, in which cell-to-cell communications is necessitated by paracrine and endocrine signals. Based on our findings, we propose that ATP usage in the ER is a key signaling event that controls mitochondrial bioenergetics, in addition to the signaling mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reactive oxygen species (<bold>ROS</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaufman and Malhotra, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> attenuates ATP import into the ER</title><p>One of our most important observations is that a Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient across the ER membrane is necessary for ATP transport into the ER. Specifically, to demonstrate that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibits ATP import, we applied an artificial PM-permeabilized cell system, by forcing mitochondrial respiration to supply ATP, for the reason that 1) the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration can be conveniently manipulated in this semi-intact experimental system; 2) the ATP supply is no longer limited by ADP availability which is considered a rate-limiting factor in vivo. Our <italic>CaATiER</italic> model was further validated by knock-down of ER ATP transporter expression, encoded by the <italic>Slc35b1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klein et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, the SERCA inhibitor, BHQ, induced a phenomenal ER ATP decrease, which was greatly attenuated in HeLa cells with <italic>Slc35b1</italic> knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating that the observed ER ATP drop is mediated by reduced ATP import into the ER. The results confirm that 1) ATP is not freely permeable to the ER membrane, and 2) The ATP transport mechanism on the ER membrane (through SLC35B1/AXER) is exquisitely sensitive to the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Although it was suggested that the immediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> mediated increase in ER ATP requires AMPK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vishnu et al., 2014</xref>), whether AMPK is involved in <italic>CaATiER</italic> in intact cells is an open question. Our findings lead us to propose that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibits ATP import into the ER, indicating that a Ca<sup>2+</sup> responsive element faces the cytosolic surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), analogous to the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (<bold>MCU</bold>) gating system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Waldeck-Weiermair et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Physiological processes require exquisitely meticulous and tight regulation of ATP, that is cytosolic ATP abundance is sensed and converted into a Ca<sup>2+</sup> chemical gradient by the coupling function of SERCA where excess cytosolic ATP will only be delivered to the ER when cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>is at physiological levels (&lt;500 nM). In summary, we propose that increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> reduces ER ATP usage to conserve ATP for cytosolic functions. Evolutionarily, the risk of ER stress resulting from a transient ATP shortage is accommodated by bountiful ER chaperones, such as GRP78/BiP and GRP94, for which peptide binding activities are regulated by ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dorner et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rosser et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wei et al., 1995</xref>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> responsive chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagur and Hajnóczky, 2017</xref>), such as calnexin and calreticulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Krebs et al., 2015</xref>).

The structural proximity is maintained by the ER-mitochondria tethering molecules, such as Mitofusin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Naon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schrepfer and Scorrano, 2016</xref>), while the functional cooperation through adenosine nucleotide exchange between the ER and mitochondria has not been directly proven. Uniquely here, we demonstrate that the ER preferentially depends on ATP produced from OxPhos, which was further confirmed by our observation that ER protein misfolding in H9 CHO cells causes an ‘<italic>anti-Warburg</italic>’ effect. Whether this observation can be extrapolated to interpret cancer cell metabolism warrants further investigation. While confirming the intimate functional cooperation of ER and mitochondria through exchange of adenosine nucleotides, our findings demonstrate that increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the cytosolic surface of the ER membrane inhibits ER ATP import and predict that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange domain is not compatible with the ATP exchange domain between mitochondria and the ER, suggesting the existence of either A) Two categories of contact domains between the organelles, or B) A domain that operates in two distinct modes (Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange mode versus ATP exchange mode), which are temporally separated.</p><p>ER stress caused by protein misfolding can cause cell death under pathological conditions.

It is plausible that AMPK activation as a consequence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klein et al., 2018</xref>) can lead to compensatory mitochondrial ATP production in an attempt to resolve ER stress by supplying more ATP to the ER. OxPhos up-regulation as a feedback mechanism to increase ER ATP consumption could contribute to mitochondrial ROS generation, although altered mitochondrial function was not detected in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Conversely, dysfunctional mitochondria can elevate ROS production by the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Murphy, 2013</xref>). In our CHO cell model system, when Tg was applied to release ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the mitochondrial matrix was significantly elevated in ER-stressed CHO cells, which could reflect the closer proximity between ER and mitochondria to ensure sufficient ATP uptake into the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaufman and Malhotra, 2014</xref>). In vivo, a similar process of IP<sub>3</sub>R-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in response to IP<sub>3</sub> generated by repeated plasma membrane receptor engagement may exacerbate ROS production as a result of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">La Rovere et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To conclude, our results expand our knowledge of cellular bioenergetics by demonstrating that a highly efficient ATP supply mechanism exists between mitochondria and ER that is antagonized by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Zimmermann (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors report new findings concerning the control of ER energy homeostasis by cytosolic calcium levels. They conclude that the ATP supply of the ER is mostly generated by mitochondrial OxPhos. In addition, they claim that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> controls the ER ATP import, which is mediated by SLC35B1/AXER and that the elicitation of protein misfolding in the ER increases the ATP demand.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major conclusions are of sufficient interest for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, as the work addresses important aspects of ER biology. However, there are some issues that need to be addressed before the paper can be recommended for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The link between <italic>Slc35B1</italic> and <italic>CaATiER</italic> is weak. The data on HeLa cells do not support the <italic>CaATiER</italic> model and there are no data on SLC35B1/AXER for the other two cell lines. Therefore, additional work is required to provide this link or, alternatively, to identify the ATP carrier that is linked to <italic>CaATiER</italic> in INS1 or CHO cells.</p><p>2) An in-depth analysis of the role of <italic>Slc35B1</italic> is needed to strengthen the study. It is required to show that <italic>Slc35B1</italic> is indeed the one and only ATP transporter to the ER. The analysis of a cytoplasmic calcium sensitivity/dependence of the <italic>Slc35B1</italic> may provide some useful information.</p><p>3) The discrepancies between the old and new results in INS1 cells need to be explained.</p><p>These criticisms of the work are listed in great detail in the reviews, which are attached in full. In addition, the reviewers offered many thoughtful and constructive suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Kaufman, and colleagues reported the identification how ATP enters the ER lumen through a cytosolic calcium-antagonized mechanism, or, as proposed by the authors a <italic>CaATiER</italic> (Ca-Antagonized Transport into ER). They report that a calcium gradient across the ER membrane is necessary for ATP transport into the ER suggesting that cytosolic calcium signaling is coupled with ATP transport to the ER. They propose an attractive explanation that cytosolic increased calcium inhibits ATP import into the ER lumen. This is to reduce ATP consumption by ER. They also report that ATP abundance in the ER and traffic from mitochondria is sensitive to inhibitors of the oxidative phosphorylation and ER protein misfolding. These findings link that ATP usage in the ER with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. These are very interesting findings and provide important and novel information on ATP metabolism, sources and regulation in the ER. This is an interesting study that significantly advances our knowledge about ER homeostasis and its links to cellular metabolism. It will certainly generate broad interest and further research in this important field of cell biology.</p><p>The biochemical/biophysical and cell biological assays demonstrating ATP production and transport are rather extensive and elegant using state-of-the-art techniques and ERTA probe for measurement of ER organellar ATP levels.</p><p>However, a few important points remain to be addressed by the authors.</p><p>The authors should define what they mean by &quot;Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient across the ER membrane&quot;. Is there a particular threshold of the gradient? Is this highly regulated process?</p><p>The role of cytoplasmic calcium is intriguing. Do the authors have any evidence for a specific signaling event that drives cytosolic calcium-dependent ATP movement? Is <italic>slc35b1</italic> a calcium binding protein? Is a specific calcium gradient required? Could this be a clue to the &quot;memory&quot; of the transporter (subsection “ER ATP import requires a Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient across the ER membrane”)?</p><p>I wonder why do authors exclusively use FACS analysis for the ERTA probe? Has there been any attempts to carry out a single cell analysis? This would provide additional validation of the data and allow real-time analysis of molecular movements.</p><p>The authors should consider using BAPTA-AM (or other cytoplasmic calcium chelators) in life cells to control cytoplasmic calcium in order to complement saponin permeabilized cell analyses.</p><p>What is the source of calcium in the cytoplasm that affects ATP transport? Is a store-operated calcium entry involved in addition to the ER?</p><p>Is the mitochondria associated membrane involved in the process? Latest report on the role of IRE1 in control of calcium movement between ER and mitochondria (PMID:31110288) indicates a link between UPR, ER, mitochondria and calcium. Is there a link to ATP transport reported here? Can this be documented? This, perhaps, may help to document that ATP and calcium movements are indeed operate or not as two distinct modes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Yong et al. titled &quot;Mitochondria supply ATP to the ER through a mechanism antagonized by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>&quot; addresses aspects of ER energy homeostasis and its regulation, in particular by cytosolic calcium levels. Yong and colleagues determined the crosstalk between the energy producing mitochondria and the ATP consuming ER lacking an autonomous ATP regenerating machinery. Based on a series of cell-based assays and employing a multitude of fluorescent sensors in combination with all sorts of pharmacological interventions in three cell lines from different species the authors conclude, that</p><p>– the ATP supply of the ER is mainly covered by mitochondrial OxPhos</p><p>– cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulates the ER ATP import, which is mediated by SLC35B1/AXER</p><p>– that induction of protein misfolding in the ER elevates its ATP demand.</p><p>Those are indeed interesting findings that further our understanding of ER homeostasis and regulatory mechanisms, granted. However, the manuscript lacks some consistency both experimentally and visually. We would appreciate if the authors could address the following major and minor comments. In the absence of respective revisions, the work does clearly not deserve the rating &quot;outstanding&quot;, which is a prerequisite for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Abstract /Significance:</p><p>1) The Abstract gives the unwarranted impression that HeLa cells were used throughout the study, i.e. that the so-called calcium antagonized ATP transport into the ER of hamster CHO- and rat INS1-cells was also observed for HeLa cells, which is at odds with Figure 3F of this manuscript (as well as findings by Vishnu et al., 2014, and Klein et al., 2018). Actually, Vishnu et al., 2014 reported a similar phenomenon as for HeLa cells also for INS1-cells. Also see point 23 below.</p><p>2) The significance statement gives the unwarranted impression that it was shown for all three cell lines that the calcium antagonized ATP transport into the ER is mediated by SLC35B1/AXER. In fact, only HeLa cells were used for the <italic>slc35b1</italic> knock down experiment. Thus, it remains an open question how calcium antagonized ATP transport into the ER of CHO- and INS1-cells is mediated. After all, Vishnu et al., 2014 as well as Depaoli et al., 2018 – both involving R. Malli as senior author – reported that there are cell type-specific effects involved.</p><p>3) The authors emphasize the anti-Warburg effect reflecting an increase in mitochondrial OxPhos and decrease in glycolysis.

It appears way too crowded and lacks a continuous, smooth flow. For example:</p><p>– Why do the authors introduce the inducible H9 CHO model in Figure 1A and 1B to demonstrate the localization of the ERAT probe being independent from ER stress. This should be added to Figure 4 when the authors actually show the increase of F8 production in response to SAHA treatment and the subsequent activation of UPR. The rest of the data for Figure 1 (1C-1H) was generated using the CHO model.</p><p>– Figure 1C should be moved to the supplement, its basic knowledge. The &quot;formula&quot; within the ER (ATP supply – ATP consumption = ATP status proportional to ERAT FRET) should be displayed differently.</p><p>– Figure 2 starts with INS1 cells and continues with CHO cells. Maybe it`s better to show only the CHO cells and put the data with the INS1 cells reacting similarly as the CHO cells to the supplement. Comparing Figure 2A-D with 2E-H two parameters were changed, cell type and SERCA inhibitor.</p><p>8) It would be important to show at least once that BiP activity is compromised under conditions of OxPhos inhibition in CHO- and INS1-cells, i.e. to provide independent biochemical evidence to back up the imaging data, e.g. in connection with Figure 1.</p><p>9) Results section: &quot;2-DG administration did not negatively affect the OCR&quot;. This is misleading as the 2-DG treatment does affect the OCR positively, which the authors later write. The corresponding red 2-DG lines in Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 4B lack the standard error for a meaningful comparison to the control.</p><p>10) Figure 1E and 1F do not correlate well with regard to the value numbers and tiny error bars in 1F. Figure 1E shows no error bar. What would be the 0 min start value in Figure 1E? Is it the same for the populations?</p><p>11) Results section and Figure 1E: &quot;flow-cytometry circumvents photo-bleaching&quot;; But in Figure 1E the DMSO control shows a drop in ER ATP levels as pronounced as the OxPhos inhibitors over time. Is that photo-bleaching or what effect causes the drop in ATP levels over the 30 min time frame of the measurement?</p><p>12) Why was the vehicle control DMSO used in 0.01% (Figure 1—figure supplement 5) and 1% (Figure 1—figure supplement 6). The latter is way too high to ensure measurements under physiological conditions.</p><p>13) Results subsection “ER ATP comes from Mitochondrial OxPhos in CHO cells” paragraph three and Figure 1G: IAA increases ER ATP levels, but in Figure 1—figure supplement 6B 2-DG reduces ER ATP levels. Can the 2-DG treatment, which is probably a more specific glycolysis inhibitor than IAA, be done with the flow cytometry assay as well? In fact, Iodoacetamide should not be considered as a specific inhibitor of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), it alkylates all cysteine residues.</p><p>14) Results section: &quot;Finally, the observations made in H9 CHO cells were completely reproduced in CHO cells that do not express human F8&quot;</p><p>This is unclear to me and leads to several questions.</p><p>– Are all previous measurements performed in &quot;stressed&quot; CHO cells?!</p><p>– Why is the basal ER ATP level (FRET ratio) in Figure 1—figure supplement 7D for DMSO much higher than other measurements (e.g. Figure 1E, 2E, 2E S2C). The stressed cells should not be considered physiological measurements under steady state.</p><p>– In Figure 1—figure supplement 7D for DMSO the measurement is constant over time in contrast to Figure 1E and many other vehicle control measurements. Why?</p><p>15) Why is the 0 min time point so often omitted in figures?</p><p>16) Figure 2: H9 CHO cells with or without induction of F8?</p><p>17) It is often unclear how many cells were used in the fluorescence ratiometric analysis/ measurements?</p><p>18) Subsection “Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibits ATP import into the ER”: &quot;ER ATP usage arrest&quot;</p><p>How would SERCA inhibition cause an ATP usage arrest? Wouldn't misfolding or ER stress drive ATP consumption by chaperones?</p><p>19) Figure 3H: Writing too small and figure too crowded/complicated. Reduce irrelevant information.</p><p>20) Figure 4A: Too small</p><p>Would it not be better, having the data from Figure 1A and 1B together with the Western blot panel that demonstrates F8 synthesis upon SAHA treatment and the inductions of UPR?</p><p>21) Subsection “Protein misfolding in the ER increases both ER ATP dependence on OxPhos and Tg-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization into mitochondria.”: it is unclear how long the cells were pre-treated with SAHA for stress induction.</p><p>22) Figure 4 I and J: Highlight the trace of population mean.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>23) Subsection “Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulates ATP import into the ER” and others: &quot;ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release with a transient ER ATP increase (Vishnu et al., 2014) (and repeated in Figure 3F) could reflect a temporary reduction in ER ATP consumption, rather than reflecting the luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the ER ATP import machinery.&quot; It appears (e.g. based on Vishnu et al., 2014) that the calcium depletion of the ER slightly precedes the initial increase in ATP level. According to the model by Yong et al. this would already inhibit SLC35B1 and prevent further ATP uptake. Yet, initially ATP levels rise in response to SERCA inhibition. In addition, the authors write &quot;a temporary reduction in ER ATP consumption&quot;. How would the reduction of ATP consumption increase the ATP level? Wouldn't it cause a stagnation of the ATP levels without the ATP transporter being active?</p><p>24) In general, we wonder how the observed role of cytosolic AMPK in Ca<sup>2+</sup> coupled ER ATP increase (Vishnu et al., 2014) fits into the model, which is described here, and why this was not addressed or at least discussed here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49682.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major conclusions are of sufficient interest for publication in eLife, as the work addresses important aspects of ER biology.

Sonenberg and Pfeffer that regulation governing ATP supply to the ER constitutes the fundamental aspect of ER biology, esp. for energy homeostasis. Our discovery that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> playing such a role witnesses, again, the elegant balancing mechanism of the intricate homeostatic control, inside a mammalian cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The link between Slc35B1 and CaATiER is weak. The data on HeLa cells do not support the CaATiER model and there are no data on SLC35B1/AXER for the other two cell lines. Therefore, additional work is required to provide this link or, alternatively, to identify the ATP carrier that is linked to CaATiER in INS1 or CHO cells.</p></disp-quote><p>First, while SLC35B1 is a necessary component for ATP supply to the ER, as demonstrated by Klein et al., we believe it is not sufficient to explain the <italic>CaATiER</italic> phenomenon. By analogy, for the plasma membrane ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup><sub>ATP</sub> channel, the ATP-sensing subunits SUR1/SUR2A/SUR2B are separate entities from the K<sup>+</sup> channel (encoded by the KCNJ-8/-11 genes).</p><p>In this revision, we now demonstrate that <italic>Slc35b1</italic> knockdown attenuated the <italic>CaATiER</italic> phenomenon in both CHO and INS1 cells.</p><p>To elaborate:</p><p>1) Using the semi-intact CHO cell system, we confirmed that <italic>Slc35b1</italic> knockdown reduced basal ER ATP levels, and attenuated <italic>CaATiER</italic>. The figure is now available as main Figure 3E, and the more detailed results are also provided in Figure 3 —figure supplement 2.</p><p>2) We also demonstrated that <italic>Slc35b1</italic> knockdown reduced basal ER ATP levels and attenuated <italic>CaATiER</italic> using single cell FRET imaging. The figures are now displayed as Figure 3 —figure supplement 3 (A to F).</p><p>These observations further support our model in Figure 3H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) An in-depth analysis of the role of Slc35B1 is needed to strengthen the study. It is required to show that Slc35B1 is indeed the one and only ATP transporter to the ER. The analysis of a cytoplasmic calcium sensitivity/dependence of the Slc35B1 may provide some useful information.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe our data presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3 fully support the model that SLC35B1 is a necessary component for ATP import into the ER. However, as important as SLC35B1 is for ER ATP supply, we cannot state that it is the “one and only ATP transporter into the ER”. As in a recent review (Depaoli et al., 2019), we believe that additional pathways might supply the ER with ATP. See Figure 3 in Depaoli et al., 2019.</p><p>Among the above proposed mechanisms, based on our results, we believe the SLC35B1 ATP/ADP translocase constitutes the major ATP import mechanism to the ER, while the retrograde import from the Golgi apparatus constitutes another important ATP supply. The latter may explain why <italic>Slc35b1</italic> knockdown is not lethal for the cell lines we have tested so far. In addition, we are unsure if the translocon channels or non-specific transporters (shaded in blue and green) play any role for meaningful ATP import into the ER.</p><p>To analyze the cytoplasmic calcium sensitivity/dependence of <italic>Slc35B1</italic>, we performed Ca<sup>2+</sup> dose response using the semi-intact H9 CHO cell system which showed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity is ~ 0.5 – 2 µM for the <italic>CaATiER</italic> mechanism in mammalian cells. This result is now provided as Figure 3—figure supplement 5.</p><p>In addition, importantly, the nice paper by Klein et al. (Klein et al., 2018) elegantly demonstrated that SLC35B1 expression alone did not confer the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responsiveness (when ectopically expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, c.f. Table 1 by Klein et al., cited below), which suggests that the SLC35B1 protein is the ATP/ADP translocation channel, but does not encode the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responsiveness element. However, in the absence of data, we refrain from further speculation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The discrepancies between the old and new results in INS1 cells need to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not feel that the “old” and new results are different from each other. Please note that in the study of Vishnu et al., 2014, the time frame of BHQ treatment of INS-1 cells was rather short (~ 3 minutes, in the left panel from Figure S3A of Vishnu et al.) prior to the depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> by the administration of the IP3 generating agonists CCh and ATP. In the current study we investigated and followed the BHQ effect on ER ATP content for more than 30 minutes, and still observed an increase in ER ATP at the start of the BHQ treatment, shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These criticisms of the work are listed in great detail in the reviews, which are attached in full. In addition, the reviewers offered many thoughtful and constructive suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>[…] The authors should define what they mean by &quot;Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient across the ER membrane&quot;.

We would like to clarify the second conclusion by reviewer #2, i.e. “cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulates the ER ATP import, which is mediated by SLC35B1/AXER”. While Klein et al. demonstrated (Klein et al., 2018) SLC35B1/AXER mediates ER ATP import, and in this revision we provide analysis in CHO, HeLa and INS-1 cells that SLC35B1 is indeed indispensable for ER ATP import.

Specifically, for Figure 1E, all tubes with OxPhos toxins received the same batch of reporter cells from one cell suspension preparation (Step 6 – Step 7), to ensure cell population homogeneity for comparison.</p><p>Secondly, flow cytometry-based FRET assay samples thousands of cells per time point.</p><p>For example, in Figure 1F, N equals 5388 for DMSO, 5298 for Oligo, 5313 for Rotenone, 5288 for FCCP groups, respectively. For Figure 1E, Prism software generated this message reading – “For some points, the error bars would be shorter than the height of the symbol. In these cases, Prism simply does not draw the error bars.”</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49682-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Results section and Figure 1E: &quot;flow-cytometry circumvents photo-bleaching&quot;; But in Figure 1E the DMSO control shows a drop in ER ATP levels as pronounced as the OxPhos inhibitors over time. Is that photo-bleaching or what effect causes the drop in ATP levels over the 30 min time frame of the measurement?</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, the basal level drop is not from photobleaching, as every cell is only sampled once in a flow-cytometer.</p><p>Secondly, we think the baseline drift was derived from the vigorous shaking before cells were taken up by the flow cytometer, and we are working diligently to modify our procedures to mitigate such an effect, by reducing the shaking speed. The improvement is visible in Figure 2E and 2F. However, shaking step cannot be omitted for flow procedure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Why was the vehicle control DMSO used in 0.01% (Figure 1—figure supplement 5) and 1% (Figure 1—figure supplement 6). The latter is way too high to ensure measurements under physiological conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>The DMSO concentration was used to match the toxin dilution, in which the stock was prepared in. In addition, incubation of cell in 1% (vol/vol) DMSO over the period for 1 hr did not affect cell physiology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Results subsection “ER ATP comes from Mitochondrial OxPhos in CHO cells” paragraph three and Figure 1G: IAA increases ER ATP levels, but in Figure 1—figure supplement 6B 2-DG reduces ER ATP levels. Can the 2-DG treatment, which is probably a more specific glycolysis inhibitor than IAA, be done with the flow cytometry assay as well? In fact, Iodoacetamide should not be considered as a specific inhibitor of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), it alkylates all cysteine residues.</p></disp-quote><p>2-DG, if used for 2hrs, effectively depleted total cellular ATP (Figure 1—figure supplement 8B), due to its metabolism by hexokinase. The more imminent effect of 2-DG was tested and displayed in Figure 1—figure supplement 7.</p><p>We agree with Dr. Zimmermann that there is no single “glycolysis inhibitor” that only blocks ATP regeneration, as we discussed in our Introduction. For this reason, we used “no glucose” condition (Figure 1H, “Glucose” vs. “PBS”) to confirm the effect of blocking glycolysis, where glucose addition for one hour had no effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Results section: &quot;Finally, the observations made in H9 CHO cells were completely reproduced in CHO cells that do not express human F8&quot;</p><p>This is unclear to me and leads to several questions.</p><p>– Are all previous measurements performed in &quot;stressed&quot; CHO cells?!</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our response to comment 7 for clarification.</p><p>H9 CHO is not considered “stressed” by basal level of F8 expression (Figure 4A), which is under the ER proteostasis control. We emphasize that only under prolonged treatment with a chemical inducer of FVIII transcription (HDAC inhibitor, e.g. SAHA or NaB) are the H9 CHO cells “stressed” (Figure 4A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why is the basal ER ATP level (FRET ratio) in Figure 1—figure supplement 7D for DMSO much higher than other measurements (e.g. Figure 1E, 2E, 2E S2C). The stressed cells should not be considered physiological measurements under steady state.</p></disp-quote><p>The above explanation assures the basal H9 CHO cells are not “stressed”.</p><p>In Figure 1—figure supplement 7D, CHO cells without F8 expression were used. The baseline FRET level is affected by the probe ERAT expression level, which is demonstrated in Figure 1—figure supplement 3A. Therefore, unlike the ATP luminescence assay by ATPLite kit, the baseline FRET signal cannot be used to calibrate ER ATP levels, and the difference in baseline FRET ratios are considered as clonal variation between the H9 and CHO cell clones. The change in FRET signal (<italic>ΔFRET</italic>) is more meaningful by design (Imamura et al., 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 1—figure supplement 7D for DMSO the measurement is constant over time in contrast to Figure 1E and many other vehicle control measurements. Why?</p></disp-quote><p>The CHO cells without F8 expression (i.e. DUK cells) use much less ATP in the ER, which correlates with less OxPhos activity in these cells. This observation is consistent with our notion that ER stress leads to an “<italic>anti-Warburg</italic>” effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Why is the 0 min time point so often omitted in figures?</p></disp-quote><p>We provided an explanation in the response to comment 10.

Wouldn't misfolding or ER stress drive ATP consumption by chaperones?</p></disp-quote><p>It was our hypothesis for “ER ATP usage arrest”, as many Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ER chaperones also promote ATP hydrolysis, such as Calnexin and Calreticulin in cooperation with BiP.</p><p>Yes, protein misfolding should drive ATP consumption by chaperones. This partially explained why ER ATP drops in H9 cells upon matrix detachment and shaking, a condition that hampers OxPhos inside a cell (Grassian et al., 2011). However, ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion is not to be taken as equivalent to ER stress/protein misfolding induction, as shown recently (Szalai et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) Figure 3H: Writing too small and figure too crowded/complicated.

The SAHA treatment was 21 hrs for Figure 4 C and D, and this information was inserted in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) Figure 4 I and J: Highlight the trace of population mean.</p></disp-quote><p>Highlighted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion</p><p>23) Subsection “Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulates ATP import into the ER” and others: &quot;ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release with a transient ER ATP increase (Vishnu et al., 2014) (and repeated in Figure 3F) could reflect a temporary reduction in ER ATP consumption, rather than reflecting the luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the ER ATP import machinery.&quot; It appears (e.g. based on Vishnu et al., 2014) that the calcium depletion of the ER slightly precedes the initial increase in ATP level. According to the model by Yong et al. this would already inhibit SLC35B1 and prevent further ATP uptake. Yet, initially ATP levels rise in response to SERCA inhibition. In addition, the authors write &quot;a temporary reduction in ER ATP consumption&quot;. How would the reduction of ATP consumption increase the ATP level? Wouldn't it cause a stagnation of the ATP levels without the ATP transporter being active?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that we do not completely understand the initial transient increase in the ERAT FRET signal in HeLa cells, except that it is highly reproducible in certain cell types (to a lesser extent INS-1, as shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 3A). We suspect there is a lag time in the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation to induce the <italic>CaATiER</italic> machinery, in the sequence of events in temporal order: SERCA inhibitor -&gt; ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake arrest -&gt; ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release -&gt; cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation -&gt; <italic>CaATiER</italic> activation.</p><p>Considering our semi-intact CHO cell result regarding the dose-response of [Ca<sup>2+]</sup>(Figure 3—figure supplement 5), we inferred that ~1 µM cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> isthe activation threshold, therefore it is reasonable to assume that <italic>CaATiER</italic> mechanism activation lagged behind the SERCA inhibitor administration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>24) In general, we wonder how the observed role of cytosolic AMPK in Ca<sup>2+</sup> coupled ER ATP increase (Vishnu et al., 2014) fits into the model, which is described here, and why this was not addressed or at least discussed here.</p></disp-quote><p>Wedid not further investigate the AMPK phosphorylation status here, partly in that we have more direct measure of ATP. We added discussions on the possible role of AMPK, in subsections “Cytosolic Ca2+ attenuates ATP import into the ER” and “ER protein misfolding increases the ER bioenergetic requirement for ATP from OxPhos”.</p><p>References</p><p>Amin-Wetzel, N., Saunders, R.A., Kamphuis, M.J., Rato, C., Preissler, S., Harding, H.P., and Ron, D.
