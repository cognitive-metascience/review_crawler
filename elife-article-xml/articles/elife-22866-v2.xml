are initially integrated in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Here, we describe a new approach to investigate these neural circuits in mouse. This semi-intact somatosensory preparation enables recording from spinal output neurons, while precisely controlling somatosensory input, and simultaneously manipulating specific populations of spinal interneurons. Our findings suggest that spinal interneurons show distinct temporal and spatial tuning properties. We also show that modality selectivity — mechanical, heat and cold — can be assessed in both retrogradely labeled spinoparabrachial projection neurons and genetically labeled spinal interneurons. Finally, we demonstrate that interneuron connectivity can be determined via optogenetic activation of specific interneuron subtypes.

Under some circumstances, these neural circuits reduce the degree to which noxious input is conveyed to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gebhart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moayedi and Davis, 2013</xref>). In others, the somatosensory input is amplified by spinal circuits, leading to allodynia and hyperalgesia, two hallmarks of chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sandkühler, 2009</xref>). Given the central role of the spinal dorsal horn in the modulation of noxious input, there is a great need for an improved understanding of the underlying spinal microcircuits and the computations they perform.</p><p>Electrophysiological recording from spinal neurons is one of the best approaches to study the functional connectivity among spinal neurons in detail. Historically, such studies were performed using in vivo recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carstens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Craig et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dickenson and Sullivan, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jinks and Carstens, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koerber et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Randic et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Torsney and Fitzgerald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Urch and Dickenson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). However, a considerable limitation to this approach is that it is difficult to target known cell types in the dorsal horn. With the advent of a new generation of molecular genetic tools, it has been possible to overcome this constraint by recording from genetically defined subsets of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bourane et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hantman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heinke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kardon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peirs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petitjean et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeilhofer et al., 2005</xref>). Generally, though, these experiments have been performed within the context of a spinal slice, which suffers from the shortcoming that key components of the nociceptive circuit, such as the input, are severed. In this context, spinal circuits are evaluated using electrical stimulation of the whole dorsal roots, even though such a stimulus is not physiological. These issues underscored the need for an electrophysiological approach that allows visual access for targeted recordings, and includes innervated skin for natural stimulation.</p><p>Here, we describe a new approach that achieves these goals, enabling precise determination of spinal output, as well as modality-specific control over somatosensory input, and the ability to manipulate genetically defined interneuron populations within a nociceptive circuit. First, we reveal how excitatory and inhibitory inputs can be distinguished from one another, and use this approach to characterize lamina I neurons based on temporal and spatial tuning properties. Next, we analyze modality selectivity of lamina I spinoparabrachial (SPB) projection neurons and genetically labeled spinal interneurons. Finally, we investigated the feasibility of optogenetic manipulation in the dorsal horn, and use this approach to begin mapping spinal circuitry. Together, our findings provide evidence that the semi-intact preparation is a powerful new approach that will facilitate the study of spinal somatosensory processing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ex vivo somatosensory preparation</title><p>Our goal was to develop a mouse preparation that preserves intact spinal circuitry, allows physiological stimulation, and enables whole cell recordings from known neuronal subtypes in the dorsal horn. Previously, we developed an ex vivo preparation to record from primary afferents while providing natural stimulation to the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumbauer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jankowski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lawson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McIlwrath et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we extended the use of this preparation by recording from neurons in the superficial dorsal horn rather than the dorsal root ganglia. This preparation comprises of a large portion of spinal cord (~C2 – S3), together with lumbar 2 (L2) and L3 roots, ganglia, saphenous nerve and hindlimb skin (including hindpaw), dissected in continuum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Spinal segments L2 and L3, which are targeted by the saphenous nerve, are regions of the spinal cord that are well-suited for visually-guided whole cell recordings because they contain regions of grey matter that are clearly visible between gaps in the roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, dotted ovals). In particular, the lateral aspect of the dorsal horn is favorable because the white matter in this region is very thin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, green shaded area). For optimal stimulation of the skin, we created a custom recording chamber in which the skin rests on a perforated platform at the air-liquid interface, allowing the dermis to be bathed with oxygenated aCSF, while the stratum corneum is exposed and thus accessible to mechanical and thermal stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In addition, to accommodate pharmacological studies, we also designed an alternative, small volume chamber with directed flow optimized for drug application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B)</xref>. The final challenge was to visualize spinal neurons for recordings. To this end, we employed side illumination with a high-powered infrared light emitting diode, which allowed visualization and patch-clamp recording of cells up to 50 µm from the surface of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Safronov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szucs et al., 2009</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22866.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ex vivo semi-intact somatosensory preparation.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Photograph (<bold>A</bold>) and schematic (<bold>B</bold>) of the semi-intact somatosensory preparation.

This is beneficial because understanding neuronal function depends on measuring synaptic input (sub-threshold excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents) and neuronal output (action potentials). Previous studies, however, have generally not been performed in a manner that enables the detailed analysis of sub-threshold inputs upon stimulation of the skin. In contrast, our preparation allows us to combine voltage clamp mode to characterize synaptic inputs onto the recorded cell, as well as current clamp mode to measure the firing evoked by natural cutaneous stimuli.</p><p>To facilitate the study of both excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) and inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) in the same cells, we took advantage of the fact that at the reversal potential for chloride (V<sub>H</sub> = −70 mV) only EPSCs are observed, whereas at a depolarized holding potential (V<sub>H</sub> = −40 mV) it is possible to clearly resolve IPSCs as outward current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoshimura and Nishi, 1993</xref>). Previously, Yoshimura and colleagues analyzed the synaptic currents in lamina II neurons that are evoked by cutaneous stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Furue et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Narikawa et al., 2000</xref>); however, the input onto lamina I neurons remained uncharacterized.</p><p>In an effort to test the functionality of our new approach, we began by analyzing synaptic currents onto lamina I neurons in response to mechanical stimulation, using a small paintbrush, which elicits activity in both nociceptors and non-nociceptors. We found that approximately half of lamina I neurons showed synaptic currents upon brushing of the anterior hindlimb skin. Of these, brush-evoked EPSCS and IPSCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>) were observed in one quarter of responding lamina I neurons. In contrast, only EPSCs were observed upon brush stimulation for approximately half of lamina I neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>), whereas only IPSCs were observed in the remaining quarter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). These data show that the somatosensory preparation can be used to visualize excitatory and inhibitory inputs evoked by natural stimulation.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22866.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Temporal and spatial response of excitatory and inhibitory inputs.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Analysis of excitatory and inhibitory input onto lamina I neurons upon brushing of the skin (grey bars).

A von Frey filament (2 g) was used to facilitate the identification of the receptive field border. A typical example is shown, illustrating a neuron whose inhibitory receptive field was significantly larger than its excitatory receptive field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Brushing the center of the receptive field induced EPSCs (upper trace) at a holding potential of −70 mV, as well as action potentials and IPSPs in current clamp mode (middle trace). In contrast, stimulation of the off-center area evoked only IPSPs, but no EPSPs (bottom trace). Of lamina I neurons that receive both excitatory and inhibitory inputs upon stimulation of the skin, the majority (5 of 6) show this type of center-surround receptive field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), consistent with previous intracellular recordings in cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koerber et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koerber and Mirnics, 1996</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we examined the temporal response of lamina I neurons upon mechanical stimulation of the skin with a von Frey filament (2 g). Most lamina I neurons (48 of 61) showed EPSCs only during the period of mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and I</xref>). However, approximately one-fifth showed a very distinct temporal response in which a prolonged afterdischarge of EPSCs and action potentials outlasted the stimulus duration by several seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>), consistent with previous findings from recordings in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Woolf and Fitzgerald, 1983</xref>). Taken together, these experiments not only show feasibility of the semi-intact somatosensory preparation for the analysis of spatial and temporal responses, but also provide the first detailed analysis of the synaptic inputs received by lamina I neurons upon stimulation of the skin, thereby complementing and extending previous extracellular recordings in cat, rat and monkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Craig et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Craig and Andrew, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davidson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jinks and Carstens, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Characterization of lamina I projection neurons</title><p>While the basic characterization of lamina I neurons to natural input is important, our ability to interpret these experiments was hampered because the identity of the recorded cell remained unknown. We therefore sought to determine the feasibility of recording from known cell types. Spinal projection neurons were of particular interest to us, since they are the output neurons that convey nociceptive information to the brain. However, while many spinal projection neurons are located in lamina I, they can be difficult to target since they are quite sparse, representing only 5% of total neurons in this lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Todd, 2010</xref>). Previous work in rat has revealed that most anterolateral tract projection neurons send their axons to the lateral parabrachial nucleus in the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Khater and Todd, 2009</xref>). We therefore injected DiI into this nucleus to retrogradely label neurons SPB projection neurons, which were readily identified four days later and targeted for whole cell patch clamp recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Next, we characterized the modality selectivity by assessing the response to mechanical force (M; 1 g von Frey filament), heat (H; 50°C saline), and cold (C; 0°C saline) stimuli. These experiments revealed the existence of several discrete functional classes of SPB projection neurons. Half of these neurons were considered to be polymodal because action potentials were evoked in response to both mechanical and thermal stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C and F</xref>). The other half appeared tuned to thermal stimuli, responding to either cold only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) or cold and heat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) as summarized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

Recently, several Cre and/or Flp alleles have been used to target genetically defined populations of spinal interneurons and investigate their role through loss- or gain-of-function approaches in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bourane et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peirs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petitjean et al., 2015</xref>). Less is known, however, about the specific functions of these cells within the context of a spinal microcircuit. We therefore investigated whether the semi-intact somatosensory preparation could be used to record from genetically defined interneurons and characterize their modality tuning. Because the genetically-labeled cells were located throughout the dorsal horn, this also gave us the opportunity to determine the depth from which we could record fluorescent cells in our preparation.</p><p>For these experiments, we used the <italic>Bhlhbe22-Cre</italic> allele, which labels neurons that express the transcription factor Bhlhe22 (also known as Bhlhb5) during development. Previous studies from our lab revealed that a subset of Bhlhe22-derived cells in the superficial dorsal horn are inhibitory neurons that function to inhibit itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ross et al., 2010</xref>). We also showed previously, using slice recordings, that <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> neurons receive direct input from primary afferents that respond to capsaicin, mustard oil, and menthol, raising the possibility that some <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> neurons might mediate the inhibition of itch by counter-stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kardon et al., 2014</xref>). However, whether this primary afferent input was sufficient to cause action potentials in <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> neurons was unknown.</p><p>To address this question, we used mice harboring the <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> allele together with Ai9, which enables Cre-dependent expression of tdTomato from the <italic>Rosa</italic> locus (here referred to as <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre<sup>lsl-tdT</sup></italic>). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed on tdTomato-labeled neurons in the superficial dorsal horn, and the fluorescent dye Alexa 647 was added to the patch pipette to ensure correct targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, we investigated which types of sensory input (mechanical, cold and/or heat) evoked action potentials in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We found that most <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> labeled neurons fired in response to at least one stimulus type, and that some responded to all three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) as summarized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ci</xref>; pie chart).

These data show that it is not only feasible to record from genetically labeled neurons in the semi-intact somatosensory preparation, but that it is possible to characterize their stimulus response properties. Moreover, we could target these brightly fluorescent cells as long as they were within 70 µm from the surface of the spinal cord, suggesting it is possible to study interneurons that reside from lamina I through to the outer part of lamina III.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22866.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Modality tuning (excitatory and inhibitory) of <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic>-labeled spinal interneurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Recording from a lamina II interneuron from a <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre<sup>lsl-tdT</sup></italic> mouse (left).

The use of tdTomato in these experiments was helpful because, although the ChR2-YFP fusion protein is fluorescent, it remains difficult to resolve which cells express it because this fusion protein is localized to the membrane. In initial experiments, we compared the <italic>Nts-Cre</italic> allele, which is specific to excitatory neurons, and labels approximately half of those in the superficial dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) to the <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> allele, which mainly labels inhibitory neurons, including those that express Nos1 (also known as nNOS) and/or Galanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kardon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ross et al., 2010</xref>).

One approach to increase the precision of genetic targeting is through the use of tamoxifen-inducible alleles, which adds specificity through temporal control of recombination. To test the use of optogenetics in this context, we used mice harboring the <italic>Nos1-CreER</italic> allele, which causes recombination selectively in Nos1-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For these experiments, mice were treated with tamoxifen at P14 and recordings were performed three weeks later. As before, blue light induced inward current in ChR2-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>); however, the magnitude of the current was significantly lower than that observed using either <italic>Nts-Cre</italic> or <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Given that Nos1 neurons make up a large fraction of those marked by the <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> allele, it seemed unlikely that this disparity in current was due to a difference in cell type. Rather, we hypothesized that the reduced current in <italic>Nos1-CreER</italic> cells was due to the timing of Cre-mediated recombination, which occurred only upon tamoxifen-treatment, hence allowing less time for ChR2 accumulation. Consistent with this, we found that if we reduced the time post tamoxifen (i.e., one week rather than three), the amplitude of blue light-evoked current was smaller still, and insufficient to trigger an action potential in ChR2-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,D and E</xref>). Thus, when using the Ai32 allele, it appears that approximately three weeks’ time post-recombination is required to reach functional levels of ChR2 expression in the dorsal horn.</p><p>Next, we analyzed effect of stimulation frequency on the responses to optogenetic stimulation. ChR2-expressing <italic>Nts-Cre</italic> neurons were able to follow a low frequency (0.1 Hz; 5 ms), where one (and occasionally two) action potentials were evoked with negligible latency jitter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Ei and F</xref>). In contrast, at higher frequencies (2 and 10 Hz), these neurons could not consistently follow, demonstrating an increase in jitter and frequent failures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Eii, 5iii and 5F</xref>). Moreover, when similar experiments were performed in ChR2-expressing <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> neurons, these cells showed even worse fidelity to optogenetic stimulation, and many showed a reluctance to fire even when we increased the stimulus duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). These data reveal that, while ChR2 can be used in our somatosensory preparation to manipulate the activity of genetically defined cells, the effects of optogenetic stimulation in a given cell type must be determined empirically.</p><p>To extend and complement these experiments, we next investigated the degree to which inhibitory opsins could be used to suppress activity in dorsal horn interneurons. For these experiments, we used mice harboring either <italic>Nts-Cre</italic> together with Ai35 (for Cre-dependent Arch) or <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> together with Ai39 (for Cre-dependent Halo). Expression of either Arch or Halo in dorsal horn neurons enabled light-induced outward current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B and C</xref>) and hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, E and F</xref>) that was not significantly different between <italic>Nts-Cre</italic> and <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> populations. To determine whether the expression of these opsins was sufficient to block evoked activity, we analyzed the effect of light on activity evoked by electrical stimulation of the dorsal root. In <italic>Nts-Cre</italic> neurons expressing Arch, optogenetic stimulation almost completely blocked root-evoked action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and G</xref>). In contrast, while the number of root-evoked action potentials was significantly reduced by optogenetic inhibition of <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> neurons expressing Halo, they were not completely eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and G</xref>). Given the similarity in outward current and hyperpolarization elicited by the two inhibitory opsins, the disparity in their effectiveness is likely due, at least in part, to differences between the two types of recorded cells, potentially including distinct intrinsic properties and/or differences in root-evoked input. Thus, these findings illustrate that inhibitory opsins can be used in a variety of cell types in the dorsal horn to manipulate cell activity while underscoring the important concept that their effects are context-dependent.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22866.009</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Optogenetic inhibition of spinal interneurons.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Representative traces of light-induced outward current in an <italic>Nts-Cre</italic> interneuron that expresses Arch (<bold>A</bold>) and a <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> interneuron that expresses Halo (<bold>B</bold>).

To investigate this question further, we analyzed the effect of optogenetic activation of <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> neurons on lamina I neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Specifically, we searched for lamina I neurons that received direct input from <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), which was deemed to be monosynaptic inhibitory input due to the short latency and absence of jitter in the evoked IPSC (data not shown). Next, we analyzed the effect of activating <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> neurons with optogenetics. In the absence of light, dorsal root stimulation resulted in two phases of EPSCs, likely due to the inputs to this cell from primary afferents with different conduction velocities, and each of these phases was associated with the generation of an action potential in current clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; black traces). Stimulation of the dorsal root in conjunction with light activation of <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> neurons resulted in similar EPSCs.

In addition, we classified SPB projection neurons based on modality tuning, as well as interneuron connectivity using optogenetics to map spinal circuits. The ability to record from output neurons in the spinal cord while having fine control of input and simultaneously modulating interneuron activity with inhibitory and excitatory opsins should facilitate the functional dissection of spinal microcircuits in the dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22866.011</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model.</title><p>The ex-vivo semi-intact somatosensory preparation enables 1) control of the input, 2) manipulation (excitation or inhibition) of spinal interneurons, and 3) quantification of the output to investigate the neural circuits of the dorsal horn.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22866.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22866.011</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22866-fig8-v2"/></fig></p><p>A key asset of our approach is that it facilitates whole cell patch clamp recordings in the context of a relatively intact circuits, enabling the recording of membrane potentials and synaptic currents, including sub-threshold activity, to characterize both input and output in identified cell types. This approach will enable new insight into the circuitry of dorsal horn by assisting in the study of inhibitory mechanisms. Inhibition is thought to be involved in limiting nociception, sharpening spatial acuity, and providing occlusion between somatosensory modalities, all of which become disrupted upon injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewin et al., 1994</xref>). However, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Thus, the somatosensory preparation may be a useful tool to study both the neural circuits involved in acute nociception as well as those processes that are disrupted in the context of chronic pain or itch.</p><p>A second advantage of this somatosensory preparation over the traditional slice preparation is that it allows the functional characterization of defined cell types in superficial laminae of the dorsal horn, such as spinal projection neurons in lamina I. Understanding the logic of spinal projection neurons that convey noxious information to the brain is a central question in the field that remains unaddressed. In particular, the number of different subtypes of spinal projection neurons is unknown, and how they encode somatosensory information is unclear. For our study, we used a common classification scheme based on three psychophysically distinct modalities, force, heat and cool. A secondary way to classify mechanically sensitive projection neurons is based on the intensity of stimulation to which they respond: nociceptive neurons respond only when mechanical stimulation is noxious, whereas wide dynamic range neurons respond in a graded manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dado et al., 1994</xref>). Most recently, several investigators have begun to subdivide chemically responsive projection neurons based on their responses to chemical algogens and pruritogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrew and Craig, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carstens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davidson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jinks and Carstens, 1999</xref>). While these efforts illustrate that different projection neurons are tuned to different types of somatosensory input in complex ways, projection neuron subtypes <italic>per se</italic> have remained generally elusive. In this regard, the semi-intact somatosensory preparation together with development genetic tools that show improved cell-type specificity represent a tool-kit to address this key gap in knowledge.</p><p>As with any approach to recording from spinal neurons, ours also has limitations. For example, we can only record from superficial laminae of the spinal cord. In addition, our ex vivo approach involves severing some components, including ascending and descending tracts as well as muscular and visceral inputs. The dissection in itself may cause tissue injury within the vicinity of the receptive fields, potentially altering the properties of the recorded neurons. Could the afterdischarge that we observed in a subset of lamina I neurons occur as a result of tissue damage? While this possibility cannot be excluded at the present time, we think it is unlikely for two reasons. First, afterdischarge is not simply due to injury of primary afferents that could potentially occur while dissecting the skin, since this phenomenon is not observed when we record from DRG neurons in our semi-intact preparation (unpublished observations). Moreover, afterdischarge is also observed in naïve rats upon recording from superficial dorsal horn neurons in vivo, where (just was we report here) 20% of dorsal horn neurons showed prolonged responses to a single stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Woolf and Fitzgerald, 1983</xref>).</p><p>Another potential limitation to the semi-intact somatosensory preparation described here that it enables the recording of inputs from the saphenous nerve (L2 and L3 roots), whereas many behavioral models of pain involve lower spinal segments (L3–L5). There is precedent, however, for the application of test stimuli (e.g., Randall-Selitto apparatus, von Frey filaments) to the dorsal surface of the paw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anseloni and Gold, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Randall and Selitto, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yilmaz and Gold, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the spared nerve injury model has been shown to cause mechanical hypersensitivity not only in the sural nerve territory but also in the saphenous nerve territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Decosterd and Woolf, 2000</xref>). Therefore, this ex vivo preparation remains compatible with several standard injury models for inflammatory and neuropathic pain.</p><p>It is clear that all of our models and circuit diagrams of the dorsal horn are just scratching the surface of the true computations that underlie spinal somatosensory processing. As a first step to understand these computations, it is essential to develop a wiring diagram that clarifies how dorsal horn neurons are connected. Previously, double patch-clamp recordings have been used to investigate synaptic connectivity between interneurons subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu and Perl, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2003</xref>). But this approach was limited by the fact that only 10% of the simultaneously recorded pairs of neurons were connected. In contrast, the combination of optogenetics and the ability to record from known cell types in the dorsal horn will allow rapid development of spinal wiring diagrams.</p><p>However, our study reinforces the idea that opsin-assisted circuit mapping must be performed with caution because it can be difficult to determine whether synaptic connections are truly monosynaptic owing to the poorer temporal fidelity of optical stimulation. In particular, the typical criteria used to establish mono-synaptic connectivity using electrical simulation (absence of failure upon stimulation at 20 Hz for Aδ fibers and 2 Hz for C fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakatsuka et al., 1999</xref>]) is not applicable to optogenetic stimulation, since light-evoked action potentials have longer latency and show Cre latency jitter than those evoked by electric stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). For this reason, we and others used a less stringent criterion (e.g., 0.1 Hz optogenetic stimulation) to differentiate between mono- and polysynaptic input in the dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Honsek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang and Zylka, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cui et al., 2016</xref>). Verification of monosynaptic connections will likely require additional tests involving, for instance, the use of tetrodotoxin together with the potassium channel antagonist 4-aminopyridine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The idea that neurons in the dorsal horn function as a gate — one that can either block or amplify the nociceptive information that is conveyed to the brain — has been around for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gebhart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Melzack and Wall, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mendell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moayedi and Davis, 2013</xref>). To develop novel strategies in the treatment of pain and itch, it is important to understand the neural basis of this gate and the complex computations that are performed within these spinal networks. The somatosensory preparation described here will facilitate these conceptual advances by uncovering spinal somatosensory circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Four- to seven-week-old mice of both sexes were used in this study. <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> mice were generated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ross et al., 2010</xref>); other genetically modified mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor ME.

The animals were perfused transcardially through the left ventricle with ice-cold oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) sucrose-based artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (in mM; 234 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 Glucose). Immediately following perfusion, the skin was incised along the dorsal midline and the spinal cord was quickly exposed via dorsal laminectomy. After cord exposure, the right hindlimb and spinal cord (~C2 – S6) were excised, transferred into Sylgard-lined dissection/recording dish, and submerged in the same ice-cold sucrose-based ACSF, which circulated at 50 ml/min to facilitate superfusion of the cord. Note that this high flow rate did not impede stable recordings because of the chamber volume (20 ml) and architecture (in which the inlet is far from the recording site). Alternatively, a chamber with smaller volume and flow rate requirements can be used for pharmacological studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, the skin innervated by the saphenous nerve was dissected free of surrounding tissue (modification from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McIlwrath et al., 2007</xref>). L2 and L3 DRG were kept on the spine. Dural and pial membranes were carefully removed and spinal cord was pinned onto the Sylgard block with the right dorsal horn facing upward. Following dissection, the chamber was transferred to the rig. Then the preparation was perfused with normal ACSF solution (in mM; 117 NaCl, 3.6 KCl, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 glucose) saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 32°C.

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made with a pipette constructed from thin-walled single-filamented borosilicate glass using a microelectrode puller (P-97; Sutter Instruments, Novato CA, and PC-10; Narishige International, East Meadow NY). Pipette resistances ranged from six to 12 MΩ. Electrodes were filled with an intracellular solution containing the following (in mM): 135 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 EGTA, 5 HEPES, 5 MgATP, pH 7.2. Alexa fluor 647 (Invitrogen; 25 µM) was added to confirm recording from the target cell. Signals were acquired with an amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale CA). The data were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz with an A/D converter (Digidata 1322A, Molecular Devices) and stored using a data acquisition program (Clampex version 10, Molecular Devices).

Aδ or C fiber-evoked EPSCs were distinguished on the basis of the conduction velocity of afferent fibers (Aδ &gt; 1.2 m/s; C &lt; 1.2 m/s). Mechanical stimulation was applied using a small paint brush that can activate both nociceptors and non-nociceptors.

The peak amplitude of inward current induced by blue light stimulation (~500 ms duration) was measured in voltage clamp mode at −70 mV.

To test if activation of <italic>Bhlhe22-Cre</italic> neurons inhibits root-evoked action potentials, root stimulation (0.2 ms) and light pulse stimulation (20 ms) were applied simultaneously. Cy3 cube (centered around 555 nm) was used for activation of Arch and Halo. Peak amplitude of outward current induced by activation of Arch/Halo was measured in voltage clamp mode at −70 mV.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew Todd (Reviewer #1); Carole Torsney (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>I am including the full reviews rather than trying to summarize them because they are in essential agreement, and all of them primarily ask for editorial and textual changes. I think it best for you to have the context for the requests for context and more complete descriptions of the limitations of the new method and its potential use. All of the reviewers find your manuscript quite interesting and worthwhile. You will note that you should also be careful to appropriately include citations of relevant previous work, and one of the reviewers is concerned about terminology.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The organisation of neuronal circuits that process pain and itch information in the spinal dorsal horn is highly complex. At present, we have very limited information about the responses of different classes of projection neuron or interneuron to natural stimuli, and about the synaptic circuits that these cells take part in. The recent identification of several neurochemically distinct interneuron populations, together with the availability of new mouse lines in which recombinases are expressed in these populations, means that we are now in a far better position to investigate the functional circuitry of pain and itch transmission at the spinal level. However, new techniques will be required for this opportunity to be fully exploited.</p><p>The study by Hachisuka et al. makes a major step forwards, by combining 3 different approaches: the skin/nerve/spinal cord preparation developed by Koerber's group, patch-clamp recording in the intact spinal cord with incident LED illumination (developed by Szucs and Safronov), and recombinase-based optogenetic and chemogenetic methods to manipulate activity in genetically-defined neuronal populations. They also show that these techniques can be combined with retrograde labelling to identify projection neurons. Although each of these approaches has been applied to the dorsal horn, the combination is quite novel and provides an extremely powerful way of exploring the functions of different neuronal populations.</p><p>My only significant concern is that at various points, the authors refer to the &quot;B5-I neurons&quot;, which they have previously defined as inhibitory interneurons in laminae I-II that are dependent on expression of Bhlhb5 for their survival, and correspond to cells that express galanin/dynorphin and/or nNOS. However, in this paper they have a tendency to assume that cells labelled with tdTomato in the <italic>Bhlhb5-Cre;Ai9</italic> cross are the same as the B5-I neurons (e.g. subsection “Recording from genetically labeled neurons”, last paragraph, subsection “Optogenetic modulation of recorded neurons”, second paragraph, and subsection “Circuit mapping using optogenetics”, first paragraph). This is not the case, firstly because some excitatory interneurons will be included, and secondly because there may be inhibitory interneurons that transiently express Bhlhb5, but are not dependent on it for their survival.

The successful demonstration of the utility of this approach to study excitatory / inhibitory / subthreshold synaptic input and AP firing in retrograde/genetically defined subpopulations that is evoked by specific sensory modalities is a significant technical achievement and in my opinion would be highly appropriate as a 'tools and resources' article in the <italic>eLife</italic> journal. Furthermore, the authors investigated the use of optogenetic manipulation of particular interneuron subpopulations in this novel preparation as a potentially powerful means of dissecting spinal somatosensory wiring. My main concern with this manuscript is the lack of discussion regarding potential limitations of the preparation and using it in combination with optogenetics to define circuitry. The development of this preparation is commendable and I think that a more open discussion of the potential issues would be a positive asset to such a tools and resources article rather than detract from it.</p><p>Key potential issues include the fact that the skin is necessarily cut/incised i.e. there is tissue injury in the vicinity of the saphenous nerve. This is particularly worth mentioning given the demonstration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H/I</xref> that a proportion of neurons display 'afterdischarge' – 'afterdischarge' is a feature observed in in vivo recordings from spinal neurons in tissue injury models. Given the paper argues that these approaches will be used to unravel spinal circuitry it has to be acknowledged that, as detailed in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) this is only achievable within a restricted zone of L2/3 which is accessible for identified patch recording. Furthermore, this has potential implications, if they intend in the future to combine with pain models that classically impact upon L4/5 and affect hindpaw sensitivity.</p><p>The most exciting aspect of this study is the potential capacity to combine this preparation with optogenetics to unravel spinal dorsal horn wiring. To define direct/monosynaptic connections high frequency stimulation of inputs is used: monosynaptic/direct connections will be able to reliably follow with little jitter unlike polysynaptic connections which will be variable and or fail. Typically, 20Hz is used in intraspinal studies (with electrical stimulation) to test whether an input is monosynaptic. A prerequisite of this approach is that input must be capable of reliably delivering the repeated stimulus with no jitter. Here the authors demonstrate that with optogenetics this was not straightforward with differing degrees of success between different targeted subpopulations. Their best scenario was 0.1Hz stimulation in the Nts-cre cells (higher frequencies caused significant jitter) – which they then used to define direct connections. This lower stringency could result in false identification of direct monosynaptic connections – this is a caveat that must be discussed if the intention is to use this approach to identify wiring.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this Tools and Resources article Hachisuka et al. combine use of an ex vivo somatosensory system preparation with mouse genetics, retrograde labeling, and optogenetics to clarify the connectivity and response properties of genetically and anatomically defined subsets of neurons in the superficial dorsal horn, including lamina I projection neurons.</p><p>Resolving the connectivity and activity patterns of lamina I output neurons is a critically important goal for better understanding how pain / itch information is transmitted to the brain, in health and disease.

Please note that the preparation described by Woodbury at al. (2001) was one containing dorsolateral trunk skin. The preparation used here, which contains skin of the dorsal hindlimb skin was first described in McIlwrath et al., 2007.

Non-neuronal cells in skin are thought to influence activity in somatosensory neurons (e.g. Wilson SR et al., 2013, doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2013.08.057, or this paper from one of the co-authors Baumbauer K et al., doi: 10.7554/eLife.09674.): to what extent are these processes impacted by the absence of surrounding tissue?</italic> </p><p>Our preparation comprises a large chunk of intact dermis that contains non-neuronal cells of the skin. Indeed, the key role of signaling from keratinocytes to primary afferents in the modulation of afferent threshold was discovered using this somatosensory preparation (Baumbauer et al., 2016). The paper by Wilson et al. (2013) shows that TSLP released from keratinocytes causes itch. The overlying dermal layer (containing keratinocytes and dermal immune cells) is intact in our preparation, thereby enabling, for instance, TLSP released from keratinocytes to activate itch-responsive primary afferents. Thus, we feel that this preparation is a good model with which to study the communication between skin and nerves.</p><p>In contrast, the semi-intact somatosensory preparation is not a good model with which to study the possible role of fat, muscle and connective tissue beneath the skin and/or circulating factors on the activity of nerves that innervate the skin. The finding that receptive field properties that we observe using this preparation are similar to those that have been observed in vivo argues that underlying structures do not play a large role, at least not in the context of acute signaling. These ideas could be added to the Discussion, but we have opted not to add them since the Discussion is already very long.</p><p><italic>Similarly, the absence of surrounding tissue can alter indentation and transmission of mechanical force.</italic> </p><p>Here we are not sure whether the reviewer in concerned about the absence of surrounding skin, the absence of underlying tissue, or both.</p><p>Given the large area of skin surface in our preparation (~7 cm<sup>2</sup>) relative to the small area of a von Frey filament (&lt;0.1 mm<sup>2</sup>), we think it unlikely that the absence of surrounding skin will have a big impact on the transmission of mechanical force.</p><p>We agree that the transmission of mechanical force could be affected the rigidity of the material that is beneath the skin. For example, primary afferent responses to a given force may differ depending on whether the skin is atop something rigid (such as bone or a metal platform) vs. something pliant (such as adipose tissue). While worthy of consideration, since the data in our manuscript are qualitative rather than quantitative, we feel that a discussion of these ideas is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>What advantages does this preparation offer compared with recording of dorsal horn neuron activity in intact animals, for example using calcium imaging (Ran C et al., 2015, doi: 10.1038/nn.4350.), and given the recent development of voltage sensors?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer brings up two important considerations. One is the relative advantages/disadvantages of an ex vivo approach compared to an in vivoapproach. A second but distinct consideration is the relative merits of electrophysiological recordings of individual neurons vs. optical monitoring of populations of neurons (note that both of these approaches can be coupled with either in vivoor ex vivo preparations.</p><p>Regarding the first consideration (ex vivo vs. in vivo), we discuss the advantages and the limitations of the ex vivo at length in the Discussion.</p><p>Regarding the second consideration (electrophysiology vs. optical monitoring), there are clearly pros and cons to each approach. Electrophysiological recordings offer better temporal resolution and the ability to resolve IPSPs, EPSPs and individual action potentials; optical monitoring enables the simultaneous analysis of populations of neurons. Although a combination of these approaches will clearly be important to understand neural circuit function, discussing calcium imaging and the future use of voltage sensors is, in our opinion, outside the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>The authors indicate that responses of lamina I neurons are &quot;time locked&quot; to the stimulus duration.
