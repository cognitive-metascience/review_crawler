AMPK, a key sensor of metabolic stress stabilizes cell-cell junctions and maintains epithelial polarity; its activation by Metformin protects the epithelial barrier against stress and suppresses tumorigenesis. How AMPK protects the epithelium remains unknown. Here, we identify GIV/Girdin as a novel effector of AMPK, whose phosphorylation at a single site is both necessary and sufficient for strengthening mammalian epithelial tight junctions and preserving cell polarity and barrier function in the face of energetic stress. Expression of an oncogenic mutant of GIV (cataloged in TCGA) that cannot be phosphorylated by AMPK increased anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells and helped these cells to evade the tumor-suppressive action of Metformin. This work defines a fundamental homeostatic mechanism by which the AMPK-GIV axis reinforces cell junctions against stress-induced collapse and also provides mechanistic insight into the tumor-suppressive action of Metformin.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20795.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20795.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Metformin, AMPK</kwd><kwd>epithelial cell polarity</kwd><kwd>tight junctions</kwd><kwd>energetic stress</kwd><kwd>ccdc88a/GIRDIN</kwd><kwd>Colon cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship T32CA121938</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohena</surname><given-names>Cristina C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM071872</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kufareva</surname><given-names>Irina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI118985</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kufareva</surname><given-names>Irina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA100768</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghosh</surname><given-names>Pradipta</given-names></name><name><surname>Farquhar</surname><given-names>Marilyn G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA160911</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghosh</surname><given-names>Pradipta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK099226</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghosh</surname><given-names>Pradipta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ACS-IRG 70-002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghosh</surname><given-names>Pradipta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An effector of AMPK is essential for the kinase and its pharmacological activators, including Metformin, to strengthen cell-cell junctions and preserve epithelial cell polarity and barrier functions in the face of energetic stress, as well as to suppress oncogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epithelial cells normally display a polarized structure, with the membrane protein and organelle compositions differing between the basal and apical sides of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaplan et al., 2009</xref>). This asymmetry between apical and basolateral compartments segregates structures, proteins, and organelle functions across polarized cells. Cell polarity is fundamental for both the architecture and function of epithelial tissues; its loss triggers organ dysfunction, neoplastic transformation and cancer progression, all via dysregulation of cell growth and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martin-Belmonte and Perez-Moreno, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Epithelial polarization requires the coordination of multiple fundamental cellular processes that are driven by their own set of unique signaling pathways and whose integration in space and time dictates overall epithelial morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">St Johnston and Sanson, 2011</xref>). Among the evolutionarily conserved pathways that control epithelial cell polarity, several collaborate to assemble, stabilize and turnover the cell-cell junctions, e.g. CDC42 and PAR proteins, such as the PAR3-PAR6-aPKC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wodarz and Nathke, 2007</xref>), and pathways that regulate membrane exocytosis and lipid modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">St Johnston and Ahringer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wodarz and Nathke, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Besides the pathways mentioned above, regulation of polarity requires an additional signaling component which is triggered exclusively under conditions of energetic stress. Three studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zheng and Cantley, 2007</xref>) published in 2006â2007 simultaneously reported a surprising role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the maintenance of epithelial cell polarity and barrier functions. Discovered in 1984, AMPK is unique in that it is a metabolic sensor protein which is activated during energetic stress and thereby, couples energy sensing to cell polarity by protecting cell junctions against stress-induced collapse. Using the polarized Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cell line (<italic>MDCK</italic>), it was demonstrated that AMPK is activated during calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)-induced tight junction (TJ) assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zheng and Cantley, 2007</xref>). Depletion of the AMPK catalytic Î± subunit or expression of a kinase-dead mutant of AMPK inhibits TJ assembly as indicated by a loss of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER); the latter is a measure of paracellular ion flow which depends on TJ stability. Activation of AMPK with 5-aminoimidizole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR) partially protects TJs from disassembly induced by calcium depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zheng and Cantley, 2007</xref>). These findings closely followed another major revelation that the tumor suppressor LKB1 (Liver Kinase B1; also known as Serine/Threonine Kinase 11 â STK11) is a direct activator of AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hawley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shaw et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Woods et al., 2003</xref>), and that polarity defects precede the development of tumors in genetically modified mice with tissue-specific deletion of LKB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hezel et al., 2008</xref>). Together, these discoveries established the first links between energetic stress, cell polarity and oncogenesis. Since then, multiple studies have reported the protective role of AMPK in maintaining cell-cell junctions across a variety of cell types in diverse tissue types [lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garnett et al., 2013</xref>), heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castanares-Zapatero et al., 2013</xref>), the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takata et al., 2013</xref>), kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seo-Mayer et al., 2011</xref>), intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Spruss et al., 2012</xref>)] while mounting a pathologic response to a variety of stressors, from bacterial invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Patkee et al., 2016</xref>) to ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seo-Mayer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although there is a wide consensus on the role of the LKB1-AMPK axis and in particular AMPK's role in reinforcing TJs and preserving cell polarity during adverse environmental changes, it remains largely unknown how this kinase actually accomplishes this. One study suggested that muscle myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) may be the effector of AMPK during energetic stress in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2007</xref>), but those findings have since come into question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shackelford and Shaw, 2009</xref>) because the phosphosites on MRLC do not conform to the optimal AMPK substrate motif found in all other established in vivo AMPK substrates. Furthermore, subsequent studies have demonstrated that the LKB1/AMPK pathway is <italic>not required for</italic> the maintenance of polarity during energetic stress in either flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haack et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mirouse et al., 2013</xref>) or fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">van der Velden and Haramis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">van der Velden et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, despite the fact that it has been a decade since the first studies revealed AMPK's ability to preserve the epithelial architecture and function in the setting of energetic stress, effectors of AMPK that orchestrate these functions have not been identified. Here, we demonstrate that the multimodular polarity scaffold protein GIV (G-alpha interacting vesicle associated protein, a.k.a. Girdin) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), is a novel substrate of AMPK, and define the molecular mechanisms by which the AMPK-GIV signaling axis protects the epithelium by stabilizing TJs and preserving cell polarity when challenged with energetic stress. Findings also reveal how deregulation of this pathway fuels the growth of tumor cells under energetic stress.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20795.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>AMPK binds and phosphorylates GIV at Ser (<bold>S</bold>) 245.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the functional modules of the multimodular signal transducer GIV.

To investigate if AMPK binds GIV, we used two complementary approaches. First, co-immunoprecipitation assays using Cos7 cells expressing myc-tagged AMPKÎ±2 confirmed that GIV co-immunoprecipitates with AMPK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Second, GST-pulldown assays confirmed that the N-terminal 440 aa of GIV [which contains the residue S245] is sufficient for binding AMPKÎ±2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results demonstrate that GIV binds AMPKÎ± both in vitro and in cellsÂ and that the interaction is mediated via GIV's N-terminus.</p><p>To investigate if AMPK phosphorylates GIV, we carried out in vitro and inÂ cellulo kinase assays and generated an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal phosphoS245-GIV antibody to specifically detect the phosphoprotein by immunoblotting. Autoradiographs ofÂ in vitro kinase assays carried out using Î³P-<italic>32 ATP,</italic> recombinant AMPKÎ±2 heterotrimers and bacterially expressed N-terminal fragment (aa 1â440) of GIV showed that AMPK phosphorylates GST-GIV-NT WT (1â440 aa) but not a non-phosphorylatable mutant protein in which the Ser at 245 is mutated to Ala (A) (S245A; henceforth referred to as SA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Identical results were obtained when in vitroÂ kinase assays were carried out as above, except by replacing Î³P-<italic>32 ATP with</italic> non-radioactive ATP and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-pS245-GIV antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The phospho-specific antibody also showed a high degree of specificity; it did not detect non-phosphorylated GIV-WT or the phosphomimicking mutant in which S245 is mutated to Asp(D) (S245D; henceforth referred to as SD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). To confirm if AMPK phosphorylates GIV at S245 in cells, we carried out inÂ cellulo kinase assays in cells coexpressing both GIV-FLAG (substrate) and myc-AMPKÎ± (kinase). Because AMPK is activated by increasing concentrations of AMP during metabolic stress induced by glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hardie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tzatsos and Tsichlis, 2007</xref>), we triggered activation of AMPK by growing the cells in glucose-free medium prior to lysis and by immunoprecipitating GIV and analyzing it for phosphorylation at S245 by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Phosphorylation of GIV at S245 was detected exclusively in the glucose-starved cells expressing GIV-WT, but not in those expressing GIV-SA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). That AMPK is required for phosphorylation of GIV at S245 after energetic stress was further confirmed using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs); such phosphorylation was induced by glucose deprivation in control MEFs, but not in MEFs derived from AMPK-/- mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). These results demonstrate that AMPK phosphorylates GIV at S245 in vitro and in cells. Furthermore, a homology model of GIV's N-terminal sequence bound to the catalytic Î±-subunit of AMPK generated using a previously solved crystal structure of CagA in complex with the AMPK-related kinase, MARK2 [PDB: 3IEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nesic et al., 2010</xref>)], showed that the residues within and flanking S245 and the consensus substrate recognition sequence are compatible with AMPK's ability to bind and phosphorylate GIV at Ser 245 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).</p><p>These findings are in keeping with results from the first large-scale high-throughput (HTP) Mass Spectrometry analysis (LC-ESI-MS/MS) aimed at mapping human protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ewing et al., 2007</xref>) in which GIV co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged AMPK in HEK293 cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ewing et al., 2007</xref>) and two prior HTP MS studies aimed at mapping the human phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schweppe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>) which also reported that S245 on endogenous GIV is phosphorylated in cells. We conclude that GIV is a bonaÂ fide substrate of AMPK and that S245 is a specific substrate site for the kinase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>GIV phosphorylated at S245 localizes to cell-cell junctions</title><p>Next we asked where GIV, and more specifically GIV that is phosphorylated at S245 (henceforth referred to as pS245-GIV), localizes in cells responding to energetic stress. We studied this by carrying out immunofluorescence studies on monolayers of Type II MDCK cells which are a widely used cell-based model system to study epithelial cell polarity, junctional integrity and epithelial morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dukes et al., 2011</xref>). Type II MDCK cells have been used as the primary model system in the initial studies that revealed the role of AMPK in the stabilization of TJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zheng and Cantley, 2007</xref>). While GIV was not detected at cell-cell contact sites in fully polarized domed MDCK monolayers at steady-state under basal (normoglycemic) conditions, it localized transiently to cell-cell junctions during energetic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Active AMPK also localized transiently to cell-cell contact sites exclusively after energetic stress at specialized zones of the TJs, called tricellular TJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). pS245-GIV was not detected at the cell-cell contact sites either inÂ isolated single cells or in fully polarized domed MDCK monolayers under normal glucose conditions, but localized to the cell-cell junctions transiently when single cells assembled junctions during the course of their growth into confluent monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Although pS245-GIV was not detected at the junctions of fully polarized domed monolayers, it was prominently detected once the monolayers were subjected to energetic stress with glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). pS245-GIV was also readily detected at cell-cell junctions when domed monolayers were exposed to low-calcium states with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-chelator EGTA, indicating that such localization is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent. Both conditions, i.e., low-calcium states (EGTA-induced) and energetic stress states (induced by glucose deprivation) were accompanied by activation of AMPK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Using cross-sections of Z-stacked images of MDCK cells treated with EGTA, we confirmed that pS245-GIV colocalizes preferentially with Occludin, a marker of tight junctions (TJs), and only occasionally with Î²-Catenin, a marker of adherens junctions (AJs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These results demonstrate that pS245-GIV preferentially localizes to the TJs and that such localization is seen exclusively during TJ turnover; localization is seen both during TJ assembly as cells come in contact to form a monolayer and during TJ-disassembly as monolayers collapse in response to energetic stress or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-depletion. These findings raise the possibility that pS245-GIV may serve as one of the effectors of AMPK at the TJs which enables the kinase to enhance junctional stability exclusively during stress-induced junction turnover. That little or no pS245-GIV was observed at cell-cell contact sites in fully polarized domed monolayers at steady-state indicates one of the two possibilities: (i) the AMPK-GIV axis, of which pS245-GIV is a product, may not have a role at the TJs under physiologic conditions, but is required to fortify TJs exclusively under conditions of energetic stress, or (ii) pS245-GIV may be required for the maintenance of TJs, but cannot be detected because of rapid dephosphorylation and a short half-life at the junctions. Finally, that GIV-SA expressing cells have normal TEER at steady-state (no energetic stress, normal calcium, normal serum; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), but fail to 'recover' TEER when they are returned to NCM growth conditions after an initial exposure to LCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) suggests that in the absence of the AMPK-GIV axis energetic stress and disassembly of junctions triggered by low calcium may set in motion some yet unknown pathways in an irreversible manner, perhaps culminating in detachment and/or apoptosis.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20795.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>GIV and S245-phosphorylated GIV localize to cell-cell junctions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MDCK cells were grown on glass cover slips, exposed or not to energetic stress (glucose deprivation for 30 and 120 min), and subsequently fixed and stained for total (t) GIV (red) and DAPI (blue; nuclei) and analyzed by confocal microscopy.

Expression of GIV was significantly reduced (~by 80â85%) in Type II MDCK cells, which present 'leakier' junctions compared to Type I MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rothen-Rutishauser et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Despite multiple attempts at depleting the residual low amounts of GIV by shRNA (lentiviral vectors), we failed to generate cell lines stably and reliably depleted of GIV, suggesting that the already low levels of endogenous GIV may be essential for the survival of MDCK cells in monolayer cultures. As an alternative approach, to study how phosphorylation of GIV at S245 affects cell polarity we generated MDCK II cell lines stably expressing FLAG-tagged full length GIV constructs at levels ~ 2 to 3 -fold above the low levels of the endogenous protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>): GIV-WT (which models the physiologic state allowing cycles of phospho-dephosphorylation at S245); the non-phosphorylatable SA (which models the constitutively dephosphorylated state); the phosphomimicking SD mutants (which models the constitutively phosphorylated state at S245). The functional integrity of TJs, as determined by measuring paracellular permeability of ions assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) across fully polarized domed monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) were similar between the parental and various Type II MDCK-GIV stable cell lines at steady-state (normal glucose and calcium); as expected, all of them were significantly 'leakier' than Type I MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

When normocalcemic conditions were restored, MDCK-GIV-WT and SD cells regained their baseline TEER, whereas MDCK-GIV-SA cells did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The MDCK-GIV-SD monolayers also showed a smaller drop in TEER (25%, compared to 50% in MDCK-GIV-WT monolayers) when exposed to EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), whereas the MDCK-GIV-SA monolayers failed to regain their TEER as efficiently as MDCK-GIV-WT cells after a Ca<sup>2+</sup> switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). These findings indicate that although all MDCK-GIV cell lines make stable TJs in normal growth conditions, the MDCK-GIV-SA monolayers are more vulnerable and the MDCK-GIV-SD monolayers are more resilient to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-depletion or energetic stress compared to GIV-WT cells.</p><p>The patterns of vulnerability versus resilience between the MDCK-GIV-SA and SD cell lines were also observed when the morphological integrity of TJs was assessed by immunofluorescence. Under normoglycemic and normocalcemic conditions, MDCK-GIV cell lines were indistinguishable from the parental Type II cells and from each other. They all grew into confluent monolayers of fully polarized cells with intact TJs and AJs, as determined by immunofluorescence studies looking at the localization of Occludin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>), E-Cadherin, ZO-1 or Î²-Catenin (data not shown). However, clear differences emerged when the localization of TJ and AJ proteins were analyzed in these cells after exposing them to conditions that trigger disassembly of cell-cell junctions by either depriving them of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (with EGTA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>) or by subjecting them to energetic stress (by glucose starvation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Both conditions revealed the early disruption of TJs and AJs and increased vulnerability of MDCK-GIV-SA cells compared to control MDCK parental cells or the MDCK-GIV-WT cells. These cells exhibited increased actin remodeling and formed stress fibers compared to control or GIV-WT cells, indicative of junctional instability, loss of polarity and cell-flattening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4âfigure supplement 5</xref>). By contrast, the MDCK-GIV-SD cells were more resilient, in that junctional markers localized to cell-cell junctions despite prolonged exposure to conditions that disrupt junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplements 4</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5</xref>). These findings indicate that an interruption in the AMPK-GIV axis during energetic stress, as modeled in the MDCK-GIV-SA cells in which AMPK cannot phosphorylate S245 on GIV, made junctions more vulnerable, leakier, and triggered loss of cell polarity. Under the same set of conditions hyperactivation of the AMPK-GIV axis, as modeled in the MDCK-GIV-SD cells which mimics constitutive phosphorylation at S245 on GIV, resisted stress-induced loss of junctional integrity and preserved barrier functions and cell polarity in the face of stress. We conclude that phosphorylation of GIV at S245 by AMPK is largely dispensable under normal growth conditions but essential for TJ integrity exclusively during energetic stress. This single phosphoevent not only resists stress-induced junctional collapse, but also favors their reassembly during recovery.</p><p>Because destabilization of the epithelial barrier alters epithelial morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pollack et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roignot et al., 2013</xref>), next we asked if the contrasting junctional properties of MDCK-GIV monolayers affect cell behavior during cystogenesis within <italic>3D Matrigel</italic> cultures; the latter is a stringent assay for testing the integrity of polarity pathways. When cultivated in 3D collagen matrix, which limits the availability of glucose, nutrients and oxygen by diffusion only, MDCK cells with intact polarity pathways form cysts comprised of polarized cells lining a single central lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">O'Brien et al., 2002</xref>). When one or more of the polarity pathways are disrupted, cysts display abnormal features, e.g., deformed or multiple lumens, elongated structures, tubules or other abnormal shapes or sizes. MDCK-parental and MDCK-GIV-WT cells morphed into cysts with a single central lumen and infrequently into small tubular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4GâJ</xref>). MDCK-GIV-SD cells formed cysts that were consistently smaller in diameter (by ~30â40%) with a smooth edged central lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), but with a notable absence of tubular structures. By contrast, MDCK-GIV-SA cells morphed into larger cysts invariably featuring multiple lumens and abundant complex branched tubular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,J</xref>). These data indicate that phosphorylation on GIV S245 is a key determinant of normal epithelial morphogenesis-- phosphorylation favors polarized normal cysts, whereas absence of phosphorylation favors branching tubules and multi-lumen structures that are associated with loss of cell polarity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Stabilization of tight junctions by AMPK requires phosphorylation of GIV at S245</title><p>Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zheng and Cantley, 2007</xref>) have shown that inhibition of AMPK, either by genetic manipulation or by chemicals like Compound C makes TJs vulnerable to disruption, whereas pharmacologic activation of AMPK with AICAR or Metformin stabilizes TJs. We used these modulators of AMPK on the MDCK-GIV stable cell lines to investigate if the previously observed role of AMPK in the protection of epithelial TJs is mediated via its ability to phosphorylate GIV at S245. If such phosphorylation is essential, we expected that pre-treatment of monolayers with AMPK agonists AICAR or Metformin would not protect TJs formed by MDCK-GIV-SA cells no matter how efficiently AMPK is activated. Conversely, we expected that treatment of monolayers with the AMPK inhibitor Compound C would not disrupt TJs assembled by MDCK-GIV-SD cells, in which the need for AMPK has been bypassed by expression of a mutant that mimics constitutive activation of the pathway. We found such is indeed the case because compared to MDCK-GIV-WT cells, the loss of functional integrity of TJs (as determined by a drop in TEER) after short (2Â hr) exposures to Compound C was significantly less in MDCK-GIV-SD cells and greater in MDCK-GIV-SA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). As anticipated, the protective actions of Metformin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) or AICAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) on TJs of cells exposed to low Ca<sup>2+</sup> media was seen in MDCK-GIV-WT, but not in MDCK-GIV-SA cells. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed that the increased susceptibility and resilience of GIV-SA and GIV-SD cells, respectively, to the AMPK inhibitor Compound C correlate with the early and late loss of structural integrity of TJs and AJs, as determined by the loss of localization of junctional proteins from cell-cell contact sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Prolonged exposure of monlayers to Compound C showed that MDCK-GIV-SD cells continue to stay attached as monolayers, long after MDCK-GIV-WT and SA cell lines have detached and floated in clumps of dead cells, indicating that the GIV-SD cell line is relatively insensitive to the AMPK-inhibitor Compound C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The findings in the MDCK-GIV-SA cells indicate that phosphorylation of GIV at S245 is required for the protective actions of AMPK activators on TJ integrity. The findings in the MDCK-GIV-SD cells indicate that phosphorylation of GIV at S245 is sufficient for offering protection against and escaping the disruptive actions of AMPK inhibitors on TJs (see schematic and legend; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Because Compound C, the only available cell permeable effective inhibitor of AMPK can also inhibit other kinases besides AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bain et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vogt et al., 2011</xref>), there is a possibility that GIV may interplay with kinases other than AMPK to maintain TJ integrity. We conclude that pS245-GIV, which is generated only when the AMPK-GIV axis is intact, is both necessary and sufficient to fortify TJs, avoid junctional collapse and preserve cell polarity in the face of energetic stress. We further conclude that a significant part of the junction-stabilizing effects of AMPK agonists AICAR and Metformin during energetic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zheng and Cantley, 2007</xref>) are mediated by AMPK via its downstream effector, pS245-GIV.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20795.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Stabilization of tight junctions (TJs) by AMPK requires phosphorylation of GIV at S245.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MDCK cell lines stably expressing various GIV constructs were grown in Transwell inserts to full confluency into domed monolayers prior to exposing them to Compound C for 1 hr.

We hypothesized that phosphorylation at S245 could impact the functions of one of the two N-terminal modules in GIV that flank this residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): (i) the ~200 aa long hook module which binds microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Simpson et al., 2005</xref>) and (ii) the ~1200 aa long coiled-coil module which mediates homodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>). First, we ruled out a significant impact of phosphorylation at S245 on GIV's ability to homodimerize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Then, we focused on the impact of such phosphorylation on GIV's ability to associate with microtubules. 3D reconstruction of deconvolved confocal images showed that pS245-GIV colocalized with and followed the bundles of polymerized microtubule tracks at the cell-cell borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). More importantly, pS245-GIV exclusively laced those microtubule tracks that ran along cell-cell junctions (arrowheads; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and not those that were found on the free-borders of the cells (arrows; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

We hypothesized that GIV might engage the free C-termini of tubulin monomers, as has been previously demonstrated in the case of the AMPK-substrate CLIP-170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mishima et al., 2007</xref>). We prepared recombinant GST fusion proteins representing the C-terminal ~100 amino acids of Î±- and Î²-tubulin (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods) and used them in GST pulldown assays. These assays revealed that full length GIV preferentially bound the C-terminus of Î±-, but not Î²-Tubulin, and that this interaction is increased during energetic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Using bacterially expressed N-terminal GIV constructs (aa 1â440) that were phosphorylated in vitro with AMPK, we confirmed that the GIVâTubulin interaction has two key properties: (i) it occurs between GIV's N-terminus and prefers the C-terminus of Î±-Tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>); (ii) it requires GIV to be phosphorylated at S245 by AMPK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7AâB</xref>). Tubulin co-sedimentation assays further confirmed that energetic stress favors the association of GIV with polymerized, sedimentable microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7CâD</xref>), and that phosphorylation at S245 (mimicked by the GIV-SD mutation) is sufficient to enhance such association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7EâF</xref>). These findings demonstrate that phosphorylation at S245 by AMPK impacts GIV's ability to bind Î±-tubulin and associate with polymerized microtubules. Taken together with our findings by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we conclude that energetic stress triggers pS245-GIV to specifically bind the junction-associated microtubule tracks. Because AMPK regulates post-translational modifications on the C-terminus of Î±-Tubulin during energetic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herms et al., 2015</xref>) and because it is capable of stimulating microtubule polymerization specifically at the cell periphery [via phosphorylation of the plus end protein, CLIP-170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nakano et al., 2010</xref>)], it is possible that either or both of those phenomena play a role in restricting pS245-GIV to associate exclusively with the junction-associated microtubule tracks. Although further experiments will be needed to shed light on these mechanisms, the results presented in this work and the published literature to date support the following model (see legend <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>): Energetic stress triggers AMPK signaling and phosphorylation of GIV at S245, pS245-GIV localizes to TJs, the N-terminus of GIV binds Î±-tubulin and junction-associated microtubule tracks. It is here that GIV may subsequently impact cell polarity and junctional integrity by assembling various functional complexes with its C-terminus, i.e., by (i) binding the Par3/Par6/aPKC polarity complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ohara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>); (ii) binding and modulating the endocytic trafficking of E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ichimiya et al., 2015</xref>); (iii) linking cadherin-catenin complexes to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Houssin et al., 2015</xref>); and finally, (iv) binding and activating G protein, GÎ±i via its GEF motif and maintaining epithelial polarity through the Par polarity complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>).

Exposure of epithelial cells to conditions that induce energetic stress result in depletion of cellular ATP stores and accumulation of AMP (step 1); the latter activates AMPK kinase (step 2). Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates GIV at S245 (step 3) triggering its localization to the cell-cell junction (TJs) via increased ability to bind TJ-associated microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2007</xref>) (step 4). Once localized to the cell-cell junctions, GIV has been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Houssin et al., 2015</xref>) to bind AJ-localized protein complexes, e.g., Î±- and Î²-Catenins and E-cadherin and links the catenin-cadherin complexes to the actin cytoskeleton (steps 5 and 8).

Most cancers are epithelial in origin, and the loss of cell polarity is a critical step that fuels both malignant transformation and metastatic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Forcet and Billaud, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mirouse and Billaud, 2011</xref>). While activation of AMPK may allow healthy cells to tide over short periods of energetic stress by preserving cell polarity and temporarily restraining energy consumption and growth, tumor cells are known to establish mechanisms to survive prolonged periods of energetic stress by down-regulating AMPK signaling and escaping its restraining influences on growth. To dissect the role of the AMPK-GIV axis, and specifically, pS245-GIV on growth properties of cancer cells, we queried the comprehensive catalogs of genetic mutations identified by genome sequencing, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) databases. A search of both databases revealed that the sequence within and flanking the AMPK-consensus site is frequently mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>). While many of those mutations were predicted by computational modeling to have various degrees of impact on the GIV-AMPKÎ± interaction (see legend, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>), we chose to characterize one recurrent mutation, L249P (four residues downstream from S245) which was found in two different colorectal tumors. The residue L249 is a key part of the consensus sequence (FxR/KxxS/Txxx<bold>L</bold>) that is recognized by AMPKÎ± and likely makes a large contribution to the binding energy because it is predicted to be buried in a hydrophobic pocket on AMPKÎ±. Computational modeling analyses predicted that when L249 is substituted with a Proline (P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) a H-bond between L249 and S184 on AMPK will be lost, the Pro will not be able to sit within the hydrophobic pocket where L249 lies, and instead poses a steric clash (see legend; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Thus, the L249P mutation (henceforth referred to as LP) was predicted to abolish AMPKÎ±'s ability to recognize GIV as a substrate. As predicted, AMPK failed to phosphorylate the GIV-LP mutant as efficiently as GIV-WT either in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) or in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), much like the SA mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). When expressed in MDCK cells, this mutant recapitulated the key phenotypes we observed previously with the non-phosphorylatable GIV-SA mutant, i.e., defective restoration of TJ integrity after Ca<sup>2+</sup> switch, as determined by measurement of TEER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) and defective epithelial morphogenesis, as determined by the formation of abnormal multi-luminal large cysts and abundant tubules in 3D cystogenesis assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). These results demonstrate that the L249P mutant of GIV found in colorectal tumors is not phosphorylatable by AMPK, and its expression in MDCK cells is associated with leakier TJs, disruption of cell polarity and abnormal epithelial morphogenesis.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20795.020</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>An oncogenic non-phosphorylatable GIV mutant reduces junctional stability and favors anchorage-independent growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Homology model of GIV-bound AMPKÎ± is shown on the left.

To test this hypothesis, we generated DLD1 colorectal carcinoma cell lines stably expressing GIV-WT, LP, or the various mutants used in this study and assessed their ability to grow into colonies in a three-dimensional (3D) spatial conformation within soft agar matrix. We chose this cell line because the LP mutant was found in colorectal cancers. The 3D colony-formation assay recreates in culture the typical 3D architecture of the tumor tissue and heterogeneously exposes cancer cells to diffusion-limited glucose, oxygen and nutrients and to other physical and chemical stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weiswald et al., 2015</xref>) at the tumor core during the early periods of avascular growth. We found that compared to parental DLD1 and DLD1-GIV-WT cells, colony formation was enhanced in those expressing the non-phosphorylatable SA or LP mutants but suppressed in the DLD1-GIV-SD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8FâG</xref>). These growth patterns were reversed when tumor cells are homogeneously exposed to unlimited oxygen, nutrients, metabolites, and signaling molecules in 2D anchorage-dependent colony growth assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weiswald et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8HâI</xref>); compared to DLD1-GIV-WT cells, DLD1-GIV-SA and LP cells lost the growth advantage previously seen in 3D and showed reduced 2D growth, whereas the DLD-GIV-SD cells overcame the growth suppressive effects previously seen in 3D and showed enhanced 2D growth. These findings indicate that the growth-enhancing effect of GIV-SA or GIV-LP and the growth-suppressive effect of GIV-SD are restricted to conditions mimicked by anchorage-independent growth in 3D. Those effects were also seen in 3D growth of Ras-transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>), indicating that the AMPK-GIV axis may in part be responsible for mediating the previously observed growth suppressive action of AMPK in this model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Phoenix et al., 2012</xref>). These results indicate that disruption of the AMPK-GIV signaling axis (mimicked by GIV-SA or LP) favors anchorage-independent 3D growth, whereas constitutive activation of the pathway (mimicked by GIV-SD) prevents such growth. We conclude that AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of GIV at S245 restricts epithelial cell growth to anchorage-dependent conditions via its ability to protect the epithelium from stress-induced junctional collapse, but fails to grow without anchorage, presumably because of death (anoikis) when anchorage is lost. Tumor cells expressing GIV mutants that cannot be phosphorylated by AMPK evade this protective mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>AMPK agonists exert their tumor suppressive effects via the AMPK-GIV axis</title><p>AMPK agonists such as Metformin and AICAR inhibit anchorage-independent 3D growth of a variety of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vincent et al., 2015</xref>), e.g., lung, pancreatic, colon, ovarian, breast, prostate, renal cancer cells, melanoma, and even acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shackelford and Shaw, 2009</xref>)]. We asked if the growth suppressive action of AMPK agonists requires an intact AMPK-GIV signaling axis. Anchorage-independent growth assays were carried out using various DLD1-GIV cell lines in the presence of increasing doses of AICAR or Metformin. As expected, both AMPK agonists effectively suppressed the growth of parental DLD1 and DLD1-GIV-WT cells in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9AâB</xref>), whereas the growth of DLD1-GIV-SA and LP cells was only mildly suppressed and only at higher doses. These findings indicate that phosphorylation of GIV at S245 by AMPK is essential for the growth suppressive actions of AMPK agonists. We conclude that anti-proliferative actions of AMPK agonists like Metformin is mediated at least in part via the AMPK-GIV signaling axis. These findings, along with the findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> support the following model: In normal epithelial cells in which the AMPK-GIV axis is intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) pS245-GIV serves as a major effector of AMPK at the TJs, inhibits stress-induced junctional collapse, preserves cell polarity, and the epithelial barrier functions to tide over stress events. Under these conditions, AMPK agonists restrict epithelial cell growth to anchorage-dependent conditions. InÂ tumor cells in which the AMPK-GIV axis is disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>) TJs are vulnerable to stress-induced collapse, cells lose polarity and overcome the need for anchorage for growth. Under these conditions, anchorage-independent growth is favored, which initiates and sustains cancer growth, and AMPK agonists are rendered ineffective.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20795.022</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation of GIV at S245 is essential for the tumor-suppressive actions of AICAR and Metformin.</title><p>(<sc><bold>A</bold></sc>, <bold>B</bold>) Parental DLD1 colorectal cancer cells and those stably expressing GIV-WT and the non-phosphorylatable SA and LP mutant GIV constructs were analyzed for their ability to form colonies in soft agar for 2â3 weeks in the presence of increasing concentrations of AICAR (<bold>A</bold>) or Metformin (<bold>B</bold>).

The first conclusion is that the polarity scaffold protein GIV is a direct target and an effector of the energy-sensing kinase AMPK; phosphorylation of GIV at a single site is necessary and sufficient to mediate the junction-stabilizing functions of AMPK in the normal epithelium. In doing so, this work has revealed an elusive link between the stress-sensing components and the cell polarity pathways (see legend, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), and improved our understanding of molecular mechanisms of how epithelial monolayers are protected despite being constantly bombarded by energetic stressors by fortifying cell-cell junctions against stress-induced collapse. Because GIV serves as a junctional scaffold in both epithelial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>) and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ichimiya et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that the stress-triggered mechanisms outlined here also account for the protective role of AMPK on cell junctions observed consistently in a variety of tissue and cell types, in both epithelial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garnett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Patkee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seo-Mayer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Spruss et al., 2012</xref>) and endothelial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castanares-Zapatero et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takata et al., 2013</xref>) cells, in the face of diverse chemical, bacterial and metabolic stressors. Given the overlapping substrate specificity of AMPK and its related kinases [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shackelford and Shaw, 2009</xref>)], it seems likely that AMPK-related family members such as the MARKs, may phosphorylate S245 on GIV under other conditions or in specific tissues. Because GIV is a GEF for trimeric G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</xref>), and because GIV's ability to trigger GÎ±i signaling is essential for cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that localized GIV-dependent G-protein signaling at the cell-cell junctions triggered by energetic stress may modulate cellular stress response via G-protein intermediates.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20795.023</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>GIV (CCDC88A) functions at the nexus of a variety of cellular pathways that regulate and respond to changes in cell-cell junctions.</title><p>A protein-protein interaction network (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods) shows all known and predicted protein-protein interactions (relevant to the current work), both functional and directly physical in nature, that stem from computational prediction, from knowledge transfer between organisms, and from interactions reported in other (primary) databases. The clusters of functional associations shown here are meant to be specific and meaningful, i.e. proteins jointly contribute to a shared function; this does not necessarily mean they are physically binding each other. The interaction network shows that GIV (CCDC88A) functions as a key polarity-determinant scaffold which links major components that sense cellular energy (STK11, LKB1; PRKA, AMPK) and determine cellular growth and survival responses (on the left) and signaling pathways, e.g., Wnt (top; light blue) and growth factor and integrin pathways (purple; bottom) that dictate anchorage-dependent vs independent growth in normal and transformed cells, respectively, to cell-cell junctions (both tight and adherens; on the right). The microtubule stability determinants (upper left; dark blue) are likely to synergize with the AMPK-GIV axis for protecting junctions against stress-induced collapse. Two previously defined functional interactions of PRKA (AMPK) studied in different contexts stand out as key links: (1) Phosphorylation of the microtubule plus end protein CLIP-170 (CLIP1; deep blue) by AMPK enhances the speed of microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nakano et al., 2010</xref>); and (2) Phosphorylation of the TJ- protein cingulin (CGN; green) by <italic>AMPK</italic> increases the association of plus ends of microtubules with TJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yano et al., 2013</xref>).

These conclusions are in keeping with prior observations that polarity defects precede the onset of tumorigenesis when the LKB1-AMPK pathway is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hezel etÂ al., 2008</xref>), fueling the speculation that polarity defects may be one of the major mechanisms for tumor initiation when the energy sensing pathway is dysregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hezel and Bardeesy, 2008</xref>). Multiple studies on GIV have demonstrated its role as a bonaÂ fide metastasis-related protein across a variety of cancers, primarily via its ability to initiate and amplify tyrosine-based G protein signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aznar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghosh, 2016</xref>) and couple it to actin cytoskeletal remodeling at the leading edge of migrating cells predominantly via interactions mediated by its CÂ terminus [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ghosh, 2015</xref>)]. This study is the first of its kind that reveals the protective role of GIV's NÂ terminus. Because loss of cell polarity is known to impact both early and later steps of oncogenic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wodarz and Nathke, 2007</xref>), it is possible that loss of cell polarity due to the disruption of the AMPK-GIV axis impacts not just the early phases of transformation and cancer growth, but also fuels cancer invasion into adjacent tissues and the formation of metastases.</p><p>The third conclusion is that the AMPK-GIV axis appears to be necessary for at least some of the protective actions of the AMPK agonist Metformin on the epithelium. Metformin (Glucophage), the most widely used type II diabetes drug in the world, reduces blood glucose by activating the LKB1-AMPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shaw et al., 2005</xref>) and inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shackelford and Shaw, 2009</xref>)]. Besides its ability to lower blood glucose, Metformin also exerts two other effects in an AMPK-dependent manner: (i) it stabilizes cell-cell junctions and protects barrier functions of both epithelial and endothelial monolayers in the setting of a variety of pathologic stressors; and (ii) it suppresses the growth of a variety of tumor cells and embryonic stem cells in culture and tumor xenografts in mice [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shackelford and Shaw, 2009</xref>)]. By demonstrating that phosphorylation of GIV by AMPK is required for Metformin to exert both these effects efficiently, this work unravels that activation of AMPK, and more specifically, the AMPK-GIV signaling axis as an important mechanism of action of Metformin. It is noteworthy that although multiple retrospective clinical trials have generally concluded that prolonged use of Metformin reduces the incidence of cancer, others have reported conflicting results, and several prospective clinical trials are underway to identify which target populations may specifically benefit from this drug [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kourelis and Siegel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pryor and Cabreiro, 2015</xref>)]. Given the widespread long-term use of metformin as a prescription drug and its potential utility both in chemoprevention as well as chemotherapy, further studies are warranted to investigate if the GIV-expression status in tumors [e.g., its expression as a spliced isoform lacking the CÂ terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh et al., 2010</xref>) or mutants that prevent phosphorylation by AMPK (current work), or its overexpression as full length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghosh et al., 2016</xref>)] may help identify which patients may benefit from the tumor suppressive actions of the Metformin.</p><p>In summary, this study not only populates the stress-polarity pathway with a new player, i.e., GIV, and reveals how this player and the pathway may be altered in cancers, but also itÂ provides mechanistic insights into the epithelium-protecting and tumor-suppressive actions of one of the most widely prescribed drugs, the AMPK-agonist Metformin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

We used a total of five different cell lines in this work, each chosen carefully based on its level of endogenous GIV expression and the type of assay. AMPK+/+ and AMPK-/- SV40-immortalized MEFs that have been extensively validated in prior publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lamia et al., 2009</xref>) were a generous gift from Katja Lamia (SALK Institute, La Jolla) with permission from Benoit Viollet (Institut Cochin INSERM, France). Parental Cos7, MDCK, NIH3T3 and DLD1 cell lines were obtained from ATCC and cultured at 37Â°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator according to the ATCC guidelines. Briefly, Cos7, NIH3T3 and MDCK cells were grown in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine. DLD1 cells were grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine. Cells were passaged at 90â100% confluency using ATV. All these cell lines were cultured according to the ATCC guidelines, screened for drifting by short tandem repeat (STR) profiling services offered by ATCC for all lines &gt;10 passages, and periodically monitored for mycoplasma infection (once a year).</p><p>Cos7 cells were primarily used to transiently overexpress tagged proteins for use in biochemical studies; lysates of these cells were used as source of proteins in various protein-protein interaction (immunoprecipitation and pulldown) and in cellulo kinase assays. WeÂ use Cos7 cells becauseÂ theyÂ are easy to transfect (&gt; 90% efficiency) with most constructs.</p><p>Type II MDCK cells were primarily used to study the effect of GIV on cell polarity. These cells have been extensively characterized in 2D and 3D cultures to study cell-cell junctions and cell polarity integrity. We determined that levels of GIV are significantly lower (~10 fold) in these cells compared to MDCK type I cells, thereby allowing us to reconstitute GIV expression exogenously and analyze the effect of various mutant GIV constructs without significant interference due to the endogenous protein.</p><p>DLD1 cells were primarily used to investigate the role of the AMPK-GIV axis on growth properties (anchorage-dependent and independent) of colorectal cancer cells. There are several reasons why this colorectal cancer cell line was chosen: (1) We focused on colorectal cancer in this study because the oncogenic mutant we characterized was found in two different colorectal tumors. Thus, DLD1 cells were deemed appropriate for us to translate our findings. (2) These cells have been extensively characterized with respect to most oncogenes (ATCC database), and are highly tumorigenic in 2D and 3D cultures due to a mutation in KRAS (G13D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shirasawa et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>Low-passage NIH3T3 fibroblasts were used exclusively in neoplastic transformation assays to study the role of the AMPK-GIV axis during neoplastic transformation. Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells were used because this is the gold standard assay used to study the role of a gene/protein in tumor transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egan et al., 1987</xref>). Like Cos7 cells, these cells are also highly transfectable (~80% transfection efficiency with GIV-FLAG). Such ease of co-expression, consistently at high levels allows us to study the effect of various mutant GIV constructs on Ras-transformed growth.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Generating bioenergetic stress</title><p>To activate AMPK in various assays, we subjected cells to energetic stress (mimic ATP-depleted state with high AMP/ADP to ATP ratios) by exposing them to glucose-free media for indicated durations as done previously by others [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hardie, 2011</xref>)]. Whenever such energetic stress was used in various assays, activation of AMPK was confirmed by immunoblotting in each instance. Besides glucose deprivation, we also eliminated growth factors/serum in these assays. This is because GIV has been previously implicated as an upstream modulator of growth factor triggered metabolic response, e.g., its ability to modulate mTOR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), regulate the exocytosis of glucose transporters and uptake of glucose into cells responding to insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lopez-Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ma et al., 2015</xref>), as well as its ability to trigger reversal of autophagy in response to growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2011a</xref>). We carried out all energetic stress assays in the absence of serum (which is a source of multiple growth factors) so as to avoid unanticipated and confounding feedback loops (from growth factor receptors to AMPK via GIV) from making interpretation difficult in assays designed to selectively dissect the role of signaling from AMPK to GIV.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Transfection, generation of stable cell lines and cell lysis</title><p>Transfection was carried out using Genejuice (Novagen) for DNA plasmids following the manufacturersâ protocols.

The supernatant was then incubated with 25 ÂµM Docetaxel at 37Â°C for 30âmin in the presence of 1âmM GTP to allow microtubules to polymerize. Microtubules were separated from soluble tubulin by centrifugation at room temperature for 30âmin at 17,000X g. The supernatant, containing soluble tubulin, was collected and supplemented with 5X sample buffer. The pellet, which contained polymerized microtubules, was gently washed with PEM buffer and resuspended in 4X sample buffer in PEM. Protein in the supernatant (S), input (I) and pellet (P) were analyzed by immunoblotting.</p></sec><sec id="s3-19"><title>Interaction network analysis</title><p>Multiple databases of gene or protein interactions, such as those compiled by extensive PubMed search, iRefIndex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Razick et al., 2008</xref>), BioGRID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chatr-Aryamontri et al., 2015</xref>), IntAct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kerrien et al., 2012</xref>), STRING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Szklarczyk et al., 2015</xref>) or GeneMANIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Warde-Farley et al., 2010</xref>) were mined for functional interactomes of the components of the energy-sending pathway (AMPK, LKB1 and the AMPK-related family of kinases) and GIV (ccdc88a). The genes and a subset of their neighbors were then extracted from the databases and reconstructed as an interaction network to highlight the major links between energy-sensing components, the junctional complex-associated genes, and the genes that provide input signals (growth factors, integrins and the Wnt pathway) for the assembly and disassembly of junctions. All splice isoforms, information regarding whether an interaction is stimulatory or inhibitory, or post-translational modifications are collapsed, i.e., each node represents all the proteins produced by a single, protein-coding gene locus, and each link represents some form of functional association.</p></sec><sec id="s3-20"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Each experiment presented in the figures is representative of at least three independent biological repeats (with at least two technical repeats for each condition within each biological repeat). Statistical significance between the differences of means was calculated by an unpaired studentâs t-test. A two-tailed pvalue of &lt;0.05 at 95% confidence interval is considered statistically significant. All graphical data presented were prepared using GraphPad.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Gordon N Gill (UCSD) and Deepali Bhandari (CSULB) for their critical input during the preparation of the manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Johanna Ivaska (Reviewer#1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael J Caplan (Reviewer #2); Tomi MÃ¤kelÃ¤ (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This interesting and well written manuscript describes experiments designed to explore the role of GIV/Girdin in the stabilization of epithelial tight junctions. It has previously been shown that activation of the AMPK kinase both facilitates tight junction assembly and stabilizes tight junctions, enhancing their resistance to factors such as energy deprivation that ordinarily lead to tight junction dissolution. The authors provide evidence indicating that GIV/Girdin is a substrate for AMPK activity. Using antibodies directed against GIV/Girdin and phosphoGIV/Girdin they show that GIV/Girdin and phosphoGIV/Girdin are not present at tight junctions at steady state. Under conditions that produce energy stress or that destabilize junctions, however, phosphoGIV/Girdin accumulates at sites of cell-cell contact. They further report that overexpression of phosphomimetic GIV/Girdin maintains junction integrity and TEER in the face of juncetion-perturbing stimuli, whereas this effect is not seen with overexpression of a non-phosphorylatable GIV/Girdin. The authors suggest that AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of GIV/Girdin constitutes the mechanism through which AMPK mediates its effects on junction stability. They find that phosphoGIV/Girdin is associated in a phosphorylation-dependent manner with microtubules that are organized along cell contact sites, and suggest that this microtubule association may play a role in the effects of GIV/Girdin on junction stability. Some tumors express a mutant form of GIV/Girdin that lacks the AMPK phosphorylation site. The authors suggest that AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of GIV/Girdin may act to link the regulation of cell growth to cell junction stability and that expression of this mutant form of GIV/Girdin might allow tumor cells to grow in an anchorage-independent fashion. They find that expression of phosphomimetic GIV/Girdin prevents anchorage independent growth, whereas expression of non-phosphorylatable GIV/Girdin does not prevent anchorage-independent growth. The data are generally strong and well presented. The figures are clear and well presented. There are, however, several points that should be addressed and questions that need to be answered.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The data shown support the conclusion that Ser245 phosphorylation of GIV plays a role in TJ integrity. However, the current data does not sufficiently demonstrate that the observed TJ regulation by GIV is dependent on AMPK. Furthermore, almost all data relies on overexpression of GIV mutants. The report in whole would be significantly strengthened by providing evidence of endogenous GIV participating in energy stress signaling to tight junctions in an AMPK-dependent manner.</p><p>1) Absence and presence of energy stress and knock-down of AMPK should be shown to demonstrate the role of AMPK and energy stress in phosphorylating GIV S245 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>2) What is the localization of AMPK upon stress, does it translocate to the junctions?</p><p>3) Calcium deprivation / EGTA treatment should be linked to AMPK activity to demonstrate that AMPK-dependent phosphorylation is needed for proper cell contacts.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F and H</xref>. The data should be shown of all mutants and the parental cell line in the presence and absence of energy stress (AMPK activation).</p><p>5) The imaging data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref> provide critical support for the authors' interpretation of the role of GIV/Girdin. It is somewhat disappointing, therefore, that no effort is made to provide any quantitative analysis of these data. It would substantially enhance the impact of these data if the authors provided quantification and statistical analysis of the extent of localization of GIV/Girdin to sites of cell-cell contact under each of the conditions tested. Similarly, a quantitative analysis of the extent of co-localization of GIV/Girdin with occludin and Î²-catenin (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) would be very valuable.</p><p>6) The lack of recovery of TEER in SA cells returned to NCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) is perplexing, since SA cells develop normal TEER at steady state. How do the authors explain this apparent discrepancy?</p><p>7) Similarly, why are SA cells (in which GIV is not available for AMPK phosphorylation) sensitive to Compound C? (5A). This is especially perplexing since the effects of Compound C on occludin localization (5D) are the same in SA and WT. The authors should address this apparent inconsistency. In addition, they should note and acknowledge that Compound C is not highly selective for AMPK and can have off target effects on a number of other kinases.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;AMP-activated protein kinase fortifies epithelial tight junctions during energetic stress via its effector GIV/Girdin&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The report in whole would be significantly strengthened by providing evidence of endogenous GIV participating in energy stress signaling to tight junctions in an AMPK-dependent manner.</italic> </p><p>This comment has two parts. In the first part, we are glad that the reviewers / editors are in agreement that &quot;the data shown support the conclusion that Ser245 phosphorylation of GIV plays a role in TJ integrity&quot;. This is important to us because it is our major claim in this work, and much of our efforts went into comprehensive and conclusive experimentation to test this central hypothesis using multiple complementary approaches, generate phosphospecific Abs, use relevant mutants, etc.</p><p>In the second part, the reviewers/editors have pointed out that a major weakness is the need to overexpress GIV (WT or mutants) in our studies. They rightly point out that the study would be significantly strengthened by testing the role of endogenous GIV at TJs in an AMPK-dependent manner and go on to suggest a few experiments. We agree and have included in this revised submission the experiments suggested (see Responses #1 and #2 below) to implicate endogenous AMPK phosphorylates endogenous GIV under energetic stress, and that endogenous AMPK localizes to the TJs. As for our need to use of exogenously expressed GIV mutants in MDCK cell lines at levels equal amounts of WT endogenous GIV, we had addressed this technical limitation in detail in the subsection âPhosphorylation of GIV at S245 is essential for junctional integrity and epithelial morphogenesisâ explaining why this was done, how we validated the cell lines to confirm that such expression did not affect the functional and structural integrity of junctions at steady-state.</p><p><italic>1) Absence and presence of energy stress and knock-down of AMPK should be shown to demonstrate the role of AMPK and energy stress in phosphorylating GIV S245 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</italic> </p><p>We have now carried out the suggested experiment and included the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> as panel I. Consistent with our prior findings, we confirmed that endogenous AMPK is necessary and sufficient to trigger phosphorylation of endogenous GIV at S245. More specifically, we found that energetic stress (induced by glucose depravation) could trigger phosphorylation of endogenous GIV at S245 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from control mice, but not in MEFs from AMPK knockout littermates (AMPK -/-) [see subsection âAMPK binds and phosphorylates GIV at residue S245â, second paragraph, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend].</p><p><italic>2) What is the localization of AMPK upon stress, does it translocate to the junctions?</italic> </p><p>We have now carried out the suggested experiment. We analyzed total-AMPK and phospho(active)-AMPK in domed monolayers of MDCK cells as they are subjected to energetic stress by glucose deprivation. These conditions mirror the exact conditions showcased in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> [in which we had analyzed the distribution of pS245-GIV]. We found that (phospho)-AMPK was not detected in fully polarized domed monolayers at steady-state grown in the presence of glucose (no energetic stress); however, when domed monolayers are subjected to 6 h of energetic stress [induced by glucose starvation] active AMPK was detected exclusively at the TJs of tricellular contact (tTJs), as determined by colocalization with Occludin where 3 or more cells come in contact. With prolonged energetic stress (i.e., 12 h of glucose starvation) tTJs were the first to disassemble and were associated with a blush of active AMPK. Longer duration of glucose starvation was associated with a loss of any specific signal for active AMPK. In this revised submission, we have now included our findings of localization of phospho-AMPK as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> (see subsection âGIV phosphorylated at S245 localizes to cell-cell junctionsâ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> legend).</p><p>Unfortunately, we could not detect endogenous total AMPK under any of these conditions despite trying various commercially available antibodies. This is perhaps not unexpected because other groups who discovered the role of AMPK as a master regulator of the 'stress polarity pathway' in 2006-2007 [both Cantley and Caplan groups] also did not report the localization of AMPK at junctions.</p><p>We thank the reviewers/editors for this question because the experiments we have carried out have indeed revealed some unexpected new findings in the context of AMPK and raise the possibility that specific cellular components in the found exclusively at the tricellular TJs may either activate AMPK at that location or help localize activated AMPK to that site.</p><p><italic>3) Calcium deprivation / EGTA treatment should be linked to AMPK activity to demonstrate that AMPK-dependent phosphorylation is needed for proper cell contacts.</italic> </p><p>We agree. In this revised submission we added an additional Figure [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>] in which we have displayed the immunoblots corresponding to the immunofluorescence studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. These immunoblots confirm that phosphorlation of GIV at S245 after calcium deprivation (in the presence of EGTA) or during energetic stress (induced by glucose deprivation) is accompanied by phosphorylation and activation of AMPK. See subsection âGIV phosphorylated at S245 localizes to cell-cell junctionsâ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref> legend.</p><p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F and H</xref>. The data should be shown of all mutants and the parental cell line in the presence and absence of energy stress (AMPK activation).</italic> </p><p>In this comment, the reviewer refers to our data [anchorage-dependent and independent growth] on DLD1 colorectal cancer cells. We had compared and contrasted the two modes of growth [in 3D vs. 2D] precisely because one, i.e., 3D growth, but not 2D growth assay is known to recreate in culture the typical 3D architecture of the tumor tissue and heterogeneously exposes cancer cells to diffusion-limited glucose, oxygen and nutrients and to other physical and chemical stresses at the tumor core during the early periods of avascular growth. When we induced further energetic stress [by glucose starvation] of DLD1 cells in 3D growth, this led to complete growth arrest of all GIV-expressing stable cell lines tested, making it impossible to assess differences. This is not unexpected given the fact that these tumor cells, like all others, are chronically energy [ATP] depleted despite ~10-15 fold higher glucose consumption [i.e., Warburg effect]. Therefore, it is not surprising that glucose deprivation was incompatible with growth. We would like to point out that we have indeed carried out the experiment that is proposed here, but using a slightly different approach. Instead of glucose deprivation as a way to activate AMPK in these anchorage-independent growth assays, we activated AMPK with AICAR or Metformin, and those results were showcased in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> (panels 9A and 9B). It is certainly possible that we have misinterpreted the question, and if so, we are willing to explain/respond with further feasible experimentation.</p><p><italic>5) The imaging data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref> provide critical support for the authors' interpretation of the role of GIV/Girdin. It is somewhat disappointing, therefore, that no effort is made to provide any quantitative analysis of these data. It would substantially enhance the impact of these data if the authors provided quantification and statistical analysis of the extent of localization of GIV/Girdin to sites of cell-cell contact under each of the conditions tested. Similarly, a quantitative analysis of the extent of co-localization of GIV/Girdin with occludin and Î²-catenin (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) would be very valuable.</italic> </p><p>In this comment, the reviewer asked us to provide a quantification of some sort for the IF panels showcased in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>. As an example, he/she asked us to assess the extent of colocalization using RGB profiler as we have done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We agree. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> of the original submission, we had presented quantification of colocalization using graphed intensities of 'red' and 'green' pixels using the RGB profile graphical analysis tool on ImageJ. We have now provided the quantitative analysis of the remaining panels listed in this comment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>) and included the additional data in Figure legends for these two panels indicating what% of surface area of how many random fields imaged had the phenotype that is displayed in the Figure panels.</p><p>As for the quantification of the extent of colocalization of total GIV/Girdin in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>, we could not do that reliably and consistently because the currently available anti-GIV antibodies, although able to detect a small pool of GIV at junctions after energetic stress, the signal is faint and seen only transiently amidst a larger pool that is known to be mostly cytosolic [see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>]; such noisy faint signals made quantification of colocalization unreliable and almost impossible. This was the primary reason we invested in generating and validating a phosphospecific GIV antibody that can specifically detect the specialized pool of GIV at the TJs. We have confirmed that both SA and SD mutant GIV cannot be detected with anti-pS245GIV antibody [see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>], and hence, we did not use this antibody in the IF assays characterizing the role of phosphorylation of GIV at TJs using the various cell lines [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>]; instead we just followed the disassembly of junctions using occludin and E-cadherin as markers of TJs and AJs, respectively.</p><p><italic>6) The lack of recovery of TEER in SA cells returned to NCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) is perplexing, since SA cells develop normal TEER at steady state. How do the authors explain this apparent discrepancy?</italic> </p><p>In this question, the reviewer accurately points out that GIV-SA expressing cells have normal TEER at steady-state [no energetic stress, normal calcium, normal serum], but noted that they did not 'recover' TEER when they were returned to normal-calcium growth conditions after an initial low-calcium exposure. We too have been perplexed by this observation. We believe that the prolonged delay in [almost lack of] recovery could be because the cells expressing the non-phosphorylatable GIV-SA mutant is expected to be defective in two conditions where we showed that the AMPK-GIV pathway is triggered: 1) when single cells come in contact and assemble TJs [see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, top two panels]; and 2) specifically at TJs subjected to Calcium or glucose deprivation [see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lower three panels]. So, after the junctions are disassembled in GIV-SA cells [drop in TEER in low-calcium state] single cells must come together in normal calcium medium. However, because these cells are unable to phosphorylate GIV at S245 as single cells come together during the reformation of the monolayer, we believe that some of these cells just detach and die during the prolonged assay period [as seen in IF assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and by light microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>]. We speculate that energetic stress or disassembly of junctions due to low calcium may set in motion some yet unknown pathways in an irreversible manner after junctions are disassembled in the absence of the AMPK-GIV axis [in GIV-SA cells].</p><p><italic>7) Similarly, why are SA cells (in which GIV is not available for AMPK phosphorylation) sensitive to Compound C? (5A). This is especially perplexing since the effects of Compound C on occludin localization (5D) are the same in SA and WT. The authors should address this apparent inconsistency. In addition, they should note and acknowledge that Compound C is not highly selective for AMPK and can have off target effects on a number of other kinases.</italic> </p><p>In this comment the reviewer points to the findings in 5A where we show that the functional integrity of TJs in GIV-SA cells is more significantly impacted after treatment of cells with Compound C than GIV-WT cells [i.e., drop in TEER is more significant]. He/she also rightly points out that in panel 5Dthe effect of Compound C on the structural integrity of TJs and AJs [as determined by IF] looks similar, i.e., in both cases junctional proteins are lost from cell-cell contact sites by 6h after treatment with Compound C. We would like to point out that TEER measurements had to be carried out with shorter periods of incubation [2 h], whereas IF assays were carried out with longer incubation [3, 6, 10 and 20 h]. Shorter incubations were necessary to see the early impairment in functional integrity [TEER] and tease out the differential sensitivity of WT and SA cells. Longer incubations in IF assays that were designed to look at structural integrity of TJs/AJs were more helpful to appreciate the resistance of GIV-SD cells, but were not sensitive enough to see early losses in functional integrity. In order to make sure that readers notice the difference of incubation times [which we mention in the labels for each Figure panel], we have now reinforced the short and prolonged exposures in the subsection âStabilization of tight junctions by AMPK requires phosphorylation of GIV at S245â, just so that readers understand that the data is consistent overall.</p><p>As for the fact that Compound C may have off target effects beyond just inhibition of AMPK, this is a very important point that we have now included in the subsection âStabilization of tight junctions by AMPK requires phosphorylation of GIV at S245â when this compound was used for the first time. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>[â¦]</italic></p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>Data revisions or further clarifications needed for experimental data:</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer point 4:</italic> </p><p><italic>It seems that no revisions were made to this manuscript based on the comments and we apologize if the question was not clear.

The DLD1-GIV-SD cells virtually do not form colonies in 3D anchorage-independent growth assays [please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F-G</xref>]; treatment with AICAR/Metformin did not change that finding. We left out DLD1-GIV-SD from the graphs displayed in 9A-Bto avoid confusing readers because display of the SD data [normalized to untreated, as done for the remaining cell lines] will show that colony growth [~0-4 colonies/well] remain at 100% despite treatment with AMPK agonists.</p><p><italic>Reviewer point 6.</italic></p><p><italic>Please include some of this explanation for this discrepancy (as nicely explained in your response letter) in the manuscript text as you find appropriate.</italic> </p><p>We have now included the stated explanation in the subsection âGIV phosphorylated at S245 localizes to cell-cell junctionsâ.</p><p><italic>Editorial revisions necessary:</italic> </p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>.
