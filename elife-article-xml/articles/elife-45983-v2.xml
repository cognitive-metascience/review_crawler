developing organisms and single cells. In <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> rod-shaped cells, Pom1 kinase forms gradients with maxima at cell poles. Pom1 controls the timing of mitotic entry by inhibiting Cdr2, which forms stable membrane-associated nodes at mid-cell. Pom1 gradients rely on membrane association regulated by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle and lateral diffusion modulated by clustering. Using quantitative PALM imaging, we find individual Pom1 molecules bind the membrane too transiently to diffuse from pole to mid-cell. Instead, we propose they exchange within longer lived clusters forming the functional gradient unit. An allelic series blocking auto-phosphorylation shows that multi-phosphorylation shapes and buffers the gradient to control mid-cell levels, which represent the critical Cdr2-regulating pool. TIRF imaging of this cortical pool demonstrates more Pom1 overlaps with Cdr2 in short than long cells, consistent with Pom1 inhibition of Cdr2 decreasing with cell growth. Thus, the gradients modulate Pom1 mid-cell levels according to cell size.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45983.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All organisms need to know how to arrange different cell types during the development of their organs and tissues. This information is provided by protein concentration patterns, or gradients, that tell cells how to behave based on where they are positioned. The same fundamental principles also work on a smaller scale. For example, although the rod-shaped yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> is a single-celled organism, it uses protein concentration gradients to control its growth and timing of division.</p><p>Before <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells divide, they need to check that they have reached the right size. Several mechanisms contribute to this information. One of them involves a concentration gradient of a protein known as Pom1, which is found on the cell membrane, with more protein at the cell extremities and less towards the middle. Pom1 serves to block the activity of Cdr2 – an enzyme that localizes to the cell middle and controls cell division. An open question has been whether Pom1 levels at the center drop as the cell grows, coordinating growth and division.</p><p>One explanation for how the Pom1 gradient could be regulated is by the removal and addition of phosphate groups. At the cell’s tip, an enzyme removes phosphate groups from Pom1, causing it to bind to the membrane. As Pom1 diffuses along the membrane, it continuously ‘re-phosphorylates’ itself. This promotes Pom1 to gradually detach, restricting it from spreading along the membrane towards the cell middle. Another explanation is that clusters of Pom1, formed at the membrane, help establish a gradient by moving along the membrane at different rates: larger clusters, formed in high concentration areas, move slower than smaller clusters, causing levels of Pom1 to be higher at the tip, and lower towards the middle. Now, Gerganova et al. set out to find which of these two processes contributes more to shaping the Pom1 gradient, and determine where Pom1 acts on Cdr2.</p><p>Gerganova et al. used super resolution microscopy to track individual Pom1 molecules inside yeast cells. This revealed two findings. First, that individual Pom1 molecules do not travel all the way from the cell tip to the center, but ‘hop’ between clusters as they move towards the middle. Second, in longer cells levels of Pom1 on the membrane drop at the center, where Pom1 encounters Cdr2. As a result, Cdr2 will come across higher levels of Pom1 in short cells, but low levels of Pom1 in long cells. This allows Pom1 to act as a measure of cell size, preventing short cells from dividing too soon.</p><p>The role of clusters in creating gradients is not only relevant for yeast cell division. It could potentially apply to the gradients that organize cells and tissues in different organisms. Future work could examine whether similar principles apply in more complex systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>concentration gradient</kwd><kwd>single particle tracking PALM</kwd><kwd>cell size</kwd><kwd>diffusion</kwd><kwd>Pom1 DYRK kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRSII3_160728</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manley</surname><given-names>Suliana</given-names></name><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Sophie G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Advanced microscopy techniques reveal that clusters of Pom1 kinase at the membrane represent the functional unit that shape the concentration gradients and modulate Pom1 mid-cell levels according to cell size.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In many organisms and cell types, graded protein patterns provide positional information. This is true from the smallest bacteria, where polar gradients of protein activity define the position of the division apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kretschmer and Schwille, 2016</xref>), to the largest multicellular organisms, where morphogen concentration gradients define regions of gene expression during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briscoe and Small, 2015</xref>). Although mechanisms of gradient formation vary, in all systems the graded patterns are thought to convey information at a distance from the source.</p><p>In fission yeast, concentration gradients formed by the DYRK-family kinase Pom1 have received considerable attention, due to the role of Pom1 in regulating the timing of mitotic entry and thus cell size at division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>). Pom1 gradients are nucleated at cell poles upon dephosphorylation by a type I phosphatase complex whose regulatory subunit Tea4 is delivered by microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tatebe et al., 2005</xref>). Dephosphorylation of Pom1 reveals a lipid-binding activity that maps to a 200-aa region in its N-terminal half. At the plasma membrane, Pom1 forms small clusters and is thought to laterally diffuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>). It also undergoes autophosphorylation reactions that promote its detachment from the membrane, leading to the graded pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>An interesting feature of Pom1 gradients is a noise correction mechanism that compensates for large variations in protein concentration at the cell poles, which can vary up to fourfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hersch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>). In a simple diffusive gradient, the decay length (the distance at which the concentration is reduced to a certain fraction of its amplitude) is independent of the amplitude at the pole. In contrast, the Pom1 gradient is corrected by varying the slope of the gradient decay: gradients with higher Pom1 concentration have a steeper decay, while those with lower Pom1 concentration have a flatter decay. Two models have been proposed to explain the source of this correction. One model suggests gradient buffering is the consequence of concentration-dependent inter-molecular phosphorylation, which promotes Pom1 detachment from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hersch et al., 2015</xref>). This model also explains the correction for the even larger variations in levels of Tea4 concentration at cell poles. A second model hypothesizes that buffering results from concentration-dependent clustering of Pom1, with higher concentrations leading to larger, slower diffusive clusters, causing a traffic-jam effect at the cell tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>). However, direct experimental evidence testing these models is scarce.</p><p>Pom1 has two physiological functions. First, Pom1 provides spatial information for division site positioning: <italic>pom1∆</italic> cells divide off-center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bähler and Nurse, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bähler and Pringle, 1998</xref>). Second, Pom1 provides temporal information to regulate the timing of mitotic entry: <italic>pom1∆</italic> cells divide precociously at an aberrantly small size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>). For both functions, Pom1 directly phosphorylates the SAD-family kinase Cdr2, but on different residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rincon et al., 2014</xref>). Pom1 function in division site placement likely also involves additional substrates. To delay mitotic commitment, Pom1 phosphorylates the C-terminus of Cdr2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2014</xref>), which antagonizes the activating phosphorylation of the Cdr2 kinase domain by the cytosolic CaMKK Ssp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2014</xref>). Cdr2 localizes at the mid-cell cortex, where it forms large, stable clusters called nodes, which contain many other proteins including a second SAD-family kinase Cdr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morrell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>). The signal relay between Cdr2 and Cdr1 is not yet elucidated, but the output is an inhibitory phosphorylation of Wee1 kinase, which itself exerts direct inhibitory activity on the sole cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kanoh and Russell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Young and Fantes, 1987</xref>). In contrast to the stable Cdr1 and Cdr2 association to the nodes, Wee1 visits are only transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>). These visits increase in frequency and duration as cells grow, consistent with the idea that Wee1 is inactivated in longer cells to permit CDK1 activation and mitotic entry.</p><p>Although genetic and biochemical evidence have firmly established Cdr2 as Pom1 substrate, there has been much debate on where the Pom1-Cdr2 interaction takes place, and whether the strength of this interaction varies in the course of a single cell cycle. Initial work proposed Pom1 gradients as a means to measure cell size, because total fluorescence measurements of Pom1-GFP along cell length revealed higher medial fluorescence in short than long cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>). This led to the model that Pom1 inhibits Cdr2 in short cells, but that inhibition is relieved upon attaining sufficient cell size, thus coupling cell size with mitotic entry. Two lines of evidence indicate that Pom1 activity on Cdr2 indeed varies with cell size. First, the levels of Cdr2 phosphorylation by Ssp1 increase during G2, consistent with a progressive decrease in Pom1-dependent inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2014</xref>). Second, the frequency and duration of Wee1 visits to Cdr2 nodes increase as cells grow, with direct evidence showing that Pom1 suppresses Wee1 visits in short cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allard et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, Pom1 re-localization to cell sides, which is prominent upon glucose starvation, leads to strong mitotic delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kelkar and Martin, 2015</xref>). However, subsequent analyses of cortical fluorescence profiles on confocal mid-plane images failed to detect significant differences in the levels of Pom1-GFP at mid-cell between short and long cells, raising questions about the previously proposed model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pan et al., 2014</xref>). The apparently invariant Pom1 mid-cell levels in cells of various lengths led to the suggestion that Pom1 may control Cdr2 activity elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>), or is not involved in cell size homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pan et al., 2014</xref>), in agreement with the observation that <italic>pom1∆</italic> cells retain homeostatic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wood and Nurse, 2013</xref>). Because the number of Cdr2 nodes at mid-cell increases with cell surface growth, this also led to the suggestion that Cdr2, not Pom1, may be the critical cell size sensor in the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pan et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, there is currently a controversy between the invariant Pom1 levels at mid-cell and the size-dependent effect of Pom1 on Cdr2 function.</p><p>In this work, we have coupled generation of a systematic <italic>pom1</italic> mutant allelic series with a wide range of imaging methods – including single molecule super-resolution PALM (photo-activated localization microscopy) imaging and tracking, confocal and TIRF (total internal reflection fluorescence) microscopy – to obtain quantitative information on the patterning of Pom1 gradients. This enabled three major findings: first, Pom1 gradients are primarily shaped by phosphorylation-mediated detachment with clusters acting as the relevant membrane-associated unit; second, Pom1 regulates Cdr2 for mitotic entry at the mid-cell cortex; third, TIRF imaging reveals significantly higher levels of Pom1 at the mid-cell cortex in short cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Membrane diffusion and dissociation of Pom1</title><p>We investigated the diffusion and membrane dissociation dynamics of single molecules of Pom1 in <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells.

The distribution of Pom1<sup>WT</sup> at cell sides was shifted toward slightly faster diffusion compared with Pom1<sup>KD</sup>. To better understand this difference, we defined two thresholds at D ≥ 10<sup>−1</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s and D ≥ 10<sup>−2</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s, which separate molecules into three sub-populations of fast (<italic>D</italic> ≥ 10<sup>−1</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s), intermediate (10<sup>−2</sup> ≤ <italic>D</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−1</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s) and slow-diffusing molecules (<italic>D</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−2</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Note that in this analysis, all fast-diffusing molecules are also fast-dissociating, but intermediate and slow-diffusing molecules can exhibit either fast- or slow-dissociating behaviors. Interestingly, there was a substantially higher proportion of fast-diffusing molecules for Pom1<sup>WT</sup> than Pom1<sup>KD</sup>, which also on average diffused faster (<italic>D<sub>mean</sub></italic> = 0.31 ± 0.01 µm<sup>2</sup>/s for Pom1<sup>WT</sup> and 0.21 ± 0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>/s Pom1<sup>KD</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). We note that the average diffusion rate of these three populations did not vary along cell length with distance from cell poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These analyses were robust to changes in threshold choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the fast population of Pom1<sup>WT</sup> diffuses faster than Pom1<sup>KD</sup>.</p><p>We then performed the same analysis on Pom1<sup>WT</sup> at the cell pole using cells oriented vertically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, the distribution of diffusion coefficients was shifted toward slower values compared to Pom1<sup>WT</sup> at the cell sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Indeed, when using the same thresholds as above, a much smaller proportion of molecules were fast-diffusing compared with the sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), very similar to the proportion observed for Pom1<sup>KD</sup>. This is consistent with Pom1 being mainly in its dephosphorylated state at the cell pole, in agreement with the presence of the Tea4-PP1 phosphatase at this location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We then tracked the evolution of the number of events along cell length starting from the cell tip. The overall number of events decreased for Pom1<sup>WT</sup> but not Pom1<sup>KD</sup>, consistent with their described localization patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Interestingly, when we considered fast, intermediate and slow populations separately, we found that Pom1<sup>WT</sup> exhibits a change in the relative proportion of molecules: the proportion of fast diffusive Pom1 remained relatively constant all along the gradient, but the proportion of intermediate and slow diffusive Pom1 decreased, resulting in a relative increase in the fast population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). In contrast, the proportions of fast, intermediate and slow diffusive populations of Pom1<sup>KD</sup> remain balanced all along the gradient, leading to a nearly constant ratio.</p><p>In summary, these measurements provide two important insights: First, the measured binding times and diffusion rates indicate that individual Pom1 molecules cover on average a small distance before detaching from the membrane. Let’s consider the fast-diffusing molecules. These represent 4.5% of the population, diffuse on average at 0.31 µm<sup>2</sup>/s and are all part of the 76% of molecules binding the membrane for an average time of 1.1 s. In fact, given the inverse correlation observed between diffusion and binding times, they likely bind the membrane for an even shorter time. From these values, we can estimate a maximum travelled distance of 0.8 µm. Slower-diffusing molecules travel an even shorter distance before detaching. Thus, it is unlikely that individual molecules continuously track from cell pole to cell sides. Second, the shorter binding time of fast-diffusive molecules and their progressive increase in proportion at a distance from the cell pole for Pom1<sup>WT</sup> but not Pom1<sup>KD</sup> suggests the possibility this may be caused by progressive phosphorylation-dependent Pom1 detachment from larger clusters. This led us to examine more closely the mode of Pom1 attachment to the membrane and the role auto-phosphorylation plays to shape the gradient.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Pom1 binds the plasma membrane through two distinct motifs</title><p>Previous work has shown that Pom1 interacts with lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>) and a fragment containing amino acids 305 to 510 can efficiently bind the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, fragment #1).

Truncation of the C-terminal 20 aa (fragment 305-490aa, fragment #2), which cuts into the predicted amphipathic helix, resulted in a strong reduction (though not complete loss; see below) of Pom1 cortical localization. Progressive N-terminal truncations showed that a minimal 468-510aa fragment (fragment #5) containing the putative amphipathic helix was sufficient for membrane binding. In this fragment, converting the hydrophobic Ile494 to the polar, uncharged Asp residue disrupted membrane binding (I494N, fragment #6), indicating that Pom1 binds the membrane through the predicted amphipathic helix. However, the same point mutation in the full 305-510aa fragment (fragment #7) did not disrupt cortical localization, indicating the presence of a second lipid-binding domain. We then mutagenized seven amino acids within the conserved MB1 region to alanine (generating the mutant allele MB1*, fragment #8), which also on its own did not perturb membrane binding. However, combining both the I494N and MB1* mutations within fragment 305–510 yielded a fully cytosolic localization (fragment #9).

Individual I494N and MB1* mutations led to a decrease of fluorescence intensity at the cell tip, which was exacerbated in the double mutant.

The number of tracks was not sufficient to determine the residence time of any slower-dissociating population with confidence. Thus, consistent with the fact that only some of the auto-phosphorylation sites are mutated in this allele, Pom1<sup>3A</sup> molecules bind the membrane longer than Pom1<sup>WT</sup>, but not as long as Pom1<sup>KD</sup>. The distribution of diffusion coefficients was also intermediate between Pom1<sup>WT</sup> and Pom1<sup>KD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The thresholds defined above (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) similarly showed a lower proportion of fast-diffusing molecules than Pom1<sup>WT</sup> but a higher proportion than Pom1<sup>KD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data are consistent with auto-phosphorylation promoting Pom1 detachment from the plasma membrane.</p><p>To assess phosphorylation-dependent gradient shape changes in a simplified system containing a single membrane-binding site, we used the Pom1<sup>MB1*</sup> mutant. This mutant binds the membrane solely with its amphipathic helix, which contains only phospho-sites 4 and 5. Consistent with poorer membrane binding, Pom1<sup>MB1*</sup> gradient profiles showed decreased intensity compared to wildtype, at both cell poles and cell sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Mutagenesis of phospho-site 5, generating Pom1<sup>MB1*-1A</sup>, led to further gradient flattening with decreased Pom1 intensity at cell tips and increase at cell middle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, autophosphorylation regulates each of the two membrane-binding sites.</p><p>The progressive increase in medial cortical Pom1 levels in the phospho-site allelic series is consistent with the previously proposed idea that sequential phosphorylation events provide a timer function for Pom1 diffusion from cell poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, non-phosphorylated Pom1 alleles may directly bind the membrane at the cell sides. To test the second scenario, we monitored the localization of the allelic series in <italic>tea4∆</italic> cells, which lacks the phosphatase regulatory subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez-Tabarés et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>tea4Δ</italic> cells, all Pom1 phospho-mutants bound the cortex nearly uniformly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, bottom row), with levels that increased with the number of phospho-site mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>, right panels), and a concomitant decrease in Pom1 cytosolic levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Again, Pom1<sup>5A</sup> cortical levels were indistinguishable from Pom1<sup>6A</sup>, but a little lower then Pom1<sup>KD</sup>, for unknown reasons. These data are in agreement with the idea that each phosphorylation event progressively lowers membrane affinity to reduce Pom1 binding in the medial region. We note that changes in Pom1 distribution in the phospho-site mutants are not due to a change in Pom1 protein concentration, as verified by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Comparing Pom1 medial cortical levels in WT and <italic>tea4∆</italic> cells showed significantly lower amounts for Pom1 and Pom1<sup>1A</sup> in <italic>tea4∆</italic>, but higher or similar levels for Pom1<sup>2A</sup>, Pom1<sup>3A</sup> and Pom1<sup>5A</sup>. This suggests that the flatter gradients observed in the Pom1 phospho-mutants are not only due to a reduction of Pom1 detachment from the membrane, allowing lateral diffusion over a longer distance, but also to an increase in Pom1 attachment to the membrane at mid-cell. Thus, Pom1 auto-phosphorylation both favors its detachment from, and prevents its attachment to, the membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Pom1 phospho-mutants have reduced gradient shape robustness</title><p>A key feature of the Pom1 gradient is its robustness to variations within the system. Previous work showed that variability in Pom1 concentration at cell poles is counteracted by varying the gradient decay length, which leads to a strong negative correlation between decay length and Pom1 amplitude at the pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hersch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>). Pom1 clustering and Pom1 inter-molecular phosphorylation have both been theoretically proposed as source for this correction, though we so far lack experimental evidence. We assessed the contribution of the multi-phosphorylation reaction in gradient buffering by plotting the correlation between decay length and amplitude at the pole in Pom1 phospho-mutants that retain significant pole enrichment. Pom1<sup>1A</sup>, Pom1<sup>2A</sup> and Pom1<sup>3A</sup> all showed a loss of negative correlation of decay length to Pom1 concentration at the cell tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, these Pom1 mutants poorly correct intrinsic variations of Pom1 concentrations at the cell tips. Another evidence for buffering comes from the steep decrease in the coefficient of variation of Pom1<sup>WT</sup> from the cell tip to the cell middle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hersch et al., 2015</xref>). While we confirm this observation with our current data set, the decrease in the coefficient of variation at cell tips and cell sides is much smaller for Pom1<sup>1A</sup>, Pom1<sup>2A</sup> and Pom1<sup>3A</sup> (from 9.6-fold for Pom1<sup>WT</sup> to 6.6 for Pom1<sup>1A</sup>, 5.8 for Pom1<sup>2A</sup>, and 4.2 for Pom1<sup>3A</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We conclude that the Pom1 phosphorylation cycle directly contributes to Pom1 gradient shape robustness.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Pom1 at the mid-cell cortex controls cell length at division</title><p>One important physiological role of Pom1 is to set cell size at division by negatively regulating the SAD-family kinase Cdr2, which forms stable cortical nodes at mid-cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>).

Cell length at division was strongly correlated with the medial cortical Pom1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), consistent with the idea that medial Pom1 levels set the cell division size. To evaluate the relative contributions of cytosolic and cortical Pom1 in Cdr2 inhibition, independently of gradient formation, we obtained the same measurements in <italic>tea4∆</italic> cells: the progressive increase in cortical Pom1 in Pom1 phospho-mutants also correlated with an increase of cell length in <italic>tea4Δ</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). We note that <italic>tea4∆</italic> cell lengths were slightly longer than WT for <italic>pom1</italic> alleles containing up to three phosphosite mutations.

To test the method’s sensitivity and selectivity for cortical signals, we first compared the fluorescence levels of Pom1<sup>WT</sup>, Pom1<sup>1A</sup>, Pom1<sup>3A</sup> and Pom1<sup>5A</sup> phospho-mutants, which reproduced the increased Pom1<sup>1A</sup>, Pom1<sup>3A</sup> and Pom1<sup>5A</sup> medial cortical localization seen by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Specific measurements of cluster size and intensity also showed higher values for Pom1<sup>3A</sup> and Pom1<sup>5A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We then imaged two cytosolic proteins. First, cytosolic GFP, expressed under the <italic>pom1</italic> promoter, could not be detected by TIRF though it was seen by epifluorescence, confirming that the evanescent field detects only cortical molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). By contrast, Pom1-GFP in <italic>tea4∆</italic> cells, which by confocal microscopy is not detected at the cortex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kokkoris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Padte et al., 2006</xref>), revealed a cortical signal by TIRF imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In <italic>tea4∆</italic>, Pom1 formed cortical clusters, though cluster number, size and intensity were lower than in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), which likely explains why the cortical Pom1<sup>WT</sup> signal in <italic>tea4Δ</italic> is virtually indistinguishable from the cytosolic signal by confocal microscopy. Thus, very transient encounters of Pom1 at Cdr2 nodes at the cortex, rather than a fully cytosolic Pom1, could account for the longer size of <italic>tea4∆</italic> cells noted above. We conclude that TIRF provides a highly specific and sensitive imaging setup for Pom1 clusters at the yeast cortex.</p><p>In TIRF timelapse imaging, Cdr2-GFP formed stable nodes at mid-cell, which did not move substantially over 60 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allard et al., 2018</xref>), whereas Pom1-GFP clusters were highly dynamic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Fast 100 ms acquisition intervals were used to monitor Pom1 clusters, which exhibited an array of dynamics with clusters moving laterally, splitting or merging. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref> provide representative examples. Example one shows an initial large cluster that splits in two at 3.0 s, remerges, and splits again at 4.4 s. Clusters 4 and 5 provide a second example of a small cluster moving laterally and merging with a larger one. Another common cluster dynamic is exemplified by clusters exhibiting dimming and/or dispersal of signal, followed by an immediate increase in fluorescence. This behavior can be seen in example 2 between times 0.0 s and 0.3 s, 1.8 s and 2.1 s, and 2.2 s and 2.5 s, the latter one dimming to only a few detectable fluorescent pixels. Note that the detection threshold was set at a value higher than the fluorescence levels measured in a strain not expressing GFP (see Materials and methods). Similarly, example three dims and regains fluorescence between 2.1 s and 2.6 s, and 3.2 s and 4.0 s. It then completely disappears at 7.0 s. There were also many instances where the Pom1 signal was too fluid to unambiguously follow individual clusters over time. These fluctuations in the fluorescence signal of individual clusters indicate that clusters often recombine and can gain and loose individual Pom1 molecules over time.

This value is very likely to be under-estimated as the longest-lived clusters were present from start to end of the time-lapse imaging. These values are higher than previous measurements obtained by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>), probably because of the higher sensitivity of TIRF imaging. They are also substantially longer than the binding time obtained by PALM imaging for individual molecules (around 1 to 3 s, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These observations further support the idea that individual Pom1 molecules turn over within single clusters. Therefore, we propose that Pom1 clusters are the functional units shaping the gradient, as their longer residence time would permit diffusion from the cell pole all the way to the zone of action at mid-cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Pom1 overlaps more with Cdr2 in short than long cells</title><p>To investigate the Pom1-Cdr2 interaction at the cortex, we acquired Pom1 TIRF images at 1 s interval for 60 s and took snapshot TIRF images of Cdr2 at the start and end of the imaging period in a dual tagged Pom1-GFP Cdr2-tdTomato strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

The values for cells of intermediate length (9 to 11 µm) were more variable, probably depending on the average length of these cells. We observed a similar pattern in the duration of Pom1-Cdr2 encounters, which we defined as the length of time the Pom1-GFP value at a Cdr2 node remained above a defined fluorescence threshold: In short cells, a higher proportion of Cdr2 clusters were continuously occupied by Pom1 over the 60-s imaging period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

In this work we provide evidence for unified models on these two subjects. We confirm experimentally that the buffering of the Pom1 concentration gradient relies on its multi-phosphorylation reaction and establish that Pom1 molecules turn over within membrane-bound clusters. The claim of Pom1 gradients serving as a measure of cell length was originally tempered by further investigations that did not detect differences in Pom1 levels at mid-cell. By specifically imaging the relevant pool of Pom1 at the mid-cell cortex, we now unequivocally show that Pom1 gradients formed by diffusion of Pom1 clusters reach the middle of short but not long cells.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Pom1 clusters as diffusion unit to shape gradients</title><p>The Pom1 gradient forms upon local dephosphorylation of Pom1 at the cell pole, promoting Pom1 membrane binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>). Previous modeling work demonstrated that the multi-phosphorylation reaction Pom1 undergoes prior to its membrane detachment could provide a timer function for Pom1 lateral diffusion and serve as a buffering mechanism for the gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hersch et al., 2015</xref>). An alternative model proposed that differential diffusion coefficients of Pom1 clusters of varying sizes underlie the buffering of the gradient with the largest clusters causing a ‘traffic jam’ event at the cell tip, which is relieved by the progressive fractionation and the subsequent increase in diffusion coefficients of smaller clusters away from the gradient source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>). The data presented here integrates these two mechanisms in a single model for Pom1 gradient formation. Single molecule measurements by PALM imaging show that the gradient is comprised of molecules with a wide distribution of diffusion coefficients. Their dissociation dynamics also revealed at least two populations with distinct binding times. Note that the fast-dissociating population is not identical to the fast-diffusing one. However, there is an overall inverse correlation between binding times and diffusion rates, such that fast-diffusing molecules are also binding the membrane only for a short time. These may represent individual Pom1 molecules not associated with a cluster or in small clusters, and are a minority of all Pom1 molecules. The slower-diffusing molecules may be part of larger clusters. Many of these molecules detach from the membrane slower, but a large pool also exhibits fast dissociation, perhaps indicating peripheral association with the cluster. Importantly, the diffusion coefficients and binding times reveal that individual molecules (in a cluster or not) will only travel a maximum distance of 0.8 µm before detaching from the plasma membrane. Thus, a Pom1 molecule binding at the cell tip upon dephosphorylation by the Tea4-PP1 complex travels only a short distance and does not reach the cell middle.</p><p>By contrast, Pom1 clusters as a whole are longer lived at the plasma membrane. Clusters appeared very dynamic, changing intensity over time, splitting, dispersing and fusing again. Importantly, TIRF measurements easily identified cluster lifetimes of over 8 s. This longer lifetime of clusters at the plasma membrane indicates that individual molecules exchange within a cluster. Specifically, this suggests that existing clusters must be able to bind Pom1 molecules directly from the cytosol. In TIRF imaging, we indeed found examples of isolated clusters whose fluorescence intensity diminished before increasing again, providing support for this idea. These longer lifetimes are consistent with clusters being able to form at the cell pole and diffuse laterally all the way to mid-cell, at least in short 7–8 µm cells. Thus, we propose that Pom1 clusters are the functional units that shape the graded distribution of Pom1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Pom1 phosphorylation shapes the gradients</title><p>The phospho-site mutant allelic series shows that Pom1 distribution critically depends on auto-phosphorylation. Indeed, progressive alanine substitution at up to five auto-phosphorylation sites causes progressive flattening of the Pom1-graded distribution, with apparently additive contribution of each phosphorylation event. Because the five phosphorylation sites all map very close to each other within two adjacent membrane-binding motifs, it is likely that they have to be phosphorylated sequentially, extending the time frame between the dephosphorylation event taking place at the cell pole and the full auto-phosphorylation, promoting membrane detachment.</p><p>Each phosphorylation event reduces the affinity to the plasma membrane, likely affecting both k<sub>off</sub> and k<sub>on</sub>. Indeed, our PALM data shows that the k<sub>off</sub> of single Pom1 molecules is modulated by their phosphorylation status: Pom1<sup>KD</sup>, which is not phosphorylated binds the plasma membrane longer than the partly dephosphorylated Pom1<sup>3A</sup>, which itself binds longer than Pom1<sup>WT</sup>. Similarly, alanine-substitutions of phospho-sites led to a progressive increase in the membrane-associated Pom1 fraction in <italic>tea4∆</italic> cells, with a fold-change larger than the one measured for the k<sub>off</sub>. This suggests that, although not directly measured, the k<sub>on</sub> of Pom1 to the plasma membrane is also modulated by phosphorylation, which decreases the membrane association rate.</p><p>Phosphorylation may also modulate cluster formation. Clusters formed in all the Pom1 mutant alleles studied here, and exhibited a similar wide range of diffusion rates in Pom1<sup>WT</sup>, Pom1<sup>3A</sup> and Pom1<sup>KD</sup>, suggesting – if we make the validated assumption that cluster size influences diffusion rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>) – a similar range of cluster sizes. Thus, dephosphorylated Pom1 efficiently forms clusters. Phosphorylated Pom1 may form clusters less efficiently, as Pom1<sup>WT</sup> forms smaller clusters in <italic>tea4∆</italic> cells. We note that it is unclear whether Pom1 is fully phosphorylated in this mutant, or whether it may be inefficiently dephosphorylated by the still present PP1 catalytic subunit lacking the Tea4 regulatory subunit. Previous data had indeed shown that Pom1 dephosphorylation does not strictly require Tea4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kokkoris et al., 2014</xref>). In either case, the data indicate that dephosphorylation at the cell pole also promotes clustering, which may be further favoured by the direct binding with Tea4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hachet et al., 2011</xref>). We note that it may be impossible to fully dissociate cluster formation from membrane binding.</p><p>The comparison of Pom1<sup>WT</sup> and Pom1<sup>KD</sup> reveals three important differences. First, the diffusion rates of Pom1<sup>KD</sup> at cell sides were similar to those of Pom1<sup>WT</sup> at cell poles, consistent with local dephosphorylation of Pom1 at this location. Second, on cell sides the fast pool of Pom1<sup>WT</sup> molecules was more abundant and diffused faster than Pom1<sup>KD</sup>. This suggests that, by reducing the electrostatic interaction with neighbouring phospholipids, auto-phosphorylation promotes faster mobility of individual Pom1 molecules. Finally, the proportion of single Pom1 molecules increased with distance from cell poles in Pom1<sup>WT</sup> but not Pom1<sup>KD</sup>. These observations are consistent with progressive phosphorylation-induced dissociation of Pom1 from the membrane and/or clusters.</p><p>From these data, we propose a revised model on how the specific gradient shape is achieved. Localized Tea4-PP1 phosphatase activity at cell poles dephosphorylates Pom1, revealing two membrane-binding domains – an amphipathic helix and an adjacent positively charged region – both of which permit the association of Pom1 with the plasma membrane. Pom1 dephosphorylation also favors the formation of clusters at the membrane, which helps carry Pom1 over a longer distance. Within a cluster, individual Pom1 molecules have a short lifetime of 1 to 3 s on average, but new Pom1 molecules join from the cytosol. As clusters split and merge, this permits the transport of single molecules from cluster to cluster. The clusters may diffuse at different rates, either because they are of different sizes and therefore contain different numbers of membrane-binding sites, or because each membrane binding site may be differently phosphorylated and thus bind the membrane with distinct affinity. Indeed, as Pom1 is active on itself, aging clusters become more phosphorylated, which promotes dissociation from the cluster and from the membrane to single molecules. Even though single molecules are present at the membrane a long distance from the poles, their binding is short-lived, detaching from the membrane within 1 s. Thus, clusters act as a diffusion unit, whose regenerating capacity is reduced via progressive auto-phosphorylation with time/distance from the cell pole.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Pom1 medial cortical levels control mitotic commitment and vary with cell size</title><p>One physiological function of Pom1 is to prevent the activation of Cdr2 kinase. Our data clearly establish that the meaningful levels of Pom1 are those at the mid-cell cortex, where Cdr2 forms nodes. Indeed, we see a strong correlation between cell size at division (the phenotypic outcome of Cdr2 regulation) and Pom1 medial levels in both WT and <italic>tea4∆</italic> cells. By contrast, the correlations between cytosolic or cell pole levels of Pom1 and cell length are inconsistent in WT and <italic>tea4∆</italic> cells, excluding the alternative models that Pom1 may act on Cdr2 at cell poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>) or in the cytosol. These data agree with the extended size of cells overexpressing Pom1 or mis-targeting it to the medial cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>). They also agree with the strong cell lengthening effect of naturally re-distributed Pom1 upon glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kelkar and Martin, 2015</xref>). Our new observation that <italic>tea4∆</italic> cells have significant cortical Pom1 signal also fits with the idea that Pom1 remains active on Cdr2 in this mutant as manifested by the longer size of <italic>tea4∆</italic> than <italic>pom1∆</italic> (this work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>). In this mutant, abundant cytosolic Pom1 likely allows substantial stochastic encounter with, and binding to, the plasma membrane. We note that the phospho-mutant Pom1 alleles did not cause noticeable changes in the position of the division site. This is in agreement with the finding that the two functions of Pom1 in controlling positioning and timing of division are separable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>). This also indicates that a graded Pom1 distribution is less important for division site placement, consistent with observations in <italic>S. japonicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kinnaer et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although Pom1 mid-cell levels clearly correlate with cell size at division in various mutant and environmental conditions, a key unresolved and debated question has been whether Pom1 levels vary during the growth of a single cell, and therefore whether Pom1 may contribute to cell size homeostasis. The higher sensitivity and specificity of TIRF imaging now allows to answer this question unequivocally: there is more Pom1 at the mid-cell cortex of small than long cells. We considered the possibility that this higher concentration may be a simple consequence of cell extension. However, a fission yeast cell doubling in length increases its volume about 1.1-fold more than its surface. Thus, considering a constant Pom1 concentration and an invariant average gradient shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>), a higher number of Pom1 molecules have less membrane space at their disposal, which would lead to higher Pom1 concentration at mid-cell in longer cells. Because we observe the opposite, the increased mid-cell levels of Pom1 in short cells must be due to Pom1 gradients extending into mid-cell of small but not long cells. The diffusion rates and cluster lifetimes we have measured are consistent with this scenario. These may be tuned to allow Pom1 diffusion over 3–4 µm distance, sufficient to reach the middle of short, but not long cell, which underlies the difference in Pom1 mid-cell cortical levels in cells of different sizes. Thus, the graded Pom1 distribution is able to convey information in a manner dependent on distance from the source.</p><p>These findings poise Pom1 to function as a sensor of cell dimension that provides more inhibition on Cdr2 in short than long cells. This proposition is consistent with biochemical data that Cdr2 activating phosphorylation, which Pom1 counteracts, increases with cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2014</xref>) and that Cdr2 is more active in long than short cells, as measured by the number of visits by the Wee1 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allard et al., 2018</xref>). It is also consistent with Pom1 function being exquisitely dose-dependent, both in terms of global levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>) and specifically at the mid-cell cortex (this work). Pom1 likely exerts its inhibitory action primarily on short cells, when its medial concentration is highest. Indeed, blocking Pom1 activity leads to precocious mitosis in short cells lacking other forms of length control, but not in otherwise wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>). Pom1 may not be the only sensor protein in the pathway: Cdr2 was also proposed to monitor cell surface area through a dynamic exchange of molecules between the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane to form medial nodes whose numbers increase with cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Facchetti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pan et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, cell growth, by both promoting a decrease in Pom1 levels and an increase in the number of Cdr2 nodes at mid-cell, enhances the activation of Cdr2 in long cells. As mutants in both Pom1 and Cdr2 retain cell size homeostasis, cells likely have secondary sizer mechanisms, perhaps monitoring different geometrical quantities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Facchetti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wood and Nurse, 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, media, and genetic approaches</title><p>Standard methods of <italic>S. pombe</italic> culturing and genetic manipulations were used.

Cells were imaged in two channels: the fluorescence channel for precise tracking of single Pom1 molecules and the phase contrast channel for cell segmentation and determination of the membrane plane. In order to selectively image Pom1 at the membrane, we used astigmatic imaging to encode the axial position of single molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2008</xref>). This leads to a change in the shape of the point spread function of molecules not in focus (from circular to elongated), allowing to discard them from the analysis. In a post-processing step, we analyzed single molecules which were at axial positions ranging from −200 nm to +200 nm (with 0 corresponding to the plasma membrane position), eliminating signal detected off the membrane. A z-calibration was performed by taking sequential images of 0.1 µm fluorescent beads (Invitrogen TetraSpeck), displacing the objective by 20 nm steps over an axial range of 1 µm.

Briefly, bead images were localized in 2D and then used to define a rigid transform using a custom MATLAB script. This transformation was then used to map the fluorescence channel onto the phase contrast channel. Second, the center-line of the cell were defined manually using MATLAB’s’ imline’ function, with line extremities corresponding to the poles x,y positions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Dissociation and bleaching rate extraction and analysis</title><p>The tracking, dissociation and diffusion analysis was performed with custom MATLAB script to extract and study the diffusion and dissociation dynamics.</p><p>The recorded molecule trajectories provide an apparent dissociation rate (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) which is the result of both the molecule photobleaching (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) and the actual dissociation rate (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) contributions.

The same settings were used to compare the distributions of Pom1-GFP and Pom1-mEos3.2. For cell length measurements, cells were stained with calcofluor and imaged with a Leica epifluorescence microscope (60X magnification). TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) was performed on a DeltaVision OMX SR imaging system, equipped with a 60 × 1.49 NA TIRF oil objective (oil 1.514), an illumination pathway for ring-TIRF and a front illuminated sCMOS camera size 2560 × 2160 pxl (manufacturer PCO).

For the phosphosite mutant allelic series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), 240 gradient profiles per strain were generated (n = 3 experiments, 60 cells). 160 gradient profiles were generated for Pom1<sup>MB1*</sup> and Pom1<sup>MB1*-1A(5)</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) from n = 2 experiments, 40 cells. The profiles were aligned to gradient maximum intensity value at the cell tip, averaged per strain and plotted against distance from the cell pole. The three individual experiments are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. For the quantification of Pom1 intensity levels at cell middle, the average value over the medial-most 1.5 μm of the gradient tails of each individual gradient was calculated and presented as boxplots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We developed a simple MATLAB script to extract decay length (Suppl. Info 1). Briefly, all 240 gradient profiles were aligned to the maximum value at the cell pole and smoothed with a Gaussian filter as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hersch et al., 2015</xref>). The profiles were binned by 5% and the first 0.5 μm of the profile values were deleted to avoid the effect of the gradient plateau at the cell pole. The decay length was obtained as the slope of the linear regression on the log of the binned average profiles and plotted against the log of the Pom1 amplitude at the pole. For the correlation plot between cell pole intensities to cell length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the intensity at cell pole was calculated as the average values from the first 0.83 μm of individual gradient profiles aligned to the maximum value at cell poles. For the quantification of cytosolic Pom1 fluorescence intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), the cytosolic signal was quantified per cell from n = 3 independent experiments, total of 50–60 cells.

Cells imaged at a medial plane. Individual lengths were recorded and presented as boxplots. For correlation plots to Pom1 levels at cell middle or at the cell pole, averages were calculated for each strain.</p><p>To quantify Pom1 cluster area and intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), we drew ROIs around 323 individual clusters from 26 wild type cells and 197 individual clusters from 25 <italic>tea4Δ</italic> cells in ImageJ (NIH). The quantification was done on the image of the first time point from a 60-s imaging period. The cluster area and intensity for phosphomutants Pom1<sup>1A</sup>, Pom1<sup>3A</sup>, and Pom1<sup>5A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>) were quantified in the same manner for 37–42 individual cells from three independent experiments. The number of quantified clusters is listed in the figure. For the quantification of cluster duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), raw TIRF images were corrected for bleaching with the EMBL tool CorrectBleach and further smoothed in ImageJ. Clusters were then tracked individually for the duration of the 8 s imaging period. Fluorescence quantifications from TIRF imaging for global Pom1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) were performed by drawing a 45-pixel wide ROI across the entire detectable TIRF signal per cell. To generate two gradient profiles, one from each cell tip, the geometric middle of the cell was used for alignment. To measure intensities at cell middle, the values from the last 1.5 μm of each gradient were averaged. The same method was used for the quantification shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. For quantification of local Pom1 levels at Cdr2 nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), a nine-pixel ROI was drawn around Cdr2-tdTomato nodes and used to detect signal in the Pom1-GFP channel. Control ROIs of the same size were shifted to the immediate vicinity of a Cdr2 node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Data corrections were done for background camera noise for each individual image and for bleaching. To estimate the average encounter duration, we recorded the length of time the Pom1 signal at a given node was above a defined fluorescence threshold. The threshold choice was instructed by the minimum detectable signal in that experiment. In all cases that threshold was higher than the fluorescence levels measured in the GFP channel using a strain that did not express GFP, in which Cdr2-tdTomato was used to identify the TIRF focal plane and the ROIs of interest. The exact subtracted arbitrary value is indicated in figure legends. Note that the difference observed between short and long cells was robust to changes in threshold choice.</p><p>All boxplots plotted using the BoxPlotR web-tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://shiny.chemgrid.org/boxplotr/">http://shiny.chemgrid.org/boxplotr/</ext-link>) with definition of whisker extend by Tukey.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Western blot</title><p>Yeast cultures were grown in YE medium at 30°C to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.8, collected by centrifugation at 3000r ≤ m at 4°C for 5 min and washed with 1x CXS buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 0,20 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA pH7.5 containing an anti-proteolitic tablet (Roche, Ref 05892791001). Lysates were obtained via mechanical breakage with acid-treated glass beads (Sigma), using a BeadBeater homogenizer for 10 repetitions at 4.5V of 30 s on, 30 s off on ice cycles. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and extracts were recovered by pipetting into a new tube. Protein concentration was determined via spectroscopy using Bradford reagent. 270 μg of proteins were loaded per sample on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred via wet Western blot transfer. 1° antibodies used: α-GFP 1:1000 dilution (Mouse, Roche, Cat.No. 11814460001), α-Tubulin (TAT1, Mouse, 1:5000 dilution), 2° antibodies α-mouse (HRP detection, Promega, W4021). The mean intensity quantification of 4 independent experiments is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>. Before averaging, values were corrected for the corresponding background and presented as a ratio of α-GFP to α-tubulin signal.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr Marileen Dogterom (TU Delft) and her group for providing the mask for photolithography for the fabrication of the micro-hole, Aster Vanhecke for assistance with processing of some of the tracking data, and Dr Aleksandar Vjestica and Dr Magdalena Marek for gifts of plasmids and strains.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Multi-phosphorylation reaction and clustering tune Pom1 gradient mid-cell levels according to cell size&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mohan Balasubramanian as the Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers and the reviewing editor appreciated the area under investigation and were enthusiastic about your work on defining the mechanism of regulation of mitotic entry and cell size through the analysis of Pom1 kinase gradient formation and phosphoregulation. In particular, your description of Pom1 behaviour through a variety of advanced imaging approaches was seen as a strength of the paper.</p><p>However, a number of major issues have been raised which need to be addressed before this paper can be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This manuscript can be further strengthened if the authors using TIRF microscopy show how the various phospho mutants influence Pom1 cluster size, and duration. In wild type cells the clusters show dynamic changes in intensity over time. Is this dynamicity altered in <italic>pom1</italic> phospho mutants. Does phosphorylation influence cluster formation or cluster stability? These experiments should be easy to perform given that the authors have already shown cluster dynamics using TIRF in WT.</p><p>2) The authors predict that Pom1 clusters transiently visit cortical nodes on the plasma membrane to phosphorylate and inhibit Cdr2. One assumption of the model is that most of active Pom1 and Cdr2 are on the plasma membrane, which were not mentioned or tested. If these data are available in the literature, they should be cited. If not, the authors can easily measure the fractions of proteins on the plasma membrane and cytoplasm using fluorescence intensity. Do cytoplasmic concentrations of Pom1 and Cdr2 change with cell size? If most of active Pom1 and Cdr2 are in the cytoplasm, there is a possibility that Pom1 inhibits Cdr2 in the cytoplasm to regulate mitotic entry. If cytosolic Ssp1 can phosphorylate Cdr2, why Pom1 cannot? Is it possible that cytoplasmic Pom1 and Cdr2 are involved in cell-size control directly? To me, it is hard to explain why visits of Weel and Pom1 to cortical Cdr2 are different.</p><p>3) Figure 1 shows that Pom1 clusters display different dissociating rates. How are you sure that all the Pom1 clusters are on the plasma membrane? Is it possible some of the clusters are in the cytoplasm? For several experiments, it will be ideal to have a plasma membrane marker so that it is certain that Pom1 is moving or diffusing on the plasma membrane.</p><p>4) My primary issue is with the conclusion that <italic>pom1</italic> is regulating cell size. The authors do an excellent job of showing that in cells &lt;10μm that <italic>pom1</italic> is directly inhibiting <italic>cdr2</italic> accumulation (Figure 6). However, for cells &gt;11μm there appears to be little discernible difference between cells in terms of <italic>cdr2/pom1</italic> interaction. Since cells divide with approximately ± 1μm precision, this data does not support the conclusion that <italic>pom1</italic> is regulating cell length at the point of division. Instead, it is consistent with a model whereby <italic>pom1</italic>'s role is to inhibit cell division early on in cell cycle (up to 11um), but after that it is not so vital. For example, Figure 6G has hardly any difference between 9-11 and 12-14μm cells at the cell middle.</p><p>So, I think some of the statements regarding <italic>pom1</italic> regulation of cell size need to be toned down – it is acting as a size sensor in early cell cycle, but later other processes are equally, if not more, important.</p><p>5) A key prediction from my previous work (Saunders et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2014) was that the surface area of the cell is the key measure of cell size. This has recently been tested very carefully (Facchetti et al., 2019) and surface area correlates with when division happens much more closely than simply cell length. I find it surprising that the authors do not explore the role of <italic>pom1 / cdr2</italic> interactions in cells of different geometry (e.g. <italic>rga2Δ</italic> and <italic>rga4Δ</italic>). How is <italic>pom1</italic> cluster distribution and <italic>pom1</italic> intensity at the centre altered in cells with different geometry? This is a highly pertinent question for this paper as the problems being addressed are directly related to cell size control.</p><p>6) Pom1 and its clusters are, of course, not restricted to the field of view. How did they account for movement of <italic>pom1</italic> molecules/ clusters moving around the surface, rather than disassociating from the surface?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45983.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This manuscript can be further strengthened if the authors using TIRF microscopy show how the various phospho mutants influence Pom1 cluster size, and duration.

We carefully examined the dynamics of these Pom1 phospho-mutant alleles: for all alleles, we could observe events as described in WT, i-e lateral movements, splitting and merging, and oscillatory fluorescence intensity. Though clusters appear more stable in the phospho-mutants, particularly for Pom1<sup>5A</sup>, we have not quantified their lifetime. This is because our measure is already limited by the length of the imaging timeframe in WT (beyond which significant photobleaching compromises interpretation), and so would be non-informative to probe longer lifetimes. Representative timelapse imaging is provided as two new videos (Video 3 and 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors predict that Pom1 clusters transiently visit cortical nodes on the plasma membrane to phosphorylate and inhibit Cdr2.

By contrast, new measurements of Pom1 cytosolic levels in these same strains show no correlation with cell size at division: Pom1 cytosolic levels are invariant in the phospho-mutant series in WT and decrease with increasing phosphosite mutations in <italic>tea4∆</italic>, leading to inconsistent relationship with cell length. Thus, the Pom1 medial cortical levels are a much better predictor of cell length at division than the cytosolic levels. Given the direct phosphorylation of Cdr2 by Pom1 (previously shown by Moseley et al., 2009, Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009, Bhatia et al., 2013, Deng et al., 2014, Rincon et al., 2014), and given cell size at division is a direct read-out of Cdr2 activity, we conclude that this regulation takes place at the cell cortex and not in the cytosol. The new cytosolic measurements and lack of correlation with length at division are provided in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>Consistent with the notion that Pom1 regulates Cdr2 at the plasma membrane, Pom1 cytosolic concentration have been indirectly measured in Saunders et al., 2014, and shown not to vary with cell size. We have not re-measured this directly, as we feel that the functional data described above is much more convincing in showing the location of Pom1 action than a likely noisy measurement of a low cytosolic concentration. Our data suggest that visits of Wee1 and Pom1 to Cdr2 nodes are different because Pom1 visits Cdr2 nodes primarily through lateral diffusion in the plasma membrane, whereas Wee1 visits them from the cytosol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1 shows that Pom1 clusters display different dissociating rates.

For several experiments, it will be ideal to have a plasma membrane marker so that it is certain that Pom1 is moving or diffusing on the plasma membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>There are two reasons we are sure the molecules we tracked were on the plasma membrane and not in the cytosol:</p><p>1) Molecules in the cytosol diffuse too rapidly to be localized with high precision at the 20 ms frame rates we used. To image cytosolic diffusion, frame rates of less than 5 ms should be used (for instance as in English BP et al., PNAS (2011)).</p><p>2) An astigmatic lens was used to distort the PSF of molecules that were not in focus, and discard them from the analysis. Focusing was readily done into the plane of the plasma membrane, where Pom1 signals were maximum and the shape of the cell was minimized. This is described in the Materials and methods to which we have added explanation of the effect of astigmatic imaging. We also mention it now in the main text, referring to the Materials and methods for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) My primary issue is with the conclusion that pom1 is regulating cell size. The authors do an excellent job of showing that in cells &lt;10μm that pom1 is directly inhibiting cdr2 accumulation (Figure 6). However, for cells &gt;11μm there appears to be little discernible difference between cells in terms of cdr2/pom1 interaction. Since cells divide with approximately ± 1μm precision, this data does not support the conclusion that pom1 is regulating cell length at the point of division. Instead, it is consistent with a model whereby pom1's role is to inhibit cell division early on in cell cycle (up to 11um), but after that it is not so vital. For example, Figure 6G has hardly any difference between 9-11 and 12-14μm cells at the cell middle.</p><p>So, I think some of the statements regarding pom1 regulation of cell size need to be toned down – it is acting as a size sensor in early cell cycle, but later other processes are equally, if not more, important.</p></disp-quote><p>We generally agree with the reviewer and have carefully monitored the wording in the text, changing it where appropriate. It is clear that Pom1 regulates cell size: <italic>pom1∆</italic> cells are shorter than WT. The question is whether it does so by contributing a measure of size that serves as homeostatic control. Because <italic>pom1∆</italic> cells retain homeostatic size regulation, and also because the relative Pom1/Cdr2 levels show significant variability from cell to cell, as does size at division, it is clear that the Pom1/Cdr2 system does not represent the sole mechanism of cell size homeostasis. Our data however show that the variation of Pom1 levels at cell middle according to cell length positions it to be one (of several) size sensors. As the reviewer points out, Pom1 likely contributes more significantly to size control when cells are small than when they have already reached a size over ~11µm. This is entirely consistent with our previous data (Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009) that Pom1 serves to prevent mitosis specifically in short cells. We have added a couple of sentences at the end of the Discussion clarifying this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A key prediction from my previous work (Saunders et al. eLife 2014) was that the surface area of the cell is the key measure of cell size. This has recently been tested very carefully (Facchetti et al., 2019) and surface area correlates with when division happens much more closely than simply cell length. I find it surprising that the authors do not explore the role of pom1 / cdr2 interactions in cells of different geometry (e.g. rga2Δ and rga4Δ). How is pom1 cluster distribution and pom1 intensity at the centre altered in cells with different geometry? This is a highly pertinent question for this paper as the problems being addressed are directly related to cell size control.</p></disp-quote><p>The finding that cell surface, rather than cell length, is sensed is a very interesting one. Because Pom1 operates at the membrane, it may well monitor cell surface rather than cell length. This would in fact be consistent with the recent proposition of Facchetti et al. that a Cdr2 allele that cannot be phosphorylated by Ssp1 (and is thus also blind to Pom1 regulation) now senses length rather than surface. We have indeed been careful in the text to use the more generic term of “cell size”, which encompasses both possibilities. However, we are not sure at this point how to relate these findings to the behavior of Pom1 clusters and/or relative intensities of Pom1 at cell middle. Finding that there is more cortical mid-cell Pom1 in short cells will be the case whether the sensed dimension is surface of length. Indeed, in preliminary experiments, we found that Pom1 medial cortical levels measured by TIRF imaging are also higher in short than long <italic>rga2∆</italic> and <italic>rga4∆</italic> cells, which are mutants with altered dimensions used in the recent studies. These measurements, performed as in Figure 6G, are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>. Determining whether and how Pom1 modulates surface measure will require careful quantitative modeling of Pom1 gradient formation in 3D, which goes beyond what we can address in these revisions.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45983-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Pom1 and its clusters are, of course, not restricted to the field of view.
