rotating long, helical filaments, called flagella. The number of flagella, their arrangement on the cell body and their sense of rotation hypothetically determine the locomotion characteristics of a species. The movement of the most rapid microorganisms has in particular remained unexplored because of additional experimental limitations. We show that magnetotactic cocci with two flagella bundles on one pole swim faster than 500 µm·s<sup>−1</sup> along a double helical path, making them one of the fastest natural microswimmers. We additionally reveal that the cells reorient in less than 5 ms, an order of magnitude faster than reported so far for any other bacteria. Using hydrodynamic modeling, we demonstrate that a mode where a pushing and a pulling bundle cooperate is the only possibility to enable both helical tracks and fast reorientations. The advantage of sheathed flagella bundles is the high rigidity, making high swimming speeds possible.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Magnetococcus marinus</italic></kwd><kwd>magnetotactic bacteria</kwd><kwd>microswimmer</kwd><kwd>path tracking</kwd><kwd>dark-field microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Faivre</surname><given-names>Damien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FA 835/7-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Faivre</surname><given-names>Damien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KL 818/2-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klumpp</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001655</institution-id><institution>Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>57314018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohammadinejad</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 937 (A21)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klumpp</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-TERC-0025-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lefèvre</surname><given-names>Christopher T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>IMPRS on Multiscale Biosystems</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Codutti</surname><given-names>Agnese</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>French National Research Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR Tremplin-ERC: ANR-16-TERC-0025-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lefèvre</surname><given-names>Christopher T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bacteria reach swimming speeds of several hundred body lengths per second and change direction in less than 5 ms by using coordinated flagella bundle agitation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The understanding of microswimmer motility has implications ranging from the comprehension of phytoplankton migration to the autonomously acting microbots in medical scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sengupta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Felfoul et al., 2016</xref>). The most present microswimmers in our daily lives are bacteria, most of which use flagella for locomotion. Well-studied examples of swimming microorganisms include the peritrichous (several flagella all over the body surface) <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> with an occasionally distorted hydrodynamic flagella bundling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Turner et al., 2000</xref>) and the monotrichous (one polar flagellum) <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic>, which are pushed or pulled by a flagellum and exploit a mechanical buckling instability to change direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Xie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Son et al., 2013</xref>). The swimming speeds of so far studied cells are in the range of several 10 µm s<sup>−1</sup> and their reorientation events occur on the time scale of 50–100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Son et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berg and Brown, 1972</xref>).</p><p><italic>Magnetococcus marinus</italic> (MC-1) is a magnetotactic, spherical bacterium that is capable of swimming extremely fast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fenchel and Thar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazylinski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Pichel, 1989</xref>). MC-1 as well as the closely related strain MO-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ruan et al., 2012</xref>) are equipped with two bundles of flagella on one hemisphere (bilophotrichous cells). The bacterium also features a magnetosome chain, which imparts the cell with a magnetic moment (‘magnetotactic’ cell). They are assumed to swim with the cell body in front of both flagella bundles, which synchronously push the cell forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). This assumption leads to helical motion in the presence of a strong magnetic field, which exerts a torque on the cell’s magnetic moment, as seen in hydrodynamic simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). In the absence of a magnetic field, this model predicts rather straight trajectories.</p><p>Our observations disagree with the above-mentioned model, indicating that an understanding of the physics of their swimming is still missing, even though proof of concept biomedical applications of these bacteria have already emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Felfoul et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we confirm that MC-1 cells reach speeds of over 500 µm s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and observe that the cells travel along a double helical path, which has not been reported for bilophotrichous cells so far. In addition, we observed that this rapid movement is complemented by an extremely fast reorientation ability (less than 5 ms). We connect the flagella bundle architecture and the swimming mechanism by hydrodynamic simulations and show that only a striking cooperative movement where one flagella bundle pushes while the other pulls the cell explains these motility characteristics.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>3D tracking in physiochemically controlled conditions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MC-1 cells were transitioned into agar-free medium, the solution was degassed to remove the oxygen and inserted into a microcapillary.

(<bold>B</bold>) The cells were observed near the band using 400 fps phase contrast video microscopy with a spherical aberration, which causes interference patterns around the spherical swimmers.

The cells were introduced into a flat, rectangular microcapillary tube with a height of 200 µm, where they accumulated in a band near their preferred oxygen conditions. The cells were imaged near this band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frankel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fenchel, 1994</xref>) at central height to avoid surface interactions. The capillary was placed at the center of three orthogonal Helmholtz coils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennet et al., 2014</xref>), which were used to cancel the Earth’s magnetic field with a precision of 0.2 µT after the band had formed. Hence, the cells’ motion could be observed in the absence of significant magnetic torques. Tracking was performed in 3D at 400 frames s<sup>−1</sup> (fps) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A high-throughput tracking method was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Taute et al., 2015</xref>) (see Materials and methods) for the reconstruction of the tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>).</p><p>Our first set of observations revealed that the cells traveled on helical paths (with a pitch of 5.3 µm ± 1.3 µm, a diameter of 1.7 µm ± 0.2 µm, and a period of 46 ms ± 32 ms, n = 65, errors are standard deviations) in the absence of magnetic torques (parameter extraction was performed with an automated track analysis algorithm, which was validated against simulated swim tracks, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, abrupt changes of the direction of the helical axis were observed (e.g. around 90° in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These directional changes occur within 2.5 ms to 5 ms, at least one order of magnitude faster than any previously analyzed reorientation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Son et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berg and Brown, 1972</xref>). Directional changes did not occur via a continuous modulation of the ratio of radius and pitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crenshaw and Edelstein-Keshet, 1993</xref>), as it has been observed as a part of the chemotaxis of sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jikeli et al., 2015</xref>). Rather, the helix parameters were the same before and after such an event. 3D tracking is essential to obtain this conclusion, as projected 2D tracks exhibit apparent changes in the helix parameters (see projected shadow of the track in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The cells were further examined at 1640 fps in high-intensity dark-field video microscopy to visualize the cell body and the flagella bundle movement in detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, Materials and methods).

Although a state-of-the-art flagella imaging method, a sufficiently high framerate and a photon density close to the cell death limit were chosen, the resulting images reveal only little information about the exact flagella bundle positions and dynamics.

We performed Stokesian dynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhyapak and Stark, 2015</xref>) for a spherical cell body (1.3 µm in diameter) with two discretized helical filaments (4 µm long and 50 nm thick if not stated differently) representing the flagella bundles (see Materials and methods for details). A large helical path of a microswimmer is produced from an off-axis (relative to the swimming direction) torque which continuously changes the direction of the thrust force. In case of a bilophotrichous cell, this requires a significant asymmetry in the propulsion force vectors of the two flagella bundles. Five possible asymmetries in flagella bundle configuration were considered to produce this torque and the resulting swimming paths were compared to experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Three asymmetric configurations were ruled out numerically, as they did not result in a significant match between simulated and experimentally observed helix diameter, helix pitch and speed. These configurations are: A difference in flagella bundle length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), a difference in motor strength (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and an asymmetry in the equilibrium angle of the two flagella bundles relative to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shum, 2019</xref>) (see Appendix 1). Another scenario would be a periodic, time-dependent movement of the flagella equilibrium angles relative to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nguyen and Graham, 2017</xref>). However, constant offsets in these angles already did not produce any significant matches between experiment and simulation. This indicates that this scenario will also fail this test and was not investigated further. Although not fully reaching experimentally observed helix pitches, the asymmetry in sense of motor rotation was the only scenario producing significant matches in helix diameter and cell speeds.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Simulations of MC-1 swimming dynamics with one pushing and one pulling flagellar bundle.</title><p>The principle cell and flagella bundle arrangement is shown in (<bold>A</bold>) at four distinct time points where the cell body diverges strongly from the helix axis.

The effect of the flagellar motors was included as a torque at the base of the helices, which rotates the filament, and a counter-torque, which rotates the cell body. We considered the two bundles to rotate independently either counter-clockwise (CCW) or clockwise (CW). The parameters for bending rigidity, torsion rigidity and torque of the flagella bundles were adjusted to reproduce the observed movement characteristics (i.e. the parameters of the small helices and velocities). A motor torque of 12 pN µm, about 3.5 times the motor torque of an <italic>E. coli</italic> cell, had to be chosen together with high isotropic bending and twisting rigidities of 7 pN μm<sup>2</sup>, about two times larger than for single flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhyapak and Stark, 2015</xref>). We assume that this increase is attributed to the structure of the flagella bundle, where seven protein motors power seven sheathed flagella cooperatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Only this assumption allowed for stable and high swimming velocities in the simulations, indicating that the function of the flagella bundle is to combine high torques with high rigidities.</p><p>Different swimming scenarios arising from combinations of CW and CCW rotation of the two bundles were simulated: both flagella bundles pushing the cell (CCW and CCW), both flagella bundles pulling (CW and CW) and one flagellum pushing, one pulling (CCW and CW).

This agrees with the flagella bundle movement in the experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Our model suggests a pushing flagella bundle together with a pulling flagella bundle rotating in opposite senses. The experimentally observed rapid reorientation events that lasts between 2.5 ms and 5 ms are most reasonably produced by a sharp change in the rotation of at least one flagella bundle. We tested different scenarios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">5</xref>) and found a transiently synchronous rotations of the two flagella bundles to be the most likely process. We tested this by changing the sense of rotation from CCW and CW to CCW and CCW for 4 ms in the simulations and calculating the angle between the trajectory segments before starting and after finishing this transient CCW and CCW step (outtake in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>).

The standard deviation of the directional change is small in our simulations, where only the runtime was varied, compared to the experimental value. The mismatch likely arises from biological diversity in flagella lengths and opening angles, but also due to shifts in local physiochemical conditions, which can for example influence the motor torque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Son et al., 2013</xref>).

In addition, they are likely to make use of a previously unrecognized pattern of motion of their flagella bundles, with one bundle pushing the cell body and the other pulling it. Key to observing this pattern of motion was the 3D tracking of single cells in the absence of magnetic torques to observe the unexpected two-helix trajectories, together with hydrodynamic simulations. The hierarchically organized flagella bundles provide a high torque and rigidity, necessary to reach record speeds of over 200 body lengths per second, while the unusual type of coordination of the two bundles provides a mechanism for rapid reorientation. Magnetotactic cocci such as MC-1 thrive and generally represent the most abundant MTB in aquatic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lefèvre et al., 2015</xref>). Their unusual motility is certainly an adaptation that represents a selective advantage that make them competitive in the highly coveted biotopes that are the oxic-anoxic interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brune et al., 2000</xref>). Indeed, the observed geometry of this resulting swimming pattern is reminiscent of the situation recently reported for <italic>magnetospirilla</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Murat et al., 2015</xref>), despite the difference in body plan. The <italic>magnetosprilla</italic> have two flagella at opposite cell poles, and a magnetic moment parallel to the flagellar axis, while the flagella of the cocci studied here are attached on one hemisphere of the cell and almost perpendicular to the magnetic moment. Nevertheless, both swim aligned with a magnetic field with one flagellum ahead and one trailing. In summary, record-breaking cells like MC-1 can help to understand physical limits of natural microswimmers and provide design principles for their artificial counterparts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Magnetococcus marinus</italic>)</td><td>MC-1</td><td>CEA</td><td>NCBI:txid156889</td><td>Dr. Christopher Lefèvre, <break/>CNRS</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ImageJ</td><td>NIH</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MatLab</td><td>The MathWorks</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell medium and culturing</title><p>MC-1 was cultured similarly to the procedure reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazylinski et al. (2013)</xref>. Artificial sea water (ASW) was used as a base medium, containing 20 g NaCl, 6 g MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.4 g Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 g KCl and 1 g CaCl<sub>2</sub> per liter H<sub>2</sub>0. To this was added (per liter) the following, in order, prior to autoclaving: 0.05 mL 0.2% (w/w) aqueous resazurin, 5 mL Wolfe’s mineral solution (ATCC, MD-TMS), 0.3 g NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 2.4 g HEPES and 1.6 g agar (Kobe I, Carl Roth). The medium was then adjusted to pH 6.3 and autoclaved. After the medium had cooled to about 45°C, the following solutions were added (per liter), in order, from previously sterile-filtered stock solutions: 0.5 ml vitamin solution (ATCC, MD-VS-10mL), 1.8 mL 0.5 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 3 mL0.01 M FeCl<sub>2</sub> and 40% (w/w) Na thiosulfate. Finally, 0.4 g cysteine was added (per liter), which was made fresh and filter-sterilized indirectly into the medium. The medium (12 mL) was dispensed into sterile Hungate tubes after verifying a pH of 7.0. All cultures were incubated at room temperature (~25°C) and, after approximately one week, a microaerobic band of MC-1 formed at the oxic–anoxic interface (pink-colorless interface) of the tubes. The cells were harvested in volumes of 1 mL from that region and magnetically transferred to ASW for experiments. The transfer step was necessary to remove agar for swimming experiments and to minimize background scattering in dark-field microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell morphology analysis</title><p>The flagella bundle length was determined with ImageJ from images taken with a Zeiss EM 912 Omega transmission electron microscope using an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. The cells were dried on a carbon film on a regular TEM copper grid and stained with 4% uranyl acetate for 6 min. Due to the staining, the cell walls appeared electron dense and covered the sight on flagella on top or below the cells. Hence, we added the average cell radius to the mean of the flagella length. A mean flagella bundle length of 3.3 µm ± 0.4 µm (n = 27) resulted. The size of the non-dried cells were measured with ImageJ from images taken with a LSM780 (Zeiss; Germany) confocal microscope. The mean size was 1.3 µm ± 0.1 µm (n = 103).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Microcapillary experiments</title><p>1 mL of a freshly harvested sample was degassed using nitrogen for 15 min and the sample was introduced into a rectangular micro-capillary (VitroTubes, #3520–050,) by capillary forces. One end of the capillary was sealed with petroleum jelly and the capillary was mounted on a microscope slide that was used to hold the sample on the microscope stage. The oxygen diffusion from the open end caused an oxygen gradient inside the medium, which led together with the oxygen consumption of the cells to the formation of a microaerobic bacteria band. The band formed in the presence of a 50 µT magnetic field towards the sealed end. The tracks were taken after 30 min of microcapillary infiltration at 0 µT.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>3d tracking experiments</title><p>3D swim tracks were recorded at 400 fps in a microcapillary in the vicinity of the microaerobic band (Nikon, S Plan Fluor ELWD,×40, Ph2, NA 0.6; NA 0.76 condenser lens; Ph2 aperture ring, 635 nm LED illumination). The 3D tracks were reconstructed using the high-throughput phase contrast reference method by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Taute et al. (2015)</xref>. A spherical aberration was introduced using a misalignment of the correction collar of the ×40 phase contrast objective to a cover slip thickness correction of 1.2 mm. The aberration caused inference pattern, which can be correlated with the relative height of the microswimmer. A custom made microscope platform, developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennet et al. (2014)</xref>, was used, which features three orthogonal Helmholtz coil pairs around the sample position. The setup can generate homogeneous fields at the sample position with arbitrary direction with a precision of 0.2 µT. The Earth’s magnetic field was canceled or an artificial field towards low oxygen conditions was generated during a capillary experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Dark-field microscopy</title><p>Flagella bundle positions were visualized at 1424 fps using high-intensity dark-field microscopy (Nikon 60×, 0.5–1.25 NA CFI P-Fluor oil objective at 0.75 NA; 1.2 NA oil condenser; mercury lamp illumination) and an Andor Zyla 5.5 (10-tap) camera (6.5 μm per pixel). The cells were placed inside a 10 µm deep chamber in ASW. A deeper chamber did not allow for successful dark-field imaging of flagella bundles due to an increase in noise from background scattering. The focal plane was adjusted to the center of the chamber, such that interactions between the observed flagella bundles and the chamber surfaces were avoided. Presumably due to the flagella bundle size and the high rotation speed of the cell and of the bundles, a direct observation of the whole flagella bundles was not successful and only a small section of each flagellum could be visualized. A sub-millisecond exposure time set the requirement for high photon intensity at the sample position. The intensity was increased until the cells melted instantly when swimming into focus. A green filter prevented the melting while still facilitating sufficient brightness. Scrupulous cleanliness at all optical interfaces was obligatory. High-speed cell body tracking could be accomplished at the center of a 200 µm deep chamber. Optimized visualization was achieved at 1640 fps using dark-field microscopy without the critical illumination from flagella tracking (Zeiss 60×, 1.0 NA; 1.2 NA oil condenser; halogen lamp illumination). The dark-field setup did not allow for a cancellation of external magnetic fields. Measurements of the magnetic field at the capillary position yielded B<sub>x</sub> = −195 µT ± 0.2 µT, B<sub>y</sub> = 60 µT ± 0.2 µT and B<sub>z</sub> = 27 µT ± 0.2 µT.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cell and flagella tracking software</title><p>3D track reconstruction was performed in MatLab (The MathWorks) using an adapted version of the code from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Taute et al. (2015)</xref>. For automated analysis of the reorientation angle distribution, the script was successfully tested against simulated data with known reorientation angles (See SI). The helix parameter determination was performed automatically on tracks extending a duration of 0.4 s, with a mean-square-displacement of at least 10 µm<sup>2</sup> and a mean opening angle between all consecutive velocity vectors of less than 60 ° to exclude strongly irregular tracks. The same exclusion parameters have been used for the reorientation angle analysis. Simultaneous dark-field cell and flagella tracking was performed using an in-house semi-automatic MatLab program. Tracking of the cell trajectory at 1640 fps without the flagella movement was performed using the TrackMate plugin of ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Hydrodynamic simulations</title><p>Each flagellum was modeled as a helical filament and a rotary motor.

With this asymmetry in flagella length, a helical path can be observed but, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, the size of the second helix isn’t comparable to the experimental values.</p><p>Moreover, the curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> are flat, indicating that changing the strength of asymmetry doesn’t have remarkable effect on the size of the second helix.</p></sec><sec id="s9-3"><title>3) Asymmetry in motor strengths</title><p>In these simulations the motor torque of one flagellum (Tm2) is 0.1, 0.5 or 0.9 times the torque of the other flagellum (Tm1). We observed double-helical trajectory with this motor asymmetry as well but with considerably smaller size compared to the experiment and our proposed pusher-puller model. The size of helix and swimming features are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, as well as experimental values for comparison.</p><p>Among these simulations the largest helix is observed for Tm2/Tm1 = 0.1 which is still smaller than the size of the experimental helix. Moreover, a hypothetical multi-flagellated microorganism that features flagella with a huge difference in motor torque (Tm2/Tm1 = 0.1) it is biologically not relevant. Also, the simulated velocities did not fit the experimental values for any of the tested scenarios.</p></sec><sec id="s9-4"><title>4) Asymmetry in flagella direction</title><p>We performed simulations with asymmetry in flagella direction. For this purpose, combination of flagella angles 0° and 10°, 0° and 20°, 0° and 30° and 0° and 40° as hinge equilibrium angles have been tested. In swimming trajectories, a very weak second helix with diameters of about an order of magnitude smaller than our pusher-puller model was observed.</p><p>For example, for 0° and 30° resulted in D = 0.17 µm, p=3.18 µm, V<sub>t</sub> = 71.50 µm/s. Which is far from the experimental ones: D = 1.7 µm, p=5.3 µm, V<sub>t</sub> = 100.0 µm/s.</p><p>In these simulations, the more tilted flagella bundle is only tilted close to the cell surface, but due to flexibility, the tilt is not persistence along the length of the flagella bundle and the two bundles approach each other at their end parts. So, the results show that asymmetry in flagella direction cannot generate a helix comparable to MC-1’s large helix.’</p></sec><sec id="s9-5"><title>Discussion of pitch differences between simulation and experimental observation</title><p>While the pitch of the simulation result, presented in the main text, is off by a factor of 2, the diameter and period time of helical trajectories are in good agreement with the experiments. The simulations show that the features of helical trajectories strongly depend on the flagellar opening angle (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) such that increasing the flagellar opening angle decreases the pitch and diameter of the large helix. Simulated effective velocities are smaller than the tracked velocities by factor of 2, since the pitch is decreased by the same factor while the period times are comparable.</p><p>Since the simulations with constant flagella length did not lead to a satisfying match in pitches, further simulations for different combinations of opening angles and flagellum lengths were carried out. The resulted diameter, pitch and velocity are compared with experimental values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>From these simulations, we can conclude that there are some other combinations of opening angle and flagellum length (for example L = 5 μm, opening angle = 60°) with which we can achieve a similar qualitative matching between simulation and experiment. However, none of them satisfy all the parameters simultaneously. The best match between helix diameter, pitch and speed is described in the main text. However, we clarify here that other tuning parameters (for example flagellum length and diameter, flagella opening angle, the motor torque) in the model cannot be precisely determined from TEM or optical microscopy images of MC-1. Therefore, it is computationally very time consuming to test different values for all these tuning parameters to find an accurate quantitative match for all parameters between experiment and simulation.</p><p>We further investigated several motor torques. Due to the collapse of our simulation for strong motors (because of the arising numerical error), the maximum applicable torque was 12 pN µm (about 3.5 times the motor torque of an <italic>E. coli</italic>). However, we can extrapolate the swimming behavior of our model MC-1 at higher motor torques by looking at its trend for lower values of motor torque. We tried motor torques of 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5 times the motor torque of<italic>E. coli</italic>and the results are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>.</p><p>The top row represents the result discussed in the main text.

Through a combination of experiment and theory the authors have found that the two flagellar bundles work in opposite ways – one pushing and one pulling the cells through their fluid environment in double-helical paths. The very fast motility and very rapid trajectories changes appear to arise from these features. This work will surely be of interest not only to those interested in the biology of motility, but also physical scientists interested in the fluid dynamics of locomotion.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;High-speed motility originates from cooperatively pushing and pulling flagella bundles in bilophotrichous bacteria&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The essence of the criticisms concerns the interpretation of the experimental observations (and the possibility of achieving better imaging of the flagella) and the analysis of the computational results. In both cases further details are needed, and in the former it appears that additional imaging would be in order.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In my opinion the topic of the article is interesting as it identifies a new flagellar arrangement for motility (though similar simultaneous pushing/pulling has been observed for species with bundles at opposite poles rather than the same hemisphere, both in magnetospirilla). However, I am not completely convinced by the authors' evidence. As detailed below, while the story is quite plausible, the experiments seem to not have key evidence which I would have expected to have easily been observed if the scenario were true, and the numerics are not performed (or perhaps just not described) in a way that convincingly rules out other hypotheses.</p><p>1) In the dark field imaging, bright spots on the cell body are identified with flagella. This identification is not obvious to me, and it is quite puzzling why the authors do not actually image the flagellar bundles. If the bundles were indeed extended from the body in front and behind the cell, I would expect that they could be visualized which would definitively prove their proposed configuration. In Son, Guasto and Stocker, 2013, sheathed flagella are quite readily imaged. In my experience, there may be difficulty seeing flagella with darkfield at 1640 fps, but they should be readily imaged at &lt;200 fps using their camera. Note that 200 fps is more than fast enough to resolve the larger helical motion with period 72 ms. It is unclear if the authors attempted this. If the authors tried and were not able to see a leading and lagging bundle, I would take that as evidence against their claim.</p><p>2) The authors describe the double helical path as &quot;unexplored&quot; in the Introduction, but based on my knowledge, double helical paths are what should be expected from most types of propulsion by flagellar bundles, with the main distinguishing feature being the size of the larger helix. The smaller helix has in the past been attributed to the rotation of the bundle or flagellar helix, see Keller and Rubinow, 1976. The larger helix arises anytime there is non-axisymmetric propulsion, see Hyon, Powers, Stocker, Fu 2012 and has been observed in many species, albeit with varying sizes of the larger helix. As discussed in point 3 below, an important implication of this is that the bar for numerical simulations cannot be simply qualitative as in &quot;straight&quot; vs. &quot;double-helical,&quot; but must involve some quantitative analysis of the trajectory pitch and radius.</p><p>3) The numerics have not been described in a way that clearly rules out alternative hypotheses.</p><p>First, as mentioned above, the quantitative details of the helical trajectory are important, but these are not well-matched. The authors say that their trajectories match the experimental helical diameter and period of the trajectories but not the pitch. The results are strongly dependent on the angle between the bundles, which is used as a fitting parameter. They say that they believe that the pitch could be matched eventually by fitting the opening angle and flagella length but do not actually do it.</p><p>Second, changing directions of bundles is also likely able to produce many different types of helical trajectories with varying pitch and radii. These have not been eliminated as possibilities.</p><p>Third, the fast reorientation in the simulations is interesting, but again, it is not ruled out whether other configurations could also yield similarly fast reorientations.</p><p>Fourth, the speed of the swimming is used as supporting evidence, but this is achieved by increasing the torque on the motor (to a value somewhat higher than some report for <italic>E. coli</italic>, but not out of the realm of possibility). If one is allowed to adjust the motor torque, then any speed can be reached for any configuration.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript reports results of a detailed experimental and numerical study of the swimming motion of magnetotactic cocci, bilophotrichous bacteria with flagellar bundles at both poles. The experiments show that bacteria swim along a double helical path, with a very high swim speed and short reorient time compared to other bacteria. Hydrodynamic modelling demonstrates that this is due to a pushing and a pulling bundle. Experimental and numerical results are in good semi-quantitative agreement.</p><p>I think this is a very nice investigation, which carefully elucidates the complex swimming motion of a bilophotrichous bacterium. Experiment and hydrodynamic simulation complement each other very well to characterize the geometry of the flagellar organization and swim pattern. Thus, I strongly support publication of this manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>I have only a few comments, which the authors should consider before publication:</p><p>1) In the main text, the authors talk about flagella as well as flagella bundles. I found this pretty confusing, until I saw Figure S1. I recommend clarifying this point early in the main text.</p><p>2) The reorientation angle could be discussed in a bit more detail. As far as I understand, as one bundle changes its direction of rotation, both bundles are in pushing (or pulling) mode, which leads to a (roughly) 90° reorientation of the swimming direction. This would explain the particular value of the reorientation angle. This seems to be somewhat similar to the behavior seen in simulations of the early stages of swimming and bundle formation of peritrichous bacteria, when the flagella are initially pointing in arbitrary directions, see, J. Hu et al., Sci. Rep. 5, 9586 (2015). However, the bundle rotation direction has to change back. This would result in another 90° angle, but uncorrelated with the first. Please clarify.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors present a very thorough study of the exceptional swimming capacities in terms of speed and possibilities to suddenly change direction, displayed by a magnetotactic bacterium strain (MC-1). They use a holographic method to track in 3D the swimming trajectories and fast camera observations of the rotating body to visualize the positions of the flagellar bundles hooked to the cell. They discover the presence of a double helical path characterizing the swimming kinematics that can be explained by two sets of pushing and pulling flagella bundles working cooperatively and positioned within the same hemisphere of the spherical body. They simulate a hydrodynamic model to corroborate their finding, yielding very reasonable quantitative agreement with the experiments. The model, when set to some limits also helped to discover a new swimming pattern under the application of a magnetic field. Importantly, they also find that to reach such performances, the flagella must assume motive torque and bundle rigidity significantly larger than what is usually obtained for other bacterial strains.</p><p>I found the experimental study excellent with important conclusions on an original propulsion model. My opinion is that the paper could deserve publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. My only concern is sometimes on the pedagogy and clarity of the explanations delivered. I believe this could be significantly be improved. I do not deny that the authors really tried to make an effort to deliver their message, in particular visually. However, it remains that sometimes, it took me several subsequent readings of the same paragraph to really understand what they actually meant. Figure 3 is a particular example of that, and I found in this instance, very hard to follow the reasoning in the caption in association with the visual message. Then I would suggest that the paper could significant gain in pedagogy and impact, if it was critically read by someone who could help to clarify some explanatory sentences.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47551.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) In the dark field imaging, bright spots on the cell body are identified with flagella.

Five possible configurations are: A difference in flagella length, a difference in motor strength, an asymmetry in the equilibrium angle of the two flagella relative to the cell surface, a time-dependent movement of the flagella equilibrium angles relative to the cell surface and the initially proposed asymmetry in sense of rotation (‘pusher-puller’ hypothesis). Finally, the best match between experiments and simulations has been found for our initially claimed ‘pusher-puller’ hypothesis.</p><p>We changed the introduction to the simulation paragraph:</p><p>“A large helical path of a microswimmer is produced from an off-axis (relative to the swimming direction) torque which continuously changes the direction of the thrust force.

These have not been eliminated as possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>In the previous simulations, we fixed the opening angle for each simulation but the direction of the flagella axes are free to be determined by the dynamics of the system. Therefore, we did not set this parameter manually and the physical model implies the direction of flagella axes based on the physical conditions such as hydrodynamic interaction and other forces in the system. According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we also did additional simulations where the direction of flagella was changed. We observe a very weak second helix in the swimming trajectories with diameter of about an order of magnitude smaller than the experimental values. The weak effect of flagella direction may originate from the flagella’s flexibility. Due to flagella’s flexibility, the two flagella approach each other at their end and the swimming of the bacteria is not very different from the symmetric case. As mentioned above, it is the dynamic of the system that determines the shape and orientation of the flagella. So, the results show that asymmetry in flagella direction cannot generate a helix comparable to the MC-1 large helix.</p><p>We described this point in the new version of the manuscript, as described in the new paragraph on different flagella bundle scenarios, as already presented.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, the fast reorientation in the simulations is interesting, but again, it is not ruled out whether other configurations could also yield similarly fast reorientations.</p></disp-quote><p>We edited the main text and added the section “Transient flagella configurations that produce fast reorientation events”.

Since we modeled a sheathed bundle of flagella by a single flagellum, we considered its effective torque to be several times larger than a single motor of <italic>E. coli</italic>. Unfortunately, there is no reported experimental value for the motor torque of MC-1. Therefore, since we have a bundle of flagella, we tested high torques and tune it in a way that the simulated velocity fit to the experimental values.</p><p>We described more clearly in the manuscript the above reasons for why we used higher motor torques for MC-1 than a single motor of <italic>E. coli</italic>. We wrote:</p><p>“The parameters for bending rigidity, torsion rigidity and torque of the flagella bundles were adjusted to reproduce the observed movement characteristics (number of small helices per large helix and velocities).

Thank you for the hint.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reorientation angle could be discussed in a bit more detail. As far as I understand, as one bundle changes its direction of rotation, both bundles are in pushing (or pulling) mode, which leads to a (roughly) 90° reorientation of the swimming direction. This would explain the particular value of the reorientation angle. This seems to be somewhat similar to the behavior seen in simulations of the early stages of swimming and bundle formation of peritrichous bacteria, when the flagella are initially pointing in arbitrary directions, see, J. Hu et al., Sci. Rep. 5, 9586 (2015). However, the bundle rotation direction has to change back. This would result in another 90° angle, but uncorrelated with the first. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>The observations showed reorientation times shorter than 5 ms. In simulation, we showed that one MC-1 reorientation event can be produced by a three-step deformation of flagella (pusher&amp;puller → pusher&amp;pusher → pusher&amp;puller). The reorientation angle is measured by finding the angle between the first and third steps (pusher&amp;puller steps) irrespective of the trajectory of the middle transient pusher&amp;pusher step. The reviewer’s reasoning for having two uncorrelated 90° reorientation is true if we give the middle step enough time such that the flagellum can find a stable configuration but since this middle step is very short, it is not possible to measure a definite angle between the first and second or the second and third steps.</p><p>We clarified the definition of reorientation angle and how we calculated it in the manuscript. We edited the following paragraph:</p><p>“Our model suggests a pushing flagella bundle together with a pulling flagella bundle rotating in opposite senses.
