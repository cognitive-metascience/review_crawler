However, the cellular cues that activate the function of ATG proteins during amino acid starvation are incompletely understood. Here we show that two related stress-responsive kinases, members of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway MAPKAPK2 (MK2) and MAPKAPK3 (MK3), positively regulate starvation-induced autophagy by phosphorylating an essential ATG protein, Beclin 1, at serine 90, and that this phosphorylation site is essential for the tumor suppressor function of Beclin 1. Moreover, MK2/MK3-dependent Beclin 1 phosphorylation (and starvation-induced autophagy) is blocked in vitro and in vivo by BCL2, a negative regulator of Beclin 1. Together, these findings reveal MK2/MK3 as crucial stress-responsive kinases that promote autophagy through Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation, and identify the blockade of MK2/3-dependent Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation as a mechanism by which BCL2 inhibits the autophagy function of Beclin 1.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05289.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05289.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05289.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells keep themselves healthy by breaking down unneeded or damaged internal structures via a process called autophagy. This process also helps a cell to survive if it is starved of nutrients. For example, if a cell does not receive enough amino acids, it cannot make new proteins. Autophagy can break down existing non-essential proteins so that their amino acids can be re-used to build other proteins that the cell needs to survive.</p><p>Autophagy is performed by a set of proteins that is found in many different species, ranging from yeast to humans and plants. How these proteins are activated when a cell is starved of amino acids is not fully understood. However, evidence suggests that activating one of these proteins, called Beclin 1, by adding phosphate groups to it controls the extent to which autophagy occurs. It is also known from previous work that less autophagy occurs when Beclin 1 binds to another protein called BCL2.</p><p>Wei, An et al. identified two enzymes that attach a phosphate group to a specific site on Beclin 1 to activate it, and revealed that autophagy is defective in cells that lack these enzymes. Furthermore, Wei, An et al. found the BCL2 protein prevents autophagy by binding to Beclin 1 in such a way that stops these two enzymes from activating Beclin 1.</p><p>Beclin 1 is also known to prevent the growth of malignant tumors. Wei, An et al. found that to do so, Beclin 1 must have a phosphate group added to the same site that activates the protein during autophagy. This suggests that drugs that enhance the addition of this phosphate group to Beclin 1 could help activate autophagy and have anti-cancer effects.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

they activate autophagy, a conserved lysosomal degradation pathway that enables cells to survive short-term periods of starvation by recycling nutrients and maintaining energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levine and Klionsky, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mizushima and Komatsu, 2011</xref>). The autophagy pathway is mediated by a set of evolutionary conserved proteins, the ATG proteins, that include proteins involved in the Atg1/ULK1 serine/threonine kinase protein complex, the Beclin 1/VPS34 class III phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI3K) complex, and the ATG5/ATG12/ATG16 and Atg8/LC3 protein conjugation complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levine and Klionsky, 2004</xref>). The activity of these ATG protein complexes can be regulated by protein–protein interactions, post-translational modifications (e.g., ubiquitination, phosphorylation, acetylation), and at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kroemer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Norris and Yao, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bánréti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Webster et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite extensive research over the past several years into the molecular mechanisms of autophagy, very little is understood about stress-responsive signals that regulate activation of autophagy protein complexes during amino acid deprivation. Inactivation of the autophagy repressor kinase mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) in response to amino acid starvation contributes to autophagy through phosphorylation of ULK1/2 and ATG13 (resulting in their dissociation) and of ATG14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meijer et al., 2014</xref>). The low-energy sensing kinase, AMPK, also acts directly on components of the autophagy machinery (ULK1, Beclin 1, VPS34) to positively regulate glucose starvation-induced autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Egan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2013</xref>), but does not appear to function similarly in amino acid starvation-induced autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, an important open question is whether any stress-responsive signals directly regulate autophagy proteins to promote autophagy during amino acid starvation.</p><p>The autophagy protein, Beclin 1, is a central regulator of autophagy and functions through its interaction with the Class III PI3K VPS34, VPS15, and the autophagy protein ATG14 in the initial stages of autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Funderburk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He and Levine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2013</xref>). It is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor important for breast cancer and also acts in various other biological processes, including differentiation and development, innate immunity, lifespan extension, protein against neurodegeneration, and exercise-mediated effects on glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao and Klionsky, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levine and Kroemer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2012</xref>). During amino acid starvation, Beclin 1-associated VPS34 autophagy complex activity is negatively regulated by the direct binding of Beclin 1 to BCL2 or BCL2L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sinha and Levine, 2008</xref>), and by inhibitory interactions with the oncogenic kinases, AKT and EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wei et al., 2013</xref>), the Golgi-associated protein, GLIPR2/GAPR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shoji-Kawata et al., 2013</xref>), and the kinase MST1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maejima et al., 2013</xref>). Several proteins positively regulate the Beclin 1-associated VPS34 autophagy complex, including those that disrupt BCL2/BCL2L1-Beclin 1 binding by either Beclin 1 phosphorylation (e.g., DAPK, ROCK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zalckvar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gurkar et al., 2013</xref>]) or BCL2 phosphorylation (e.g., JNK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wei et al., 2008</xref>]) and proteins that are part of the core autophagy machinery, such as ULK1 and AMBRA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fimia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Bartolomeo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Russell et al., 2013</xref>). These observations suggest that Beclin 1 may be a central target that is ‘turned on’ or ‘turned off’ in order to properly coordinate autophagosome formation with the needs of the cell to increase or decrease autophagy in a context-dependent manner.</p><p>However, it remains unknown whether stress-activated kinases directly phosphorylate Beclin 1 (or other ATG proteins) to positively regulate autophagy in response to amino acid starvation. Here we describe a novel role for members of the stress-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) signaling pathway, MAPKAPK2 (MK2) and MAPKAPK3 (MK3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cargnello and Roux, 2011</xref>), in mediating Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation, which we show is essential for its autophagy and tumor suppressor function. This MK2/3-dependent Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation is inhibited by a mutant form of BCL2 that cannot be phosphorylated by the MAPK family member, JNK1.</p><p>Our findings reveal a crucial link between an evolutionarily conserved family of stress-activated protein kinases, MK2 and MK3, and a component of the autophagy machinery, Beclin 1, that plays an essential role in starvation-induced autophagy. Moreover, we demonstrate that blockade of MK2/MK3-dependent Beclin 1 phosphorylation is a mechanism by which BCL2 family proteins inhibit autophagy. These finding have important implications for understanding how cells respond to amino acid starvation and turn on autophagy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nutrient starvation enhances Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation</title><p>Activation of the Beclin 1/VPS34 complex is an essential event for starvation-induced autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Funderburk et al., 2010</xref>). To gain insights into potential mechanisms that regulate starvation-induced autophagy, we sought to identify post-translational modifications of Beclin 1 that occur specifically in response to the autophagy-inducing condition, amino acid starvation. Mass spectrometry analysis of SKNSH human neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with Flag epitope-tagged Beclin 1 grown in normal growth or starvation conditions identified only one phosphorylation event that increased specifically in response to amino acid deprivation—phosphorylation of the serine 90 residue of Beclin 1 (data not shown).</p><p>We confirmed starvation-induced phosphorylation of Beclin 1 S90 using HeLa cells transiently transfected with either Flag epitope-tagged wild-type Beclin 1 or Flag epitope-tagged mutant Beclin 1 containing a non-phosphorylatable alanine substitution at residue 90 of human Beclin 1 (Beclin 1 S90A). Following metabolic labeling with <sup>33</sup>P, immunoprecipitation with an anti-Flag antibody and autoradiography, minimal phosphorylation was detected during nutrient-rich conditions, whereas Beclin 1 phosphorylation increased in response to starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, upper gel). Mutation of S90 to alanine almost completely abolished the <sup>33</sup>P signal of Beclin 1, indicating that S90 is a major starvation-induced phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, upper gel). We confirmed that starvation induces Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation by generating a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes Beclin 1 p-S90. Beclin 1 p-S90 reactivity of wild-type Beclin 1, but not Beclin 1 S90A, increased after nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle gel).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05289.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Beclin 1 S90 is phosphorylated in response to nutrient starvation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Detection of Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation in HeLa cells transfected with indicated Flag-Beclin 1 construct by radiolabeling, immunoprecipitation with an anti-Flag antibody and autoradiography (upper gel) or by western blot analysis using an anti-Beclin 1 S90 phosphospecific antibody (middle gel).

This increase in Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation was accompanied by starvation-induced autophagy as measured by a time-dependent decrease in levels of the autophagy substrate, SQSTMI/p62 (herein referred to as p62), and increase in the conversion of the autophagy protein LC3-I to the lipidated, autophagosome-associated form, LC3-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

These readouts represented an increase in autophagic flux rather than a block in autophagosomal maturation, as treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 blocked p62 degradation and further increased LC3-II accumulation and numbers of GFP-LC3 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). In contrast, enforced expression of the Beclin 1 S90A mutant failed to induce autophagy in response to starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>), indicating that the Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation site is essential for autophagy induction in response to nutrient starvation. Moreover, a phosphomimetic mutant Beclin 1 S90E increased autophagy in basal conditions, suggesting that Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation may be sufficient to induce autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05289.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation site is required for autophagy induction in MCF7 and U2OS cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot results of MCF7 cells transiently transfected with empty vector, and Flag epitope-tagged wild-type Beclin 1, Beclin 1 S90A, or Beclin 1 S90E.

Expression of shRNA-resistant wild-type Beclin 1, but not shRNA-resistant Beclin 1 S90A, rescued starvation-induced autophagic flux as measured by p62 degradation and quantification of GFP-LC3 puncta in the presence and absence of bafilomycin A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Expression of the phosphomimetic mutant Beclin 1 S90E increased autophagy in basal conditions to levels similar to those observed in starvation in cells expressing wild-type Beclin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Taken together, the data in MCF7 cells and U2OS cells provide strong evidence that Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation is both necessary and sufficient for autophagy induction. We note that there is not a complete block in autophagic flux in empty vector transfected MCF7 cells or in U2OS cells treated with doxycycline, presumably due to the presence of low levels of Beclin 1 expression.</p><p>In both MCF7 cells and U2OS cells, we observed that bafilomycin A1 treatment resulted in Flag-Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation in the absence of starvation. To determine whether bafilomycin A1 also induces phosphorylation of endogenous Beclin 1 S90 and whether such effects are due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation that occurs as a consequence of inhibition of vacuolar-type-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhdanov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yokomakura et al., 2012</xref>), we measured the effects of bafilomycin A1 treatment on Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation in HeLa cells in the presence or absence of the ROS scavenger, <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-L-cysteine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our results indicate that bafilomycin A1 results in endogenous Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation which is blocked by <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-L-cysteine. Thus, ROS generation, as well as starvation, results in Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. We also observed Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation in response to other stress stimuli (data not shown), but chose to focus on starvation, given the crucial physiological importance of starvation in autophagy induction.</p><p>To address the mechanism by which Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation induces autophagy, we compared U2OS cells expressing wild-type Beclin 1, the non-phosphorylatable Beclin 1 S90A mutant, and the phosphomimetic Beclin 1 S90E mutant with respect to (1) Beclin 1-associated VPS34 lipid kinase activity; (2) Beclin 1 immunoprecipitation of ATG14 and VPS34, and (3) the membrane localization of Beclin 1, ATG14, and VPS34. Our results show that the amounts of VPS34 and ATG14 that co-immunoprecipitate with Beclin 1 are not altered by starvation or by mutation of the Beclin 1 S90 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In addition, no apparent differences were observed in the localization of Beclin 1, ATG14, or VPS34 to membrane fractions (e.g., mitochondrial-enriched, microsomal) in cells expressing wild-type Beclin 1, Beclin 1 S90A, or Beclin 1 S90E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, despite similar levels of Beclin 1/ATG14 and Beclin 1/VPS34 binding, marked differences were observed in the VPS34 lipid kinase activity associated with wild-type and mutant forms of Beclin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). In cells expressing the phosphorylation-defective Beclin 1 S90A mutant, no increase was observed in Beclin 1-associated VPS34 lipid kinase activity in response to starvation. In cells expressing the Beclin 1 S90E phosphomimetic mutant, Beclin 1-associated VPS34 lipid kinase activity was higher in baseline and in starvation conditions than in cells expressing wild-type Beclin 1. Thus, Beclin 1 S90 phopshorylation increases the lipid kinase activity of the Beclin 1/VPS34 complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation site is required for tumor suppressor function</title><p>Beclin 1 is a tumor suppressor protein that inhibits the growth of MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells in immunodeficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liang et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furuya et al., 2005</xref>).

The structure of the BCL2-related anti-apoptotic protein, BCL2L1 (which also inhibits autophagy through its interaction with Beclin 1), bound to the helical BH3 domain of Beclin 1 has been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oberstein et al., 2007</xref>) (PDV ID: 2P1L), as has the structure of a region of MK2 bound to its auto-inhibitory peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meng et al., 2002</xref>) (PDB ID: 1KWP). Based on sequence analysis suggesting that Beclin 1 residues 80–104 that precede the BH3 domain are helical when bound to a suitable partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mei et al., 2014</xref>), a model for this region was built by ‘in silico’ mutagenesis of the MK2-bound auto-inhibitory peptide to correspond to Beclin 1 residues 80–95, such that S90 was positioned optimally for phosphorylation. This helix was then extended to include Beclin 1 residues 96–131 and BCL2L1 positioned by superposition of the bound Beclin 1 BH3 domain (residues 105–128) on the modeled Beclin 1 extended helix. This model suggests that steric hindrance may prevent simultaneous binding of BCL2L1 (or BCL2) and MK2 to Beclin 1, thereby inhibiting MK2-dependent Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. Of note, residues 216–236 and the N- and C-terminal regions of MK2 and BCL2L1 residues 26–81, were not present in the structures used to build this model, but in the full-length proteins these residues likely result in additional steric conflicts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Furthermore, the BCL2L1 C-terminal membrane-anchoring helix that was removed in the construct crystallized may provide cellular localization constraints that prevent MK2-mediated phosphorylation of Beclin 1 S90.</p><p>Next, we assessed whether BCL2 binding to Beclin 1 in cultured cells regulates Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). In HeLa cells stably transfected with wild-type BCL2, the starvation-induced increase in Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation was delayed and blunted compared to that observed in HeLa control cells; however, by 2 hr after starvation when there was complete disruption of BCL2 and Beclin 1 binding (as measured by co-immunoprecipitation), an appreciable increase in Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In contrast, in HeLa cells stably transfected with the mutant BCL2 T69A/S70A/S87A (BCL2 AAA), which lacks the JNK1 phosphorylation sites and fails to dissociate with Beclin 1 during starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wei et al., 2008</xref>), there was no increase in Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation in response to starvation. The levels of starvation-induced autophagy, as assessed by p62 degradation and LC3-II conversion paralleled the levels of Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. Starvation-induced autophagy was delayed and attenuated in HeLa/BCL2 cells compared to HeLa/control cells, and completely blocked in HeLa/BCL2 AAA cells. These effects of BCL2 on starvation-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation and autophagy were not due to a blockade of MK2/MK3 activation, as levels of phospho-HSP27 increased similarly during starvation in HeLa/control, HeLa/BCL2 and HeLa/BCL2 AAA cells. Furthermore, even in the absence of starvation, active MK2 was able to increase Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation and induce autophagy in HeLa/control cells but not in HeLa/BCL2 or HeLa/BCL2 AAA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, BCL2 blocks both starvation- and active MK2-mediated upregulation of Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation and autophagy.</p><p>To confirm whether BCL2 regulates starvation-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation in vivo, we examined the levels of Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation in <italic>Bcl2</italic><sup>AAA</sup> mice that contain a T69A/S70A/S84A knock-in mutation in Bcl2 (S84 is homologous to human S87) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

Following a 48 hr starvation period, we found the skeletal muscle of wild-type mice had activation of MK2 (as evidenced by a band shift in MK2 and phosphorylation of the substrate, HSP27), increased autophagy (as detected by p62 degradation and LC3-II conversion), and increased Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. In contrast, in the muscles of <italic>Bcl2</italic><sup>AAA</sup> mice, activation of MK2 appeared similar to that observed in wild-type muscles, but this was not accompanied by an increase in Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation or in levels of autophagy. Thus, the constitutive binding of Bcl2 AAA to Beclin 1 during starvation in vivo is sufficient to block the effects of activated MK2 on Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. Based on our data above in cultured cells, we propose that this block in MK2-regulated Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation may contribute to the mechanism by which Bcl2 inhibits autophagy in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>MK2/MK3 are crucial kinases for starvation-induced autophagy</title><p>Autophagy is a fundamental cellular survival response during nutrient starvation, permitting cells to maintain nutrient and energy homeostasis when external food supply is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levine and Klionsky, 2004</xref>).

The signaling molecules that activate Beclin 1/VPS34 to rapidly initiate autophagosome formation during complete starvation have been heretofore unknown.</p><p>Using unbiased approaches, we identified Beclin 1 S90 as a key phosphorylation site in starvation-induced autophagy and identified two stress-activated protein kinase signaling pathway family members, the p38 MAPK-activated protein kinases MK2 and MK3, as crucial kinases that mediate Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. A previous study showed that Beclin 1 S90 is phosphorylated during starvation and may function in autophagy (based on a ubiquitin-p62 degradation assay) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fogel et al., 2013</xref>), but did not identify the kinase(s) responsible for this phosphorylation. In the present study, we found that alanine substitution of Beclin 1 serine 90 is sufficient to block detection of starvation-induced Beclin 1 phosphorylation, and sufficient to block Beclin 1-mediated rescue of starvation-induced autophagy in multiple different <italic>beclin 1</italic>-deficient cells using multiple different autophagic flux assays. The structurally and functionally-related p38 MAPK-activated protein kinase family members, MK2 and MK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cargnello and Roux, 2011</xref>), but not the more distant family member, MK5, are strong inducers of Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. MK2 and MK3 phosphorylate a Beclin 1 peptide spanning S90 in vitro; MK2 and MK3 phosphorylate Beclin 1 immunoprecipitated from cells in vitro; dominant negative MK2 blocks starvation-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation and constitutively active MK2 induces Beclin 1 S90 starvation during basal conditions; and MEFs from <italic>MK2/MK3</italic> knockout mice are deficient in starvation-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. Moreover, MK2 positively regulates autophagy through a mechanism that requires the Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation site.</p><p>These findings describe a previously unidentified direct link between specific members of the MAPK signaling pathway and the positive regulation of a core component of the autophagy machinery during starvation. MK2 was originally discovered as an ERK1/2 activated protein kinase that phosphorylates HSP25 and HSP27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stokoe et al., 1992</xref>), and was later found to be stimulated by p38 in response to stress stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freshney et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rouse et al., 1994</xref>). MK3 was discovered independently through a yeast two-hybrid screen for p38-interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McLaughlin et al., 1996</xref>) and through an analysis of genes commonly deleted in small-cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sithanandam et al., 1996</xref>). The substrate spectrum of MK2 and MK3 are virtually indistinguishable, and both enzymes modulate proteins involved in cytokine production, endocytosis, actin remodeling, cell migration, cell cycle control, chromatin remodeling, and transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cargnello and Roux, 2011</xref>). The role of MK2 and MK3 in LPS-induced inflammatory signaling is well-established in vivo; <italic>MK2</italic> knockout mice show increased resistance to endotoxic shock and increased susceptibility to infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kotlyarov et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lehner et al., 2002</xref>) and this phenotype is exacerbated by simultaneous deletion of <italic>MK3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ronkina et al., 2007</xref>)<italic>.</italic> To our knowledge, MK2 and MK3 have not been previously linked to starvation-induced stress responses or to phosphorylation of specific substrates involved in starvation-induced stress response pathways such as autophagy. The newly described role of these kinases in regulating starvation-induced autophagy raises the possibility that this arm of the MAPKAPK family (sometimes referred to as the ‘p38 module’) may have evolved to integrate autophagy induction with diverse other cellular functions required for cellular adaption to stress.</p><p>Our data also suggest that MK2/MK3 are activated during amino acid starvation by the well-characterized upstream kinase, p38α. Several reports have shown that p38 functions in the positive regulation of autophagy in response to other stress stimuli such as glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moruno-Manchon et al., 2013</xref>), interferon-γ stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsuzawa et al., 2012</xref>) reservatrol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2014</xref>) or accumulation of mutant gilal fibrillary acidic protein in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tang et al., 2008</xref>). However, Webber and Tooze found that p38α functions in the negative regulation of basal and starvation-induced autophagy in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Webber and Tooze, 2010</xref>). The basis for the apparent discrepancy between this previous report and our current findings may reflect that p38α functions differently in different cell types or may reflect other differences in experimental design. For example, we did not directly examine the effects of p38α overexpression or p38α siRNA knockdown on MK2/MK3 activation and autophagy; instead, we used a dominant-negative p38α plasmid. One possibility is that there may be compensatory activation of different p38 isoforms that have different substrate signaling specificity in different experiments. In support of the concept that different p38 isoforms have different effects on starvation-induced MK2/MK3 activation, we found that dominant-negative p38β, but not dominant-negative p38γ, also blocks starvation-induced MK2/MK3 activation (unpublished data). Another possibility is that p38α may function upstream of MK2/MK3 in amino acid starvation, but its effects on other substrates may, in some contexts, counterbalance such effects in terms of autophagy regulation. Given our findings that dominant negative p38α blocks starvation-induced MK2/MK3 activation, further studies are warranted to more clearly define the role of this signaling event in amino acid starvation-induced autophagy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation is essential for its tumor suppression function</title><p><italic>Beclin 1</italic> is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor; it is frequently monoallelically deleted in human breast and ovarian cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aita et al., 1999</xref>); heterozygous loss in mice results in an increased incidence of breast and other spontaneous tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yue et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cicchini et al., 2014</xref>); decreased <italic>beclin 1</italic> mRNA expression is associated with aggressive clinic-pathological features and poor prognosis in human breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tang et al., 2015</xref>); and <italic>beclin 1</italic> gene transfer impairs the ability of MCF7 human breast tumor cells to form tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liang et al., 1999</xref>). Previous studies have shown that mutation of the nuclear export signal of Beclin 1 (resulting in its nuclear retention) or deletion of the evolutionary conserved domain of Beclin 1 (which abrogates it binding to VPS34 and autophagy function) blocks its tumor suppressor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furuya et al., 2005</xref>). Our observation that a single point mutation in Beclin 1 that abrogates starvation-induced autophagy, Beclin 1 S90A, also eliminates it ability to suppress MCF7 mammary tumorigenesis provides additional support for the concept that Beclin 1 functions as a tumor suppressor through its autophagy activity. However, as this mutation impairs Beclin 1-associated VPS34 lipid kinase activity, we cannot rule out the possibility that the mutation blocks a VPS34-dependent, autophagy-independent function of the Beclin 1/VPS34 complex in tumor suppression.</p><p>Regardless of the precise mechanisms by which the Beclin 1 S90A mutation blocks the tumor suppressor function of Beclin 1, our data show a strong association between decreased autophagy, increased tumor growth, and increased cellular proliferation in human mammary tumor xenografts. This association occurs despite the presence of increased cell death in tumors with decreased autophagy, and is consistent with our previous findings showing that enhanced suppression of autophagy in non-small cell lung carcinomas is associated with enhanced tumor growth despite increased cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wei et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that the pro-survival function of autophagy in established tumors may not be the most important determinant of net tumor growth; other factors such as the effects of autophagy on cell growth control and genomic stability may be more important.</p><p>Another implication of our finding relates to the potential relationship of MK3 deletion and Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation in cancer development. Given the requirement of the Beclin 1 S90 site for the tumor suppressor activity of Beclin 1, it will be interesting to determine whether the lack of MK3-dependent Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation contributes to the pathogenesis of small cell lung carcinomas that commonly harbor deletions in MK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sithanandam et al., 1996</xref>) or of other cancers with frequent heterozygous loss of MK3 such as invasive breast carcinomas, ovarian carcinomas, lung adenocarcinomas and lung squamous cell carcinomas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org">www.cbioportal.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation may stimulate autophagy by modulating the activity of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I (PI3KC3–C1)</title><p>PI3KC3-C1 consists of the lipid kinase, VPS34; the scaffolding protein, VPS15; and two autophagy proteins containing coiled-coil domains, ATG14 and Beclin 1. Our data show that Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation increases the VPS34 lipid kinase activity of this complex, without altering its composition or membrane localization. These data are consistent with predictions from a recent EM reconstitution of the ordered domains of the PI3KC3-C1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baskaran et al., 2014</xref>). The architecture of the EM reconstituted complex predicts that signaling inputs at the N-terminus of Beclin 1 are likely to function in the allosteric regulation of its lipid kinase activity. There are no direct interactions between ATG14 and Beclin 1 and VPS34; however, the unstructured N-terminal region of Beclin 1 is predicted to be in proximity to the catalytic subunit of VPS34, leading to the proposal that signals in the region of the Beclin 1 N-terminus regulate the activity of VPS34 lipid kinase domain. We speculate that MK2/MK3-dependent phosphorylation of Beclin 1 S90 may function to initiate autophagy precisely through the mechanism predicted by the recently solved structure of the PI3KC3-C1 complex, that is, through allosteric interactions that increase the activity of the VPS34 lipid kinase domain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>BCL2 inhibits autophagy through a mechanism involving suppression of MK2/MK3-dependent Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation</title><p>Beclin 1 was originally identified as a BCL2-interacting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liang et al., 1998</xref>), and BCL2 and BCL2L1 inhibit autophagy by binding to the BH3 domain of Beclin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pattingre et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maiuri et al., 2007</xref>). Bcl2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of stimulus-induced autophagy in vivo, as mice that contain non-phosphorylatable mutations in Bcl2 that prevent disruption of its binding to Beclin 1 are deficient in both starvation- and exercise-induced induced autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the importance of BCL2/BCL2L1 as negative regulators of autophagy, little is understood about the precise molecular mechanism by which their binding to Beclin 1 inhibits its autophagy function. The BH3 domain is in the N-terminal half of Beclin 1 and is not required for interaction with ATG14 or VPS34 or for the autophagy function of Beclin 1. Homodimerization of Beclin 1 favors binding BCL2/BCL2L1 and disfavors binding ATG14 or UVRAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noble et al., 2008</xref>), but the temporal order of Beclin 1 homodimerization and binding BCL2/BCL2L1 are not known. Even if BCL2/BCL2L1 binding to Beclin 1 precedes its homodimerization, it is not yet established that the promotion of Beclin 1 homodimerization and consequent prevention of binding to ATG14 is an important mechanism by which these proteins inhibit the autophagy function of Beclin 1.</p><p>Our data uncover a previously undescribed mechanism by which BCL2 inhibits the autophagy function of Beclin 1. BCL2 binding to the BH3 domain of Beclin 1 blocks an essential step in the positive regulation of starvation-induced autophagy—MK2/MK3-dependent Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. Our structure-based model predicts that this may occur via steric hindrance of MK2/MK3 binding to Beclin 1 when BCL2 is bound to the BH3 domain of Beclin 1, which is in close proximity to Beclin 1 serine 90. While further studies will be required to test this structural model, our data provide strong functional evidence that BCL2 binding to Beclin 1 blocks Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation, both in vitro and in vivo. BCL2 inhibits MK2-dependent in vitro phosphorylation of Beclin 1 S90 in a dose-dependent manner; BCL2 binding to Beclin 1 in cultured cells prevents starvation and active MK2-dependent Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation; and Bcl2 AAA mice have deficient starvation-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation despite starvation-induced activation (phosphorylation) of MK2.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>MAPK signaling pathway molecules converge on Beclin 1 activation in starvation-induced autophagy</title><p>Taken together, our findings describe a central regulatory loop underlying starvation-induced activation of autophagy. This loop involves two distinct arms of the MAPK signaling pathway, which act in parallel to activate the autophagy function of Beclin 1 in response to starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Previously defined JNK1-mediated BCL2 multisite phosphorylation, leading to disruption of BCL2/Beclin 1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wei et al., 2008</xref>), is a requisite event for subsequent for MK2/MK3-dependent Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation and Beclin 1-dependent autophagy. The dual functions of two arms of the MAPK signaling pathway, JNK1 and MK2/MK3, in mediating starvation-induced autophagy at the level of Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation underscore the crucial importance of the interaction between the MAPK signaling pathway and Beclin 1 in starvation-induced autophagy. More broadly, these findings suggest that activation of autophagy is intricately coordinated with other MAPK signaling stress responses.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05289.015</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of convergent functions of MAPK signaling molecules in amino acid starvation-induced autophagy and regulation of Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation.</title><p>In response to nutrient starvation, JNK1 results in multi-site phosphorylation of BCL2 and disruption of BCL2/Beclin 1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wei et al., 2008</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and three reviewers. Vivek Malhotra also acted as Reviewing editor.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agreed on the significance of the findings and the high quality of the data presented. But how starvation activated MK2/MK3 and how activation of Beclin2 by MK2 initiated autophagy was not clear from the data presented. It was generally agreed that addressing some aspect of this would strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>We suggest that you address the following three major issues:</p><p>1) How activation of Beclin 1 by MK2 results in the initiation of autophagy? Results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> suggest a possible model, as cells expressing S90A display reduced VPS34 lipid kinase activity. However, additional mechanistic insight is needed. Might Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation stabilize the Beclin 1/VPS34/ATG14 complex? The authors should blot for VPS34 in their immuno-precipitation experiments to monitor the interaction of VPS34 with wild type Beclin 1 and the S90A and S90E mutant proteins. In an alternative model, does S90 phosphorylation stabilize interaction of the Beclin 1/VPS34/ATG14 complex with membranes, similar to a previously suggested model for ATG14 regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fogel et al., 2013</xref>)? The authors should monitor membrane binding of wild type Beclin 1 and the S90A and S90E mutant proteins using cellular fractionation approaches and in vivo localization experiments. In yet another possible model, might Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation induce autophagy by stimulating VPS34 lipid kinase activity, similar to ULK1-mediated phosphorylation of Beclin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Russell et al., 2013</xref>)?</p><p>2) MK2 and MK3 have not been previously implicated in amino acid starvation stress responses. Moreover, the best-characterized kinase that activates MK2/MK3, p38 MAPK, is thought to negatively regulate starvation-induced autophagy (Weber and Tooze, 2010). It would be very interesting and important to provide some new insight into how amino acid starvation results in MK2/MK3 activation.</p><p>3) Why bafilomycin A1 treatment alone induces Beclin1 phosphorylation as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, D</xref>?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05289.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers agreed on the significance of the findings and the high quality of the data presented.

In the revised manuscript, we have added additional experiments to address how starvation activates MK2/MK3. In addition, we have performed the experiments suggested by the reviewers to further address how MK2-mediated phosphorylation of Beclin 1 initiates autophagy. We thank the reviewers for their suggestions, and believe these additional experiments significantly strengthen our manuscript.</p><p><italic>We suggest that you address the following three major issues</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) How activation of Beclin 1 by MK2 results in the initiation of autophagy?

The results (added to revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) indicate that there are no differences in the Beclin 1/VPS34/ATG14 complex related to the phosphorylation status of Beclin 1, i.e. equivalent amounts of VPS34 and ATG14 co-immunoprecipitate with wild-type Beclin 1, the Beclin 1 S90A phosphorylation -defective mutant, and the Beclin 1 S90E phosphomimetic mutant, and the amounts do not change in response to starvation. These data indicate that Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation increases VPS34 lipid kinase activity without stabilizing the Beclin 1/VPS34/ATG14 complex.</p><p><italic>In an alternative model, does S90 phosphorylation stabilize interaction of the Beclin 1/VPS34/ATG14 complex with membranes, similar to a previously suggested model for ATG14 regulation (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14"><italic>Fogel et al., 2013</italic></xref><italic>)?

These results show that the amounts of the different Beclin 1 constructs in each subcellular fraction (cytosol, mitochondrial-enriched fraction, microsomal fraction) are similar and do not vary in response to starvation. We observed similar findings for ATG14. For VPS34, although there are some differences in the different lanes, we did not observe any consistent pattern in several repeat experiments with respect to amounts of VPS34 in the microsomal fraction during starvation or in cells expressing the different Beclin 1 constructs. Thus, we do not believe that Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation increases the membrane binding of the Beclin 1/VPS34/ATG14 complex. These new experiments are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref> of the revised manuscript. Also, in earlier immunostaining experiments (data not shown) performed by our laboratory, we did not find any difference in the subcellular localization patterns of wild-type Beclin 1, Beclin 1 S90A, and Beclin 1 S90E.</p><p><italic>In yet another possible model, might Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation induce autophagy by stimulating VPS34 lipid kinase activity, similar to ULK1-mediated phosphorylation of Beclin 1 (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55"><italic>Russell et al., 2013</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>?</p><p>Our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> are indeed consistent with a model in which Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation stimulates VPS34 lipid kinase activity. To strengthen this claim, we have added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> the quantification of multiple different experiments examining the VPS34 lipid kinase activity associated with wild-type Beclin 1, Beclin S90A, and Beclin 1 S90E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> of revised manuscript). These results clearly show that, despite similar levels of VPS34 in immunoprecipitates, there is a significant defect in Beclin 1-associated VPS34 kinase activity during starvation when Beclin 1 is lacking the S90 phosphorylation site. In addition, there is a significant increase in baseline as well as starvation-induced Beclin 1-associated VPS34 kinase activity in cells expressing the Beclin 1 S90E phosphomimetic mutant. Of note, we have added a new section to the Discussion section to highlight that we believe the mechanism by which Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation induces autophagy is by stimulating VPS34 lipid kinase activity. This observation is particularly timely in view of the recent <italic>eLife</italic> publication by Baskaran et al. (2015) which described the EM reconstitution of the ordered domains of the Beclin 1/ATG15/VPS15/VPS34 complex, and predicted that signaling input from the disordered N-terminal region of Beclin 1 was likely to result in allosteric regulation of the VPS34 lipid kinase domain.</p><p><italic>2) MK2 and MK3 have not been previously implicated in amino acid starvation stress responses. Moreover, the best-characterized kinase that activates MK2/MK3, p38 MAPK, is thought to negatively regulate starvation-induced autophagy (Weber and Tooze, 2010). It would be very interesting and important to provide some new insight into how amino acid starvation results in MK2/MK3 activation</italic>.</p><p>It is true that MK2 and MK3 have not been previously implicated in amino acid starvation stress responses, and indeed, this observation represents a novel element of our findings. The best-characterized kinase that activates MK2/MK3 is, as stated, p38 MAPK. There have also been some claims that MK2/MK3 can be activated by JNK. For these reasons, we evaluated the effects of both dominant-negative p38α and dominant-negative JNK1 on starvation-induced MK2 activation (as measured by western blot detection of an MK2 band shift and phosphorylation of the downstream MK2 substrate, HSP27), as well as on Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. Our results, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1A</xref>, indicate that dominant-negative p38α inhibits starvation-induced MK2 activation, Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation, and autophagy. Dominant-negative JNK1 also inhibits starvation-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation and autophagy (presumably due to its inhibition of Bcl–2/Beclin 1 disruption as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wei et al., 2008</xref>, Molecular Cell) and our findings in this manuscript showing that Bcl–2 binding to Beclin 1 blocks Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation); however, in contrast to dominant-negative p38α, dominant-negative JNK1 does not block starvation-induced MK2 activation. Thus, these results suggest that p38α, not JNK1, is indeed the kinase that functions upstream of MK2/MK3 in amino acid starvation-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. To further confirm that MK2 functions downstream of p38 in amino acid starvation, we also evaluated whether constitutively active MK2 could reverse the inhibitory effects of dominant negative p38α on Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. Our results, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref>, indicate that constitutively active MK2 blocks the inhibitory effects of dominant negative MK2 on starvation-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation. Taken together, these results suggest that p38α MAPK functions upstream to activate MK2-dependent Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation and autophagy during amino acid starvation.</p><p>We recognize that this finding is in apparent contradiction to the report of Webber and Tooze (2010, EMBO) that p38α negatively regulates starvation-induced autophagy. We also note that other studies report a positive role for p38α MAPK in autophagy induction, including in response to glucose starvation (Moruno-Manchón et al., 2013, Biochem J), IFNγ stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsuzawa et al., 2012</xref>, J Immunol; Matsuzawa et al., 2014, Immunology), reservatrol treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2014</xref>, J Cell Physiol), and accumulation of a mutant glial acidic fibrillary protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tang et al., 2008</xref>, Hum Mol Genet). In the revised Discussion, we have discussed possible reasons for apparently discrepant findings in different studies, as well as cautioned that there is a need for further studies of p38α MAPK-regulation of starvation-induced autophagy. Unfortunately, within the scope of the present paper, it is not possible to thoroughly examine this issue and resolve the basis for discrepant reports in the literature.</p><p><italic>3) Why bafilomycin A1 treatment alone induces Beclin1 phosphorylation as seen in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A, D</italic></xref>?</p><p>While this manuscript focuses on starvation-induced autophagy and starvation-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation, we have also found that Beclin 1 undergoes S90 phosphorylation in response to several other autophagy-inducing stress stimuli. Therefore, we postulated that bafilomycin A1 might induce Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation as a consequence of generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), presumably as a consequence of its inhibition of vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yokomakura et al., 2012</xref>, J Toxicol Sci; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhdanov et al., 2011</xref>, Cell Mol Life Sci). To address whether bafilomycin A1-mediated ROS generation was responsible for Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation, we evaluated whether this event was blocked by concurrent treatment with an ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Our results indicate that bafilomycin A1 induces S90 phosphorylation of endogenous Beclin 1 in HeLa cells and that this is blocked by pretreatment with NAC. These results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> of the revised manuscript. Of note, we performed these experiments in HeLa cells to confirm that bafilomycin A1-induced Beclin 1 S90 phosphorylation occurs on endogenous Beclin 1, as the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> involve the measurement of S90 phosphorylation of transfected Beclin 1 (in MCF7 cells and U2OS) and we wanted to exclude the possibility that bafilomycin A1-induced S90 phosphorylation was an artifact of exogenous Beclin 1 expression.</p></body></sub-article></article>
