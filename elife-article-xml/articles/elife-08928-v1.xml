intramembrane-cleaving proteases, remain unclear. We examined the function of a conserved region looped into the membrane domain of RseP to form a β-hairpin-like structure near its active site in substrate recognition and cleavage. We observed that mutations disturbing the possible β-strand conformation of the loop impaired RseP proteolytic activity and that some of these mutations resulted in the differential cleavage of different substrates. Co-immunoprecipitation and crosslinking experiments suggest that the loop directly interacts with the transmembrane segments of substrates. Helix-destabilising mutations in the transmembrane segments of substrates suppressed the effect of loop mutations in an allele-specific manner. These results suggest that the loop promotes substrate cleavage by selectively recognising the transmembrane segments of substrates in an extended conformation and by presenting them to the proteolytic active site, which contributes to substrate discrimination.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08928.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08928.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08928.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells have communication systems that enable them to respond to potentially dangerous changes in their external environment. For example, bacteria have an enzyme called RseP that helps to activate responses to external stresses. This enzyme sits in the membrane that surrounds the cell and cuts a protein called RseA to release a signal molecule into the cell interior. This signal molecule then promotes the expression of particular genes to protect the cell from harm.</p><p>Previous studies have identified the ‘active site’ of RseP, which is the region of the enzyme that actually cuts the target protein. However, it is not clear how the enzyme is able to identify and cleave RseA and its other ‘substrate’ proteins. The enzyme also contains a structure called a β-hairpin-like loop that is close to the active site, which is not commonly found in membrane proteins. Here, Akiyama, Mizuno et al. used genetic and biochemical techniques to study the role of this loop structure in the RseP enzyme of the <italic>E. coli</italic> bacterium.</p><p>The experiments show that the loop specifically binds to a section of substrate proteins—called the transmembrane segment—that spans the cell membrane. Several genetic mutations that affected the loop altered the ability of RseP to bind to and cleave substrates. The effect of these mutations in RseP could be suppressed by introducing genetic mutations in substrates that altered the transmembrane segments. Akiyama, Mizuno et al. propose that the β-hairpin-like loop of the RseP enzyme binds the transmembrane segment of a substrate and presents it to the active site.</p><p>A previous study showed that another region of RseP called the periplasmic PDZ domains can act as a filter to stop RseP cutting other membrane proteins in error. Akiyama, Mizuno et al.'s findings suggest that the β-hairpin-like loop serves as an additional checkpoint to identify RseA and other proteins that RseP targets. The next step is to carry out further experiments to test this model.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

mechanism for transmembrane signalling and is a part of many important cellular processes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ha, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wolfe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Urban, 2013</xref>). Proteases involved in RIP are called intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs) and catalyse the proteolytic cleavage of transmembrane segments (TMs) of target membrane proteins within the lipid bilayer. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RseP belongs to S2P zinc metalloproteinase family of I-CLiPs. It plays a key role in regulating the σ<sup>E</sup> extracytoplasmic stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hizukuri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kroos and Akiyama, 2013</xref>), in which the dedicated sigma factor σ<sup>E</sup> is activated through the successive cleavage of a single membrane-spanning anti-σ<sup>E</sup> RseA in response to cell surface stresses. The first cleavage catalysed by DegS (site-1 cleavage) on the periplasmic side triggers the intramembrane cleavage by RseP (site-2 cleavage) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alba et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanehara et al., 2002</xref>). Recent studies suggest that in addition to being involved in RseA cleavage, RseP acts in the proteolytic removal of remnant signal peptides from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2011</xref>). RseP spans the membrane 4 times, with both the termini facing the periplasm. Its central periplasmic region contains tandem PDZ domains (PDZ-N and PDZ-C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanehara et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kinch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Inaba et al., 2008</xref>). The S2P family proteases share a conserved core domain containing 3 TMs. In RseP, these correspond to TM1–TM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kinch et al., 2006</xref>). The first and the third TM contain HExxH and LDG active site motifs, respectively. Disulfide crosslinking and co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that TM3 plays a critical role in binding of a substrate TM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koide et al., 2008</xref>). Helix destabilisation of substrate TMs promotes their binding to and cleavage by RseP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koide et al., 2008</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08928.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structures of RseP and the model substrates used in this study.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of RseP.

Previous studies suggest that RseP PDZ domains are involved in the site-1 cleavage-dependence of the site-2 cleavage by RseP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanehara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grigorova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Inaba et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hizukuri and Akiyama, 2012</xref>). Although the crystal structure of an S2P homolog (mjS2P) from <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2007</xref>) has been reported, it does not have a PDZ domain, and the three-dimensional structure of an S2P homolog with PDZ domain(s) is not available. We recently reported the crystal structure of the PDZ tandem of an <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> RseP homolog. The structure suggests that the 2 PDZ domains create a single pocket-like structure that covers the core membrane domain on the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hizukuri et al., 2014</xref>). Structural models and biochemical and genetic results suggest that the PDZ tandem acts as a size-exclusion filter to allow only the periplasmically truncated form of RseA to enter the recessed active site in the membrane domain of RseP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kroos and Akiyama, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hizukuri et al., 2014</xref>). However, mechanisms underlying substrate proteolysis by RseP remains elusive. It is unclear whether the size-exclusion function of the PDZ tandem is sufficient to discriminate between substrates and non-substrates and how a substrate TM, which assumes an α-helical conformation that needs to be unwound for proteolysis, is recognised and presented to the proteolytic active site. The mechanism of substrate discrimination and specific cleavage in RIP is one of the major problems to be solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langosch et al., 2015</xref>). Detailed knowledge of mechanisms underlying substrate discrimination and cleavage would help in controlling the cleavage of membrane proteins by I-CLiPs including S2P proteases.</p><p>The structure of mjS2P indicates that it contains a region, located close to the active site, that is looped into the membrane domain from the cytoplasmic side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). This membrane-reentrant loop is unique because it is in an extended or β-strand conformation, whereas a membrane-embedded polypeptide is generally in an α-helical conformation. Therefore, we have named this region membrane-reentrant β-loop (MRE β-loop). The MRE β-loop is conserved in proteins belonging to groups I and III of S2P subfamilies, including RseP (group I), <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> SpoIVFB (group III) and mjS2P (group III; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ha, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kroos and Akiyama, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). A recent study showed that the MRE β-loop of SpoIVFB can be crosslinked with a substrate through disulfide bonds, suggesting its possible involvement in substrate interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). However, functional roles of the MRE β-loop remain largely unknown. Here, we analysed the function of the RseP MRE β-loop and found that it could directly bind to and promotes selective cleavage of RseP substrates. Therefore, we propose that the MRE β-loop stabilises substrate TMs in an extended conformation and presents them to the proteolytic active site.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Importance of the MRE β-loop in the proteolytic function of RseP</title><p>We performed systematic mutational analysis to investigate the possible role of the MRE β-loop in RseP function. We constructed an MRE β-loop deletion mutant (Δloop mutant) containing a short linker (Gly–Gly) in place of residues Ile-61 to Glu-75. Accumulation level of the Δloop mutant of RseP-HM (RseP with a C-terminal His-Myc bipartite tag) was comparable to that of wild-type RseP-HM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that the Δloop mutation did not cause global structural changes in RseP. The Δloop mutant did not exhibit complementation activity against a Δ<italic>rseP</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Its protease activity was examined using model substrates HA-MBP-RseA148 and HA-MBP-RseA(LY1)148 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). HA-MBP-RseA148 is a derivative of the DegS-cleaved form of RseA (RseA148) and contains a maltose-binding protein (MBP) domain with an N-terminal haemagglutinin (HA) tag in place of the cytoplasmic region of RseA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hizukuri and Akiyama, 2012</xref>). HA-MBP-RseA(LY1)148 is essentially similar to HA-MBP-RseA148, except that it has the first TM (LY1) of lactose permease (LacY) instead of the RseA TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hizukuri and Akiyama, 2012</xref>).

Recent studies have shown that some small membrane proteins are encoded by the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome and expressed as functional proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hemm et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alix and Blanc-Potard, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fontaine et al., 2011</xref>). YqfG and YoaJ, small membrane proteins with unknown functions, are predicted to have type II (N<sub>IN</sub>-C<sub>OUT</sub>) membrane orientation according to the TMHMM program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krogh et al., 2001</xref>). Membrane topology of YoaJ was confirmed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fontaine et al., 2011</xref>). We examined the cleavage of these proteins by RseP because their structural features were analogous to those of signal peptides that were recently identified as RseP substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To facilitate detection, we attached an HA-MBP domain to the N-termini of YqfG and YoaJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and expressed them in Δ<italic>rseA</italic>/Δ<italic>rseP</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Anti-HA immunoblotting showed the accumulation of a protein of the expected size (approximately 46 kDa) when HA-MBP-YqfG was expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The protein was converted to a slightly smaller fragment upon co-expression with wild-type RseP-HM but not with RseP-HM E23Q mutant, indicating that HA-MBP-YqfG was cleaved by RseP presumably within its TM. As expected, the Δloop mutant did not cleave HA-MBP-YqfG. In contrast, HA-MBP-YoaJ did not undergo any cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Cell fractionation and alkali extraction showed that most HA-MBP-YoaJ was integrally associated with the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that its inability to undergo cleavage was not because of defective membrane localisation. These results show that the MRE β-loop plays a critical role in the proteolytic function of RseP and that RseP selectively cleaves type II membrane proteins, even those with a small periplasmic domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pro substitutions in the MRE β-loop lead to the differential cleavage of the model substrates</title><p>Cys-scanning mutagenesis was performed to identify functionally important residues in the MRE β-loop. We constructed single Cys RseP derivatives by substituting Cys residues in place of the 15 residues in the MRE β-loop of Cys-less RseP-HM, which contained Ala residues in place of the 2 original Cys residues (Cys-33 and Cys-427). Complementation and model substrate cleavage assays showed that all the single Cys mutants, except G68C supported normal cell growth and cleaved HA-MBP-RseA(LY1)148 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although the G68C mutant was inactive in complementation, it cleaved the model substrate with a slightly lower but significant efficiency. These results indicate that no residue in the MRE β-loop is specifically required for the proteolytic function of RseP. It is unclear why the G68C mutant failed to complement the Δ<italic>rseP</italic> mutation despite its substantial protease activity against the model substrate. G68C mutation might destabilise or inactivate the mutant protein under conditions employed in the complementation assay or might impair the cleavage of certain substrates that affect cell viability (see below).</p><p>We then performed a Pro-scanning experiment to test whether the secondary or tertiary structure of the MRE β-loop affects RseP function. Introduction of a Pro residue would disturb the higher-order structures of the MRE β-loop because Pro lacks the amide proton unlike other amino acids. Because the MRE β-loop originally had 1 Pro residue at position 65, we replaced other residues with Pro individually. In contrast to the results for Cys mutants, Pro substitution at positions 67, 68, 69 and 70, which are thought to be located in the distal part (Leu-66 to Glu-75) of the MRE β-loop, abolished complementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistently, the cleavage of HA-MBP-RseA148 was impaired moderately (G67P) or severely (G68P, Y69P and V70P) by these mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similar cleavage defects were observed with HA-MBP-RseA(LY1)148 for G67P, Y69P and V70P mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, the G68P mutant, which was almost completely defective in cleaving HA-MBP-RseA148, efficiently cleaved HA-MBP-RseA(LY1)148.</p><p>Pro mutations in the MRE β-loop exerted more profound effects on the cleavage of HA-MBP-YqfG than on the cleavage of the other 2 model substrates. Cleavage was severely impaired by G67P, G68P, Y69P and V70P mutations and was moderately impaired by I61P, L66P and K71P mutations. However, the latter 3 mutations did not inhibit the cleavage of the other 2 model substrates to detectable levels.</p><p>Substrate cleavage kinetics was investigated by pulse-chase experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). We found that the initial rates of HA-MBP-RseA(LY1)148 and HA-MBP-YqfG cleavage by co-expressed RseP-HM were slightly lower than that of HA-MBP-RseA148 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). During the 15 min chase period, the G68P mutant significantly cleaved HA-MBP-RseA(LY1)148 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) while the K71P mutant efficiently cleaved HA-MBP-RseA148 and HA-MBP-RseA(LY1)148 but only slightly cleaved HA-MBP-YqfG, which was consistent with immunoblotting results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Thus, the intrinsic susceptibility of each model substrate to wild-type RseP was not correlated with its susceptibility to MRE β-loop mutants, indicating that the MRE β-loop mutations resulted in the differential cleavage of different model substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The MRE β-loop is important for stable substrate–RseP interaction</title><p>We investigated the possible role of the MRE β-loop in RseP–substrate interaction by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

The precipitated proteins were analysed by anti-HA or anti-Myc immunoblotting. In all the following co-immunoprecipitation/crosslinking experiments, RseP derivatives carried a mutation (E23Q) in the active site motif to prevent substrate cleavage during expression and immunoprecipitation/crosslinking. We previously used a similar approach to show that several residues in TM3, including Asn-389, play important roles in substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koide et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with the previous results, wild-type RseP-HM was co-immunoprecipitated with HA-MBP-RseA and HA-MBP-RseA was co-immunoprecipitated with RseP-HM, but no co-immunoprecipitation was observed with RseP-HM having an N389L mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Deletion of the MRE β-loop almost completely abolished co-immunoprecipitation, suggesting its importance in RseP–substrate interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We found that all the MRE β-loop Pro mutants, except D74P located in the C-terminus of the loop, significantly decreased co-immunoprecipitation efficiency, indicating that the Pro mutations compromised the interaction between RseP-HM and model substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The result that absence of or mutations in the MRE β-loop interfered with RseP–substrate interaction suggests that the MRE β-loop is required for stable substrate binding by RseP. Pro substitutions in the proximal part (Ile-61 to Ile-64) of the MRE β-loop had little effect on substrate proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and decreased co-immunoprecipitation.

Anti-HA co-immunoprecipitation showed that RseP-HM was pulled down with HA-MBP-YoaJ in an MRE β-loop-dependent manner, indicating that YoaJ can interact with RseP although it is not cleaved by RseP and that the MRE β-loop can affect this interaction. However, overexpression of HA-MBP-YoaJ little affected the cleavage of co-expressed HA-RseA148 by RseP. It would be possible that YoaJ interacts with the MRE β-loop with much lower affinity than RseA does in the membrane, although similar amounts of RseP-HM were co-immunoprecipitated with HA-MBP-YoaJ and HA-MBP-RseA148 after membrane solubilisation. Alternatively, YoaJ might bind to RseP at a site different from that for RseA and other substrate proteins. In this case, deletion of the MRE β-loop might have indirectly disturbed the former site. The nature of the RseP–YoaJ interaction should be clarified in future study.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>In vivo photo-crosslinking between RseP and RseA</title><p>The above results and the presumed location of the MRE β-loop near the proteolytic active site suggest that the loop is directly involved in substrate binding by RseP. This was examined by site-directed in vivo photo-crosslinking experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Amber suppression-mediated incorporation of <italic>p</italic>-benzoylphenylalanine (<italic>p</italic>BPA), a non-natural photoreactive amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Young et al., 2010</xref>), allowed the expression of RseP-HM derivatives with <italic>p</italic>BPA in the MRE β-loop. We examined the crosslinking of plasmid-expressed RseP-HM with chromosomally encoded RseA. We used Δ<italic>rseP</italic>/Δ<italic>ompA</italic>/Δ<italic>ompC</italic> strain as the host strain because <italic>rseP</italic> can be deleted in <italic>rseA</italic><sup>+</sup> background when genes encoding outer membrane proteins OmpA and OmpC are deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Douchin et al., 2006</xref>). The host strain expressed DegS, which cleaved some amount of RseA to RseA148. Expression of <italic>p</italic>BPA-containing RseP-HM proteins decreased the accumulation of RseA148, indicating the functionality of these proteins, although some exhibited lower proteolytic activity against RseA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). After the exposure of cells to UV irradiation, the proteins were analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Anti-RseA immunoblotting showed UV irradiation produced bands of approximately 71 kDa (XL) when <italic>p</italic>BPA was incorporated at position 69, 71 or 74, suggesting that these bands represented photo-crosslinked products between RseP-HM and RseA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, upper panels). However, these bands were not detected by anti-Myc immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lower panels). As the expression level of plasmid-expressed RseP-HM was much higher than that of chromosomally encoded RseA, it seemed likely that only a small portion of RseP-HM was crosslinked with RseA. The over-expression of RseP-HM caused an increased background, making it difficult to detect weak bands of crosslinked products by anti-Myc immunoblotting. To confirm whether the 71 kDa band represented an RseP–RseA crosslinked product, we conducted immunoprecipitation experiments by using total proteins obtained from UV-irradiated RseP(Y69<italic>p</italic>BPA)-HM-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Anti-RseA antibody precipitated a predominant 71 kDa band that reacted with both anti-RseA and anti-RseP antibodies (upper panels). Anti-Myc antibody also precipitated a single anti-RseA-reactive protein of 71 kDa (lower left panel). Although no clear band of the corresponding size was obtained after anti-RseP immunoblotting (lower right panel), this may be due to increased background disturbance because of the high expression of RseP-HM. These results further support the notion that the 71 kDa band was the RseP–RseA crosslinked product.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08928.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>In vivo photo-crosslinking between RseP and RseA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis of the MRE β-loop/RseA crosslinking.

Our current results showed that several Pro substitutions in the MRE β-loop exerted opposite effects, that is, they compromised substrate binding and cleavage. Therefore, we examined whether destabilisation of a substrate TM helix improves its cleavage by RseP MRE β-loop mutants. Because the MRE β-loop was inserted halfway into the membrane from the cytoplasmic side, we replaced each residue in the N-terminal region (Ile-8 to Phe-15) of the presumed YqfG TM by a Pro residue, a strong helix destabiliser, and investigated its cleavage by RseP G67P and K71P mutants, which showed severe and moderate defects, respectively, in cleaving HA-MBP-YqfG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Wild-type RseP-HM cleaved all the HA-MBP-YqfG mutants almost as efficiently as it cleaved the original HA-MBP-YqfG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). L11P and L12P mutations but not other mutations appreciably increased the cleavage by RseP(G67P)-HM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, cleavage by RseP(K71P)-HM was markedly improved by mutations other than L12P and L13P. L12P and L13P also improved cleavage, but their effects were much lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We focused on 2 YqfG TM mutations I8P and L12P that resulted in differential cleavage by RseP(G67P)-HM and RseP(K71P)-HM and confirmed their effects by pulse-chase experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). RseP(WT)-HM efficiently cleaved wild-type HA-MBP-YqfG and its I8P and L12P mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). G67P mutation in the RseP MRE β-loop severely impaired its ability to cleave wild-type HA-MBP-YqfG. Only some cleavage was observed after the 60 min chase period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). K71P mutation, which had a weaker effect on immunoblotting, also impaired the ability of RseP to cleave wild-type HA-MBP-YqfG during the 15 min chase period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). RseP(G67P)-HM significantly cleaved HA-MBP-YqfG(L12P) but not HA-MBP-YqfG(I8P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) and RseP(K71P)-HM efficiently cleaved HA-MBP-YqfG(I8P) but not HA-MBP-YqfG(L12P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), which was consistent with the immunoblotting results. Replacement of Leu-12 in YqfG by Asn, another strong helix-destabilising amino acid, also promoted cleavage by the RseP MRE β-loop Pro mutants. However, replacement of the same residue by a helix-forming Trp residue resulted in no increase in cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>), suggesting that helix destabilisation is important for improving substrate cleavage. The I8P or L12P mutation did not promote cleavage by the RseP Δloop variant, indicating that these mutations did not bypass the RseP MRE β-loop function for substrate cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08928.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Suppression of the effect of RseP MRE β-loop mutations by destabilising substrate TM helix.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Immunoblotting analysis of YqfG cleavage.

However, detailed mechanisms underlying its substrate recognition and cleavage are not completely understood. We focused on the MRE β-loop, a conserved intramembrane β-hairpin-like structure, and investigated its role in substrate proteolysis by RseP. Deletion or Pro substitution in the MRE β-loop impaired substrate cleavage, indicating its critical role in the proteolytic function of RseP. Crosslinking and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the MRE β-loop was directly involved in substrate binding. Several Pro substitutions differentially affected RseP-catalysed proteolysis of substrates. Helix-destabilising mutations in substrate TMs suppressed the defects caused by mutations in the MRE β-loop in an allele-specific manner. These results collectively suggest that the MRE β-loop specifically recognises substrate TMs.</p><p>The proximal part of the MRE β-loop has a short β-strand (Ile<sup>72</sup>-Leu-Leu) in the reported crystal structure of mjS2P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2007</xref>). However, no secondary structure is assigned for the distal part of the MRE β-loop. Analysis of the secondary structure with STRIDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frishman and Argos, 1995</xref>) suggested that Val<sup>80</sup>-Ala-Met in the distal part forms a β-strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). This region is in an extended conformation with the side chains facing the opposite sides in an alternate manner (as expected for a β-strand) suggesting that this region forms a β-strand. Sequence-based prediction suggested that the MRE β-loops of RseP and SpoIVFB also have β-strands in the corresponding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that the MRE β-loop commonly assumes a β-hairpin-like structure.</p><p>Cys-scanning mutagenesis suggest that no specific residue in the MRE β-loop is essential for the proteolytic function of RseP because the Cys substitutions had little or only slight effect on the substrate cleavage. In contrast, substrate cleavage was severely impaired by Pro substitutions. These observations suggest that a higher-order structure of the MRE β-loop is important for the proteolytic function of RseP. Interestingly, some Pro substitutions in the MRE β-loop resulted in the differential cleavage of the 3 model substrates. Pulse-chase experiments showed that RseP(G68P)-HM significantly cleaved LY1 but only slightly cleaved RseA TM and YqfG TM. In contrast, RseP(K71P)-HM efficiently cleaved RseA TM and LY1 but only slightly cleaved YqfG TM. These 3 substrates were rapidly cleaved by wild-type RseP-HM. Therefore, the effects of MRE β-loop mutations cannot be simply explained by the intrinsic susceptibility of these substrates to RseP. In addition, some mutations in YqfG TM suppressed G67P and K71P mutations of the RseP MRE β-loop in an allele-specific manner. The I8P mutation improved the proteolysis by RseP(K71P)-HM but not by RseP(G67P)-HM, whereas the L12P mutation improved the proteolysis by RseP(G67P)-HM compared with that of RseP(K71P)-HM. Similarly the F21P, but not F20P, mutation in the LacY TM1 region (LY1) partially suppressed the V70P mutation of the RseP MRE β-loop. These results suggest that the MRE β-loop specifically recognises substrate TMs.</p><p>Direct evidence of MRE β-loop–substrate interaction was obtained by co-immunoprecipitation and crosslinking experiments. Pro substitutions in the MRE β-loop markedly decreased the co-immunoprecipitation of RseP-HM with HA-MBP-RseA after membrane solubilisation, suggesting that the integrity of the MRE β-loop is required for stable RseP–substrate interaction. Disulfide- and photo-crosslinking experiments showed that residues at positions 69 and 71 of the MRE β-loop contact with substrates. Cys residues at these positions disulfide-bonded with Cys residues on either side of the scissile bond in RseA. A similar result was reported recently for SpoIVFB and its substrate Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). A Cys residue in place of Val-70 in the MRE β-loop of SpoIVFB formed disulfide bonds with Cys residues at several positions around the cleavage site in Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>, suggesting that the MRE β-loop of SpoIVFB directly interacts with Pro-σ<sup>K</sup>. However, the role of the MRE β-loop in SpoIVFB function has not been investigated experimentally. Although RseP also has a Val residue at the position corresponding to Val-70 in SpoIVFB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), we did not observe any substrate crosslinking at this position. This might be due to differences in the mode of enzyme–substrate interaction between RseP and SpoIVFB. Indeed, the substrates of these enzymes show some differences. In contrast to RseA, which is a single-spanning membrane protein with type II orientation, Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> is suggested to be peripherally associated with the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, although helix-destabilising residues in substrate TMs are important for their efficient cleavage by RseP, these residues are not required for the cleavage of Pro-σ<sup>K</sup> by SpoIVFB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the role of the MRE β-loop in substrate binding and cleavage might slightly differ between RseP and SpoIVFB.</p><p>The N389L mutation in RseP TM3, which was previously shown to weaken the RseP-substrate interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koide et al., 2008</xref>), inhibited the in vivo photo-crosslinking of the MRE β-loop with RseA, suggesting that the observed crosslinking reflected a functional RseP–substrate interaction. The TM4 (corresponding to RseP TM3) of mjS2P that contains one of the active site residues (corresponding to Asp-402 in RseP TM3) can be located in the vicinity of the proteolytic active site and the MRE β-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2007</xref>). We previously showed that Cys introduced at the positions of Pro-397 and Pro-399 in RseP TM3 can form a disulfide bond with Cys at multiple positions of RseA TM. In mjS2P, the residues corresponding to Pro-397 and Pro-399 of RseP reside in a loop-like structure. The region containing residues 397 and 399 might be flexible and act with the MRE β-loop in stable binding of a substrate.</p><p>An α-helix is generally not amenable to proteolysis and unwinds to an extended structure to undergo cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wolfe, 2009</xref>). Many zinc metalloproteinases have a β-strand (edge strand) close to their proteolytic active site that binds to substrates in an extended conformation through β-strand addition and presents them to catalytic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stocker and Bode, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Langklotz et al., 2012</xref>). Our results suggest that the MRE β-loop stabilises the extended conformation of a substrate by directly binding to it through β-strand addition, thus promoting substrate cleavage in a manner similar to the edge strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Crosslinking at alternate positions in the Tyr<sup>69</sup>-Val-Lys region supports the idea that this region is in a β-strand conformation during its interaction with a substrate. According to this model, mutations that disrupt the secondary structure of the distal part of the MRE β-loop would compromise its interaction with a substrate. Introduction of a Pro residue will disturb substrate accommodation through β-strand addition or interstrand interaction because Pro residues cannot serve as hydrogen bond donors because of the absence of the amide proton. Moreover, if the compromised interaction of the MRE β-loop with a substrate prevents efficient conformational conversion of the substrate TM and decreases its cleavage efficiency, destabilisation of the α-helical structure of the substrate TM might improve its cleavage by RseP MRE β-loop mutants, which is consistent with our results. A recent structural study of <italic>E. coli</italic> GlpG that belongs to the rhomboid family of I-CLiPs revealed that the P1–P4 region of a substrate forms a β-sheet with the GlpG loop 3 located near the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zoll et al., 2014</xref>). Mutations in loop 3 severely compromise the GlpG activity, suggesting the interaction between the substrate and loop 3 is functionally important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker and Urban, 2012</xref>). Although the loop 3 of GlpG and the MRE β-loop of RseP differ in that the former is located near the periplasmic surface of the membrane and forms a parallel β-sheet with a substrate whereas the latter is located near the cytoplasmic surface and forms a anti-parallel β-sheet, they might have a similar role in stabilising an extended substrate structure and promoting its cleavage.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08928.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model describing the function of the MRE β-loop.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The periplasmic PDZ tandem of RseP acts as a size-exclusion filter to discriminate between substrates based on the size of their periplasmic region.

MRE β-loop-assisted cleavage of a substrate may be affected by helix stability and amino acid sequence of substrate TMs. We recently suggested that the periplasmic PDZ tandem of RseP acts as a size-exclusion filter to prevent the cleavage of substrates with bulky periplasmic domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hizukuri et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we observed that RseP did not cleave YoaJ, a type II membrane protein with a very small periplasmic domain, suggesting the presence of additional mechanism(s) for substrate discrimination. In vivo photo-crosslinking experiments suggest that the MRE β-loop interacts with RseA after site 1 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) and that it acts as the second checkpoint for membrane proteins that passed the first check by the PDZ filter and contributes to their selective proteolysis. It should be noted that mjS2P does not have PDZ domains. Thus, the MRE β-loop could play a central role in cleaving specific substrates in this enzyme.</p><p>Although the MRE β-loop may not interact with intact RseA, our previous chemical crosslinking and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that RseP directly interacted with intact RseA in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanehara et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that RseP has a separate binding site (exosite) for intact RseA. Because the PDZ filter excludes intact RseA from the intramolecular active site, the presumed exosite may exist on the external surface of the enzyme. Other families of I-CLiPs such as rhomboid and γ-secretase have also been suggested to have an exosite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kornilova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Strisovsky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Watanabe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arutyunova et al., 2014</xref>). A systematic in vivo crosslinking approach would help in identifying binding sites for intact RseA. This along with the structural analysis of RseP, especially in complex with a substrate, would be essential for verifying our model and for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying substrate recognition and intramembrane proteolysis by RseP. Further, we would like to study the physiological significance of RseP-catalysed cleavage of YqfG and identify additional substrates of RseP to elucidate all the cellular roles of RseP.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains</title><p>All the bacterial strains used in this study are derivatives of <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 and are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Other plasmids were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis by using appropriate combinations of primers and template plasmids. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pMZ14 was constructed by cloning a PCR-amplified fragment encoding YqfG into the SalI–PstI site of pSTD835 and by ligating an EcoRI–HindIII fragment of the resulting plasmid with EcoRI-/HindIII-digested pSTD689. pKA195 was constructed by cloning a 0.6 kb EcoRI–HindIII fragment of pYH18 in the same site of pSTD689. For construction of pKA210, first, a PCR-amplified fragment encoding YoaJ was cloned in the SalI–PstI site of pSTD835, and then an EcoRI–HindIII fragment of the resulting plasmid was ligated with EcoRI-/HindIII-digested pSTD689. pKA268 was constructed by cloning a 1.4 kb EcoRI–HindIII fragment of pMZ14 in the same site of pUC118.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Media</title><p>L medium (10 g/l bactotryptone, 5 g/l yeast extract and 5 g/l NaCl; pH adjusted to 7.2 by using NaOH) and M9 medium (without CaCl<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller, 1972</xref>) were used for bacterial cultivation.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agree that this manuscript is broadly suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. It addresses a fundamental issue of high significance and broad interest. The issues that all agree need addressing before it could be accepted are as follows:</p><p>1) How general is the compensatory effect of the helix-destabilizing mutations in the substrate? Do they have a similar effect when introduced into YqfG or RseA? Testing the effect of helix destabilizing mutants would shed further light on the mechanism.</p><p>2) Does RseP interact with YoaJ, a non-substrate? If it does, can YoaJ inhibit cleavage of RseA or YqfG? In other words, is the binding site in the MRE β-loop separated from another binding site for the rest of the transmembrane domain, in a mechanistic analogy to what was proposed for rhomboids (Strisovsky et al., Mol Cell 2009)?</p><p>3) Comparisons with rhomboid mechanisms should be discussed in more detail. The first evidence for an exosite was published by Strisovsky et al., and a recent paper with a structure of a rhomboid in complex with a peptide substrate has suggested that the L3 loop might have a similar role.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> we are presented with a model of the MRE β−loop. The structure of this region is important since residues along on face of the strand 68-71 appear to be involved in substrate recognition, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>.

Do they have a similar effect when introduced into YqfG or RseA? Testing the effect of helix destabilizing mutants would shed further light on the mechanism.</italic></p><p>To address the above problem, we first constructed HA-MBP-RseA148 derivatives with a Pro substitution in the RseA TM region, but we found that many of these mutants were not cleaved even by wild type RseP. As the RseA TM has unusually low hydrophobicity (for example, TMHMM program does not predict the RseA TM as a “true” TM segment), we suppose that the Pro substitutions would interfere with membrane integration. We thus used HA-MBP-RseA(LY1)148. We found that the F21P mutation in LY1 significantly improved the cleavage of LY1 by RseP(V70P)-HM, an MRE β-loop mutant almost defective in cleavage of wild type LY1, but the Pro substitution of the neighbouring residue Phe-20 did not, suggesting that Pro substitutions could generally suppress the MRE β-loop mutations in an allele-specific manner. These points were described in Results (subsection “Suppression of MRE β-loop mutations by destabilising substrate TM helices”) and Discussion (fourth paragraph) and the data was presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Does RseP interact with YoaJ, a non-substrate? If it does, can YoaJ inhibit cleavage of RseA or YqfG? In other words, is the binding site in the MRE β-loop separated from another binding site for the rest of the transmembrane domain, in a mechanistic analogy to what was proposed for rhomboids (Strisovsky et al., Mol Cell 2009)?</italic></p><p>Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that HA-MBP-YoaJ can interact with RseP. On the other hand, the HA-MBP-YoaJ did not stably interact with the RsePΔloop mutant, suggesting that the MRE β-loop might directly or indirectly affect the binding of YoaJ to RseP. However, overexpression of HA-MBP-YoaJ little affected the RseP-dependent cleavage of co-expressed RseA. It would be possible that YoaJ interacts with the MRE β-loop with much lower affinity than RseA does in the membrane, although similar amounts of RseP was pulled down with YoaJ and RseA after membrane solubilization. Alternatively, the binding sites for YoaJ and RseA (and other cleavable substrates) are not the same. In this case, the deletion of the MRE β-loop might indirectly affect the YoaJ-binding site. Further detailed investigation will be needed to characterize the nature of YoaJ-binding to RseP and we would like to address this issue in future study. These points were described in Results (subsection “The MRE β-loop is important for stable substrate–RseP interaction”) and the data was presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) Comparisons with rhomboid mechanisms should be discussed in more detail. The first evidence for an exosite was published by Strisovsky et al., and a recent paper with a structure of a rhomboid in complex with a peptide substrate has suggested that the L3 loop might have a similar role</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the helpful suggestions. We now state that an exosite has been reported for Rhomboid and cite the study by Strisovsky et al. in the Discussion. We also discuss similarity of GlpG (<italic>E. coli</italic> rhomboid protease) L3 loop to the MRE β-loop in substrate binding/recognition.</p><p><italic>4) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref> <italic>we are presented with a model of the MRE β−loop.

For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, the polypeptide backbone is simply extracted from the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> (the structure of mjS2P) and the amino acid residues of the corresponding region of RseP are assigned on the model. Secondary structure of the MRE β−loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) is assigned based on the analysis of amino acid sequences by PsiPred (for RseP and SpoIVFB) or the analysis of the crystal structure by STRIDE (for mjS2P). We clearly state these points in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, and in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>5) Previous work in the lab has identified helix 3 of RseP as important in substrate recognition. This should be brought into the Discussion and placed in context of where TM3 resides in relation to the MRE β−loop</italic>.</p><p>The crystal structures of mjS2P have been reported. The TM4 (corresponding to RseP TM3) of mjS2P that contains one of the active site residues can be located in the vicinity of the proteolytic active site and the MRE β-loop. We have previously shown that Cys introduced at the positions of Pro-397 and Pro-399 in RseP TM3 can form a disulfide bond with Cys at multiple positions of RseA TM. In mjS2P, the residues corresponding to Pro-397 and Pro-399 of RseP reside in a loop-like structure in TM4. The region containing residues 397 and 399 might be flexible and act with the MRE β-loop in stable binding of a substrate. This point is described in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
