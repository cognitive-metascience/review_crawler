It remains unclear how these motors move along MTs densely coated with obstacles of various sizes in the cytoplasm. Here, we tested the ability of single and multiple motors to bypass synthetic obstacles on MTs in vitro. Contrary to previous reports, we found that single mammalian dynein is highly capable of bypassing obstacles. Single human kinesin-1 motors fail to avoid obstacles, consistent with their inability to take sideways steps on to neighboring MT protofilaments. Kinesins overcome this limitation when working in teams, bypassing obstacles as effectively as multiple dyneins. Cargos driven by multiple kinesins or dyneins are also capable of rotating around the MT to bypass large obstacles. These results suggest that multiplicity of motors is required not only for transporting cargos over long distances and generating higher forces, but also for maneuvering cargos on obstacle-coated MT surfaces.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kinesin</kwd><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>intracellular transport</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM094522</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yildiz</surname><given-names>Ahmet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1055017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yildiz</surname><given-names>Ahmet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1617028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yildiz</surname><given-names>Ahmet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM123655-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferro</surname><given-names>Luke S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dynein bypasses obstacles on microtubules more efficiently than single kinesin, and kinesins overcome this limitation when transporting intracellular cargos in teams.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kinesin and dynein move towards the plus- and minus-ends of MTs, respectively, and play major roles in intracellular cargo transport, cell locomotion, and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Verhey et al., 2011</xref>). Although these motors have complementary functions on MTs, they have distinct structural and mechanistic features. Kinesin-1 contains a globular motor domain that binds the MT and hydrolyzes ATP. Two identical motor domains are connected by a short neck-linker to a common tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Verhey et al., 2011</xref>). In vitro studies have shown that kinesin moves by coordinated stepping of its motor domains, in a manner akin to human walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yildiz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asbury et al., 2003</xref>). It follows a single protofilament track on the MT and almost exclusively steps forward without frequent sideways or backward motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ray et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Can et al., 2014</xref>). Unlike kinesin, dynein’s motor domains are large heterohexameric rings of AAA+ ATPase subunits that connect to the MT through a coiled-coil stalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>). Stepping of the dynein motor domains is not tightly coordinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeWitt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>). Instead, either monomer can take a step while the other serves as an MT tether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeWitt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>). Dynein has a large diffusional component in its stepping behavior, resulting in frequent sideways and backward steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeWitt et al., 2012</xref>). Differences in the stepping behaviors between these motors may influence their cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hancock, 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48629.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Single dynein motors, but not kinesin motors, bypass QD obstacles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of single-molecule motility assays on surface-immobilized MTs decorated with streptavidin-coated QD585 obstacles.

The MT network is densely decorated with obstacles such as MT-associated proteins (MAPs), stationary organelles, protein aggregates, MT defects, opposing motor traffic and other cytoskeletal filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dixit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Che et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liang et al., 2016</xref>). It is not well understood how motors transport cargos efficiently throughout the cell despite these challenges. Previous in vitro studies suggested that motors need to take sideways steps to avoid obstacles on their path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>). In agreement with this idea, kinesin motility is strongly inhibited by obstacles such as catalytically-inactive motors, MAPs or cell extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dixit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Telley et al., 2009</xref>). While these motors can occasionally bypass obstacles by detaching and reattaching to neighboring protofilaments, they stall or detach from the MT in most cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leduc et al., 2012</xref>). Kinesin-2, a different kinesin family member with faster MT detachment/reattachment kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2018</xref>) and increased side-stepping ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoeprich et al., 2014</xref>), bypasses obstacles more successfully than kinesin-1. Dynein was expected to be less sensitive to obstacles than kinesin because of its elongated structure and frequent sideways stepping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeWitt et al., 2012</xref>). Yet, in vitro studies on isolated mammalian dynein observed that the motor reverses direction when encountering a MAP obstacle rather than bypassing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dixit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Soundararajan and Bullock, 2014</xref>). However, these studies were conducted before it was understood that mammalian dynein alone is autoinhibited and its activation requires assembly with dynactin and a cargo adaptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trokter et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, how active dynein motors bypass obstacles on MTs is not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ruensern Tan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elshenawy et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Unlike helicases, unfoldases and DNA/RNA polymerases, which usually function as individual motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>), cytoskeletal motors often operate in teams to transport a cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Encalada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Levi et al., 2006</xref>). Multiple motors carry cargos with increased processivity relative to single motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Derr et al., 2012</xref>), which is essential for long-range transport in cell types such as neurons. Teams of motors also exert higher forces, which may enable the transport of large cargos through the dense cellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blehm et al., 2013</xref>). It has been proposed that cargos with multiple motors also avoid obstacles more effectively than single motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hancock, 2014</xref>). A recent study found that multi-kinesin cargos pause at MT defects rather than detach like single motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liang et al., 2016</xref>). Ensembles of two kinesin-1 motors linked together with a DNA scaffold have a higher run length than single kinesins, but their run length was also decreased in the presence of neutravidin obstacles on the MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2018</xref>). Motility of multiple dyneins has not been studied on MTs decorated with obstacles. Therefore, it is not well understood whether cargos driven by multiple motors bypass obstacles more successfully than single motors.</p><p>Here, we challenge single- and multi-motor cargos of kinesin and dynein with quantum dot (QD) and tubulin antibody obstacles on MTs. We find that kinesin and dynein employ different mechanisms to bypass these obstacles. Consistent with their ability to take side-steps, single dynein motors efficiently navigate around obstacles. Unlike dynein, single kinesins are strongly inhibited by QDs and antibodies on MTs yet overcome this limitation when working together as a team. The multiplicity of motors was also critical to bypass large roadblocks. When cargos driven by a team of kinesin or dynein motors face a wall along their path, they swing around the MT without net forward movement and continue moving forward. Together, our results provide insight into how motors transport intracellular cargos along obstacle-coated MT surfaces.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single dyneins, but not kinesins, bypass obstacles</title><p>Previous studies used rigor motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>), cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Telley et al., 2009</xref>) or MAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dixit et al., 2008</xref>) to study how motors move in the presence of obstacles. Because some of these obstacles have complex binding kinetics to MTs, vary in size, and interact with motors directly, it is difficult to discern how their presence on the MT obstructs motility. We sought a model obstacle that stably attached to the MT, had a well-defined size and formed no specific interactions with motors. To this end, we decorated biotinylated MTs with streptavidin-conjugated QDs (25 nm in diameter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeWitt et al., 2012</xref>). These QDs have a bright and photostable fluorescent emission, which enable us to measure their linear density along MTs.</p><p>We studied the motility of human kinesin-1, yeast cytoplasmic dynein, and mammalian dynein/dynactin/BicD2N (DDB) in the presence and absence of QD obstacles. Human kinesin-1 was truncated at its coiled-coil stalk (expressing amino acids 1–560) and fused to GFP and HaloTag at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belyy et al., 2016</xref>). The N-terminal tail domain of yeast cytoplasmic dynein was replaced with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag for dimerization and a HaloTag for labeling (GST–Dyn331kD, expressing amino acids 1219–4093 of the dynein heavy chain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>). The DDB complex was assembled using full-length human cytoplasmic dynein, pig brain dynactin and N-terminal coiled-coil of mouse BicD2 (BicD2N). To facilitate DDB assembly, we used a human dynein mutant that does not form the autoinhibited conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Motors were labeled with excess QDs of a different color on their tail region, and their motility on surface-immobilized MTs was monitored using multicolor imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The run lengths of kinesin-QD complexes (2.1 ± 0.2 µm, mean ± SD) were similar to kinesin motors labeled with an organic dye (p=0.21, two-tailed t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>), suggesting that QDs were driven by single motors.</p><p>The surface density of QD obstacles was varied, with a maximum decoration of 12 QDs µm<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Consistent with dynein’s ability to take side-steps, we found that single yeast dynein and DDB motors walked processively even at the highest QD density tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeWitt et al., 2012</xref>). We did not see evidence of motor reversals when DDB encountered a QD obstacle, suggesting that previously observed reversals of mammalian dynein might be due to diffusive motion of this motor in the absence of dynactin and a cargo adaptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trokter et al., 2012</xref>). While mobile fraction, velocity and run length of yeast dynein were reduced 30–70% by increasing density of QDs, DDB motility was less sensitive to obstacles. In comparison to dynein motors, kinesin motility was severely affected by the QDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). The majority of kinesins became stuck on the MT with the addition of QDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). At low QD density (1–2 µm<sup>−1</sup>), the mobile fraction was reduced 90%, while the run length and velocity were reduced by 60% compared to the 0 QDs µm<sup>−1</sup> (p=0.0003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Kinesin motility could not be analyzed at higher QD densities because we did not detect processive runs longer than 250 nm under these conditions. Collectively, these results show that kinesin remains bound to an MT but is unable to move forward when it encounters a QD obstacle.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-48629-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48629.004</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Motility of DDB motors is not strongly affected by the QD obstacles.</title><p>DDB motors were labeled with QD655 at their N-termini.

Even at the lowest QD density, most kinesin motors were immotile throughout the recording, suggesting that kinesin has a high likelihood of permanently pausing when encountering a QD. Trajectories of the remaining processive motors were interspersed with frequent pauses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We analyzed the trajectories of these motors before they permanently paused or dissociated from the MT and calculated the residence times of motors per distance traveled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Residence times were composed of two distinct states. A fast state corresponded to processive motility of the motor along MTs, and a slow state represented transient pauses in motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We calculated the density and length of pauses from the frequency and decay time of the slow state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Strikingly, kinesin pause density increased two-fold and pause time increased four-fold at 2 QDs µm<sup>−1</sup>. In contrast, pause density and duration of yeast dynein and DDB were only modestly increased by the QD density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Transient pauses may correspond to detachment of kinesin when encountering an obstacle and reattachment to a nearby protofilament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>).

It is possible that bulky obstacles such as QDs may hinder motor movement more than proteins. To test this idea, we labeled kinesin motors with Cy3 dye instead of a QD. In assembling the dynein complex, mouse BicDR1 with a C-terminal SNAP tag was labeled with LD555 and incubated with dynein/dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Urnavicius et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, we decorated the MTs with anti-tubulin antibody obstacles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Because antibodies are small in size (~150 kDa), they likely block fewer protofilaments than QD obstacles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to QD obstacles, we see that single kinesin motors are more strongly inhibited by antibody obstacles than DDB (p=0.013 for velocity and 0.01 for run length, two-tailed t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>).

In contrast to QD-obstacles, there was not a significant difference between the mobile fraction of kinesin and dynein at 20 µg/mL antibody (p=0.15, two-tailed t-test). Consistent with a previous study that used rigor kinesin as an obstacle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>), we did not observe extended pauses of kinesin motors. Thus, antibody obstacles inhibit kinesin by causing them to detach rather than pausing for extended periods. Collectively, our results show that single kinesins detach from MT when encountering small protein obstacles.

As a result, surface immobilization may serve as an additional obstacle as the motors attempt to bypass the QDs. MTs in the cell, however, are freely suspended in 3D. This may allow motors to fully explore the MT surface and more successfully bypass the obstacles. To test this possibility, we constructed ‘MT bridges’ by immobilizing MT ends to polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) ridges on either end of a 10 µm deep valley (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In this study, we investigated the ability of kinesin and dynein to bypass permanent obstacles using in vitro reconstitution and single-molecule imaging. These results show that kinesin and dynein utilize different mechanisms to bypass these obstacles. Despite their large size, single dyneins were highly capable of maneuvering around obstacles on the MT. In contrast, single kinesins were strongly inhibited by obstacles, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dixit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leduc et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Telley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>). These results are likely a consequence of differences in the sidestepping ability of the two motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Can et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeWitt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ray et al., 1993</xref>). Remarkably, multiple kinesins were able to bypass these obstacles as efficiently as dyneins. In the case of multi-motor cargos, we anticipate that kinesin motors are just as likely to get stuck at an obstacle as a single motor. However, the other motors driving the cargo may exert a force on the stuck motor, causing its rapid detachment and the continued forward motion of the cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tjioe et al., 2019</xref>). In this process, new motors in the leading direction are recruited to the lattice while the motors in the trailing direction detach from the MT. Alternatively, a team of motors carrying the cargo pause until they move sideways either by stepping to neighboring protofilaments or because stochastic shifts in the center of mass of the bead allow for unbound motors to attach to adjacent protofilaments. Addressing the mechanism of obstacle avoidance of multiple motors will require future studies at higher spatial resolution.</p><p>Multi-motor teamwork also proved beneficial for both types of motors when challenged by a large obstacle. Cargo beads driven by multiple kinesin or dynein motors were able to maneuver around a PDMS obstruction that blocked access to half of the MT surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This behavior helps explain how cargoes bypass large cellular roadblocks such as stationary organelles or intersecting cytoskeletal filaments. Recent measurements observed rotational motion in the trajectories of endosomal cargos carrying gold nanorods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaplan et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, correlative live-cell and super-resolution microscopy showed that rotational movement could be used by cargos to avoid steric obstacles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Verdeny-Vilanova et al., 2017</xref>). These studies proposed that rotational movement and off-axis stepping might result from having a mix of motors, such as kinesin-2 or dynein, on the cargo along with kinesin-1. While transient back-and-forth movement of cargo may allow it to change the protofilament track, our results clearly show that tug-of-war between opposite polarity motors is not required to bypass large obstacles. Instead, cargo beads driven by multiple motors can switch to the other side of the MT surface by rotation, when only one type of motor is active at a time. We also showed that fluidity of the cargo is not essential for this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Verdeny-Vilanova et al., 2017</xref>). These results show that multiplicity of motors not only increases the collective force generation and the length of processive runs on an MT but also enables motors to maneuver around obstacles in their path. Future studies are required to address how the motor copy number affects the ability of cargoes to bypass dynamic obstacles, such as MAPs.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

After pouring over the master, the PDMS was cured for 1 hr at 80°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Features were confirmed with helium ion microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The PDMS was then removed from the mask and baked for an additional 1 week at 80°C. To extract low molecular weight species that diffuse to the surface and alter surface chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eddington et al., 2006</xref>), PDMS was incubated, in sequence, with triethylamine, ethyl acetate, and acetone and allowed to dry overnight in an oven.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>MT bridges</title><p>Silanization of PDMS was similar to glass with a few modifications. Ethanol was used as the solvent rather than acetone, as it is less likely to swell the PDMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2003</xref>). The patterned surface was plasma oxidized at 50 W and 200 mTorr for 1 min. The slab was then immediately immersed in a 5% (v/v) solution of APTES in HPLC-grade ethanol (Sigma, 459828) for 20 min. After rinsing in 95% ethanol/water, the PDMS was baked 40 min on a hot plate. To remove unbound silane, PDMS was rinsed in pure ethanol and then water, and baked for an additional 40 min. Finally, PDMS was incubated for 1 hr in an 8% glutaraldehyde solution. Excess glutaraldehyde was removed by rinsing in water and the functionalized PDMS was stored at room temperature for 1 week. To create a flow chamber, uncured PDMS was spin-coated on a coverslip to a thickness of 100 µm. After baking, a channel was cut in the PDMS-coated coverslip, and the surface was plasma oxidized. The PDMS block with the bridge pattern was placed functional-side down on the coverslip, creating a flow cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Motility assays were performed as described for single-molecule assays. The sample was imaged using a 1.4 NA oil-immersion condenser (Nikon) under brightfield illumination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Anti-GFP coating beads</title><p>Latex beads were coated with anti-GFP antibody as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belyy et al., 2016</xref>). To prevent clumping of the beads when incubated with high concentrations of motors, we used ‘CML’ beads (ThermoFisher, C37481), which have a high density of carboxyl groups that facilitate charge repulsion. 200 µL of 0.5 µm diameter CML beads (4% solids) were washed three times in activation buffer (10 mM MES, 100 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.0) by centrifugation for 6 min at 7,000 <italic>g</italic>. Final resuspension was in 200 µL activation buffer. Beads were then sonicated for 1 min in a bath sonicator (Vevor). Separately, fresh 4 mg/mL solutions of EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride, ThermoFisher) and Sulfo-NHS (N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide) were prepared in water. 5 µL each of fresh EDC and Sulfo-NHS solutions were added to the beads. Beads were sonicated for 1 min and nutated for 30 min at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, beads were resuspended in 200 µL PBS and mixed with 200 µL 0.4 mg/mL anti-GFP antibody overnight with nutation. Custom-made anti-GFP antibodies (Covance) were purified by GFP affinity chromatography. The beads were passivated by incubating with 10 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) overnight. Finally, beads were washed five times in PBS and stored at 4°C with 1 mg/mL BSA supplement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Bead motility assay</title><p>For bead motility assays, anti-GFP beads were diluted two-fold in water and sonicated for 1 min to disperse the beads. GFP-tagged kinesin motors were incubated with beads for 10 min. The excess motor was then washed from the beads by diluting the mixture into 100 µL BRB80 supplemented with 1 mg/ml casein (BRB-C) and centrifuging at 8,000 <italic>g</italic> for 3 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 15 µL BRB-C supplemented with 1 mM TCEP, 100 µM ATP, glucose oxidase, catalase, and 0.4% dextrose. Beads were then flown into a flow chamber after surface-immobilization of biotinylated MTs. DDB experiments were performed similarly with a few exceptions. The GFP handle was on the cargo adaptor (BicD2N-GFP). We used a dynein mutant that does not form the autoinhibited phi-conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) to facilitate assembly of the DDB complex. 1 µL each of 1 µM human dynein complex, pig brain dynactin, and BicD2N-GFP were mixed at a 1:1:1 molar ratio and incubated for 15 min before mixing with the beads. The mixture was pelleted at 8,000 <italic>g</italic>, resuspended in 15 µL MB supplemented with 1 mg/mL casein, 1 mM TCEP, 100 µM ATP, glucose oxidase, catalase and dextrose and added to the flow chamber.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Each measurement was performed with at least three independent replicates, and the exact number of repetitions is reported for each experiment. Each statistical analysis method is explicitly stated in the main text and/or figure legend. ‘n’ refers to the number of motors analyzed across all experimental replicates. ‘Independent experiments’ mean data collected on different days using the same protein preparation. However, all major findings were repeated with multiple different protein preparations. Standard deviations (SD) represent differences between independent experiments.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Robert Anthony Cross (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting study comparing the abilities of cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin-1 to step around large obstacles attached to the microtubule lattice. Previous roadblock experiments, of which there are many, did not use a full length dynein in complex with BicD and dynactin. Also, the obstacles used here are larger than those used in any previous study (25nm diameter quantum dots (QD), or a bar of PDMS). The main result is that single dynein-BicD molecules, and to a lesser extent single yeast dynein molecules, can circumvent large obstacles. A subsidiary result is that beads carrying multiple kinesins can also move around obstacles, whereas single kinesin molecules cannot.</p><p>All reviewers found this study interesting, but they raised the following major concerns that need to be addressed for you to submit a revised manuscript:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Controls are required to address the question to which extent the results are specific for the combination of large obstacle and fluorescent label used here (QDs). Looking at the literature, there seems to be a tendency that larger obstacles like quantum dots may hinder motor movement more than proteins. For controls, motors could be labelled with a small fluorophore which could be attached to the Halotag and/or smaller proteins could be used as obstacles (e.g. rigor kinesins or streptavidins).</p><p>2) The 'stuck' state observed for kinesin is quite different from what most studies have reported for single kinesins with smaller dyes encountering smaller obstacles. The same controls suggested above could shed light on this discrepancy with the literature.</p><p>3) In discussing the circumvention of obstacles, 'rotation' of the motor-bead is used in two different senses and the distinction is not made clearly. Migration of the motor-bead complex around the MT is one kind of rotation. Rotation of the multimotor-bead around its own centre (rolling) as it does this is another kind of rotation. Directional rolling as the bead migrates around the MT axis would indicate that new motors are being recruited into the interface with the lattice. Alternatively, motors might just maintain diffusional attachment to the MT by marching on the spot until the team drifts sideways passively around the obstruction, without generating sideways force impulses? Is there evidence that sideways motion across the lattice is &quot;driven by forces exerted by the motors&quot;? These questions deserve more discussion.</p><p>4) Some technical clarifications should be provided:</p><p>4a) It was unclear how the authors know that their kinesin-QD complexes correspond to single kinesin molecules. Are there measurements on the GFP fluorescence versus the QD fluorescence? Run length might give reassurance that these complexes are single molecules. Data in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 show run length above 2 µm, which seems little long for a single molecule? If there are fluorescence ratio measurements, can an estimate be made of the number of kinesins needed to make a multimolecule team capable of circumventing obstacles?</p><p>4b) Please explain in more detail how the number of QDs on a microtubule was calculated from the intensity of the QD spots?</p><p>4c) Figure 2C: It seems that n means the number of samples scored. Was the number of replicates only one (meaning, both the protein preparation and the assay were performed only once for each data point in the figure)? Has the standard error been derived from regression analysis that was applied to a single data set? Please explain the statistical details.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48629.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Controls are required to address the question to which extent the results are specific for the combination of large obstacle and fluorescent label used here (QDs).

We labeled motors with fluorescent dyes and decorated MTs with tubulin antibody obstacles. As predicted by the reviewers, antibody obstacles inhibit kinesin motility by causing them to detach from MT rather than getting stuck. These data are presented in a new Figure 3. and the results are discussed in the main text as follows:</p><p>“Kinesin quickly detaches from MTs decorated with antibody obstacles</p><p>Previous studies have reported that kinesin motors detach when encountering catalytically “dead” motors or MAPs on the MT rather than getting stuck (Telley et al., 2009, Schneider et al., 2015). […] However, kinesin motors that carry a rigid QD cargo are more likely to pause when encountering a bulkier obstacle on an MT.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In discussing the circumvention of obstacles, 'rotation' of the motor-bead is used in two different senses and the distinction is not made clearly.

We did not study the mechanism by which the beads move from one side of an MT to the other side on PDMS walls. Therefore, we cannot distinguish between the possibilities of “rolling of the bead” or sideways stepping of the motors bound to the bead. We revised the Discussion to mention these possibilities. We have also mentioned forced detachment of motors from MT as a possibility, rather than as a fact, in Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><p>We also noted that the rotation of the beads around the PDMS wall is different than the helical movement of the beads. In the former, the beads do not move along the MT long axis until they move to the top of the wall, whereas in the latter, the majority of the movement occurs in the longitudinal direction. We wrote: &quot;This movement was different from the previously observed helical movement of kinesin- or dynein-driven cargos around the MT, in which rotation is accompanied by forward translational movement.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some technical clarifications should be provided:</p><p>4a) It was unclear how the authors know that their kinesin-QD complexes correspond to single kinesin molecules. Are there measurements on the GFP fluorescence versus the QD fluorescence? Run length might give reassurance that these complexes are single molecules. Data in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 show run length above 2 µm, which seems little long for a single molecule? If there are fluorescence ratio measurements, can an estimate be made of the number of kinesins needed to make a multimolecule team capable of circumventing obstacles?</p></disp-quote><p>To make our measurement more consistent with the field, we reported the half-life of the exponential decay (rather than the decay constant) as the motor run length in the revised manuscript. The corrected run length for kinesin-QD in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 is 2.5 ± 0.4 µm (mean ± SD).</p><p>To determine if this run length is abnormally high, we measured the run lengths of kinesin motors labeled with LD555 (Lumidyne) dye. This dye is directly conjugated to Trolox, which increases its photostability. The run length of kinesin-LD555 (1.95 ± 0.03 µm, mean ± SD) is not significantly different from QD-tagged motors (p = 0.21, two-tailed t-test). To prevent attachment of multiple kinesins to a single QD, we always kept QDs in excess of motors during the labeling reactions. In Materials and methods, we wrote: “2 µM of these QDs were mixed with 100-500 nM motors fused with a SNAPTag or HaloTag for 10 min on ice.” Therefore, it is unlikely that the QDs are driven by multiple motors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4b) Please explain in more detail how the number of QDs on a microtubule was calculated from the intensity of the QD spots?</p></disp-quote><p>This information was added to the “Motility” section in the Materials and methods: “At low QD concentrations, the linear density of QD-obstacles on the MT was measured by counting the number of fluorescent spots from TIRF images. At higher QD concentrations, the linear density was estimated from the ratio of total fluorescence signal on an MT to the fluorescence intensity of a single QD.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4c) Figure 2C: It seems that n means the number of samples scored.
