In vitro studies suggest a novel approach to controlling seizures in SE: acute inhibition of estrogen synthesis in the brain. Here, we show in rats that systemic administration of an aromatase (estrogen synthase) inhibitor after seizure onset strongly suppresses both electrographic and behavioral seizures induced by kainic acid (KA). We found that KA-induced SE stimulates synthesis of estradiol (E2) in the hippocampus, a brain region commonly involved in seizures and where E2 is known to acutely promote neural activity. Hippocampal E2 levels were higher in rats experiencing more severe seizures. Consistent with a seizure-promoting effect of hippocampal estrogen synthesis, intra-hippocampal aromatase inhibition also suppressed seizures. These results reveal neurosteroid estrogen synthesis as a previously unknown factor in the escalation of seizures and suggest that acute administration of aromatase inhibitors may be an effective treatment for SE.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12917.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12917.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12917.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Seizures occur when connected groups of cells in the brain become over-active and fire together. Current anti-seizure medications work by reducing brain activity generally. Although this is often effective in controlling seizures, it can also lead to negative side effects like drowsiness, dizziness or difficulty concentrating. A better alternative would be to target a factor that promotes activity especially during seizures.</p><p>Most people think of estrogens as being female sex hormones. However, estrogens are also made in the brain of both sexes, where they could promote activity during seizures. Sato and Woolley therefore set out to test a two-part hypothesis: that seizures stimulate the production of estrogen in the brain, and that inhibiting this production process just as seizures begin would make seizures less severe.</p><p>Sato and Woolley studied male and female rats and found that in both sexes, seizures stimulate the production of estrogens in the hippocampus – a part of the brain that is often involved in seizures. Because estrogens are known to increase the activity of cells in the hippocampus, this suggested that estrogens that are produced in the brain during seizures could make seizures worse. Sato and Woolley tested this by injecting rats with a drug that inhibits estrogen production, called an aromatase inhibitor, shortly after seizures began. The drug strongly suppressed seizures, whereas control rats that did not receive the injection continued to have seizures.</p><p>Overall, Sato and Woolley show that the production of estrogen in the brain escalates seizure activity, and suggest that aromatase inhibitors may be useful for controlling seizures. Several questions remain that require further study. How does seizure activity lead to estrogen being made in the brain? How do estrogen levels go back down after a seizure? What circumstances other than seizures stimulate brain estrogen production, and what roles does this production process play in activity that is not related to seizures?</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12917.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12917.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>microdialysis</kwd><kwd>estradiol</kwd><kwd>seizure</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>kainic acid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS037324</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woolley</surname><given-names>Catherine S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000124</institution-id><institution>Office of Research on Women's Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS037324</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woolley</surname><given-names>Catherine S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Seizures stimulate estrogen synthesis in the brain and acutely inhibiting brain estrogen synthesis suppresses seizures, in both sexes, without additional interventions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Status epilepticus (SE) is a common neurological emergency characterized by a prolonged seizure episode. ~One-third of SE cases are refractory to first line (benzodiazepine) and second line (anti-epileptic drug) treatments, and often require pharmacologically induced coma to control seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Novy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Betjemann and Lowenstein, 2015</xref>). The overall mortality rate of SE is estimated at 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeLorenzo et al., 1995</xref>) and patients who recover have an increased likelihood of subsequent unprovoked seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hesdorffer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holtkamp et al., 2005</xref>). Thus there is a need for new approaches to acute seizure control.</p><p>Estrogens have long been known to be proconvulsant, both in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Terasawa and Timiras, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicoletti et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buterbaugh and Hudson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edwards et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Woolley, 2000</xref>) and in human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bäckström, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herzog et al., 1997</xref>). Most studies have assumed that the estrogens relevant to seizures are of ovarian origin and so have studied estrogen regulation of seizures on the time scale of the reproductive cycle. However, accumulating evidence suggests that synthesis of estrogens in the brain as neurosteroids could acutely promote neural activity, especially in the hippocampus, a limbic brain region commonly involved in seizures.</p><p>The hippocampus of both sexes contains enzymatic machinery to synthesize estrogens, including 17β-estradiol (E2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hojo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kretz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tabatadze et al., 2014</xref>), and studies in primary hippocampal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prange-Kiel et al., 2003)</xref>, slice cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kretz et al., 2004</xref>) and acute slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hojo et al., 2004</xref>) show that the hippocampus can synthesize E2 in vitro. In hippocampal slices, E2 levels were increased by 30 min of NMDA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hojo et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that neurosteroid E2 synthesis may be stimulated by neural activity. In vitro studies also show that E2 acutely promotes neural activity. For example, E2 applied to hippocampal slices increases neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Teyler et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumar and Foster, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wu et al., 2011</xref>), potentiates excitatory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wong and Moss, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kramar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smejkalova and Woolley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oberlander and Woolley, 2016</xref>), and suppresses inhibitory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang and Woolley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tabatadze et al., 2015</xref>), on a time scale of minutes. Thus, in vitro studies indicate both that neural activity could stimulate neurosteroid E2 synthesis and that E2 acutely promotes neural activity.</p><p>Based on these findings, we hypothesized that, in vivo, the onset of seizures initiates a positive feedback loop in which neural activity stimulates neurosteroid estrogen synthesis, and that in turn, synthesized estrogens potentiate neural activity further, contributing to seizure escalation during SE. To investigate this, we used a combination of electrographic and behavioral seizure testing, aromatase (estrogen synthase) inhibitor treatment, and microdialysis in male and female rats injected with kainic acid (KA), a well-established animal model of SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lévesque and Avoli, 2013</xref>). The results demonstrated that neurosteroid estrogen synthesis is seizure-promoting, in both sexes, and that acutely inhibiting aromatase, either systemically or specifically within the hippocampus, strongly suppresses seizures. Thus neurosteroid estrogen synthesis is a previously unknown factor that contributes to seizures in SE, and acute treatment with an aromatase inhibitor may be an effective new approach to seizure control.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Extra-gonadal aromatase inhibition acutely suppresses seizures</title><p>We first sought to determine whether acutely inhibiting extra-gonadal synthesis of estrogens affects seizures in one or both sexes.

Thus fadrozole suppressed seizure escalation. The effects of fadrozole were the same in males and females (all p values &gt;0.30) so data were combined.

Cross-correlation between EEG and the occurrence of specific seizure behaviors for each rat confirmed that normalized hippocampal EEG amplitude (<italic>F</italic><sub>4,86</sub>=30.22, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and power (<italic>F</italic><sub>4,86</sub>=15.63, both p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) are better correlated with behavioral signs of mild limbic seizures (Racine 0, 1–2) than convulsive seizures (Racine 3, 4, 5). Interestingly, fadrozole decreased the strength of cross-correlation between EEG and some behaviors, particularly those reflecting convulsive seizures (Racine 3: amplitude: <italic>t</italic><sub>18</sub>=2.87, power: <italic>t</italic><sub>18</sub>=2.80, and Racine 4: power: <italic>t</italic><sub>17</sub>=2.57, all p&lt;0.05). Thus systemic fadrozole not only suppressed seizure activity, but also altered the temporal relationship between hippocampal EEG activity and convulsive seizures.</p><p>Behavioral seizures induced by KA followed a similar pattern as electrographic seizures in that vehicle-treated rats spent progressively more time in seizure, peaking during the 2<sup>nd</sup> hr when they spent 47 ± 9% of time in seizures more severe than staring (Racine stages 1–5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This progressive increase was largely absent in fadrozole-treated rats, who spent only 16 ± 8% of time in Racine 1–5 seizures during the 2<sup>nd</sup> hr (time x drug: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,19</sub>=7.22, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The same results were obtained regardless of the types of seizures analyzed. For example, consideration of mild limbic seizures specifically (Racine 1–2, time x drug: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,19</sub>=7.29, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) produced the same results, as did inclusion of staring (Racine 0–5, time x drug: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,19</sub>=15.65, p&lt;0.01, not shown). Furthermore, in fadrozole-treated rats, convulsive seizures (Racine 3–5) typically subsided within 2 hrs, such that fadrozole-treated rats spent only ~3% of time in convulsive seizures, compared to 12% in vehicle-treated rats (time x drug: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,19</sub>=6.59, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Thus, inhibition of extra-gonadal aromatase suppressed behavioral seizures in parallel with its effect to suppress electrographic seizure activity in the hippocampus.</p><p>We also investigated how fadrozole affected SE, which is defined clinically as a prolonged seizure lasting 5 min or longer in the case of convulsive SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Trinka et al., 2015</xref>). We analyzed KA-induced SE in two ways: based on sustained periods of either convulsive seizures (Racine 3–5) or of EEG amplitude exceeding 10x baseline (see Materials and methods). Both of these analyses showed that fadrozole suppressed SE. For example, fadrozole significantly decreased the proportion of rats in behavioral SE at any point during 2 hrs of testing (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,19</sub>=7.66, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), reflecting decreased incidence of SE, and among rats that reached criteria for behavioral SE, the time spent in SE was also significantly lower in fadrozole-treated animals (Veh: 1296 ± 245 sec; Fad: 436 ± 141 sec, <italic>t</italic><sub>14</sub>=2.26, p&lt;0.05, not shown). The latency to SE onset was longer on average in fadrozole-treated rats, but this was not a significant difference (Veh: 3052 ± 262 sec; Fad: 3548 ± 520 sec, p&gt;0.10). Results were similar when SE was defined based on EEG amplitude, which met electrographic SE criteria only during the 2<sup>nd</sup> hr of testing.

The hippocampus is a likely brain region in which aromatase activity could affect seizures, because of its relationship to the early stages of KA seizure activity, in vitro demonstrations of neurosteroid E2 synthesis, and many examples of acute E2 potentiation of neural activity in the hippocampus. However, there is currently no direct evidence for hippocampal estrogen synthesis in vivo. Therefore, we used in vivo microdialysis to investigate whether the hippocampus in awake, freely moving rats can synthesize E2.

We investigated whether acute seizures affect hippocampal E2 levels using in vivo microdialysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) in gonadectomized rats treated with KA (1.25–5 mg/kg, i.p.).

We divided animals into those that experienced mild, moderate, or severe seizures based on the amount of time that each animal spent in seizure behaviors more severe than staring (Racine 1–5) during 2 hrs after KA. This demonstrated that animals with relatively mild seizures (&lt;30 min, n=10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) showed a small increase in E2 (188 ± 38% baseline, <italic>F</italic><sub>2,18</sub>=5.39, p&lt;0.05) that was delayed relative to KA administration, whereas those with moderate seizures (30–90 min, n=17, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) showed a large increase in E2 (318 ± 68% baseline, <italic>F</italic><sub>2,23</sub>=8.22, p&lt;0.01) evident within the first 30 min. Interestingly, the small fraction of animals with very severe seizures (&gt;90 min, n=4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) began with significantly higher basal E2 (10.4 ± 2.0 pg/ml) than those with mild or moderate seizures (5.3 ± 0.8 pg/ml, <italic>t</italic><sub>29</sub>=2.22, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and hippocampal E2 remained high during seizures in those animals (97 ± 33% baseline).

That already high hippocampal E2 did not increase further in animals with the most severe seizures suggests a ceiling on hippocampal E2 and raises the possibility that high basal E2 in the hippocampus of a small number of animals may have predisposed them to more severe seizures.

Coupled with results from microdialysis showing seizure-induced E2 synthesis in the hippocampus, this suggests that E2 synthesized in the hippocampus may be acutely seizure-promoting. To test this possibility, we first bilaterally infused fadrozole (10 µg/side, n=10) or vehicle (30% β-cyclodextrin in saline, n=11) into the dorsal hippocampus 20 min before KA (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and monitored seizures for 2 hrs.

In addition, even among rats that progressed to more severe seizure behaviors, fadrozole significantly reduced the time animals spent in any seizures beyond staring (Racine 1–5, time x drug: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,30</sub>=6.99, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and in mild limbic seizures specifically (Racine 1–2, time x drug: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,30</sub>=5.64, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) in the 2<sup>nd</sup> hr.

As with gonadectomized rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,J</xref>), we analyzed SE in two ways: based on sustained periods of either frequent convulsive seizures (Racine 3–5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) or EEG amplitude that exceeded 10x baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

We found that systemic administration of an aromatase inhibitor after the onset of KA seizures strongly suppressed electrographic and behavioral seizure activity, in both sexes, without additional interventions. Microdialysis showed that seizures stimulate <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of estrogens in the hippocampus and that animals with more severe seizures began with or reached higher levels of E2 in the hippocampus. Because E2 is known to acutely promote hippocampal neural activity, this suggested that E2 synthesized in the hippocampus might be seizure-promoting. Consistent with this, infusion of an aromatase inhibitor specifically into the hippocampus also suppressed both electrographic and behavioral seizures. These results support the idea of a positive feedback loop between seizure activity and neurosteroid estrogens in which seizures stimulate estrogen synthesis in the brain, which then acutely promotes neural activity, contributing to further seizure activity. Breaking this cycle with aromatase inhibitor therapy may be a novel approach to clinical control of SE.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mechanisms by which estrogens acutely modulate hippocampal activity</title><p>Decades of in vitro studies have shown that E2 acutely potentiates neural activity in the hippocampus. Since the early work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Teyler et al. (1980)</xref>, which showed that E2 application to hippocampal slices rapidly increases extracellularly recorded field potentials, multiple groups have demonstrated acute E2 modulation of hippocampal intrinsic and synaptic physiology. For example, E2 suppresses Ca<sup>++</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents to reduce the slow afterhyperpolarization following a burst of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumar and Foster, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrer et al., 2003</xref>) and increases repetitive action potential firing in response to current injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). E2 also acutely promotes excitatory synaptic transmission through both increased glutamate release probability and increased postsynaptic sensitivity to glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kramar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smejkalova and Woolley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oberlander and Woolley, 2016</xref>). The molecular mechanisms that underlie these effects are under active investigation by our lab and others. Most studies indicate that E2’s acute actions are mediated by membrane-associated forms of the classical estrogen receptors, ERα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang and Woolley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tabatadze et al., 2015</xref>) and ERβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kramar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smejkalova and Woolley, 2010</xref>), as well as the G protein-coupled ER, GPER1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oberlander and Woolley, 2016</xref>), and involve downstream signaling through protein kinases including Src, Erk1/2, protein kinase A, and RhoA kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulware et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kramar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zadran et al., 2009</xref>) to influence synaptic transmission. Although it is possible that inhibiting aromatase resulted in increased levels of estrogen precursors, such as testosterone or androstenedione, the well-known effects of E2 to acutely promote neural activity make an estrogen-based explanation for the seizure-suppressing effects of aromatase inhibitors the most parsimonious. Further studies will be necessary to investigate the possibility that aromatase inhibition suppresses seizures by influencing other steroids in addition to E2.</p><p>Our microdialysis results indicate that E2 reaches sufficient concentrations in the hippocampus to promote seizure activity. For example, based on our probe recovery estimate of ~30% and the mean basal concentrations of E2 we detected in dialysate, basal E2 concentrations in the hippocampus of gonadectomized rats average at least ~20 pg/ml (74 pM). The highest concentrations we measured indicate that hippocampal E2 reaches ~100 pg/ml (367 pM) after KA, which overlaps with E2 concentrations known to acutely potentiate intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission when bath-applied in vitro (100 pM, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smejkalova and Woolley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). Separately, two considerations suggest that our estimates of extracellular E2 levels are likely to underestimate in vivo concentrations at or near synapses, where extranuclear ERs are located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Milner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Waters et al., 2015</xref>). First, electron microscopic immunogold labeling indicates that aromatase is concentrated at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hojo et al., 2004</xref>). This suggests that synaptic E2 levels could be substantially higher than levels measured using microdialysis, which samples a large extracellular volume. Second, we obtained the in vitro probe recovery value of 30% with no E2 carrier (e.g., BSA) in the bath; this value therefore reflects maximum recovery. If E2 is carrier-bound in the brain, then total E2 levels could be substantially higher than our estimates indicate. These considerations make it very likely that E2 reaches sufficient concentrations in the brain during seizures to potentiate neuronal excitability and/or synaptic transmission and thereby promote further seizure activity through one or more of the mechanisms that have been indentified in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Regulation of aromatase activity in the brain</title><p>We have shown that seizures increase E2 levels in the hippocampus, but how would E2 eventually return to baseline? Passive diffusion, active reuptake, and/or active metabolism could be involved. Passive diffusion in extracellular space is possible, as the maximum solubility of E2 in aqueous medium is estimated to be in the low µM range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shareef et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, the lipophilic nature of estrogens allows their diffusion across or within membranes, including the plasma membrane, which could reduce E2 levels in extracellular space. Sequestration and/or transport of locally synthesized E2 may also be aided by carrier molecules, as is the case for steroids in circulation. Steroids bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) can be actively transported across the plasma membrane in an immortailized hippocampal cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caldwell et al., 2007</xref>), although it is currently not known whether SHBGs are expressed in the hippocampus in vivo.</p><p>Interestingly, there is some evidence that active metabolism of estrogens could occur with intracellular pH changes associated with seizures. Studies in peripheral systems show that the aromatase enzyme can switch between aromatase and hydroxylase activity in a pH-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Osawa et al., 1993</xref>). Aromatization is the final step in E2 synthesis; hydroxylation is an initial step in conversion of E2 to an inactive form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2003</xref>). The ratio of aromatase to hydroxylase activity is greatest at acidic pH, whereas hydroxylase activity predominates at alkaline pH. This is potentially relevant to seizures in that, in vitro, KCl-induced depolarization of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Svichar et al., 2011</xref>) or treatment with the NMDA receptor co-agonist glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diering et al., 2011</xref>) produces biphasic changes in intracellular pH: an initial acid transient is followed by alkalinization. Thus, the proximity of aromatase to acid-loading or acid-extruding membrane proteins that mediate activity-dependent changes in intracellular pH during seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sinning et al., 2011</xref>) may control a balance of aromatase vs. hydroxylase activity in a way that initially promotes E2 synthesis, followed by E2 inactivation through hydroxylation. Further studies will be required to test this idea.</p><p>It should be noted that several studies on avian aromatase have demonstrated mechanisms through which aromatase activity can be negatively regulated, but their results indicate effects that are the opposite of what is observed in the rodent hippocampus. For example, glutamate retrodialysis reduced E2 levels in a cortical brain area in zebra finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Remage-Healey et al., 2008</xref>) and treatment of quail hypothalamic explants with glutamate receptor agonists lowered aromatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balthazart et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, glutamate receptor activation increases aromatase activity in rat hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hojo et al., 2004</xref>) and our findings with in vivo seizures in rats are consistent with this. Thus there may be species- and/or brain region-specific regulation of aromatase activity. One possibility is that species differences in enzyme structure lead to differences in aromatase regulation. Aromatase activity requires access to lipophilic substrate, and differences between avian and mammalian aromatase are greater in a region responsible for membrane association (~58% identity) than catalytic activity (~73% identity, chicken vs. rat, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghosh et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>That we detected a range of basal E2 concentrations suggests that factors in addition to seizures may regulate aromatase activity in the hippocampus. For example, studies in the avian brain indicate that stress regulates enzymes involved in E2 metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Soma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dickens et al., 2011</xref>). Given our observation that high basal E2 is associated with more severe seizures in response to KA, understanding how basal E2 levels in the hippocampus are influenced by stress or other experience may have important implications for understanding the role of environmental factors in modulating seizure susceptibility and/or severity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Therapeutic potential of acute aromatase inhibitor treatment</title><p>Although most of our experiments were done in gonadectomized animals to focus on E2 synthesized in the brain, additional experiments showed that systemic aromatase inhibition also acutely suppresses seizures when circulating gonadal hormones are present. Thus, acute aromatase inhibitor treatment may be useful in seizure patients, most of whom are gonadally intact. One concern, however, is that aromatase inhibition would eliminate the neuroprotective effects of estrogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoffman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schauwecker et al., 2009</xref>), which could have the detrimental effect of excacerbating seizure-related damage in the brain. We investigated this and found no effects of either intra-hippocampal fadrozole in gonadectomized animals or systemic letrozole in gonadally intact animals on seizure-induced cell death. It is possible that the milder seizures with aromatase inhibition, which would be expected to result in less cell death, were balanced by loss of estrogen neuroprotection producing roughly equivalent seizure-induced cell death. Further experiments with more detailed analyses of seizure-related neuronal damage will be required to investigate how aromatase inhibition interacts with estrogen neuroprotection to influence downstream sequelae of seizure activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and surgeries</title><p>All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the <italic>National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> and were approved by the Northwestern University Animal Care and Use Committee (Animal Study Protocol: IS00000520, Animal Welfare Assurance: A3283-01). Young adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (~50 days old, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were gonadectomized or gonadally intact, and were implanted with either unilateral microdialysis guide cannulae (CMA, Kista, Sweden) or bilateral intra-hippocampal infusion guide cannulae (PlasticsOne, Roanoke, VA). Surgeries were conducted under ketamine (85 mg/kg, i.p.; Bioniche Pharma, Lake Forest, IL) and xylazine (13 mg/kg, i.p.; Lloyd Laboratories, Walnut, CA) anesthesia.

For EEG with intra-hippocampal infusions, polyimide-coated stainless steel electrodes (0.15 mm OD, PlasticsOne) were attached to guide cannulae, and extended 2 mm beyond the end of guide cannulae. For EEG without intra-hippocampal infusions, the same recording electrodes were attached to guide wires with recording electrodes extending 2 mm beyond the end of the guide wire. All implants were secured with skull screws and dental cement. Following surgeries, rats were housed in groups of 2–3 for infusion and EEG experiments or singly for microdialysis experiments. All experiments were conducted 7–10 days after surgeries. The estrous phase of gonadally intact females was assessed by daily vaginal smears. Estrous phases on the day of seizure testing were Veh: 3 estrus, 1 metestrus, 1 diestrus and Let: 2 estrus, 2 diestrus. Previous studies have reported no estrous cycle-related differences in the occurrence of acute KA-induced SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D’Amour et al., 2015</xref>) and we also found no differences related to the estrous cycle.

For the experiment without EEG recording, the dose was increased to 15 mg/kg to achieve the same range of seizure severity as in animals with EEG electrodes implanted. For the dialysis experiments, 1.25–5 mg/kg doses were used, as these animals experienced more severe seizures than rats without microdialysis, possibly due to tissue damage from microdialysis probes.</p><p>The testing chamber was 45 x 45 cm for microdialysis and EEG testing or 25 x 45 cm for behavior-only testing. Each rat was injected with KA (i.p., in saline) at the doses indicated above.

Because distinguishing Racine stage 1 (oral movement/chewing) from stage 2 (head nodding/waving) was often difficult in videos, these stages were grouped together as Racine 1–2 (C-HW). Staring was recorded only for the first 30 min in the study without EEG recording, because most rats in these experiments either showed no sign of seizure or progressed to more severe seizure stages after 30 min. The first &gt;20 s period of staring was used for latency and proportion calculation. When behavioral seizure monitoring was extended to 6 hrs, the first 2 hrs were scored as above, followed by scoring of Racine 3–5 seizures to evaluate SE during the last 4 hrs.

We tested a lower dose (40 mg/kg) and found that it was highly effective in suppressing seizures. For intra-hippocampal infusion, we adjusted the dose for the volume of the hippocampus and estimated that 1–10 µg/side fadrozole would result in an effective concentration. This is in line with concentrations shown to inhibit aromatase activity in vitro (0.29–29 µg/ml, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wade et al., 1994</xref>). We then conducted a pilot study on the effects of intra-hippocampal fadrozole on KA-induced seizures using 1 and 10 µg/side, and observed significant attenuation of seizures with 10 µg/side, which was not obvious with 1 µg/side. Thus, we chose 10 µg/side for further experiments with intra-hippocampal infusion. Another non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, was used in experiments with gonadally intact rats. The dose of letrozole (1 mg/kg) was chosen based on a previous study of affective behavior in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kokras et al., 2014</xref>), as well as a pharmacokinetic study of letrozole-cyclodextrin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wempe et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>i.v.

As soon as the first hippocampal electrographic seizure subsided, the protective tubing was removed and i.v. injections were performed. For the experiment with fadrozole, 1 ml/kg saline vehicle or fadrozole HCl in saline (40 mg/ml) was slowly injected, and drug solution inside the catheter was flushed with 0.2 ml saline. Seven male rats failed to develop electrographic seizures within 45 min of KA administration. These animals were returned to their home cages and re-tested 1–2 days later. Two developed electrographic seizures on the 2<sup>nd</sup> trial and were included (1 Veh, 1 Fad), whereas 5 failed to develop seizures on 2<sup>nd</sup> trial and were excluded. Procedures were the same for the experiment with letrozole except that 19% (w/v) (2-hydroxypropyl) β-cyclodextrin in saline was used as the vehicle. In this experiment, 4 female rats that failed to develop electrographic seizures within 45 min on the 1<sup>st</sup> trial did develop seizures on the 2<sup>nd</sup> trial and thus were included (3 Veh, 1 Let). For intra-hippocampal administration of vehicle or fadrozole, rats were infused bilaterally (1 µl/side) either with vehicle (30% w/v (2-hydroxypropyl) β-cyclodextrin in saline) or fadrozole HCl (10 µg/µl), into the dorsal CA1 region at 1 µl/min through 28G internal infusion cannulae extending 2 mm beyond the implanted guide cannulae.

The electrode in the contralateral hippocampus served as the reference electrode. This approach, rather than using a skull screw or another epidural electrode as a reference, resulted in a cleaner EEG signal that was more resistant to motion artifacts in a pilot study. EEG electrodes were connected to a commutator mounted on a balance arm. EEG signals were filtered (high-pass: 1 Hz; low-pass: 500 Hz; notch filter at 60 Hz), amplified, and digitized at 400 Hz sampling frequency. Digitized signal was stored on a PC and later analyzed with custom Matlab scripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/SatoruMSato/seizure">https://github.com/SatoruMSato/seizure</ext-link>).</p><p>One day before testing, rats were acclimated to the testing chamber for 20 min. For EEG-recording with systemic (i.v.) fadrozole/letrozole or vehicle, each rat was moved to the testing chamber and baseline EEG was recorded for 20 min, then KA was injected, and recording was terminated 2 or 6 hrs after i.v. injection. For EEG recording with intra-hippocampal infusion, pre-infusion baseline EEG was recorded for 20 min, the rat was removed from the testing chamber, and drugs were infused into the hippocampus as described above. The rat was then returned to the testing chamber and EEG and time-synched video were recorded for 20 min before and 2 hrs after KA injection. To account for individual differences, we quantified EEG signals normalized to baseline for each animal. The signal from a 120 s period beginning 800 s from the start of EEG recording, shortly before either KA injection or hippocampal infusions, was used as baseline. Rats were typically quietly resting during this time after an initial period of exploration. On rare occasions when motion artifact was observed in the baseline EEG, the baseline period used for quantification was shifted by 60 s earlier or later. Signals from 50–100 Hz were not used for analysis due to the use of a 60 Hz notch filter.</p><p>Power spectrum density (PSD) was calculated by fast-Fourier transformation of EEG data for each 5 s bin. To account for differences between individuals, for example due to variation in electrode placement, we quantified seizure-related changes in power normalized to baseline for each animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Medvedev et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lehmkhule et al., 2009</xref>). Quantification of seizure severity using power in a similar frequency range (20–70 Hz) has been used in multiple previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lehmkule et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giménez-Cassina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rook et al., 2013</xref>) as a way of objective, efficient, and motion artifact-resistant quantification of electrographic seizures during SE. For amplitude-based seizure detection, we used 5x baseline amplitude for 30 s as criterion and PSD-based seizure detection was based on power exceeding 5x baseline for 20 s.</p><p>To evaluate time spent in seizure, we used a 5x baseline threshold, which was based on comparisons of manually detected seizures with seizures detected with various thresholds. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the similarity between manual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>)-, normalized amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>)-, and normalized β-low γ power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>)-based seizure detection. While manual and β-low γ-based detection were more sensitive to minor seizures (e.g., the 1<sup>st</sup> seizure), amplitude-based detection was more effective in resolving seizures in the merging phase (e.g., 4000–7200 s in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). With both amplitude- and power-based seizure detection methods, 10x baseline threshold failed to detect minor seizures (e.g., the 1<sup>st</sup> seizure), whereas 3x baseline threshold failed to resolve seizures at the onset of merging seizures (4000–5000 s). Nonetheless, the ability of fadrozole to attenuate seizure progression was evident and statistically significant regardless of the threshold used for amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>) or power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>)-based seizure detection.</p><p>For EEG-behavior cross-correlations, normalized EEG signal (root mean square amplitude or β-low γ power) and the presence of each seizure behavior assessed from coded videos were cross-correlated for each 5 s bin with no lag. Note that differences in the strength of EEG-behavior relationships cannot be attributed solely to less frequent occurrence of certain seizure behaviors, because seizure behaviors that occur less frequently (e.g., C-HW relative to staring, or rearing relative to FLC) showed a similar strength of relationship. Thus, the higher coefficients for mild limbic relative to convulsive seizure behaviors indicate better temporal correspondence between high hippocampal electrographic activity and the occurrence of mild limbic seizures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of behavioral and electrographic SE</title><p>Quantitative definitions of SE vary widely in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">White et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D’Amour et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mishra et al., 2015</xref>). For the purpose of this study, we identified the onset of behavioral SE when Racine 3–5 seizures (FLC, rear, fall/tonic-clonic) occurred uninterrupted for at least 30 s and continued with no more than 2 min between occurrence of Racine 3–5 seizures. Mild seizures (Racine 1–2) almost always continued after termination of an SE episode, but this was not counted as SE. If/when another 30 s period of uninterrupted Racine 3–5 seizures occurred in the same animal, SE was considered to have begun again and to last until 2 min passed with no Racine 3–5 seizures. We also evaluated electrographic SE, for which there is also no consensus definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Trinka et al., 2015</xref>). We identified the onset of electrographic SE as an increase in EEG amplitude exceeding 10x baseline for at least 30 sec. After beginning, electrographic SE was considered to end if amplitude dropped below 3x baseline for 30 sec. We found that these parameters captured severe merging seizures without classifying earlier isolated seizures as SE. Also, note that while the term 'electrographic SE' has been used synonymously with non-convulsive SE (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">White et al., 2010</xref>), the parameters used here were designed to capture severe electrographic seizures that can accompany behavioral SE.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Enzyme immunoassay for E2</title><p>We used a commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) for measurement of E2, with one modification: the E2 tracer was diluted by 50% with Ringer’s solution (Na<sup>+</sup>: 132.2, K<sup>+</sup>: 4.96, Ca<sup>++</sup>: 1.53, and Cl<sup>-</sup>: 140.22 in mM) including 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), which we found increased sensitivity of the assay.

As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, both we and the manufacturer tested testosterone, estrone, and 17α-estradiol. In addition, we tested androstenedione, other steroids known to act as neurosteroids (allopregnanolone, pregnenolone, DHEA) and glucocorticoids (corticosterone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone), all purchased from Steraloids (Newport, RI). To conduct these tests, we initially included 200 ng/ml of the steroid in 32 pg/ml of E2 standard and tested for a shift in measured E2 concentration. Assays were run in duplicates. If significant (&gt;0.02%) cross-reactivity was suspected, we assayed a series of concentrations of the steroid to quantify cross-reactivity. All tests confirmed minimal to no cross-reactivity with compounds other than estrogens. Consistent with our tests, the manufacturer reported &lt;0.1% cross-reactivity for non-estrogens, and &lt;15% for estrogens other than E2.

Immediately after the second concentration of E2, the probe was rinsed briefly in Ringer’s, placed in fresh Ringer’s with 0 pg/ml E2, and then two additional 30 min samples were collected to measure carryover.

To use the minimum number of animals necessary, we analyzed data once n=4~5 (or ~8 for the non-EEG/dialysis experiment) was reached, and the sample size was increased if a statistical trend (p&lt;0.2) was observed. Final effect sizes were generally large (Cohen’s d≈0.8) and never d&lt;0.69 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Research was supported by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke grant NS037324 and the Office of Research on Women’s Health, the Northwestern University High Throughput Analysis Laboratory and Biological Imaging Facility.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Acute Inhibition of Neurosteroid Estrogen Synthesis Suppresses Status Epilepticus in an Animal Model&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examines the role of an aromatase inhibitor (fadrozole) in the response of gonadectomized male and female rats to the convulsant kainic acid. The results suggest that the inhibitor decreased the severity of the seizures, and the authors suggest that the reason is that hippocampal estradiol levels were reduced. The authors measure estradiol by microdialysis and report that estradiol increased after kainic acid injection. The authors conclude that estradiol synthesis in hippocampus increases after kainic acid, and this increases the severity of seizures. They also suggest that these data provide a foundation for a new therapeutic approach to SE. The paper has many strengths: it is well written and the methods are clearly laid out. References are thorough. The results generally show the effects of fadrozole to decrease the effects of kainic acid. It is also interesting that estradiol levels in hippocampus appear to rise as seizures occur. There are concerns however, most importantly that the experiments were done in gonadectomized animals thus the relevance to intact animals is unclear. We think this point requires additional experiments (see point 2 below), which we hope would be feasible within the <italic>eLife</italic> policy of 2 months.</p><p>1) Specificity of the drug. Regarding fadrozole, aromatase inhibitors do not only affect estradiol synthesis. The authors do acknowledge this in the Discussion, but it seems hard to dismiss.</p><p>2) The exclusive use of gonadectomized animals. The use of gonadectomized rats undermines the broad relevance of the study, and also the therapeutic relevance. Gonadectomy leads to numerous changes in the brain and periphery, and hippocampal circuits are likely to dramatically change, as the authors are well aware. This could be dependent on the time after gonadectomy also, as the authors are also aware (what was this time?). Seizure susceptibility in the female and male should dramatically rise after gonadectomy, in light of work showing that the metabolites of progesterone and testosterone enhance GABAergic inhibition and they are largely removed by gonadectomy. Although intact rats are difficult to work with but this point is very important when the suggestion is made that the work could lead to a therapeutic strategy in humans with SE. Note that it is also true that in most patients it won't be possible to treat before SE begins. Therefore, the therapeutic relevance is not too clear at this point. Overall, one wonders how much the results would be generalizeable to intact animals. Experiments in intact animals are necessary for obvious reasons: most patients won't be gonadectomized.</p><p>In addition, the microdialysis results suggest that the estradiol involved in the seizure-promoting effect are within the physiological range, a very important line of argument, but as the authors point out, microdialysis is not an exact measurement of concentrations at synapses.</p><p>3) Seizure and status epilepticus analysis. The analyzed appear to be the first two hours after kainic acid injection, when there is a period of individual nonconvulsive and convulsive seizures and then onset of SE. The authors don't separate the initial individual seizures and SE, pooling everything. However, if the authors want to study SE, the seizures leading up to SE don't seem important. In SE is studied, the latency to onset, the duration, and incidence should be measured. It seems that animals with fadrozole almost always failed to exhibit SE (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, the heat maps), supporting the authors' conclusions, so it would be good to do an analysis of SE incidence at least.</p><p>Because the authors pool all data, and only study the first two hours of SE it is hard to address power because it may have surged after the 2 hours, when SE becomes most severe (at least by some reports). When a seizure begins and ends after KA is very hard to say because one transitions to another. For example, seizures after KA often transition from stage 1 to a stage 2 or stage 3 to 4 – is this two seizures or one? Where does each start? These issues need better definition and discussion.</p><p>4) EEG analyses. If sites of electrode tips differed, which is the case here, then the EEG will be substantially different because the different layers of the hippocampus have different spectral characteristics. For example, γ is best detected in cell layers and θ is best detected in layers such as stratum lacunosum-moleculare.

Computer-measured EEG power has low sensitivity and specificity for seizure detection. Muscle activity and motor movements contribute to EEG power, and seizures cause muscle activity and movement. Also hippocampal seizures (in humans, rats or mice) are rhythmic spike wave discharges in θ range, thus it is unclear why the authors focused on β power.</p><p>5) A key goal of treatments for status epilepticus is to shorten its duration. Neuronal injury and death correlate with seizure duration. However, the authors did not demonstrate a reduction in seizure (status epilepticus) duration.

The results suggest that the inhibitor decreased the severity of the seizures, and the authors suggest that the reason is that hippocampal estradiol levels were reduced. The authors measure estradiol by microdialysis and report that estradiol increased after kainic acid injection. The authors conclude that estradiol synthesis in hippocampus increases after kainic acid, and this increases the severity of seizures. They also suggest that these data provide a foundation for a new therapeutic approach to SE. The paper has many strengths: it is well written and the methods are clearly laid out. References are thorough. The results generally show the effects of fadrozole to decrease the effects of kainic acid. It is also interesting that estradiol levels in hippocampus appear to rise as seizures occur. There are concerns however, most importantly that the experiments were done in gonadectomized animals thus the relevance to intact animals is unclear. We think this point requires additional experiments (see point 2 below), which we hope would be feasible within the eLife policy of 2 months.</italic></p><p><italic>1) Specificity of the drug. Regarding fadrozole, aromatase inhibitors do not only affect estradiol synthesis. The authors do acknowledge this in the Discussion, but it seems hard to dismiss.</italic></p><p>To address this issue, we performed additional experiments with a second aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, and found that letrozole also suppressed seizures as fadrozole did. These new results, together with the seizure-induced increase in hippocampal E2 observed with microdialysis and the well-known effects of E2 to acutely promote neural activity in the hippocampus, make an estrogen-based explanation of the seizure-suppressing effects of aromatase inhibitors the most parsimonious one.</p><p>That said, it is possible that inhibiting estrogen synthesis in the brain has the indirect consequence of altering levels of other neurosteroids, particularly estrogen precursors, and we cannot rule out the possibility that such indirect effects may also influence seizures. We acknowledge this in the Discussion (subsection “Mechanisms by which estrogens acutely modulate hippocampal activity”, first paragraph) and have added a statement that future studies will be necessary to address this possibility.</p><p><italic>2) The exclusive use of gonadectomized animals. The use of gonadectomized rats undermines the broad relevance of the study, and also the therapeutic relevance. Gonadectomy leads to numerous changes in the brain and periphery, and hippocampal circuits are likely to dramatically change, as the authors are well aware. This could be dependent on the time after gonadectomy also, as the authors are also aware (what was this time?). Seizure susceptibility in the female and male should dramatically rise after gonadectomy, in light of work showing that the metabolites of progesterone and testosterone enhance GABAergic inhibition and they are largely removed by gonadectomy. Although intact rats are difficult to work with but this point is very important when the suggestion is made that the work could lead to a therapeutic strategy in humans with SE. Note that it is also true that in most patients it won't be possible to treat before SE begins. Therefore, the therapeutic relevance is not too clear at this point. Overall, one wonders how much the results would be generalizeable to intact animals. Experiments in intact animals are necessary for obvious reasons: most patients won't be gonadectomized.</italic></p><p>In the previous submission, we had used gonadectomized animals to eliminate circulating gonadal hormones and focus on E2 synthesized in the brain. However, we concur that the therapeutic potential of our results would be increased by demonstrating that aromatase inhibitors also suppress seizures in gonadally intact animals. To address this, we performed new experiments in which we used systemic administration of an aromatase inhibitor that is used clinically, letrozole, in gonadally intact animals (males and females) after seizures had begun. We also extended the period of seizure monitoring in this experiment to 6 hours, to address other concerns raised below regarding analysis of SE. In brief, these new studies showed that acute systemic aromatase inhibition effectively suppressed seizures in gonadally intact animals, similar to acute systemic aromatase inhibition in gonadectomized animals. These findings are described in a new section of the Results (”Systemic aromatase inhibition acutely suppresses seizures in gonadally intact animals”) and are shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and 8.</p><p>One difference we observed between gonadectomized and gonadally intact animals is that behavioral seizures were much <italic>less</italic> severe in gonadectomized animals of both sexes (electrographic seizures did not appear to differ, however). Owing to the Reviewers’ comment, we mention this in the revised Results (in the aforementioned section) and include a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) to illustrate the difference. Thus, while it has been shown that metabolites of progesterone and testosterone are anticonvulsant in several seizure models, the physiological source of these steroids that suppress seizures in vivo may not be the gonads.</p><p>To answer the reviewers’ question about the duration of gonadectomy, animals were used for experiments 7-10 days after surgery (Materials and methods, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>In addition, the microdialysis results suggest that the estradiol involved in the seizure-promoting effect are within the physiological range, a very important line of argument, but as the authors point out, microdialysis is not an exact measurement of concentrations at synapses.</italic></p><p>To further clarify this important issue, we have revised the relevant section of the Discussion (subsection “Mechanisms by which estrogens acutely modulate hippocampal activity”, last paragraph) to explain how our measurements of E2 from microdialysis relate to the concentrations of E2 that have been shown to acutely promote neural activity when bath-applied to hippocampal slices.</p><p><italic>3) Seizure and status epilepticus analysis. The analyzed appear to be the first two hours after kainic acid injection, when there is a period of individual nonconvulsive and convulsive seizures and then onset of SE. The authors don't separate the initial individual seizures and SE, pooling everything. However, if the authors want to study SE, the seizures leading up to SE don't seem important. In SE is studied, the latency to onset, the duration, and incidence should be measured. It seems that animals with fadrozole almost always failed to exhibit SE (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, the heat maps), supporting the authors' conclusions, so it would be good to do an analysis of SE incidence at least.</italic></p><p>This is an important point and we thank the Reviewers for suggesting additional analyses focused specifically on SE. To address this, we quantified SE incidence, latency to onset, and time spent in SE both for the 2 hr dataset previously obtained with systemic fadrozole in gonadectomized animals and the new 6 hr dataset obtained with systemic letrozole in gonadally intact animals. We evaluated SE in two ways: based on sustained periods of Racine 3-5 convulsive seizures (behavioral SE) and based on sustained periods during which EEG amplitude exceeded 10x baseline (electrographic SE). In brief, both types of analysis showed that aromatase inhibition suppressed SE in both experiments. The results with fadrozole in gonadectomized animals are described in a new section of the Results (subsection”Extra-gonadal aromatase inhibition acutely suppresses seizures”, last paragraph) and shown in new Figure panels 2H, J and the results with letrozole in gonadally intact animals are described in a new section of the Results (subsection “Systemic aromatase inhibition acutely suppresses seizures in gonadally intact animals”, third paragraph) and a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. The Materials and methods have been revised to include a description of SE analyses (subsection “Analysis of behavioral and electrographic SE”).</p><p><italic>Because the authors pool all data, and only study the first two hours of SE it is hard to address power because it may have surged after the 2 hours, when SE becomes most severe (at least by some reports).</italic></p><p>This was a helpful comment, and prompted us to extend seizure monitoring from 2 to 6 hrs in additional experiments with letrozole in gonadally intact animals. As evident in the EEG recordings, normalized power spectra, and summary data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, seizure activity reached its peak around 1.5 hr after the first electrographic seizure was detected in the hippocampus (~2 hrs after KA injection) and then gradually declined. Neither EEG amplitude nor power increased further after 2 hrs. Also, as these figures show, the effect of aromatase inhibition to suppress seizure activity extended for the duration of 6 hrs of recording and thus aromatase inhibitors did not simply delay seizure escalation.</p><p><italic>When a seizure begins and ends after KA is very hard to say because one transitions to another. For example, seizures after KA often transition from stage 1 to a stage 2 or stage 3 to 4 – is this two seizures or one? Where does each start? These issues need better definition and discussion.</italic></p><p>We concur that it can be difficult to identify isolated bouts of seizure, especially as seizures progress to become more severe. For behavioral seizures, we did not attempt to identify individual seizure bouts, but instead scored specific seizure behaviors (Racine stages) per second of each video and report% time in seizure in 5 min increments (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G, H</xref>). For the heatmaps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, we show the highest stage of seizure behavior reached per minute, as indicated in the Results text (subsection “Inhibition of hippocampal E2 synthesis suppresses behavioral seizures”, first paragraph) and related figure legend. For identification of electrographic seizures, we used a threshold approach based on normalized EEG amplitude or power, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. We report normalized EEG amplitude, power, or% time in seizure in 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) or 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) bins throughout each recording period (2 or 6 hrs). Thus we did not attempt to identify the beginning and end of an electrographic seizure. The one exception to this is our approach to identifying periods of SE (which did have an onset and an end, necessitated by the suggestion above to quantify SE latency to onset and duration), as detailed in the revised Materials and methods (subsection “Analysis of behavioral and electrographic SE”).</p><p><italic>4) EEG analyses. If sites of electrode tips differed, which is the case here, then the EEG will be substantially different because the different layers of the hippocampus have different spectral characteristics. For example, γ is best detected in cell layers and θ is best detected in layers such as stratum lacunosum-moleculare. Therefore, it is not clear one can compare the EEG across animals, as the authors have. Because gliosis at the electrode site (and other aspects of the recordings) differs from animal to animal, it is hard to compare EEG amplitude across animals.</italic></p><p>This concern raised by the reviewers, individual differences in electrode placement, etc., is the reason we quantified EEG amplitude and power relative to baseline for each individual animal. Our approach was based on that in Medvedev et al., 2000, Brain Res Bull; Lehmkhule et al., 2009, J Neurophysiol and also used by others (e.g., Gimenez-Cassina et al., 2012, Neuron; Liu et al., 2013, Neuron; Rook et al., 2013, Biol Psychiatry). We have revised the Materials and methods section (subsection “Intra-hippocampal EEG recording and analyses”, second and third paragraphs) to further clarify this and to emphasize that EEG amplitude and power results are reported as changes relative to baseline (i.e., normalized amplitude or normalized power). In addition, we have made revisions throughout the Results text, figures, and figure legends to be clearer that we report seizure-related changes in EEG amplitude or power, which is what we compare across animals. We have not compared raw EEG amplitude or power across animals.</p><p><italic>It's interesting to look at the relationship between EEG and seizure-associated behavior, but the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Extra-gonadal aromatase inhibition acutely suppresses seizures” does not lead to a strong conclusion because it is not clear one can say anything about seizure spread based on the cross correlation. Spread is something one needs look at with multiple electrodes, determining where seizures begin – i.e. one electrode starts before another.</italic></p><p>We removed reference to seizure spread from this sentence and eliminated the section of the Discussion that had addressed this idea.</p><p><italic>In addition, EEG power was used as a surrogate for seizures. Computer-measured EEG power has low sensitivity and specificity for seizure detection. Muscle activity and motor movements contribute to EEG power, and seizures cause muscle activity and movement. Also hippocampal seizures (in humans, rats or mice) are rhythmic spike wave discharges in θ range, thus it is unclear why the authors focused on β power.</italic></p><p>Our use of β-low γ power as an approach to detect seizures was driven partly by the existing literature and partly by our observations. In the literature, a KA-induced increase in power in the β-low γ range is well-documented both in vivo and in vitro (Fisahn et al., 2004, J Neurosci; Medvedev et al., 2000, Brain Res Bull; Lévesque et al., 2009, Neurobiol Dis) and quantification of seizure severity using power in a similar frequency range (20-70 Hz) has been used by others (e.g., Lehmkhule et al., 2009, J Neurophysiol; Gimenez-Cassina et al., 2012, Neuron; Liu et al., 2013, Neuron; Rook et al., 2013, Biol Psychiatry) as a way of objective, efficient, and motion artifact-resistant quantification of electrographic seizures during SE. This reasoning is noted in the Results (subsection “Extra-gonadal aromatase inhibition acutely suppresses seizures”, second paragraph) as well as Materials and methods (subsection “Intra-hippocampal EEG recording and analyses”, third paragraph). In addition, our pilot studies showed that β-low γ power was relatively resistant to motion artifacts compared to lower frequency ranges, while being more broadly sensitive to seizures than higher frequency ranges. The utility of changes in β-low γ power for detecting seizures is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>. Note also that we quantified and reported seizure-related increases in power in 3 frequency ranges (δ-θ, β-low γ, ripple) and report all results in the text.</p><p><italic>5) A key goal of treatments for status epilepticus is to shorten its duration. Neuronal injury and death correlate with seizure duration. However, the authors did not demonstrate a reduction in seizure (status epilepticus) duration. Interestingly cell death was not prevented by this treatment either. This point requires additional documentation or discussion.</italic></p><p>Our primary motivation for evaluating Fluoro-Jade B positive cells was to determine whether aromatase inhibition during seizures might produce a detrimental outcome by eliminating estrogen neuroprotection (Hoffman et al., 2003, Exp Neurol; Schauwecker et al., 2009, Brain Res). However, we found no statistically significant effects of aromatase inhibition, despite the fact that average numbers of Fluoro-Jade B positive cells were slightly lower in aromatase inhibitor-treated animals (consistent with their milder seizures). One potential explanation for this is that milder seizures following aromatase inhibition, which would be expected to result in less cell death as the Reviewers point out, is balanced by loss of estrogen neuroprotection, producing roughly equivalent seizure-related cell death. We have added this suggestion to the Discussion and noted that future, more detailed studies will be required to fully address it (subsection “Therapeutic potential of acute aromatase inhibitor treatment”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
