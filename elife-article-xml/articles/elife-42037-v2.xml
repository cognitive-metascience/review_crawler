proteins. However, little is known about host factors at the interface between replicase complexes and the host cytoplasm. We engineered a biotin ligase into a coronaviral replication/transcription complex (RTC) and identified &gt;500 host proteins constituting the RTC microenvironment. siRNA-silencing of each RTC-proximal host factor demonstrated importance of vesicular trafficking pathways, ubiquitin-dependent and autophagy-related processes, and translation initiation factors. Notably, detection of translation initiation factors at the RTC was instrumental to visualize and demonstrate active translation proximal to replication complexes of several coronaviruses. Collectively, we establish a spatial link between viral RNA synthesis and diverse host factors of unprecedented breadth. Our data may serve as a paradigm for other positive-strand RNA viruses and provide a starting point for a comprehensive analysis of critical virus-host interactions that represent targets for therapeutic intervention.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42037.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Coronaviruses can infect the nose and throat and are a main cause of the common cold. Infections are usually mild and short-lived, but sometimes they can turn nasty. In 2002 and 2012, two dangerous new coronaviruses emerged and caused diseases known as SARS and MERS. These viruses caused much more serious symptoms and in some cases proved deadly. The question is, why are some coronaviruses more dangerous than others? Scientists know that the body's response to virus infection can make a difference to whether someone had mild or severe disease. So, to understand why some coronaviruses cause a cold and others kill, they also need to learn how people react to virus infection.</p><p>Coronaviruses hijack membranes inside cells and turn them into virus factories. Within these factories, the viruses build molecular machinery called replicase complexes to copy their genetic code, which is needed for the next generation of virus particles. The viruses steal and repurpose proteins from their host cell that will assist in the copying process. However, scientists do not yet know which host proteins are essential for the virus to multiply. So, to find out, V’kovski et al. developed a way to tag any host protein that came near the virus factories.</p><p>The new technique involved attaching an enzyme called a biotin ligase to the replicase complex. This enzyme acts as a molecular label gun, attaching a chemical tag to any protein that comes within ten nanometres. The label gun revealed that more than 500 different proteins come into contact with the replicase complex. To find out what these proteins were doing, the next step was to switch off their genes one by one. This revealed the key cell machinery that coronaviruses hijack when they are replicating. It included the cell's cargo transport system, the waste disposal system, and the protein production system. Using these systems allows the viruses to copy their genetic code next to machines that can turn it straight into viral proteins.</p><p>These new results provide clues about which proteins viruses actually need from their host cells. They also do not just apply to coronaviruses. Other viruses use similar strategies to complete their infection cycle. These findings could help researchers to understand more generally about how viruses multiply. In the future, this knowledge could lead to new ways to combat virus infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>coronavirus</kwd><kwd>replicase complex</kwd><kwd>proximity labeling</kwd><kwd>virus-host interaction</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>vesicular transport</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>173085</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>V'kovski</surname><given-names>Philip</given-names></name><name><surname>Thiel</surname><given-names>Volker</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>748627</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfaender</surname><given-names>Stephanie</given-names></name><name><surname>Thiel</surname><given-names>Volker</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>160780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>Jenna</given-names></name><name><surname>Ebert</surname><given-names>Nadine</given-names></name><name><surname>Thiel</surname><given-names>Volker</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The molecular microenvironment of coronaviral replicase complexes provides functional and spatial links between conserved cellular processes and viral RNA synthesis, and highlights potential targets for the development of novel antivirals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Positive-strand RNA viruses replicate at membranous structures that accommodate the viral replication complex and facilitate RNA synthesis in the cytosol of infected host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Romero-Brey and Bartenschlager, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Romero-Brey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cortese et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knoops et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miorin et al., 2013</xref>). Rewiring host endomembranes is hypothesized to provide a privileged microenvironment physically separated from the cytosol, thereby ensuring adequate concentrations of macromolecules for viral RNA synthesis, preventing recognition of replication intermediates such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by cytosolic innate immune receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Overby et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Neufeldt et al., 2016</xref>), and providing a platform that facilitates molecular interactions with host cell proteins.</p><p>Ultrastructural studies have reported the origin, nature, and extent of membrane modifications induced by coronaviruses (order <italic>Nidovirales</italic>, family <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>), which materialize as an ER-derived network of interconnected double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CM) in perinuclear regions of infected cells to which the viral replication/transcription complex (RTC) is anchored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knoops et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ulasli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oudshoorn et al., 2017</xref>). The RTC is generated by translation of the genomic RNA into two large polyproteins that are extensively auto-proteolytically processed by viral proteases to give rise to 16 processing end-products, termed non-structural proteins (nsps) 1–16. Nsp1 is rapidly cleaved from the polyproteins and not considered an integral component of the coronaviral RTC, but interferes with host cell translation by inducing degradation of cellular mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Züst et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lokugamage et al., 2015</xref>). Although it has not yet been formally demonstrated, the remaining nsps (nsp2-16) are thought to comprise the RTC and harbor multiple enzymes and functions, such as de-ubiquitination, proteases, helicase, polymerase, exo- and endonuclease, and N7- and 2’O-methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Thiel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Snijder et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Decroly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barretto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lindner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Athmer et al., 2017</xref>). Many of these functions have been studied using reverse genetic approaches, which revealed their importance in virus-host interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kindler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Züst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eckerle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). In most cases, phenotypes were described via loss-of-function mutagenesis. However, in the context of virus infection, the specific interactions of RTC components with host cell factors remain largely unknown.</p><p>A number of individual host cell proteins have been shown to impact coronavirus replication by using various screening methods, such as genome-wide siRNA, kinome, and yeast-two-hybrid screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Verheije et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reggiori et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Wilde et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pfefferle et al., 2011</xref>). Likewise, genome-wide CRISPR-based screens have been applied to other positive-stranded RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses, and identified critical host proteins required for replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marceau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Some of these proteins were described in the context of distinct ER processes, such as N-linked glycosylation, ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), and signal peptide insertion and processing. Although individual proteins identified by these screens may interact with viral replication complexes, they likely constitute only a small fraction of the global replicase microenvironment.</p><p>To capture the full breadth of host cell proteins and cellular pathways that are spatially associated with viral RTCs, we employed a proximity-based labeling approach involving a promiscuous <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived biotin ligase (BirA<sub>R118G</sub>). BirA<sub>R118G</sub> biotinylates proximal (&lt;10 nm) proteins in live cells without disrupting intracellular membranes or protein complexes, and hence, does not rely on high-affinity protein-protein interactions but is also able to permanently tag transient interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roux et al., 2012</xref>). Covalent protein biotinylation allows stringent lysis and washing conditions during affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometric identification of captured factors. By engineering a recombinant MHV harboring BirA<sub>R118G</sub> as an integral component of the RTC, we identified &gt;500 host proteins reflecting the molecular microenvironment of MHV replication structures. siRNA-mediated silencing of each of these factors highlighted, amongst others, the functional importance of vesicular ER-Golgi apparatus trafficking pathways, ubiquitin-dependent and autophagy-related catabolic processes, and translation initiation factors. Importantly, the detection of active translation in close proximity to the viral RTC highlighted the critical involvement of translation initiation factors during coronavirus replication. Collectively, the determination of the coronavirus RTC-associated microenvironment provides a functional and spatial link between conserved host cell processes and viral RNA synthesis, and highlights potential targets for the development of novel antiviral agents.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Engineering the BirA<sub>R118G </sub>biotin ligase into the MHV replicase transcriptase complex</title><p>To insert the promiscuous biotin ligase BirA<sub>R118G</sub> as an integral subunit of the MHV RTC, we used a vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eriksson et al., 2008</xref>) to generate a recombinant MHV harboring an in-frame fusion of myc-tagged BirA<sub>R118G</sub> to nsp2.

Thirty-four factors, that are mainly involved in fatty acid β-oxidation biological processes in the mitochondrion, displayed significant enrichment in MHV-WT compared to MHV-BirA<sub>R118G</sub>-nsp2 infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

This is in agreement with studies demonstrating co-localization and interactions amongst individual nsps, and with studies showing association of the nucleocapsid protein with the coronavirus RTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ulasli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denison et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sims et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van der Meer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bost et al., 2001</xref>). It also highlights the specificity and effectiveness of the labeling approach in live cells and is the first experimental evidence showing that collectively these viral nsps and the nucleocapsid (N) protein are subunits of the coronavirus RTC. Furthermore, these results corroborate previous reports that nsp1 is likely not an integral component of the coronavirus RTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Züst et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lokugamage et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denison et al., 1992</xref>). Amongst the ‘not detected’ or ‘not enriched’ viral proteins are (i) nsp11, which is a short peptide of only 14 amino acids at the carboxyterminus of polyprotein 1a with a yet unassigned role or function in coronavirus replication, (ii) the structural proteins spike (S) protein, envelope (E) protein, and membrane (M) protein, which mainly localize to sites of viral assembly before being incorporated into newly-formed viral particles, and (iii) all accessory proteins (NS2a, HE, ORF4, ORF5a). Altogether, these results validate the proximity-dependent biotinylation approach and demonstrate the specific and exclusive labeling of MHV-RTC-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p><p>The BirA<sub>R118G</sub> biotin ligase biotinylates proteins in its close proximity that must not necessarily have tight, prolonged, or direct interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roux et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the identified RTC-proximal host proteins, recorded over the entire duration of the MHV replication cycle, likely include proteins that display a prolonged co-localization with the MHV RTC, proteins that may locate only transiently in close proximity to the RTC, and proteins of which only a minor fraction of the cellular pool may associate with the RTC. To this end, we assessed the localization of a limited number of host proteins from our candidate list in MHV-infected cells. Accordingly, we identified RTC-proximal host proteins displaying a pronounced co-localization with the MHV RTC, such as the ER protein reticulon 4 (RTN4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), and host proteins where co-localization by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was not readily detectable, such as the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3E (eIF3E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). However, in the latter case, a more sensitive detection technique, such as a proximity ligation assay that relies on proximity-dependent antibody-coupled DNA probe amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Söderberg et al., 2006</xref>), demonstrated proximity of eIF3E and dsRNA in MHV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our results show that the approach of integrating a promiscuous biotin ligase as an integral subunit into a coronavirus RTC revealed a comprehensive list of host cell proteins that comprises the RTC microenvironment. The efficacy and specificity of our approach is best illustrated by the fact that we were able to identify all expected viral components of the MHV RTC, while other viral proteins, such as nsp1, structural proteins S, E, and M, and accessory proteins, were not amongst the significantly enriched proteins. Since the biotin-based proximity labeling was performed during the entire viral life cycle, our data likely also contains proteins that are only transiently present in the RTC microenvironment or only comprise a sub-fraction of the cellular pool in close proximity to the MHV RTC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Functional classification of RTC-proximal host factors</title><p>To categorize functionally related proteins from the list of RTC-proximal host proteins and identify enriched biological themes in the dataset, we performed a functional classification of RTC-proximal factors using Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. 86 GO biological process (BP) terms were significantly enriched in the dataset (p-value &lt; 0.05), of which 32 terms were highly significant (p-value &lt; 0.005) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Moreover, Cluster IV was comprised of proteins that mediate clathrin-coated vesicle (endosomal) transport between the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network (TGN), which is also closely associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Together with sorting nexins, cluster IV components can be regarded as regulating late-Golgi trafficking events and interacting with the endosomal system.</p><p>Many of the cellular processes and host proteins assigned to ‘transport’ (specifically in clusters II-IV) are also listed in the category ‘cell organization’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

The high degree of interaction between these subunits is suggestive of the presence of the entire translation initiation apparatus in close proximity to the viral RTC. The 60S ribosomal protein L13a (Rpl13a), ribosome biogenesis protein RLP24 (Rsl24d1), ribosome-binding protein 1 (Rbp1), release factor Gspt1, and regulatory elements, such as Igf2bp1, Gcn1l1, Larp, Fam129a and Nck1, are further indicative of the host cell translation machinery near sites of viral RNA synthesis.</p><p>Lastly, the category ‘catabolic processes’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>) includes a subset of autophagy-related factors and numerous ubiquitin-dependent ERAD components, including the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex and 26S proteasome regulatory subunits (Psmc2, Psmd4).</p><p>Collectively, the coronavirus RTC-proximal proteins identified by proximity labeling greatly expand the repertoire of candidate proteins implicated in the coronavirus replication cycle.

Notably, in MHV-BirA<sub>R118G</sub>-nsp2-infected cells the detection of biotinylated coronavirus replicase gene products nsp2-10, nsp12-16, and the nucleocapsid protein by mass spectrometry demonstrates that these proteins are in close proximity during infection. This extends previous immunofluorescence and electron microscopic studies that were limited by the availability of nsp-specific antibodies and could only show localization of individual nsps to coronavirus replicative structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knoops et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ulasli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schiller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hagemeijer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2005</xref>).

This included several individual factors and host cell pathways, especially transport mechanisms involving vesicle-mediated trafficking, which have been shown to assist coronavirus replication. Indeed, previous findings have reported the importance of the early secretory pathway, as well as key proteins for these processes such as Gbf1 and Arf1, for efficient coronavirus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Verheije et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Wilde et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oostra et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knoops et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vogels et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hsu et al., 2010</xref>). Other markers such as Sec61α have also been detected in proximity of viral RTCs in SARS-CoV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knoops et al., 2010</xref>). Correspondingly, the implications of proteins involved in catabolic processes such as autophagy have also been linked to coronavirus replication and other positive-strand RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reggiori et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monastyrska et al., 2013</xref>). Of note, the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been studied in more details during MHV infection and has also been highlighted in a genetic screen using infectious bronchitis coronavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Raaben et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raaben et al., 2010b</xref>).</p><p>Notably, numerous coronavirus RTC-proximal host proteins and pathways also have documented roles in the life cycle of other, more intensively studied, positive-stranded RNA viruses. Recent genome-wide CRISPR screens identified proteins involved in biosynthesis of membrane and secretory proteins, as well as in the ERAD pathway, as required for flavivirus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marceau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting considerable commonalities and conserved virus-host interactions at the replication complexes of a broad range of RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marceau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hsu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Randall et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, our list of RTC-proximal proteins by far exceeds the number of host cell proteins currently known to interact with viral replication complexes and the vast majority of MHV RTC-proximal proteins have not been described before. These likely include proteins with defined temporal roles during particular phases of the viral life cycle and proteins that did not yet attract our attention in previous screens because of functional redundancies. We therefore expect that this approach will find wide application in the field of virus-host interaction, target identification for virus inhibition, and provides a starting point to reveal similarities and differences between replication strategies of a broad range of viruses.</p><p>One novel finding that arose immediately from our RTC-proximity screen is the demonstration of a close spatial association of host cell translation with the coronavirus RTC. Indeed, the biotin ligase-based proteomic screen identified a number of translation initiation factors, most prominently several eIF3 subunits that were found to have functional importance for viral replication, and numerous ribosome- and translation-associated proteins within the coronavirus RTC microenvironment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These results are in line with a recent genome-wide siRNA screen where translation factors were suggested to play a role in the replication of avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). The implication of this finding has, to our knowledge, not been further investigated. In addition, we noted the presence of subunits of the signal recognition particle in proximity to the coronavirus RTC and their functional relevance for viral replication, which is indicative of an importance for the translation of membrane proteins. Notably, the coronavirus RTC is translated as two polyproteins that contain nsp3, 4 and 6 with multiple trans-membrane domains that are believed to anchor the RTC at ER-derived membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knoops et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oostra et al., 2007</xref>). It is thus tempting to speculate that the coronavirus RTC is either attracting, or deliberately forming in proximity to, the ER-localized host translation machinery in order to facilitate replicase translation and insertion into ER membranes. This idea is also applicable to many other positive-stranded RNA viruses that express viral polyproteins with embedded trans-membrane domains to anchor the viral replication complex in host endomembranes. Recent experimental evidence for Dengue virus supports this hypothesis. By using cell fractionation and ribosomal profiling, it has been shown that translation of the Dengue virus (family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>) genome is associated with the ER-associated translation machinery accompanied by ER-compartment-specific remodeling of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reid et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, several recent genome-wide CRISPR screens demonstrated the functional importance of proteins involved in biosynthesis of membrane and secretory proteins, further supporting a pivotal role of the ER-associated translation machinery for virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Compartmentalization of cellular translation to sites of viral RNA synthesis has been described for dsRNA viruses of the orthoreovirus family, which replicate and assemble in distinct cytosolic inclusions known as viral factories to which the host translation machinery is recruited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Desmet et al., 2014</xref>). The data presented here indicate that coronaviruses have evolved a similar strategy by compartmentalizing and directing viral RNA synthesis to sites of ER-associated translation. Likewise, this strategy has a number of advantages. Coronaviruses would not require sophisticated transport mechanisms that direct viral mRNA to distantly located ribosomes. A close spatial association of viral RNA synthesis and translation during early post-entry events would rather allow for remodeling the ER-associated translation machinery to ensure translation of viral mRNA in a protected microenvironment. Viruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to facilitate translation of their mRNAs including highly diverse internal ribosomal entry sites, recruitment of translation-associated host factors to viral RNAs, and even transcript-specific translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hashem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, by remodeling defined sites for viral mRNA translation, the repertoire and concentration of translation factors can be restricted to factors needed for translation of these viral mRNAs. A microenvironment that is tailored towards the translational needs of viral mRNAs in proximity to the viral replicase complex would also make virus replication tolerant to host- or virus-induced shut down of translation at distal sites within the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Raaben et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, host translational shut down is well known for coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Raaben et al., 2007</xref>) and specifically nsp1 has been implicated to play a role in this context by mediating host mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Narayanan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kamitani et al., 2006</xref>). Coronaviruses may thus have evolved a two-pronged strategy to ensure efficient translation of viral proteins by establishing viral RNA synthesis in close proximity to actively translating ribosomes and by employing nsp1-mediated host cell mRNA degradation at RTC-distal sites. The strategy to assemble the viral RTC in close proximity to translation would also favor the coupling between genome translation and replication that has been proposed for picornaviruses and other positive-strand RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Groot et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Novak and Kirkegaard, 1994</xref>). Finally, host cells are equipped with fine-tuned mechanisms of foreign RNA recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gebhardt et al., 2017</xref>). As such, MDA5 has been identified as a key cytosolic pattern recognition receptor restricting coronavirus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Züst et al., 2011</xref>). Likewise, the nonsense-mediated RNA decay pathway targets mRNAs of different origin containing aberrant features for degradation and has been newly demonstrated to also target cytosolic coronavirus mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wada et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schweingruber et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, proximity of viral mRNA synthesis and translation in a confined microenvironment protected from cytosolic surveillance factors can also be considered a mechanism to evade these cytosolic mRNA decay mechanisms and innate immune sensors of viral RNA.</p><p>The novel finding of a close association of the host translation machinery with sites of viral RNA synthesis during coronavirus infection exemplifies the power of the MHV-BirA<sub>R118G</sub>-nsp2–mediated labeling approach to identify RTC-proximal cellular processes that significantly contribute to viral replication. Indeed, the ability of BirA<sub>R118G</sub> to label viral and host factors independently of high affinity and prolonged molecular interactions enables the establishment of a comprehensive repertoire reflecting the history of protein association with the viral RTC, recorded during the entire course of infection. In future studies it will be important to provide an ‘RTC-association map’ with temporal resolution. Like we have seen for translation initiation factors in this study, association of host cell proteins with the viral RTC might not persist throughout the entire replication cycle but might be of importance only transiently or during specific phases of the replication cycle. Given its short labeling time, APEX2 indeed offers this possibility to dissect protein recruitment to the viral RTC in a time-resolved manner, that is to detect RTC-associated host proteins at specific time points post infection. This will ultimately result in a dynamic, high resolution molecular landscape of virus-host interactions at the RTC and provide an additional impetus to elucidate critical virus-host interactions that take place at the site of viral RNA synthesis. These interactions should be exploited in the development of novel strategies to combat virus infection, based on conserved mechanisms of interactions at replication complexes of a broad range of positive-stranded RNA viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (Escherichia coli)</td><td valign="top">BirA<sub>R118G</sub></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">PMCID: 3308701</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (mouse hepatitis virus)</td><td valign="top">MHV-A59</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">PMID: 15709029</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (mouse hepatitis virus)</td><td valign="top">MHV-Gluc</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">PMID: 24874215</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (mouse hepatitis virus)</td><td valign="top">MHV-BirA<sub>R118G</sub>-nsp2</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (human coronavirus)</td><td valign="top">HCoV-229E</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">PMID: 19057873</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus)</td><td valign="top">MERS-CoV</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">PMID: 23170002; 23078800</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (Mus musculus)</td><td valign="top">L929</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">85011425</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (Mus musculus)</td><td valign="top">17Cl1</td><td valign="top">Gift from S.G.

The QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Switzerland) was used according to the manufactures instructions for measuring the expression levels of Rpl13a, eIF3E, eIF3I, eIF3F, eIF4G1, eIF4G2, eIF2ak3, Rsl24d1 and Tbp. All primer pairs where placed over an exon intron junction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). All expression levels are displayed as ΔΔCt over non-targeting siRNA (ΔCt values calculated as Ct target - Ct Tbp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Livak and Schmittgen, 2001</xref>). One-way ANOVA (ordinary one-way ANOVA, uncorrected Fisher’s LSD test) was used to test the statistical significance.</p><p>Western blots were performed after a 48 hr transfection of 10 nM individual siRNAs as described before. Cells were lysed in M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with cOmplete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and Laemmli SDS-sample buffer. Samples were loaded on 4–12% Bolt Bis-Tris gels and run in MES SDS buffer (Life Technolgies). Proteins were blotted on a nitrocellulose membranes using a power blotter system and power blotter select transfer stacks (ThermoFisher Scientific). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in PBS supplemented with 0.5% Tween20 (PBST) and incubated with primary antibodies (anti-eIF3E, HPA023973; anti-eIF3F, ab176853; anti-eIF3I, HPA029939) and secondary HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in 0.5% milk in PBST. Proteins were visualized using WesternBright enhanced chemiluminescence horseradish peroxidase substrate (Advansta) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, membranes were washed extensively in PBST and probed using an HRP-conjugated anti-actin antibody (Sigma A3854).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Total cellular translation</title><p>siRNA-based silencing was performed as described above. 48 hr post-transfection, control cells were incubated with 355 μM cycloheximide (Sigma) and 208 μM Emetin (Sigma) for 30 min to block protein synthesis. Cells were treated with 3 μM puromycin for 60 min followed by three PBS washes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shen et al., 2018</xref>). Total cell lysates were prepared using M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with protease inhibitors (cOmplete Mini, Roche). Lysates were separated on a 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and electroblotted as described above. Western blots were probed using a monclonal AlexaFluor647-conjugated anti-puromycin antibody (clone 12D10, Merk Millipore) and a donkey-derived HRP-conjugated anti-mouse (Jackson immunoresearch 715-035-151). Actin was detected using a monoclonal HRP-conjugated anti-actin antibody (Sigma A3854) and used to normalize input.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Ribopuromycylation assay</title><p>Ribopuromycylation of actively translating ribosomes was performed as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">David et al., 2012</xref>). L929, Huh-7 cells were seeded on glass coverslips and infected with MHV-A59 (L929), HCoV-229E (Huh-7) and MERS-CoV (Huh-7) at MOI = 1. One hour after inoculation, cells were washed with PBS and incubated further for the indicated time. Cells were treated with 355 μM cycloheximide and 208 μM Emetin (Sigma) for 15 min at 37°C. Cells were further incubated in medium containing 355 μM cycloheximide, 208 μM Emetin and 182 μM puromycin (Sigma) for additional 5 min. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and fix on ice for 20 min in buffer containing 50 mM TRIS HCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM KCl, 355 μM cycloheximide, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) TritonX-100, 3% formalin and protease inhibitors (cOmplete Mini, Roche). Cells were blocked for 30 min in CB, and immunostained as described above using polyclonal anti-MHV-nsp2/3 (gift from S. Baker), polyclonal anti-HCoV-229E-nsp8 (gift from J. Ziebuhr), or monoclonal anti-dsRNA (J2 MAB, English and Scientific Consulting) as primary antibodies to detect MHV and HCoV-229E replication complexes, respectively. Donkey-derived, AlexaFluor488-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) were used as secondary antibodies. Additionally, ribosome-bound puromycin was detected using a monoclonal AlexaFluor647-conjugated anti-puromycin antibody (clone 12D10, Merk Millipore). Slides were mounted, imaged and processed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>DAB staining and transmission electron microscopy</title><p>L929 fibroblasts were seeded in 24-well plates and infected with MHV-APEX2-nsp2, MHV-A59, or non-infected for 10 hr. 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) stains were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martell et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, cells were fixed at 10 h.p.i. using warm 2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 mM calcium chloride (cacodylate buffer) and placed on ice for 60 min. The following incubations were performed on ice in ice-cold buffers unless stated otherwise. Cells were washed 3x with sodium cacodylate buffer, quenched with 20 mM glycine in cacodylate buffer for 5 min. before three additional washes with cacodylate buffer. Cells were stained in cacodylate buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml DAB and 10 mM H2O2 for 20 min until DAB precipitates were visible by light microscopy. Cells were washed 3x with cacodylate buffer to stop the staining reaction. Processing of samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schätz et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, cells were washed once with PBS prewarmed to 37°C and subsequently fixed with 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (Merck, Hohenbrunn, Germany) pH 7.4 for 30 min at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. After three washes in cacodylate buffer for 10 min each, cells were post-fixed with 1% OsO4 (Chemie Brunschwig, Basel, Switzerland) in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 1 hr at 4°C and again washed three times with cacodylate buffer. Thereafter, cells were dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series (70%, 80%, 90%, 94%, 100% (v/v) for 20 min each) and embedded in Epon resin, a mixture of Epoxy embedding medium, dodecenyl succinic anhydride (DDSA) and methyl nadic anhydride (MNA) (Sigma Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland). Ultrathin sections of 90 nm were then obtained with diamond knives (Diatome, Biel, Switzerland) on a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E (Leica, Heerbrugg, Switzerland) and collected on collodion-coated 200-mesh copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Sections were double-stained with 0.5% (w/v) uranyl acetate for 30 min at 40°C (Sigma Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) and 3% (w/v) lead citrate for 10 min at 20°C (Laurylab, Saint Fons, France) in an Ultrastain (Leica, Vienna, Austria) and examined with a Philips CM12 transmission electron microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. Micrographs were captured with a Mega View III camera using the iTEM software (version 5.2; Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions GmbH, Münster, Germany).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Mark Denison, Susan Baker, and John Ziebuhr for sharing virus sequence information and antisera.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, V'kovski and colleagues described the use of proximity labeling in an attempt to define the complete proteome of replication complexes within the cytoplasm of coronavirus infected cells. For this study, the authors mainly focused on mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), but they also confirmed a subset of their findings with human coronavirus 229E and MERS-coronavirus. They used very well controlled experimental conditions at one time point during MHV infection of L929 cells in culture. The authors engineered a biotin ligase into the coding region of nsp2 and demonstrated that this virus, as well as a control GFP virus, had replication kinetics and growth properties similar to those of WT MHV. Five hundred proteins were identified, roughly 50 of which had proviral effects, as surmised from the decrease in viral RNA replication when the abundance of their mRNAs was reduced by siRNA treatment.</p><p>This is a well-crafted study that has generated a wealth of data regarding the composition of membrane bound replication complexes in coronavirus-infected mouse cells. It has the potential for uncovering the mechanistic details of how RNA replication complexes are assembled, how those complexes change during infection, and how viral non-structural proteins interact with a large array of host proteins to produce viral mRNAs and RNA replication intermediates. Given the already ambitious scope of the current study, all these mechanistic questions could not be addressed in this manuscript, but it is anticipated that data reported in this paper will be a springboard for many future studies. Here, the authors focused on translation factors and used a puromycin incorporation assay to show that active viral translation occurred near sites of viral RNA synthesis, providing evidence for the spatial coupling of viral translation and RNA synthesis functions and likely dependence of nascent protein synthesis for the proper topology of membrane association.</p><p>A small amount of additional protein work is needed to demonstrate the integrity of the BirA<sub>R118G</sub>-nsp2 fusion protein during infection and the reduction in ribosomal proteins following siRNA treatment.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1A and 1B.

In order to assess whether BirA<sub>R118G</sub> remains fused to nsp2 during infection, we performed a western blot analysis of mock-infected, MHV-WT and MHV-BirA<sub>R118G</sub>-nsp2-infected cells, using an anti-myc monoclonal antibody.</p><p>As shown in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 1, a specific band at the expected molecular weight of 102.2 kDa was detected specifically in MHV-BirA<sub>R118G</sub>-nsp2 lysates. Additionally, a band largely exceeding the size of the reference protein ladder likely represents polyprotein precursors. Importantly, no specific bands were detected at 36.7 kDa, which represents the expected molecular weight of myc-BirA<sub>R118G</sub>. Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis of MHV-BirA<sub>R118G</sub>-nsp2-infected cells further demonstrates the association of BirA<sub>R118G</sub> with nsp2/3 and nsp8-labelled RTCs at all investigated time points (9, 12, 15 hours post infection) (Figure 1C and Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 1—figure supplement 3). We included the immunofluorescence data from time points 9h and 15h post infection in the new supplementary Figure 1—figure supplement 2. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that BirA<sub>R118G</sub> remains fused to nsp2 during the entire course of MHV-BirA<sub>R118G</sub>-nsp2 infection and is not cleaved by viral proteinases.</p><p>These results were included in the manuscript as two new supplementary figures (Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2) and in the second paragraph of the subsection “Engineering the BirA<sub>R118G</sub>-biotin ligase into the MHV replicase transcriptase complex”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data and their interpretation presented in the subsection “Active translation near sites of viral mRNA synthesis”, are problematic.

In order to address this question, we ordered a deconvolved siRNA library containing target-specific, single siRNAs to silence eIF3e, eIF3f and eIF3i as well as eIF4G1 and Rpl13a. Next, we assessed protein levels by western blot after siRNA-mediated silencing of these factors (48h). For Rpl13a, we did not find suitable commercial antibodies, and western blots using both a polyclonal rabbit anti-eIF4G1 as well as a monoclonal rabbit anti-eIF4G1 (cell signalling 2858 and 8701) did not result in western blots of acceptable quality to allow quantification.</p><p>However, we could find suitable monoclonal antibodies for eIF3e, eIF3f and eIF3i, and we show in a new figure (Figure 5) that the knockdown of eIF3e, eIF3f and eIF3i, using 4 distinct siRNAs, resulted in a significant decrease of protein levels when normalized to an actin loading control. These data were performed in three independent siRNA knockdown followed by western blot experiments. Correspondingly, assessing viral replication using MHV-Gluc in the same knockdown conditions was consistent with previous results and confirmed that the knockdown of eIF3e, eIF3f and eIF3i significantly impairs viral replication.</p><p>These results are displayed in a new figure (Figure 5) and in the first paragraph of the subsection “Active translation near sites of viral mRNA synthesis”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection &quot;Functional classification of the RTC-proximal host factors.&quot; This subsection contains a lengthy analysis of what emerged from the GO analysis, and how these observations could be connected with the literature.

Indeed, within the coronavirus RTC microenvironment, we expect to detect both proviral host factors that are required and support viral replication, as well as antiviral factors responsible for detecting viral replication intermediates. However since this study was performed in a L929 mouse fibroblast cell line, it is not surprising that the results are skewed towards highlighting proviral factors. To detect antiviral factors, other cell lines/types, e.g. primary macrophages, that are better equipped in eliciting antiviral responses, would be preferable.</p><p>Accordingly, we included the following sentence in the manuscript: “In contrast, we did not find antiviral factors that resulted in significant enhancement of viral replication upon siRNA knockdown. While this work was performed in a murine fibroblast cell line, the identification of antiviral proteins may be anticipated in a similar siRNA-mediated knockdown screen using primary target cells such as macrophages, that are better equipped in eliciting antiviral responses upon virus infection.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
