the reprogramming of metabolic pathways, whereby a switch from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism diverts glycolytic intermediates towards anabolic pathways. Herein, we identify a novel role for TRIM32 in the maintenance of glycolytic flux mediated by biochemical interactions with the glycolytic enzymes Aldolase and Phosphoglycerate mutase. Loss of <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRIM32, encoded by <italic>thin (tn)</italic>, shows reduced levels of glycolytic intermediates and amino acids. This altered metabolic profile correlates with a reduction in the size of glycolytic larval muscle and brain tissue. Consistent with a role for metabolic intermediates in glycolysis-driven biomass production, dietary amino acid supplementation in <italic>tn</italic> mutants improves muscle mass. Remarkably, TRIM32 is also required for ectopic growth - loss of TRIM32 in a wing disc-associated tumor model reduces glycolytic metabolism and restricts growth. Overall, our results reveal a novel role for TRIM32 for controlling glycolysis in the context of both normal development and tumor growth.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRIM32</kwd><kwd>muscle</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>glycolysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR060788</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geisbrecht</surname><given-names>Erika R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM119557</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tennessen</surname><given-names>Jason M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AR073373</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geisbrecht</surname><given-names>Erika R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TRIM32-mediated glycolytic flux generates precursors that are utilized for biomass production in non-dividing muscle, brain and tumor cells, demonstrating a universal metabolic function for TRIM32 in cell growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The metabolism of all cells must adapt to meet the energetic and biosynthetic needs of growth and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lloyd, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu and Thompson, 2019</xref>). For example, tissues composed of non-dividing, differentiated cells must strike a balance between catabolic pathways that provide energy for cellular homeostasis and anabolic pathways that repair the cell and generate cell-type-specific molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lloyd, 2013</xref>). In contrast, the metabolic requirements of cell growth and proliferation often require a shift toward anabolic pathways that favors the synthesis of macromolecules, such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and complex carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu and Thompson, 2019</xref>). Striking this delicate balance between degradative and biosynthetic processes requires the integration of extracellular and intracellular information by complex signaling networks.</p><p>The mechanisms by which cell proliferation and tissue growth rewire metabolism to enhance biosynthesis are diverse and complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011</xref>). These changes in metabolic flux involve pathways such as the pyrimidine and purine biosynthesis, one carbon metabolism, and the interplay between the citric acid cycle and amino acids pools. However, the pathway most commonly associated with enhanced biosynthesis is glycolysis, where in biological systems ranging from yeast to human T-cells, glycolytic flux is often elevated in the context of cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu and Thompson, 2019</xref>). This observation is particularly apparent in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, where the onset of larval development is preceded by a metabolic switch that induces the coordinate upregulation of genes involved in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tennessen et al., 2011</xref>). The resulting metabolic program allows larvae to use dietary carbohydrates for both energy production and biomass accumulation. Moreover, studies of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval muscles reveal that this metabolic transition is essential for muscle growth and development, suggesting that glycolysis serves a key role in controlling growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tennessen et al., 2014b</xref>). The mechanisms that control glycolysis specifically in larval muscle, however, remain relatively unexplored. As a result, <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval development provides an excellent model for understanding how glycolysis and biomass production are regulated in a rapidly growing tissue. Moreover, since larval muscle increases in size without cell divisions, larval muscle provides an unusual opportunity to understand how glycolytic metabolism promotes growth independent of cell division.</p><p>Of the known factors that promote muscle development, TRIM32 is an intriguing candidate for coordinating metabolism with cell growth. This protein is a member of the Tripartite motif (TRIM)-containing family of proteins defined by an N-terminal RING domain, one or two B-boxes, a coiled-coil domain, and a variable C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tocchini and Ciosk, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Watanabe and Hatakeyama, 2017</xref>). In TRIM32, six <underline>N</underline>cl-1, <underline>H</underline>T2A, <underline>L</underline>in-41 (NHL) repeats comprise the C-terminus and are proposed to mediate the diverse functions of TRIM32, including cell proliferation, neuronal differentiation, muscle physiology and regeneration, and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lazzari and Meroni, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tocchini and Ciosk, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Watanabe and Hatakeyama, 2017</xref>). A single mutation in the B-box region of TRIM32 causes the multisystemic disorder Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2006</xref>), while multiple mutations that cluster in the NHL domains result in the muscle disorders Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H (LGMD2H) and Sarcotubular Myopathy (STM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frosk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazzari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nectoux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schoser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">ServiÃ¡n-Morilla et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A complete understanding of TRIM32 function is confounded by its ubiquitous expression and multitude of potential substrates for E3 ligase activity via the RING domain. Many known TRIM32 target substrates include proteins implicated in muscle physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kudryashova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Locke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Volodin et al., 2017</xref>) or the prevention of satellite cell senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kudryashova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mokhonova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">ServiÃ¡n-Morilla et al., 2019</xref>), consistent with a role for TRIM32 in LGMD2H. However, additional polyubiquitinated substrates, including p53, Abi2, Piasy, XIAP, and MYCN, are implicated in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Izumi and Kaneko, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ryu et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, TRIM32 protein levels are upregulated in multiple tumor types, suggesting that TRIM32 is a key player in growth regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). There is precedence for NHL function in controlling cell proliferation as two other <italic>Drosophila</italic> NHL-containing proteins, Brat and Mei-P26, act as tumor suppressors in the larval brain and female germline, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arama et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edwards et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Here, we provide a novel mechanism for TRIM32 in cell growth. Our data show that TRIM32 promotes glucose metabolism through the stabilization of glycolytic enzyme levels. This increased rate of TRIM32-mediated glycolytic flux generates precursors that are utilized for biomass production. Surprisingly, this mechanism operates in both non-dividing muscle cells as well as in proliferating larval brain cells, demonstrating a universal metabolic function for TRIM32 in growth control.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TRIM32 binds to glycolytic enzymes</title><p>While NHL domain-containing proteins can interact with both RNAs and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tocchini and Ciosk, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Watanabe and Hatakeyama, 2017</xref>), few bona fide TRIM32 binding partners have been identified. Causative mutations in human LGMD2H cluster in the NHL repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">CossÃ©e et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frosk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazzari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nectoux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schoser et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that this region may mediate protein-protein interactions important in disease prevention. We previously showed that mutations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRIM32 also show progressive larval muscle degeneration, despite modest sequence identity (~42%) across the NHL domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">LaBeau-DiMenna et al., 2012</xref>). To gain molecular-level insight into the functional conservation between the NHL regions in fly and mammalian TRIM32, we obtained a crystal structure of TRIM32_NHL at 2.6 Ã resolution (Rwork/RfreeÂ =Â 18.2/22.8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). The structure was solved by molecular replacement, using the NHL-repeat region of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Brat protein as a search model (PDB Code 1Q7F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edwards et al., 2003</xref>). This structure features a six-bladed Î²-propeller, where each NHL repeat is comprised of four antiparallel Î²-strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). We then used the TRIM32_NHL structure to construct a model for mouse TRIM32_NHL using SWISS-MODEL. Indeed, the superimposition of these two structures demonstrate that the NHL region of <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRIM32 is a faithful model to understand NHL function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The NHL region of <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRIM32 is structurally conserved.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the RING, B-box, coiled-coil, and NHL domains in TRIM32.

Briefly, the C-terminal region of <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRIM32 containing all six NHL domains (AA 1061â1353) was fused in-frame with an N-terminal Glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag. This GST_TRIM32_NHL protein was expressed, purified, and incubated with third instar larval (L3) lysates. These resulting protein complexes were subjected to MS to detect peptide fragments that co-purify with TRIM32_NHL. In addition to the recovery of our bait protein, we detected peptides corresponding to Tropomyosin (Tm) and Troponin T (TnT) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1âsource data 2</xref>), which are both known polyubiquitinated substrates of mammalian TRIM32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, glycolytic enzymes were also enriched in the list of possible NHL-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1âsource data 2</xref>) and were further evaluated for physical interactions with TRIM32.</p><p>We utilized two independent methods to validate candidate protein interactions with TRIM32. First, an in vitro binding assay using purified proteins was developed with Tropomyosin 2 (Tm2) as a positive control. Indeed, incubation of TRIM32_NHL together with His-tagged Tm2 confirmed a physical interaction between these two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). This assay was then used to test for physical interactions with candidate glycolytic enzymes. To this end, we expressed and purified His-tagged Aldolase (Ald) or His-tagged Phosphoglycerate mutase 78 (Pglym), both of which were low or absent in control pulldowns. Both Ald and Pglym were found to directly interact with the NHL domains of TRIM32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Note that no binding was detected between TRIM32_NHL and the His-tagged control protein SCIN, ruling out non-specific binding of the His tag. To extend these findings, we utilized immunoprecipitation experiments to test for in vivo interactions with full-length TRIM32. As expected, immunoprecipitation of TRIM32 successfully pulled-down Tm as an interacting protein at the predicted molecular weight ofÂ ~37 kD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). We also confirmed that both Ald and Pglym co-immunoprecipitate with anti-TRIM32 antibody. Interestingly, the bands corresponding to these proteins migrated at a higher molecular weight than the expected size present in input lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>; asterisk), suggestive of a post-translational modification. Two approaches were taken to confirm the specificity of the slower migrating bands that correspond to Ald or Pglym. First, we concentrated L3 lysates before SDS-PAGE analysis.

In order to support high levels of biomass accumulation, glycolytic metabolism is increased prior to larval growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tennessen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tennessen et al., 2014b</xref>). One larval tissue that requires high glycolytic activity is the somatic musculature, where <italic>WT</italic> body wall muscles undergo dramatic growth as development proceeds from second instar larvae (L2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,G</xref>) to the L3 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,G</xref>). We, and others, previously reported a loss of structural integrity in TRIM32-deficient muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Domsch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">LaBeau-DiMenna et al., 2012</xref>) and assumed that the associated reduction in muscle size was a secondary consequence of progressive tissue degeneration. While multiple independent alleles of <italic>tn</italic> have been shown to produce smaller muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Domsch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">LaBeau-DiMenna et al., 2012</xref>), quantification of <italic>tn-/-</italic> confirmed a decrease in larval muscle diameter in both L2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,G</xref>) and L3 individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Thus, loss of TRIM32 compromises the glycolytic-driven growth of muscles during larval development.</p><p>As an initial assessment of glycolytic activity, we measured the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in <italic>WT</italic> or <italic>tn-/-</italic> muscle carcasses using the Agilent Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer. Since a major contributor to extracellular acidification is lactate excretion into medium during glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mookerjee and Brand, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">TeSlaa and Teitell, 2014</xref>), we anticipated, and indeed, observed a reduction in ECAR upon loss of TRIM32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). While quantitative, end-point assays such as ECAR, only measure a population of muscles at a single time point. For real-time measurements of glycolytic flux, the Xe96 Analyzer was used to calculate the proton efflux rate (PER). This assay specifically provides a measurement of protons derived from glycolysis by correcting for both the production of protons derived from mitochondrial reactions and for the buffering capacity of the assay medium. Briefly, the assay measures ECAR of the system under three conditions: (1) without manipulation, (2) following addition of the electron transport chain inhibitors rotenone and antimycin A, and (3) after addition of the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). The end result of the assay is a measurement of acidification rate largely due to glycolytic sources. Our analysis revealed that glycolytic metabolism produces fewer protons in <italic>tn-/-</italic> muscle carcasses as compared with <italic>WT</italic> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), thus supporting our hypothesis that TRIM32 is required to support glycolytic flux.</p><p>To independently validate that loss of TRIM32 results in decreased glycolytic flux, we directly measured NADH levels within muscle tissues using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), which exploits the fluorescent characteristic of this cofactor to visualize NADH levels in cellular microenvironments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Provenzano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">SzaszÃ¡k et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yaseen et al., 2017</xref>). Since the fluorescent lifetime of NADH (the time required for NADH to decay when exposed to 740 nm wavelength light) is longer when NADH is bound to mitochondrial enzymes than in the free state, this assay can distinguish intracellular NADH pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bird et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Skala et al., 2007</xref>). This analysis revealed that <italic>WT</italic> muscles analyzed by FLIM showed a markedly shorter lifetime than <italic>tn-/-</italic> muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Since free, unbound NADH is predominate in highly glycolytic cells, here we confirm a reduction in the glycolytic profile upon loss of TRIM32. These data, taken together, strongly support the hypothesis that TRIM32 maintains glycolytic flux in larval muscle tissue.</p><p>One consequence of analyzing <italic>tn</italic> mutant alleles is the possibility that the observed muscle defects result from loss of TRIM32 in other tissues. To rule out TRIM32-mediated systemic defects, we utilized tissue-specific RNAi approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>). First, we reconfirmed that induction of three independent RNAi constructs targeting <italic>tn mRNA</italic> transcripts with the <italic>mef2</italic>-Gal4 muscle driver produced smaller muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B,D</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brooks et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Domsch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">LaBeau-DiMenna et al., 2012</xref>). Knockdown of TRIM32 in a single muscle (5053&gt;Â &gt;<italic>tn RNAi</italic>, asterisk) within each hemisegment was sufficient to reduce muscle cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

These changes in amino acid abundance are likely due to both decreased synthesis and increased catabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), as we observed that <italic>tn-/-</italic> exhibited a&gt;1.5 decrease in not only serine and glycine levels which are normally synthesized from glucose, but also a reduction in the anaplerotic amino acids proline and aspartic acid. Moreover, loss of TRIM32 also induced a significant depletion of alanine, which is both synthesized from and catabolized into pyruvate. Overall, the metabolomic profile of <italic>tn-/-</italic> indicates that disruption of glucose catabolism results in depletion of larval amino acid pools, raising the possibility that decreased amino acid availability contributes to the <italic>tn-/-</italic> muscle defects.

Maintenance of such a high metabolic rate predicts that enzymes are present at sufficient concentrations in the cell to mediate the rapid shunting of intermediates through the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Menard et al., 2014</xref>). We show here that TRIM32 directly interacts with and maintains the levels of two glycolytic enzymes.

In many organisms, the insulin/target of rapamycin (TOR) pathways integrate nutritional signals to physiologically control body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hyun, 2013</xref>). Implicit in this mechanism is the scaling of individual organs. Four pieces of evidence refute nutritional status as a mechanism for TRIM32-mediated tissue growth. First, the overall body size of <italic>tn</italic> mutant pupae is not smaller than their <italic>WT</italic> counterparts under starvation conditions, but instead elongated due to defective muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Domsch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">LaBeau-DiMenna et al., 2012</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>). Second, the size of the wing disc and midgut, both tissues that show reduced growth in poorly fed larvae, is not altered upon loss of TRIM32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2FâH</xref>).

Collectively, these data demonstrate that TRIM32 functions in a cell autonomous manner to regulate tissue growth, independent of systemic nutritional status.</p><p>Li, et al., recently reported that pathways controlling lactate and glycerol-3-phosphate metabolism function redundantly in larval growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Removal of LDH and hence lactate production caused an increase in glycerol-3-phosphate, which was sufficient to maintain larval redox balance. Since both LDH and GPDH1 regulate redox balance necessary for maintaining high glycolytic flux to promote biomass accumulation, <italic>Ldh, Gpdh1</italic> double mutants exhibit severe growth defects with reduced brain size. Our results show that loss of TRIM32 decreases both lactate and glycerol-3-phosphate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), thus mimicking the reduced carbohydrate metabolism in <italic>Ldh, Gpdh1</italic> double mutants.</p><p>It is not clear how mutations in a ubiquitously expressed protein such as TRIM32 result in tissue-specific diseases. One prediction is that TRIM32 differentially interacts with proteins in diverse cell types to elicit distinct biological outputs. There is strong evidence to support this hypothesis in the context of LGMD2H. TRIM32 is upregulated in proliferating satellite cells and loss of this protein prevents myotube regeneration, partially through the misregulation of NDRG and c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kudryashova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mokhonova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nicklas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">ServiÃ¡n-Morilla et al., 2019</xref>). Muscle-specific targets that contribute to disease progression are less clear. TRIM32-mediated deregulation of key muscle substrates, including actin, Î±-actinin, tropomyosin, and desmin, contribute to muscle atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kudryashova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Locke et al., 2009</xref>), but studies have not been performed to directly test this model in the context of LGMD2H. Interestingly, mammalian glycolytic type II fibers are preferentially affected over oxidative type I fibers in muscle atrophy induced by aging/starvation, as well as in Duchenneâs and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciciliot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pant et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>TRIM32 KO</italic> muscles also show a decrease in the glycolytic proteins GAPDH and PyK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mokhonova et al., 2015</xref>), just as we observe a reduction in Ald and Pglym levels in <italic>tn-/-</italic> muscles, suggesting that TRIM32-mediated regulation of glycolysis may be a general mechanism that underlies some muscular dystrophies.</p><p>The multi-faceted roles exhibited by TRIM32 in muscle physiology and cancer seem quite different on the surface. However, control of glycolytic flux may be a common mode of regulation that has been overlooked. As in muscle tissue, the majority of studies on TRIM32 and cancer have focused on identifying substrates that are subject to poly-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Piasy, p53 and Abi2 are known targets of TRIM32 E3 activity that regulate the proliferative balance in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). The proteolytic turnover of these proteins may affect signaling pathways independent of glycolytic TRIM32 regulation or may be a compensatory mechanism in response to metabolic shifts in which normal cells can transiently adopt cancer-like metabolism during periods of rapid proliferation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of this study</title><p>How does this loss of TRIM32 lead to a reduction in glycolytic enzymes? Glycolytic proteins may be substrates for TRIM32 E3 ligase activity. It seems unlikely that TRIM32 polyubiquitinates Ald or Pglym for proteasomal degradation as protein levels are not elevated upon loss of this putative E3 activity. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitaion of higher molecular weight forms of Ald or Pglym with TRIM32 suggests a yet unidentified post-translational modification. Another possibility, which we favor, is that the NHL domain of TRIM32 serves as a scaffold for the subcellular localization of glycolytic proteins to limit diffusion of substrates during glycolysis. This does not negate, but rather expands the repertoire of TRIM32 functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

An Agilent Seahorse XFe96 cartridge (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) was hydrated with 200 Î¼l of calibrant solution (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) overnight at 25Â°C. The next day, brains, muscles, or discs were dissected in phosphate buffered solution (PBS) and added to an Agilent 96-well cell plate (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) containing 50 Î¼l of Agilent Seahorse assay media with supplements required for specific assay (see glycolytic rate assay method). Tissue was sunk to the bottom of the well and centered in the middle between the three raised spheres. Forceps were used to lower the tissue restraint such that the plastic ring is facing toward the bottom of the well and the nylon screen is facing the top of the well. A probe was used to gently push the edge of the tissue restraint down toward the bottom of the well until the restraint did not move or float in the well. 130 Î¼l of assay media was added to each well; resulting in a total of 180 Î¼l final in each well. The cell plate was placed on the tray of the XFe96 analyzer. The instrument was for basal and glycolytic rate assays with all cycle procedures consisting of one-minute mixing, zero-minutes waiting, and 3-min measuring. <italic>Basal ECAR measurements using the XFe96.</italic> Basal levels of extracellular acidification (ECAR) were measured for a minimum of six cycles. Tissue restraints were measured without tissue as a control. Agilent Seahorse XF assay medium (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) supplemented with 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM sodium pyruvate was used for all basal measurement assays. A minimum of 4 biological replicates were used to analyze the basal rate of <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>tn-/-</italic> larval muscle. Standard error of the mean (SEM) was used in analyzing metabolic measurement levels. Statistical significance was determined using the Holm-Sidak method with alphaÂ =Â 0.05. <italic>Glycolytic Rate Assay.</italic> Analysis of glycolytic rate with mitochondrial-produced acidification subtracted was conducted using base medium without phenol red (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), supplemented with 5 mM Hepes (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), 2 mM glutamine, 10 mM glucose and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. 20 Î¼l of 50 Î¼M rotenone and antimycin-A was added to port A and injected at the 7th cycle, resulting in a final concentration of 5 Î¼M rotenone and antimycin-A. 22 Î¼l of 1M 2-deoxyglutarate (2-DG) was added to port B and injected at the 12th cycle, resulting in a final concentration of 100 mM 2-DG. The software package included with this kit analyzes the oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates, while factoring in the buffer capacity of the media. It also calculates the acidification caused by the mitochondria and subtracts this from the data. This method produces the proton efflux rate (PER). A minimum of four biological replicates were used to analyze the glycolytic rate of <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>tn-/-</italic> larval brains.

Biochemical and genetic studies using <italic>Drosophila</italic> provide critical insights into how cells achieve such a switch via the E3 ligase protein, TRIM32. In addition to its role in protein degradation, authors have shown that TRIM32 physically interacts with and stabilizes key glycolytic proteins, Aldolase and Phosphoglycerate mutase and controls glycolytic flux. Given that its function is proven in both the muscle and in overgrowing tissues, it will be interesting to see detailed molecular mechanisms of TRIM32 that may be conserved in other species.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>Drosophila</italic> TRIM32 cooperates with glycolytic enzymes to promote cell growth&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Authors have characterized structural homologies between the mammalian TRIM32 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> thin, and isolated glycolytic enzymes including Aldolase and Pglym as biochemical interactors. Loss of TRIM32 leads to an overall loss of glycolytic metabolites and 11 amino acids, and as a consequence, ATP levels significantly reduce in this background. Furthermore, authors have shown TRIM32 is required for the Pvr-induced tumor growth in the wing disc, concluding that TRIM32 is a critical regulator of glycolytic enzymes in both developing and cancerous tissues.</p><p>1) Authors have indicated that <italic>tn-/-</italic> larvae significantly decreased ATP levels as well as glycolytic products. These metabolic consequences could be due to reduced food consumption or dysfunctions in the digestive system. Authors need to distinguish systemic developmental defects and cell-autonomous functions of <italic>tn</italic> mutants. It will be critical to include proper controls showing that the metabolic phenotype is not derived by <italic>tn</italic>-mediated systemic effects but by loss of <italic>tn</italic> in a specific tissue. As one of the examples, tissue-specific metabolic measurements after the loss of <italic>tn</italic> in the muscle or the brain could suitably support the query.</p><p>2) The authors' previous study on <italic>tn</italic> mutants has shown that loss of <italic>tn</italic> causes an overall reduction in the muscle and animal size. In Figure 4A, authors have claimed that <italic>tn</italic> mutants exhibit the significantly smaller size of the brain, in addition to the muscle. However, given that <italic>tn</italic> mutants are smaller in their size, it will be important to show proportional size changes of the brain and the muscle compared to the larval size changes.</p><p>3) According to the Materials and methods, authors cultured <italic>WT</italic> or <italic>tn</italic> mutant larvae on the agar plate from very early stages and let them grow until the 3rd instar. However, <italic>WT</italic> animals marginally change their body mass and the muscle diameter after the chronic starvation (Figure 3F-I). How do larvae properly grow without any nutrition? Supporting references on the chronic starvation and normal growth, or some other control experiments would make the data more concrete and convincing.</p><p>4) If NHL domain plays a unique role in protecting the glycolytic enzymes, a specific deletion or mutation on the NHL domain would provide more precise metabolic phenotypes while eliminating Ub-mediated complexities. It is not clear in the current version whether it is the NHL domain mutation that gives rise to the glycolytic phenotypes. It will be important to segregate non-canonical TRIM32 functions through NHL domain from Ub-mediated canonical phenotypes.</p><p>5) In Figure 4E-H, authors have shown that the Pvr-induced tumor growth phenotype is recovered by loss of <italic>tn</italic>. Though the representative image in Figure 4F displays significantly bigger wing disc, the quantitation of the <italic>dpp&gt;Pvr<sup>act</sup></italic> shown in Figure 4H indicates a comparable measurement to that of controls. Accurate measurement would enhance the clarity of data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting study uncovering a novel function for the disease-associated protein TRIM32. This will likely be of interest to a broad audience studying metabolism, muscle biology, as well as the TRIM32-associated diseases.</p><p>A number of issues need to be significantly strengthened, however, to make the main conclusions of this study solid:</p><p>1) Does full-length TRIM32 bind Ald and Pglym in vivo? The authors only show an in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins (likely in high molar concentrations) using a truncated TRIM32 version. Can these protein-protein interactions be observed by co-immunoprecipitation using full-length TRIM32 from tissue or cell lysates?</p><p>2) It is not clear that the phenotypes described here are indeed cell-autonomous, as would be expected if they are due to glycolytic defects in the cells being studied. Since whole-body <italic>tn</italic> mutants are being studied, the phenotypes could be due to more complex organismal defects. Specifically, are the reduced size of muscle and brain cells cell-autonomous? If <italic>tn</italic> is knocked-down only in the brain or only in a small subset of larval muscles, or if <italic>tn</italic>- mutant clones are generated in the brain, does this result in small cell size?</p><p>3) The metabolic phenotype is not sufficiently characterized:</p><p>â Figure 2: A decrease in lactate production does not mean glycolytic flux is reduced â it could also indicate an increase in respiration. The drop in steady-state pyruvate levels is not interpretable because it does not say anything about flux through pyruvate. (i.e. if twice as much pyruvate is made per unit of time, and twice as much pyruvate is used up, steady-state pyruvate levels will not change, showing that they do not say anything about flux). Is respiration increased in <italic>tn</italic> mutant cells?</p><p>â It is highly unlikely, if indeed glycolytic flux is reduced, that there is no change in glucose uptake by these cells, as concluded in the manuscript, referring to Figure 4âfigure supplement 2. Almost always, changes in glycolytic flux and glucose uptake correlate. Where would all the intracellular glucose go otherwise? Even if it shuttles into the PPP pathway it still returns to the glycolytic pathway as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate which requires Pglym to be metabolizedâ¦ Hence Figure 4âfigure supplement 2E-F would need to be quantified (e.g. cell dissociation and FACS? Or lysis and measuring fluorescence normalized to protein?) to conclude this more robustly.</p><p>â The authors write &quot;The metabolism of growing cells must strike a balance between ATP production and the maintenance of metabolite pools that contribute to biomass production. The metabolomic profile of <italic>tn</italic>-/- larvae suggests that TRIM32 regulates this metabolic balance by promoting glycolytic flux, which results in the synthesis (and preservation) of amino acid pools for protein synthesis.&quot;</p><p>This conclusion does not appear to be correct. Indeed, more respiration will lead to more ATP synthesis and less biomass production. However, the <italic>tn</italic> mutants do not have less lactate and more ATP, but less of everything (less lactate, less ATP and less amino acids).</p><p>â Is TRIM32 expressed in cells in culture (e.g. <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells)? If so, these issues can be dissected much more easily in cell culture, but knocking down TRIM32 and quantitating glucose uptake, lactate production, and oxygen consumption. This would more rigorously show an effect on glycolytic flux.</p><p>4) It is not clear that indeed a glycolytic defect is causing the muscle phenotypes.</p><p>The authors write &quot;To confirm that the smaller muscles in TRIM32-deficient larvae are indeed due to defective glycolysis, muscle carcasses were isolated and assessed for changes in metabolic activity&quot; â this statement is misleading/incorrect. This approach only shows correlation, not causality.</p><p>â There is no functional experiment in the manuscript showing that reduced glycolysis is causing the muscle phenotypes, or that restoring glycolytic flux rescues the phenotype.</p><p>5) Importantly, from Figure 3F, the main conclusion that &quot;the addition of amino acid building blocks is sufficient to rescue a TRIM32-mediated loss of muscle mass.&quot; is not warranted.</p><p>The addition of yeast extract or amino acids does not 'rescue' the muscle defect of <italic>tn</italic> mutants, i.e. it does not return the phenotype to wildtype levels. It simply rescues the additional defect caused by not feeding these animals any protein (agar only). This does not mean much. It is analogous to not feeding <italic>tn</italic> mutants any water and seeing that they dehydrate. Then giving them water again would return them to the original <italic>tn</italic> mutant phenotype, and thereby concluding that water is sufficient to rescue the TRIM32-mediated phenotype.</p><p>To prove that amino acid deficiency is causing the muscle atrophy phenotype, one would need to see that feeding additional amino acids (on top of the normal food) to <italic>tn</italic> mutants causes their muscle size to become more like wildtype.</p><p>6) Could it be the other way around â that a muscle defect is leading to an eating defect (which requires continuous muscle movement) and as a consequence, less intake of sugar and protein by the larvae, leading to the metabolic phenotypes? This can be resolved by:</p><p>â quantifying food intake by <italic>tn</italic> mutant larvae;</p><p>â- checking the cell-autonomy of the metabolic defects;</p><p>â testing in cell culture whether TRIM32 knockdown leads to the same glycolytic defects.</p><p>7) Figure 4âfigure supplement 1: it is difficult to judge whether apoptosis rates account for a difference in tissue size by just quantifying apoptosis, because this only yields a snapshot of apoptosis at that moment, whereas tissue size integrates apoptosis rates over time. So a change in apoptosis may appear mild at any one point, but result in significant tissue size differences over time. The way to prove this functionally is to block apoptosis, e.g. with p35. Alternatively, if the authors want to conclude that cell size in <italic>tn</italic> brains is smaller than in control brains, a direct quantification of cell size would be better.</p><p>8) The authors write &quot;Wing discs are not inherently glycolytic and do not endogenously express LDH (Figure 4E). Accordingly, the overall area or volume of the disc was not affected by loss of TRIM32&quot;</p><p>This is not correct. Endogenous LDH (called ImpL3 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) is expressed in wing discs, and can be detected by Q-RT-PCR or by in situ hybridization on endogenous transcript.</p><p>Hence, the fact that wing disc size is not decreased in TRIM32 mutants cannot be explained with this justification and raises the question whether indeed the metabolic mechanism the authors propose is correct.</p><p>9) Along the same lines, there is no quantification of glycolytic flux rates in the wing discs â neither that PVR expression causes them to increase, nor that the <italic>tn</italic> mutation causes them to drop again. The phenotype shown in Figure 4H simply says there is some genetic interaction, but this could be happening at any level.</p><p>In sum, between points #4 and #5, I do not see any solid evidence that a metabolic defect is causing the muscle phenotypes described here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Bawa et al. describes compelling observations suggesting that TRIM32 is a key regulator of glycolysis in fast growing larval tissues. <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRIM32 ortholog Tn physically interacts with two enzymes, Aldolase and Pglym. Strikingly, loss of <italic>tn</italic> caused a reduction in Ald and Pglym protein levels, which might not be explained by its role as E3-ubiquitin ligase. Of importance, the authors present multiple pieces of data suggesting that Tn is required for maintaining the levels of metabolites produced by glycolysis and derived from glucose. Biochemical and physiological characterization of <italic>tn</italic> mutant shows that a main role of <italic>tn</italic> is to maintain amino acid pools to support growth presumably by maintaining glycolysis. Overall, the observations are quite interesting and novel, prompting follow-up studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Tn maintains glycolysis and address whether mammalian TRIM32 plays a similar role. The manuscript should be suitable for publication if the authors address the following comments.</p><p>1) Proton efflux rate (PER), as shown with brain tissues in Figure 4D, provides a reasonable assessment of glycolytic flux in isolated tissues. In contrast, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) is also influenced by CO<sub>2</sub> produced during respiration; thus it wouldn't provide an accurate estimation of glycolytic flux. To clearly demonstrate <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRIM32 regulate glycolysis in larval muscle, it is critical to compare PER in wild-type and <italic>tn</italic> muscles.</p><p>2) Only one <italic>tn</italic> mutant allele is used throughout the study. How can the authors rule out the possibility that the phenotypes observed with the <italic>tn</italic> allele is not due to a background mutation? One way to resolve this issue is to show that the key phenotypes, such as a reduction in PER, can be reversed by having a genomic rescue transgene or tissue specific rescue using GAL4/UAS system. Alternatively, it would be helpful to show that similar phenotypes can be seen with different <italic>tn</italic> alleles.</p><p>3) Considering the hypothesis that TRIM32 is required for maintaining glycolytic flux, I would suggest to move the results in Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C-D to the main figures. Note that the results shown in Figure 2C-G are not new; additionally, similar results are shown in Figure 3B-F. Thus, Figure 2C-G can be moved to the supplementary figures.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;<italic>Drosophila</italic> TRIM32 cooperates with glycolytic enzymes to promote cell growth&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) As suggested by reviewer #1 comment 2, reviewer #2 comment 1-3, in vivo interactions between TRIM32 and Ald/Pglym are critical to prove the hypothesis, and therefore, require precise descriptions of experiments and results.</p><p>2) Reviewer #3 comment 2: ERR-mediated restoration experiments need better descriptions and if possible, additional data could be added.</p><p>3) Other comments can be immediately addressed or edited.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Authors have significantly improved the manuscript and adequately addressed critiques raised by reviewers. There are some points below to be changed for better readability.</p><p>1) In the line &quot;Importantly, protein levels of Ald.â¦â¦ ERR in <italic>tn-/-</italic> muscles, indicating that~&quot;, figure citation is missing. It could be Figure 2âfigure supplement 2F-G.</p><p>2) As suggested in the major revision 3, showing the in vivo interactions between TRIM32 and Ald/Pglym is essential for the study. Therefore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> needs to be moved to the main figure with additional explanations and discussions.</p><p>3) Given that <italic>tn</italic> mutants exhibit reduced mouth hook contraction, the growth of <italic>tn</italic> mutants could be overall retarded while tissue-specific knockdown of <italic>tn</italic> showed no difference. Having the possibility of slow growth, showing the small-sized muscle or brain of <italic>tn</italic> mutants in main Figures 3-4 could be misleading. It will be more adequate to show the small size phenotypes with tissue-specific RNAi backgrounds.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript is significantly improved. For instance, the authors do a good job of showing the tissue-autonomous nature of the TRIM32 phenotypes.</p><p>Some issues which can be fixed without any additional experiments:</p><p>1) The authors write in their rebuttal &quot;Identification of the TRIM32-Ald or TRIM32-Pglym biochemical interaction was performed in vivo using larval lysates (Figure 1C; Figure 1âfigure supplement 2Aâ¦&quot;. If I understand correctly, in Figure 1, a truncated version of TRIM32 was fused to GST, expressed recombinantly in bacteria, and purified. This was then incubated in a test tube with larval lysates. How can this be called &quot;in vivo&quot;? Some people call cells in culture &quot;in vivo&quot; and some people mean a live organism by &quot;in vivo&quot;, but I do not think anyone considers a lysate in a test tube to be &quot;in vivo&quot;? If I misunderstood the experimental setup, it needs to be described better in the manuscript.</p><p>2) Showing that full-length TRIM32 binds Ald and Pglym in vivo is critical for this story. I believe the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> should be put into the manuscript.</p><p>3) Regarding the fact that the co-IPed Ald and Pglym in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> are running at a different molecular weight compared to Ald and Pglym in the input can either be interpreted as the authors write by post-translational modification of the pool of Ald and Pglym that interact with TRIM32, or it might simply be another contaminating protein that cross-reacts with the Ald and Pglym antibodies. Can this be distinguished? If it is a sub-population of the total Ald/Pglym, it should also be visible in the total lysates. Also, most post-translational modifications are readily lost in IP buffer and Laemmli (e.g. ubiquitination or phosphorylation), which would cause it to run at the 'normal' size. This should be discussed.</p><p>4) The authors write &quot;Surprisingly, cellular glucose uptakeâ¦ was normal in <italic>tn-/-</italic> larval brains and wing discsâ¦ demonstrating that glucose is not a limiting substrate for glycolysis in these isolated tissues.&quot;</p><p>I believe this statement is not correct. How does this show glucose is not a limiting substrate for glycolysis in brains and wing discs? Or do the authors mean specifically in <italic>tn</italic> mutants?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors have appropriately addressed most of my comments. I have two additional comments:</p><p>1) The authors showed that Ald and Pglym protein levels were reduced in <italic>tn</italic> mutant. However, the authors didn't show that TRIM32 stabilized these proteins. Thus, I suggest to revise the following sentences:</p><p>&quot;Here we provide a novel mechanism for TRIM32 in cell growth. Our data show that TRIM32 promotes glucose metabolism through the stabilization of glycolytic enzyme levels.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Taken together, these data highlight a unique role for TRIM32 in the stabilization of glycolytic enzyme levels.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Importantly, protein levels of Ald and Pglym were stabilized upon expression of ERR in <italic>tn</italic>-/- muscles, indicating that restoration of glycolytic protein levels is sufficient to recover TRIM32-mediated growth defects.&quot;</p><p>2) Although the authors claimed that ERR overexpression stabilized Ald and Pglym levels, the results were not shown. Thus, the authors should test whether ERR overexpression could restore Ald and Pglym levels in <italic>tn</italic> mutant. Otherwise, the result regarding the ERR overexpression in muscle shown in Figure 2M is better to be removed. Additionally, given that ERR can impact on multiple targets, &quot;restoration of glycolytic protein levels is sufficient to recover TRIM32-mediated growth defects.&quot; is an overstatement.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52358.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to demonstrate whether the tn mutant phenotype is cell-autonomous.</p><p>â Tissue-specific knock-down or tn-/- mutant clones in the muscle/brain will address the concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point. Multiple new experiments show that the <italic>tn</italic> mutant phenotype is cell-autonomous:</p><p>1) Knockdown of TRIM32 using three independent RNAi lines all show a reduction in the diameter of L3 muscles upon induction with <italic>mef2-</italic>Gal4 (<italic>tn RNAi-A, tn RNAi-B</italic>, and <italic>tn RNAi-C</italic>) (Figure 2K; Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A, B). Note that two of these RNA lines were previously published by us (LaBeau-DiMenna et al., 2012) and the Nguyen group (Domsch et al., 2013) to show the same small muscle phenotype as the <italic>tn</italic> alleles in this paper. We also show that knockdown of <italic>tn RNAi-A</italic> in a single muscle (<italic>5053</italic>-Gal4 driver) reduces cell size (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C).</p><p>2) Brain-specific knockdown of TRIM32 using the pan-neuronal driver <italic>elav</italic>-Gal4 causes a smaller larval brain size, while knockdown of <italic>tn RNAi</italic> in muscles does not alter brain size (Figure 4C-G).</p><p>3) Brain lactate levels are lower in <italic>elav&gt;tn RNAi</italic>, but not <italic>mef2&gt;tn RNAi</italic> brains (Figure 4I). The converse is also true, where muscle carcasses of the genotype <italic>mef2&gt;tn RNAi</italic> show a reduction in lactate levels, but not upon neuronal-specific depletion of TRIM32 (<italic>elav&gt;tn RNAi</italic>) (Figure 2L).</p><p>4) While previously published (LaBeau-DiMenna et al., 2012; Domsch et al., 2013), we confirm that muscle-specific expression of <italic>TRIM32 cDNA</italic> rescues muscle cell size (Figure 2M), muscle function (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D, E), and stabilizes glycolytic enzyme levels (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2F, G).</p><p>5) Finally, two tissues that are not considered glycolytic in nature (wing disc and midgut), are not smaller in <italic>tn</italic> mutants. This is further evidence that TRIM32 affects glycolytic tissues (muscle and brain).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Quantifying food intake by tn mutant larvae will resolve a part of the issue.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by multiple reviewers, muscle defects could lead to reduced feeding and thus produce whole body metabolic defects. To assay food intake, larvae were fed yeast mixed with a blue dye (Aditi et al., 2016). The amount of dye present in the gut of <italic>WT, tn-/-,</italic> or <italic>tn RNAi</italic> animals was quantified by measuring absorbance values at a wavelength of 600 nm. Not surprisingly, <italic>tn-/-</italic> larvae showed reduced mouth hook contractions and compromised ingestion of dye at both 3 and 24 hr (Figure 5âfigure supplement 2E, I, J). However, larvae with reduced TRIM32 in larval muscle (<italic>mef2&gt;tn RNAi</italic>) or brain tissue (<italic>elav&gt;tn RNAi</italic>) showed no difference between control or RNAi knockdown conditions (Figure 5âfigure supplement 2I, J). These data clearly demonstrate that a loss of TRIM32 in all tissues compromises food consumption, while the observed metabolic defects (e.g., lactate production) upon tissue-specific loss of TRIM32 are not nutrition limited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to concern #1, there is only one tn mutant allele used in this study. It will be critical to show phenotypes of another tn mutant allele or multiple RNAi lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We should have emphasized this point in our initial submission. Our 2012 PNAS paper described three <italic>tn</italic> alleles [<italic>l(2)tn, tnÎA</italic>, and <italic>tnÎB</italic>] and one RNAi line (<italic>tn RNAi-A</italic>) that exhibit smaller, degenerative muscles (LaBeau-DiMenna et al., 2012). Soon after, the Nguyen lab published similar results using three additional alleles of <italic>tn</italic> as well as the <italic>tn RNAi-A</italic> and <italic>tn RNAi-B</italic> lines used in this paper (Domsch et al., 2013). Note that a later publication from our lab confirmed knockdown of <italic>tn mRNA</italic> transcripts for two <italic>UAS-tn RNAi</italic> lines by qPCR (Brooks et al., 2016). To further support our results, we now show in this manuscript that knockdown of three RNAi lines (<italic>tn RNAi-A, tn RNAi-B,</italic> and <italic>tn RNAi-C</italic>) in muscle tissue produce smaller muscles (Figure 2K) and also exhibit reduced lactate levels (Figure 2L).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Interactions between TRIM32 and Ald or Pglym were only shown in vitro.

Nevertheless, to address reviewer concerns, we performed immunoprecipitations using anti-TRIM32 antibodies to pull down protein complexes from L3 larval lysates. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we can pulldown TM, Ald, and Pglym and uncovered quite an interesting result. While the molecular weight of immunoprecipitated TM is as expected, we see higher molecular weight bands of Ald and Pglym in our anti-TRIM32 IPs that are suggestive of a post-translational modification (PTM). This verification of TRIM32-glycolytic enzyme complexes will be followed up to identify the nature of the PTM. We include a section at the end of the Discussion entitled âLimitations of this studyâ that addresses how TRIM32 may function with glycolytic enzymes.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Reviewer Figure 1.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52358-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The metabolic phenotypes require further characterization including:</p><p>â Respiration in tn mutants</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B, we show that CO<sub>2</sub> production is mildly increased in <italic>tn-/-</italic> whole larvae.

Indeed, muscle-specific expression of ERR in <italic>tn-/-</italic> restores muscle size (Figure 2M), allows for muscle contraction (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D, E), and stabilizes the levels of Ald and Pglym (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2F, G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers' comments attached below are detailed and will help you improve the manuscript for publication.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[â¦]</p><p>1) Authors have indicated that tn-/- larvae significantly decreased ATP levels as well as glycolytic products. These metabolic consequences could be due to reduced food consumption or dysfunctions in the digestive system. Authors need to distinguish systemic developmental defects and cell-autonomous functions of tn mutants. It will be critical to include proper controls showing that the metabolic phenotype is not derived by tn-mediated systemic effects but by loss of tn in a specific tissue. As one of the examples, tissue-specific metabolic measurements after the loss of tn in the muscle or the brain could suitably support the query.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see complete response above (Essential revisions #1). In summary, we now show that muscle-specific or brain-specific loss of TRIM32 causes a reduction in L-lactate levels, independent of feed consumption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors' previous study on tn mutants has shown that loss of tn causes an overall reduction in the muscle and animal size. In Figure 4A, authors have claimed that tn mutants exhibit the significantly smaller size of the brain, in addition to the muscle. However, given that tn mutants are smaller in their size, it will be important to show proportional size changes of the brain and the muscle compared to the larval size changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We previously showed that <italic>tn</italic> mutants cause a reduction in muscle cell size, but not overall animal size (a phenotype associated with growth defects) (LaBeau-DiMenna, et al. 2012). In fact, loss of TRIM32 results in elongated pupal cases due to defective muscle contraction during the larval to pupal transition (Figure 3H, I; Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D, E). Thus, the smaller muscle and brain sizes affect only these tissues, but not the size of wing discs (Figure 5D; Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A-C), midgut tissue (Figure 5âfigure supplement 2F-H), or overall body size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) According to the Materials and methods, authors cultured WT or tn mutant larvae on the agar plate from very early stages and let them grow until the 3rd instar. However, WT animals marginally change their body mass and the muscle diameter after the chronic starvation (Figure 3F-I). How do larvae properly grow without any nutrition? Supporting references on the chronic starvation and normal growth, or some other control experiments would make the data more concrete and convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention as we should have explained this more clearly in our initial submission. The reviewer is correct that complete starvation during early larval development causes growth arrest and reduced size (Beadle et al., 1938; Robertson, 1966). Our larvae were reared on 2.25% agar, which contains an undefined amount of two polysaccharides, agarose and agaropectin. Thus, the larvae are not devoid of all nutrition. In our hands, <italic>WT</italic> larval growth is delayed with variable L3 body mass and muscle diameter (Figure 3F, G). Some <italic>WT</italic> larvae also die, but others are able to pupate, albeit reduced in size (Figure 3H, I). We have clarified this information in Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) If NHL domain plays a unique role in protecting the glycolytic enzymes, a specific deletion or mutation on the NHL domain would provide more precise metabolic phenotypes while eliminating Ub-mediated complexities. It is not clear in the current version whether it is the NHL domain mutation that gives rise to the glycolytic phenotypes. It will be important to segregate non-canonical TRIM32 functions through NHL domain from Ub-mediated canonical phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes! We agree these are important experiments. Preliminary results in our lab show that deletion of the TRIM32 NHL domain fails to rescue <italic>tn-/-</italic> phenotypes in muscle (also published in Domsch et al., 2013). Experiments are underway to examine the necessity of human point mutations for maintaining glycolysis in muscles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 4E-H, authors have shown that the Pvr-induced tumor growth phenotype is recovered by loss of tn. Though the representative image in Figure 4F displays significantly bigger wing disc, the quantitation of the dpp&gt;Pvr<sup>act</sup> shown in Figure 4H indicates a comparable measurement to that of controls. Accurate measurement would enhance the clarity of data.</p></disp-quote><p>There is indeed variability in wing disc area of <italic>dpp&gt;Pvr<sup>act</sup></italic> tumors and measuring volume appears to better assess overall size (previously supplementary data).

Since whole-body tn mutants are being studied, the phenotypes could be due to more complex organismal defects. Specifically, are the reduced size of muscle and brain cells cell-autonomous ? If tn is knocked-down only in the brain or only in a small subset of larval muscles, or if tn- mutant clones are generated in the brain, does this result in small cell size?</p></disp-quote><p>This data is now included (Figure 2M; Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A-C; Figure 2L; Figure 4C-G; Figure 4I).

The drop in steady-state pyruvate levels is not interpretable because it does not say anything about flux through pyruvate. (i.e. if twice as much pyruvate is made per unit of time, and twice as much pyruvate is used up, steady-state pyruvate levels will not change, showing that they do not say anything about flux). Is respiration increased in tn mutant cells?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point. This data is now included (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B). Please see responses above (Essential revisions #4) and the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â It is highly unlikely, if indeed glycolytic flux is reduced, that there is no change in glucose uptake by these cells, as concluded in the manuscript, referring to Figure 4âfigure supplement 2. Almost always, changes in glycolytic flux and glucose uptake correlate. Where would all the intracellular glucose go otherwise? Even if it shuttles into the PPP pathway it still returns to the glycolytic pathway as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate which requires Pglym to be metabolizedâ¦ Hence Figure 4âfigure supplement 2E-F would need to be quantified (e.g. cell dissociation and FACS? Or lysis and measuring fluorescence normalized to protein?) to conclude this more robustly.</p></disp-quote><p>This result is surprising to us as well. Since we did not look at glucose uptake in other tissues or quantify differences using cell dissociation and FACS, it is possible there are minor changes that we were not able to observe. Nevertheless, we can conclude that the tissue-specific reductions in cell size are independent of nutrient status (Figure 5âfigure supplement A-J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The authors write &quot;The metabolism of growing cells must strike a balance between ATP production and the maintenance of metabolite pools that contribute to biomass production. The metabolomic profile of tn-/- larvae suggests that TRIM32 regulates this metabolic balance by promoting glycolytic flux, which results in the synthesis (and preservation) of amino acid pools for protein synthesis.&quot;</p><p>This conclusion does not appear to be correct. Indeed, more respiration will lead to more ATP synthesis and less biomass production. However, the tn mutants do not have less lactate and more ATP, but less of everything (less lactate, less ATP and less amino acids).</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed these sentences entirely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Is TRIM32 expressed in cells in culture (e.g. Drosophila S2 cells)? If so, these issues can be dissected much more easily in cell culture, but knocking down TRIM32 and quantitating glucose uptake, lactate production, and oxygen consumption.

It simply rescues the additional defect caused by not feeding these animals any protein (agar only). This does not mean much. It is analogous to not feeding tn mutants any water and seeing that they dehydrate. Then giving them water again would return them to the original tn mutant phenotype, and thereby concluding that water is sufficient to rescue the TRIM32-mediated phenotype.</p><p>To prove that amino acid deficiency is causing the muscle atrophy phenotype, one would need to see that feeding additional amino acids (on top of the normal food) to tn mutants causes their muscle size to become more like wildtype.</p></disp-quote><p>This entire section has been rewritten.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Could it be the other way around â that a muscle defect is leading to an eating defect (which requires continuous muscle movement) and as a consequence, less intake of sugar and protein by the larvae, leading to the metabolic phenotypes? This can be resolved by:</p><p>â quantifying food intake by tn mutant larvae;</p><p>â checking the cell-autonomy of the metabolic defects;</p><p>â testing in cell culture whether TRIM32 knockdown leads to the same glycolytic defects.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a really great point and has now been addressed. Please see previous responses (Essential revisions #1; reviewer #1, point #1; reviewer #2, point #3)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 4âfigure supplement 1: it is difficult to judge whether apoptosis rates account for a difference in tissue size by just quantifying apoptosis, because this only yields a snapshot of apoptosis at that moment, whereas tissue size integrates apoptosis rates over time. So a change in apoptosis may appear mild at any one point, but result in significant tissue size differences over time. The way to prove this functionally is to block apoptosis, e.g. with p35. Alternatively, if the authors want to conclude that cell size in tn brains is smaller than in control brains, a direct quantification of cell size would be better.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now measured the area of cells in the lobes of the developing larval brain. Although quite variable in size depending on their cell lineage and/or the timing of cell division, there is a clear overall reduction in cell area upon loss of TRIM32 (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1J-M).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors write &quot;Wing discs are not inherently glycolytic and do not endogenously express LDH (Figure 4E). Accordingly, the overall area or volume of the disc was not affected by loss of TRIM32&quot;</p><p>This is not correct. Endogenous LDH (called ImpL3 in Drosophila) is expressed in wing discs, and can be detected by Q-RT-PCR or by in situ hybridization on endogenous transcript.</p><p>Hence, the fact that wing disc size is not decreased in TRIM32 mutants cannot be explained with this justification and raises the question whether indeed the metabolic mechanism the authors propose is correct.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We simply meant that wing discs are not considered a tissue with enhanced glycolytic activity and that LDH-GFP is not enriched in <italic>WT</italic> wing discs [consistent with published data that endogenous LDH activity is not readily detectable in wing and eye discs (Wang et al., 2016)]. We have corrected this statement to read, âUnlike muscle or brain tissue, neither LDH activity (Wang et al., 2016) nor LDH-GFP expression (Figure 5A) were detectable in control wing discs, suggesting that this tissue does not exhibit elevated glycolytic activity.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Along the same lines, there is no quantification of glycolytic flux rates in the wing discs â neither that PVR expression causes them to increase, nor that the tn mutation causes them to drop again. The phenotype shown in Figure 4H simply says there is some genetic interaction, but this could be happening at any level.</p><p>We now include FILM data (Figure 5G) that demonstrate differences in the glycolytic profile between PVR tumors grown in <italic>WT</italic> or <italic>tn-/-</italic> larvae.

In contrast, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) is also influenced by CO<sub>2</sub> produced during respiration; thus it wouldn't provide an accurate estimation of glycolytic flux. To clearly demonstrate Drosophila TRIM32 regulate glycolysis in larval muscle, it is critical to compare PER in wild-type and tn muscles.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this experiment is critical. We now include PER data for dissected <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>tn-/-</italic> muscle tissue (Figure 2I). Since the PER assay reports acidification of the media due to glycolysis and not resulting from TCA cycle metabolism, our results clearly show that loss of TRIM32 reduces glycolytic flux in muscle tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Only one tn mutant allele is used throughout the study. How can the authors rule out the possibility that the phenotypes observed with the tn allele is not due to a background mutation? One way to resolve this issue is to show that the key phenotypes, such as a reduction in PER, can be reversed by having a genomic rescue transgene or tissue specific rescue using GAL4/UAS system. Alternatively, it would be helpful to show that similar phenotypes can be seen with different tn alleles.</p></disp-quote><p>We now have this data.

How can this be called &quot;in vivo&quot;? Some people call cells in culture &quot;in vivo&quot; and some people mean a live organism by &quot;in vivo&quot;, but I do not think anyone considers a lysate in a test tube to be &quot;in vivo&quot;?

Can this be distinguished? If it is a sub-population of the total Ald/Pglym, it should also be visible in the total lysates. Also, most post-translational modifications are readily lost in IP buffer and Laemmli (e.g. ubiquitination or phosphorylation), which would cause it to run at the 'normal' size. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Great point. We have verified the higher molecular weight bands corresponding to Ald or Pglym using additional antibodies raised against human ALD or PGAM1. Due to the high conservation of glycolytic enzymes, these antibodies cross-react with fly proteins.
