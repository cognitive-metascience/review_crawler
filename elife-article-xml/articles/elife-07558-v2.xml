neurodegenerative proteinopathies, including Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. Curiously, the same conformational antibody recognizes different disease-related oligomers, despite the variations in clinical presentation and brain regions affected, suggesting that the oligomer structure might be responsible for toxicity. We investigated whether polyglutamine-expanded ATAXIN-1, the protein that underlies spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, forms toxic oligomers and, if so, what underlies their toxicity. We found that mutant ATXN1 does form oligomers and that oligomer levels correlate with disease progression in the <italic>Atxn1</italic><sup><italic>154Q/+</italic></sup> mice. Moreover, oligomeric toxicity, stabilization and seeding require interaction with Capicua, which is expressed at greater ratios with respect to ATXN1 in the cerebellum than in less vulnerable brain regions. Thus, specific interactors, not merely oligomeric structure, drive pathogenesis and contribute to regional vulnerability. Identifying interactors that stabilize toxic oligomeric complexes could answer longstanding questions about the pathogenesis of other proteinopathies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07558.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07558.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07558.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease in which damage to the brain regions that control movement results in the gradual loss of coordination and motor skills. The disease is a caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for a protein called ATAXIN-1. In healthy individuals this protein contains up to 39 copies of an amino acid called glutamine. However, the mutant gene can encode for 40 or more copies of glutamine, which results in a longer-than-usual ATAXIN-1 protein with toxic properties.</p><p>Within the brain, some of the toxic ATAXIN-1 proteins form insoluble deposits, while the rest remain soluble. At first it was assumed that the insoluble deposits were responsible for the neurodegeneration seen in SCA1. However, closer examination revealed that these deposits form mainly in brain regions that do not degenerate, which suggests that they might instead have a protective role. This is consistent with evidence from research into other brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, which suggests that the soluble form of the toxic proteins might be causing these diseases.</p><p>Lasagna-Reeves et al. now provide the first direct evidence that the soluble form of the toxic ATAXIN-1 proteins are indeed harmful in a mouse model of SCA1. Experiments reveal that these soluble proteins accumulate in the brain regions that undergo degeneration in SCA1, such as the cerebellum, but not in those regions that remain intact. Moreover, the motor skills and coordination of the mice get worse as the level of soluble toxic ATAXIN-1 increases.</p><p>Lasagna-Reeves et al. go on to show that a protein called capicua stabilizes the toxic ATAXIN-1 proteins, which keeps them from forming insoluble deposits. Since capicua is particularly abundant in the cerebellum, this could explain the high levels of toxic ATAXIN-1 in this region and why it is vulnerable to degeneration.</p><p>Future experiments are needed to investigate whether proteins equivalent to capicua might play a similar role in stabilizing toxic proteins in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, and whether preventing this stabilization could have therapeutic potential.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07558.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07558.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ataxin-1</kwd><kwd>amyloid oligomer</kwd><kwd>native interactor</kwd><kwd>proteinopathies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Robert A and Renee E Belfer Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lasagna-Reeves</surname><given-names>Cristian A</given-names></name><name><surname>Rousseaux</surname><given-names>Maxime WC</given-names></name><name><surname>Jafar-Nejad</surname><given-names>Paymaan</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Nan</given-names></name><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3R01 NS027699-25S1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lasagna-Reeves</surname><given-names>Cristian A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS027699-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Studies in a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 show that a protein called capicua stabilizes toxic ataxin-1 oligomers offering a possible explanation for regional patterns of neurodegeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The family of neurodegenerative diseases known as proteinopathies are characterized neuropathologically by deposits of insoluble proteins. In Alzheimer disease (AD), for example, there are extracellular depositions of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular accumulations of neurofibrillary tangles of tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glenner and Wong, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1986</xref>). Similarly, in Parkinson disease (PD), α-synuclein forms cytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lashuel et al., 2013</xref>). Although AD, PD, and other proteinopathies such as Huntington disease (HD) and the prion disorders are associated with different proteins possessing various structures, functions, and affecting different brain regions, they all involve the accumulation of β-sheet-rich entities, which suggests some commonality of pathogenic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glabe and Kayed, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knowles et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Like HD, Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a polyglutamine disease that belongs to this larger class of proteinopathies. SCA1 is caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat that encodes for glutamine (Q) in ATAXIN-1 (ATXN1), a protein that is expressed throughout the brain. The <italic>Atxn1</italic> knockin mouse model, which bears a 154 CAG repeat knocked into the murine <italic>Atxn1</italic> locus, faithfully reproduces the SCA1 phenotype: progressive motor incoordination due to cerebellar degeneration, cognitive deficits, premature death, and degradation-resistant deposits (nuclear inclusions, or NIs) that contain mutant ATXN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Watase et al., 2002</xref>). As with the stable fibrillar deposits first observed in AD over a hundred years ago, the prominence of these NIs led initially to the postulate that this material is the causative agent of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiti and Dobson, 2006</xref>). Yet the NIs develop primarily in neurons that escape degeneration, not in the cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), which are the first to succumb to SCA1 pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Watase et al., 2002</xref>). This curious observation led to the proposal that the ATXN1-containing NIs are not themselves toxic but rather might serve a protective role by sequestering the mutant protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cummings et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">1999</xref>).</p><p>Recent findings suggest a refinement to this hypothesis: it may be that the primary drivers of toxicity are metastable non-fibrillar species known as soluble oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Glabe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benilova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krishnan et al., 2012</xref>). Although toxic oligomers have been identified in HD models and their modulation relates to beneficial outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Legleiter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sontag et al., 2012</xref>) their specific role in disease progression in vivo remains unstudied. Furthermore, there are not studies regarding the role of binding partners of the disease-related proteins in the oligomerization process. The inverse correlation between NIs and neuronal integrity in SCA1, however, lends appeal to the hypothesis that soluble oligomers, rather than fibrils per se, drive neurodegeneration in SCA1.</p><p>In this study we sought to determine if and how oligomeric forms of polyQ ATXN1 might contribute to the SCA1 disease state. We report the discovery of polyQ ATXN1 oligomers in the <italic>Atxn1</italic> knockin mouse and demonstrate that these oligomers do indeed correlate with disease pathogenesis and motor dysfunction. We also show that polyQ ATXN1 oligomers seed the formation of new oligomers and demonstrate that Capicua (CIC), a key native binding partner of ATXN1, plays a pivotal role in the stabilization and regional toxicity of these oligomeric species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ATXN1 oligomers are associated with neurodegeneration in SCA1</title><p>In the absence of high-resolution structural data for oligomers, conformation-dependent antibodies can be used to distinguish between different types of amyloid structures by recognizing epitopes that are associated with specific aggregation states, independent of their amino acid sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kayed et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2010</xref>). We used the conformational monoclonal anti-oligomer antibody F11G3 to detect ATXN1 oligomers in the <italic>Atxn1</italic><sup><italic>154Q/+</italic></sup> knockin mouse model. This antibody has been extensively characterized and compared to other anti-oligomer antibodies previously developed using similar methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guerrero-Munoz et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2014b</xref>).

Staining of PCs at various stages of neurodegeneration in the <italic>Atxn1</italic><sup><italic>154Q/+</italic></sup> mice revealed high levels of oligomers in the neurites prior to their degeneration; in later stages, oligomers accumulated in the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

The presence of ATXN1 oligomers in more susceptible neurons suggests that these soluble aggregates are important in the neuropathology of SCA1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ATXN1 amyloid oligomers correlate with disease progression</title><p>We took advantage of the fact that the knockin mouse model reproduces the progressive phenotype of SCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zoghbi and Orr, 2009</xref>) to investigate the relationship between oligomer levels and degree of motor impairment in the <italic>Atxn1</italic><sup><italic>154Q/+</italic></sup> mice. Motor incoordination in the rotarod assay becomes apparent in these mice as early as 5 weeks of age and worsens throughout their life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Watase et al., 2002</xref>). Accordingly, we tested the levels of ATXN1 oligomers in these mice at an early stage of disease (8 weeks of age), a middle stage (18 weeks), and a late stage (28 weeks). There was considerable variability among animals of the same age in both motor performance and oligomer abundance, but the levels of different molecular weight oligomers in the cerebellum clearly increased as the mice aged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The differences between individual mice, however, allowed us to search for relationships between motor impairment and different ATXN1 oligomers. We tested each mouse on the rotarod and observed a consistently strong inverse correlation between latency to fall and the level of ATXN1 oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), with oligomers over 245 KDa showing the greatest inverse correlation (R = 0.89). Importantly, no significant changes in monomeric ATXN1 levels (2Q or 154Q) were observed in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Evaluation of individual fractions by western blot with anti-ATXN1 antibody revealed WT and polyQ monomeric ATXN1 in different fractions, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lam et al., 2006</xref>). When we analyzed the SEC fractions with the anti-oligomer antibody, we observed oligomeric species mainly between fractions 10 and 12 (ranging from 500 to 1000 KDa in size; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel). Anti-ATXN1 antibody confirmed that the oligomers in these fractions do in fact contain ATXN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel); the range of sizes of these oligomers is thus rather broad. Fraction 11 (∼667 KDa) contained a peak in the signal of oligomers &gt;245 KDa in weight, as well as the presence of lower molecular weight oligomeric species (∼180, ∼135, ∼110 and ∼98 KDa). AFM revealed that those fractions detected by the anti-oligomer antibody (particularly fractions 11 and 12) were indeed oligomeric, whereas the higher molecular weight fractions were fibrillar in nature (fraction 7, ∼4000KDa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A hydrophobic interaction column, which separates proteins according to hydrophobic domain exposure, showed that fraction 11 is highly hydrophobic, as is characteristic of many oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Campioni et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). To establish how stable these oligomers are, SEC fractions were incubated at 37<bold>°</bold>C for up to 48 hr followed by immunoblot analysis using F11G3. F11G3 showed a strong affinity for fractions 11 and 12 even after 48 hr of incubation, suggesting that these oligomers are highly stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the ATXN1 oligomeric complex can induce cellular toxicity, we treated cultured cerebellar granular neurons (CGNs) with SEC fractions from <italic>Atxn1</italic><sup><italic>154Q/+</italic></sup> cerebellar samples.

The cellular damage was thus produced by an ATXN1-containing oligomeric complex present in this SEC fraction.

These cells form nuclear inclusions, but their capacity to form oligomers had never been evaluated. We first established that these cells do form oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). As a negative control, we used cells that express mRFP-ATXN1(82Q,S776A), a mutant form of ATXN1 that cannot be phosphorylated at Ser776 and is not toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emamian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jorgensen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2013</xref>). The anti-oligomer antibody detected the smaller inclusion bodies (350–900 nm) but did not recognize the larger inclusions (&gt;900 nm), suggesting that these larger inclusions are more complex and composed of higher order aggregates, likely to be fibrillar in nature.</p><p>We next tested whether ATXN1 oligomer complexes from <italic>Atxn1</italic><sup><italic>154Q/+</italic></sup> mouse cerebellum seed the formation of new oligomers in this cell model. We added cerebellar fractions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) to the cells and quantified the percentage of mRFP-ATXN1(82Q) cells with oligomeric or fibrillar inclusions, based on size (350–900 nm or &gt;900 nm, respectively) and whether or not the inclusions were detected by F11G3. The cells exposed to either fraction 11 or 12 developed the largest proportion of oligomeric inclusions (55% and 34%, respectively) in comparison with cells incubated with other fractions or the control group (18%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). None of the treated groups showed an increase in fibrillar inclusions. This suggests that ATXN1 oligomeric complexes seed the formation of new oligomers but do not promote the formation of ATXN1 fibrillar material. No fibrillar or oligomeric inclusions were observed in any of the mRFP-ATXN1(82Q, S776A) cells, regardless of the treatment (data not shown). ATXN1 oligomeric complexes may thus act as a seed, but the cell needs to express an entity that is prone to aggregate.</p><p>To confirm that the seeding effect was in fact produced by ATXN1 oligomers, Daoy mRFP-ATXN1(82Q) cells treated with Fraction 11 were immunostained with either anti-oligomer antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) or an anti-ATXN1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The anti-oligomer staining (green fluorescence) revealed several oligomeric complexes that lacked an mRFP signal, suggesting that exogenously added oligomers were internalized by the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). ATXN1 staining revealed that cells also internalized exogenously added ATXN1 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We next treated Daoy mRFP-ATXN1(82Q) cells with fraction 11 pre-incubated with the anti-oligomer antibody, the anti-ATXN1 antibody, or a control antibody. Cells treated with fraction 11 pre-incubated with the anti-oligomer or the anti-ATXN1 antibody blocked oligomer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). It is therefore the ATXN1 oligomers present in fraction 11 that are responsible for inducing the formation of new oligomeric inclusions in mRFP-ATXN1(82Q) cells.</p><p>To determine the mechanism through which the anti-oligomer antibody blocks the seeding effect of ATXN1 oligomers, we treated Daoy mRFP-ATXN1(82Q) cells with fraction 11 pre-incubated with the anti-oligomer antibody and performed IF using only a secondary antibody labeled with alexa 488. Fluorescent images show that the anti-oligomer antibody was not internalized by the cell but bound to the ATXN1 oligomers in the extracellular space. The antibody thus appears to block the internalization of exogenous ATXN1 oligomers rather than interacting directly with intracellular oligomeric species. The presence of anti-oligomer antibody was confirmed by western blot analysis of media from cells treated with only secondary antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CIC interacts with ATXN1 oligomers stabilizing the complex in its oligomeric conformation</title><p>In SCA1, both wild-type and expanded ATXN1 share many binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lim et al., 2006</xref>).

We also probed FRA membranes with OC, a conformational antibody that specifically recognizes fibrillar oligomers and fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kayed et al., 2007</xref>), and found fractions 7 and 8 in <italic>Atxn1</italic><sup><italic>154Q/+</italic></sup> mice, and fractions 7, 8, and 9 in <italic>Atxn1</italic><sup><italic>154Q/+</italic></sup><italic>;Cic</italic><sup><italic>L+/-</italic></sup> mice, positive for OC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). ATXN1 thus tends to form fibrillar oligomers, amorphous aggregates and/or fibrils when CIC levels are reduced. We detected no oligomers using F11G3 in the FRA membranes; ATXN1 oligomers detected by F11G3 are therefore soluble in 2% SDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) and able to escape detection by FRA.

As a negative control, we utilized CIC with the W37A mutation which hinders its interaction with ATXN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Increasing amounts of CIC led to increasing levels of oligomers as measured with F11G3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), but increasing amounts of mutant CIC/W37A produced no changes in the levels of ATXN1 oligomers in the cells. To determine whether polyQ-length plays a role in CIC's stabilization of ATXN1 oligomers, we repeated the same co-transfection experiments in HeLa cells as described for ATXN1(82Q), this time utilizing nonpathogenic wild-type ATXN1(30Q). When cells were co-transfected with ATXN1(30Q) and increasing amounts of CIC, oligomers were almost undetectable by western blot using F11G3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). As expected, increasing amounts of mutant CIC/W37A produced no oligomeric signal. To compare the relative amounts of oligomers in the ATXN1(82Q) and ATXN1 (30Q) cells, we performed direct ELISA using F11G3 and normalized the values by the total amount of ATXN1 measured using anti-ATXN1 antibody. The ELISA quantification confirmed that increasing amounts of CIC corresponded to increasing levels of oligomers in ATXN1(82Q) cells, whereas no changes in oligomer levels were observed when cells were treated with any amount of mutant CIC/W37A. Cells transfected with nonpathogenic ATXN1(30Q) failed to produce oligomers, whether they were co-transfected with CIC, CIC/W37A, or not co-transfected at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07558.018</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>ATXN1 requires CIC binding to maintain oligomer conformation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot of Hela cells co-transfected with ATXN1(82Q) and increasing concentrations (from 0.5 to 3 μg) of wild type CIC (left panel) or increasing concentrations of mutant CIC/W37A (right panel).

It has been shown that these fibrillar oligomers are more mature oligomers, more compact and less toxic than the soluble ones detected with A-11 and F11G3, known as prefibrillar oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krishnan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guerrero-Munoz et al., 2014b</xref>). Despite the structural similarity of fibrillar oligomers and fibrils, the former are not positive for Thioflavine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Glabe, 2008</xref>). As expected, AXH either alone or with mutant CIC W37A formed significantly more fibrillar oligomers at 24 hr than it did with wild-type CIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This result suggests that CIC binding to ATXN1 promotes the formation of and stabilizes soluble prefibrillar oligomers and tends to divert ATXN1 from forming more mature and less toxic aggregates such as fibrillar oligomers and fibrils. To solidify this interpretation, we performed a Thioflavin T (Thio-T) assay to determine the effect of CIC on the formation of AXH fibrils. Fluorescence measurements of Thio-T showed that wild-type CIC diminished the formation of AXH fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The results obtained from our aggregation kinetics assay suggested that CIC not only promotes AXH oligomerization but also stabilizes the oligomers, retarding the kinetics of AXH aggregation to fibrils.</p><p>Having demonstrated that increasing levels of CIC stabilize ATXN1 polyQ oligomers in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we sought to determine whether the particular susceptibility of the cerebellum to ATXN1 toxicity could be attributable, at least in part, to CIC levels in the tissue. We measured the levels of ATXN1 and CIC in the cerebellum and cortex of wild type mice and found that, under these physiological conditions, CIC levels are higher in the cerebellum than in the cortex, but ATXN1 levels are lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The amount of CIC available relative to ATXN1 is thus considerably higher in the cerebellum than in the cortex. This result suggests that in brain regions containing high levels of CIC in relation to ATXN1 (such as the cerebellum), CIC stabilizes ATXN1 in its oligomeric conformation, but where the ratio of CIC to ATXN1 is lower, ATXN1 is not stabilized in its oligomeric confirmation and continues its process of forming non-toxic NIs.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07558.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Comparison of CIC and ATXN1 protein levels in cerebellum and cortex.</title><p>CIC levels are higher in the cerebellum than in the cortex, while ATXN1 levels are lower in the cerebellum than in the cortex, making the amount of CIC per ATXN1 much higher in the cerebellum.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07558.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07558.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07558-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>An overwhelming number of studies have shown that structurally related oligomers are toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiti and Dobson, 2006</xref>) and that the soluble rather than the fibrillar mutant protein is associated with a toxic gain of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saunders and Bottomley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zoghbi and Orr, 2009</xref>). Oligomers have been specifically associated with Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and frontotemporal dementia, and it has been proposed that the disease pathology could be caused solely by soluble toxic entities of Aβ, α-synuclein or tau, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lesne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shankar et al., 2008</xref>). Yet the molecular mechanism(s) of this toxicity have remained poorly understood. Not since Prusiner proposed the existence of a ‘protein X’ that might help form the toxic species has attention been paid to a possible requirement for interaction with another protein partner to form toxic oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Telling et al., 1995</xref>). Here we have demonstrated not only that polyQ ATXN1 adopts an oligomeric conformation and that this conformation is pathogenic in cellular and animal models of SCA1, but that the native binding partner of ATXN1, CIC, is essential for the stabilization of oligomeric polyQ ATXN1. We believe the data provide compelling reason to investigate the role of native partners involved in the toxicity of protein oligomers in other neurodegenerative proteinopathies.</p><p>Our study also provide an answer to the longstanding conundrum of differential regional vulnerability, i.e., why a ubiquitiously expressed protein should prove toxic to only certain brain regions and leave others relatively unharmed. It has been particularly perplexing that regions that develop insoluble nuclear inclusions, which were long thought to be toxic, tend to escape SCA1 pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Watase et al., 2002</xref>). We had previously shown that polyQ ATXN1 exerts toxicity through its native complexes containing CIC rather than through aberrant interactions with novel proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lam et al., 2006</xref>) and that reducing CIC levels by 50% rescues the phenotype of a mouse model for SCA1, improving motor functions and increasing survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fryer et al., 2011</xref>). The data from the current study provide insight into how CIC modulates pathogenesis and why it is particularly toxic in the cerebellum: CIC stabilizes toxic oligomers and exists in a particularly high ratio with respect to ATXN1 in cerebellar neurons. In the SCA1 knockin mice, the abundance of these oligomers correlated directly with behavioral deficits; without CIC, in vitro and in vivo, ATXN1 oligomers continue on the aggregation pathway and co-assemble into less-toxic fibrillar oligomers, amorphous aggregates and/or fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). SCA1 is therefore triggered not just by a conformational change in ATXN1 but by interactions with a specific partner in a specific brain region that brings about oligomerization and stabilization. The partner not only has to be present, but its levels have to be high enough to stabilize a considerable proportion of ATXN1 oligomers in order to drive pathogenesis. These observations do much to explain why pathology is relatively localized in SCA1 despite the ubiquitous expression of ATXN1. It seems likely that the physiological cellular environment will prove to be the determining factor in promoting and stabilizing the respective pathological proteins in their toxic conformations in other polyglutamine diseases and proteinopathies.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07558.023</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>ATAXIN-1 oligomer complexes with seeding capability correlate with disease progression in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1: a model.</title><p>Under normal conditions (<bold>A</bold>, left panel), wild type ATXN1 forms a transcriptional repressor complex with CIC (1) and binds to DNA (2).

In light of this, we propose that CIC interacts with oligomeric polyglutamine-expanded ATXN1 dimers through the exposed hydrophobic domains, which in turn stabilizes the complexes. In other words, CIC—a native ATXN1 interactor—does not discern between a nonpathogenic wild type ATXN1 dimer and a pathologically expanded ATXN1 dimer, and interacts with either; it simply binds to ATXN1 to form a functional transcriptional repressor complex or a dysfunctional oligomeric complex, depending on the polyglutamine tract. The length of the polyQ tract is essential to the accumulation, aggregation and oligomerization of ATXN1, as has been postulated for other polyglutamine diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Legleiter et al., 2010</xref>). Given that CIC interacts with ATXN1 regardless of polyQ expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lam et al., 2006</xref>) and that CIC stabilizes AXH oligomers, we believe that CIC stabilizes ATXN1 oligomers independent of the polyQ tract length. Nevertheless, a polyglutamine expansion is necessary to initiate the oligomerization process under physiological conditions, in the context of the full-length protein. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that a native interactor of a toxic protein can stabilize its oligomeric form to promote its bioavailability and downstream toxicity. Furthermore, ATXN1 oligomeric complexes were able to penetrate cells and seed the formation of new ATXN1 oligomers without forming fibrillar inclusions. This could be explained by the addition of monomers to the ends of oligomers, which is kinetically more favorable than the assembly of oligomers into fibrils via sheet stacking interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our findings for SCA1 are likely to be applicable to other members of the larger family of neurodegenerative proteinopathies. It should be worthwhile, for example, to explore whether native interactors of tau and α-synuclein might promote or hinder their formation of toxic oligomers. Without ruling out the role of non-native interactors in protein aggregation, we propose that neuropathological features of a specific disease are determined by both transient and stable native protein interactions and that these interactions in turn affect the amyloidogenic properties of the disease-associated protein. Thus, blocking certain interactions that mediate the formation or stabilization of oligomeric toxic entities, or modulating the downstream effects of such interactions, could be an attractive treatment option for this class of diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse models and preparation of brain extracts</title><p>All mouse procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee for Baylor College of Medicine and Affiliates. <italic>Atxn1</italic><sup><italic>154Q/+</italic></sup>, and <italic>Atxn1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lorenzetti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Watase et al., 2002</xref>) and were backcrossed to C57BL/6 for more than ten generations.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and three reviewers. We add the individual reports which are all three very positive. No further experimental work seems needed and careful consideration of the different suggestions could help to improve the final version of the work.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I like this story about the toxicity of prefibrillar ATXN1 oligomers a lot. I think it convincingly shows, primarily using conformation specific antibodies, that the fraction of the polyQ expanded mutant protein that forms prefibrillar toxic oligomers depends on the level of a known interactor of native ATXN1. This model makes much sense for polyQ proteins since the expansion is likely to leave other domains natively folded—the generality is of course unclear at this moment. The observations are important because they provide a way to understand the otherwise perplexing stereospecificity of the cytotoxcicity of aggregating proteins, which is one of the main outstanding questions in the field: why is the same aggregating protein toxic to some cells but not to others.</p><p>The work is well done and the manuscript is well written. My main concern regards the conformational antibody itself. I think the authors should discuss in the manuscript how F11G3 differs from the well-known A11. There are serious concerns about the variations in the properties of this antibody both batch to batch and between suppliers. Is F11G3 better behaved, or should readers worry about the same flaws (which come down to reproducibility issues)? I think in terms of the credibility of the story I would provide some more support for the robustness of this (to me) relatively new antibody.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is a very exciting and timely manuscript that both nicely builds on the authors’ previous work and provides important new findings relating to protein propagation in CAG repeat diseases. The use of the antibody developed by Dr. Kayed is a strength. This has been a very active area of research over the last several years, having been shown for FTD, PD and other disorders and more recently in cells for HD. This is a very elegant study showing that Capicua, which was shown as critical to SCA1 previously by Zoghbi and Orr, is linked to formation of oligomers and seeding of aggregation. They convincingly show that oligomers correlate with disease progression in vivo in SCA1 transgenic mice using a multitude of assays. Any of these in isolation would be somewhat correlative, but taken together they build an extremely strong case. The data also provide support for the hypothesis that the protein interactions that drive the formation of these toxic oligomeric structures may explain some of the selectivity that drives disease in Purkinje cells.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript is a thorough and wide-ranging study of the role of oligomers in SCA1, one of nine polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorders. The authors marshal an impressive range of methods and employ multiple mouse and cell models to ascertain the presence of disease protein oligomers in susceptible brain tissue/cells and explore interactions between such oligomers and a well-established disease protein interacting partner, Capicua (CIC1). There are many strengths to the paper. It serves as an important addition to the field of polyglutamine diseases specifically, and to neurodegenerative proteinopathies more generally. I have several small points of clarification and questions for the authors, but no truly major concerns.</p><p>Two points of moderate significance:</p><p>1) The distinction of fibrillar from oligomeric inclusions, which is based in part on size, is not particularly well supported in the paper. It is a critical distinction for many of the authors' result and ultimate conclusion, and may benefit from additional description.</p><p>2) The tight correlation between degree of motor dysfunction in SCA1 knock-in mice and levels of ATXN1 oligomers, while striking and intriguing, is likely heavily weighted toward the young mice and old mice which respectively show low and high levels of oligomers on average (these young and old mice presumably differ in many other respects as well). Ideally, though not essential for this paper, the authors would analyze a set of mice of the same, intermediate age with varying degree of motor dysfunction and determine whether, at this intermediate age, levels of oligomers indeed do correlate closely with degree of motor dysfunction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07558.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>The work is well done and the manuscript is well written.

Regarding the question about differences between F11G3 and A-11, because we focused on use of F11G3 it is hard for us to make claims regarding how the two compare. F11G3 has been previously extensively characterized and compared with A-11 (Guerrero-Munoz et al. 2014. Neurobiology of disease 71, 14-23).</p><p>To make things clearer we now state this in the Results section and we also indicate in the Results and in the Materials and methods sections that F11G3 is a mouse monoclonal antibody that can be provided by Dr. Kayed and is not commercially available in contrast to A-11 that is a rabbit polyclonal that have been sold commercially.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) The distinction of fibrillar from oligomeric inclusions, which is based in part on size, is not particularly well supported in the paper. It is a critical distinction for many of the authors' result and ultimate conclusion, and may benefit from additional description</italic>.</p><p>The distinction between different inclusions was based not only on the size but also on F11G3 reactivity. Nevertheless, we agree that additional description would be helpful. Therefore in the subsection “ATXN1 oligomers seed the formation of endogenous ATXN1 oligomers in cell culture”, we stated: “larger inclusions are more complex and composed of higher order aggregated, likely to be fibrillar in nature”.</p><p><italic>2) The tight correlation between degree of motor dysfunction in SCA1 knock-in mice and levels of ATXN1 oligomers, while striking and intriguing, is likely heavily weighted toward the young mice and old mice which respectively show low and high levels of oligomers on average (these young and old mice presumably differ in many other respects as well). Ideally, though not essential for this paper, the authors would analyze a set of mice of the same, intermediate age with varying degree of motor dysfunction and determine whether, at this intermediate age, levels of oligomers indeed do correlate closely with degree of motor dysfunction</italic>.</p><p>In the current manuscript we already analyzed a set of mice of intermediate age (18 weeks old) with varying degree of motor dysfunction (young would be 5-8 weeks and old would be 35-50 weeks). Please refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-B</xref> where we observed the correlation between the levels of oligomers and the degree of motor dysfunction in these mice.</p></body></sub-article></article>
