indicative of regulation by a bi-modal switch, but it is not clear how these switches are controlled. Using native elongating transcript analysis (NET-seq), we show that transcription itself is a component of bi-modal switches, facilitating reciprocal expression in gene clusters. <italic>HMS2</italic>, encoding a growth-regulated transcription factor, switches between sense- or antisense-dominant states that also coordinate up- and down-regulation of transcription at neighbouring genes. Engineering <italic>HMS2</italic> reveals alternative mono-, di- or tri-cistronic and antisense transcription units (TUs), using different promoter and terminator combinations, that underlie state-switching. Promoters or terminators are excluded from functional TUs by read-through transcriptional interference, while antisense TUs insulate downstream genes from interference. We propose that the balance of transcriptional insulation and interference at gene clusters facilitates gene expression switches during intracellular and extracellular environmental change.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03635.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03635.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03635.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A DNA double helix is made up of two DNA strands, which in turn are made of molecules that are each known by a single letter—A, T, C, or G. The sequence of these ‘letters’ in each DNA strand contains biological information.</p><p>Genes are sections of DNA that can be ‘expressed’ to produce proteins and RNA molecules. To express a gene, the DNA strands in the double helix must first be partially separated so that one of them can be used as a template to build an RNA molecule in a process called transcription. Either of the DNA strands in a helix can be used as an RNA template, but contain different genes and are read in opposite directions. One of the two strands is called the ‘sense’ strand, the other the ‘antisense’ strand.</p><p>The RNA molecule does not transcribe a whole DNA strand; instead, it transcribes a section of DNA, known as a transcription unit, which contains at least one gene. The end of a transcription unit is marked by certain signals that stop transcription. However, some transcription units in a DNA strand overlap, so there must be some way that the transcription machinery can sometimes ignore these stop signals.</p><p>The activity of some genes is linked to the activity of their immediate neighbours. Furthermore, some genes are expressed in different amounts in response to changes in environmental conditions. Researchers have previously suggested that there must be some form of switch that controls when these genes are expressed.</p><p>Nguyen et al. now engineer start and stop signals at a neighbouring pair of genes, called <italic>HMS2</italic> and <italic>BAT2</italic>, in yeast. When one gene is switched on, the other is switched off and which gene is active depends on the diet of the yeast cells.</p><p>On the antisense DNA strand opposite to <italic>HMS2</italic> is another gene, <italic>SUT650</italic>. Nguyen et al. show that when this gene is transcribed, the transcription of <italic>HMS2</italic> on the other DNA strand is blocked. This has the knock-on effect of turning on <italic>BAT2</italic>. Conversely, transcribing <italic>HMS2</italic> switches off <italic>SUT650</italic> and <italic>BAT2</italic> because the end of <italic>HMS2</italic> overlaps with the beginning of both <italic>SUT650</italic> and <italic>BAT2</italic>. Switching between different genes relies on loops that physically link the start and stop signals of the gene to be transcribed while ignoring the start and stop signals for neighbouring genes.</p><p>Proteins called transcription factors can bind to DNA and affect whether a gene is transcribed. Nguyen et al. found that a transcription factor that binds near the start of the <italic>HMS2</italic> gene helps to control which DNA strand is transcribed. When transcription factors do not bind to the start of <italic>HMS2</italic>, antisense transcription—and the expression of <italic>SUT650</italic>—occurs instead.</p><p>Overall, Nguyen et al. show that the transcription process itself makes up part of a switch that can control the expression of several genes on both the sense and antisense strands of a DNA double helix. This may also explain how many other, more complex, gene networks are activated in response to changes in the environment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genome-wide mapping of RNA transcripts in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has revealed an extensive array of coding and non-coding transcripts, giving rise to a genome that is heavily interleaved. Individual genes can possess multiple, overlapping transcripts, in the sense and the antisense orientations with respect to the pre-mRNA, as well as poly-cistronic transcripts, which span neighbouring genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kapranov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berretta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pelechano et al., 2013</xref>). Genome-wide mapping of nascent transcription, using techniques such as NET-seq, shows that transcription commonly extends into and over the intergenic regions of both convergent and tandemly arranged genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>). For tandemly arranged genes, transcription into the promoter of the downstream gene would be expected to interfere with its expression by a variety of mechanisms, including modifying the local chromatin environment and interference by removal of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martens et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martianov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hainer et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, extensive transcription antisense to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Venters and Pugh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murray et al., 2012</xref>), and into the promoter of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perocchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2009</xref>), the canonical coding transcript is also implicated in modulating gene expression by similar mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hongay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Camblong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Uhler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Houseley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pinskaya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Werven et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castelnuovo et al., 2013</xref>). An interleaved genome with overlapping transcription units requires that polyadenylation and transcription termination signals in the sense and antisense orientations are by-passed but it is not clear how this is achieved. In addition, questions are commonly raised about whether transcription of these overlapping transcription units is contemporaneous.</p><p>It is now clear that much transcription is organised into biologically relevant temporal windows within phenomena such as the metabolic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tu and McKnight, 2006</xref>). Indeed, periodic or cycling expression of genes can be detected using fluorescent reporters or dual-labelled RNA FISH in cultures of asynchronous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laxman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Silverman et al., 2010</xref>), or in the absence of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Slavov et al., 2011</xref>). This periodic expression is a result of synchronization of respiratory and glycolytic activities into robust oscillations in oxygen consumption, characterized by phase-specific transcript signatures involving over 3000 genes, known as the Yeast Metabolic Cycle (YMC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klevecz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tu et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Soranzo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Slavov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai and Tu, 2012</xref>). In the long-period YMC, a single cell alternates between periods of high (oxidative (OX) phase) or low oxygen consumption (reductive building (RB) and charging (RC) phases), the residence time in each phase being nutrient-dependent. For exponentially growing cells in batch culture, the majority of cells in the population will be in the OX phase of the YMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Slavov et al., 2011</xref>). Transcript levels for genes that cycle in the YMC will change as the cell moves through these phases; at any time, some cells in an asynchronous population will contain a transcript and some will not. These shifts through transcriptional states are robust but not invariable, as YMC-regulated genes switch on and off in response to cues prompted by both regulated and erratic changes in the intracellular and extracellular environment.</p><p>In addition to the partitioned gene expression patterns during the YMC, genomic spatial arrangements also contribute to regulatory relationships between genes, albeit on a smaller scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee and Sonnhammer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Batada et al., 2007</xref>). While genes displaying functional relatedness, such as the <italic>GAL</italic> genes, are regulated similarly by possessing the same <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences (i.e. the UAS<sub><italic>GAL</italic></sub>), co-expression of clustered genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is largely independent of similarly controlled transcription, gene orientation, and/or shared regulatory sequences. However, members of adjacent gene pairs or clusters are more likely to belong to the same functional pathway than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee and Sonnhammer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Batada et al., 2007</xref>). The mechanism by which these clustered genes are regulated remains largely elusive.</p><p>Here we show that overlapping transcription, in both the sense and antisense orientations, constitutes an additional layer of regulation at clustered genes by managing state-switching in response to environmental change. We use a simple carbon source shift coupled with NET-seq to define genes whose transcription increases or decreases &gt;threefold, after transfer from glucose (GLU)- to galactose (GAL)-containing media and show a remarkable enrichment for genes whose transcripts cycle during the YMC. The majority of these genes have no functional associations with transcription factors that might mediate repression or induction in GLU or GAL, but are organised in clusters and subject to overlapping sense and antisense transcription. We exemplify this mode of gene regulation, state-switching by transcriptional interference and insulation, at the <italic>HMS2:BAT2</italic> tandem gene cluster. By engineering promoters and terminators at <italic>HMS2:BAT2</italic>, we demonstrate the formation of alternative transcription units underlies state-switching. We suggest that overlapping transcription and the formation of alternative transcription units, associated with temporally segregated gene expression, will be a general feature of gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide response to a change in carbon source reveals genes whose transcripts cycle in the YMC</title><p>The question we address in this work is whether transcriptional interference can explain the switching on and off of genes and thus altered gene expression in response to environmental change. We used a change in carbon source by shifting exponentially growing cells from glucose- (GLU) to galactose-containing media (GAL) for 3 h and analysed the native transcripts associated with elongating RNA polymerase II (NET-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>) to identify genes whose transcription is altered during this environmental change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). 10.45% (551) of ORF-Ts (open reading frame—transcripts) showed a &gt;threefold increase and 9.99% (527) showed a &gt;threefold decrease in transcription in GAL relative to GLU (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). By comparing the NET-seq output with a microarray of Poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA, we show that for the majority (≈88%) of genes, the change in transcript levels on the GLU to GAL shift reflects altered transcription rather than altered transcript stability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed highly significant associations to growth, quiescence, and transcripts that cycle in the YMC, particularly during the oxidative (OX) and the reductive charging (RC) phases of the YMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1C,D</xref>). The genes whose transcription decreases in GAL are enriched (467; 88.6% p &lt; 1x10<sup>−5</sup>) for OX phase genes that are mainly involved in ribosome biosynthesis and growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). By contrast, for genes whose transcription increases in GAL, there is significant enrichment (392; 71.1%, p &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) for genes whose expression peaks in the reductive charging phase (RC) of the YMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These genes are associated with stress resistance, metabolism, and quiescence. 33.1% (891) of the 2691 annotated OX- and RC-regulated genes also show &gt;threefold change on the GLU to GAL shift, supporting a shared regulatory mechanism between the YMC and the GLU to GAL shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>). In addition to ORF-Ts, many of the non-coding transcription events are regulated by the GLU to GAL shift. These include antisense transcription reads (to ORF-Ts), which increase in GAL compared to GLU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and 25.7% of the 1772 annotated non-coding transcripts, the stable unannotated transcripts (SUTs), or cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), which show &gt;threefold change in transcription on the GLU to GAL shift (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03635.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reciprocal switching of expression by carbon source reveals links to the YMC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The distribution of all ORF-Ts into different YMC phases.

Selected data from this analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1F</xref>. In summary, pairs of ORF-Ts in the convergent orientation occur more often than expected, while tandemly arranged ORF-Ts occur less often than expected. YMC genes are clustered, with 503 (16.9%) YMC genes flanked by non-cycling genes, 1431 (48.4%) with a single adjacent YMC partner either upstream or downstream and 1023 (34.5%) with a neighbouring cycling gene both upstream and downstream. Compared to more isolated genes, ORF-T clusters are more likely to show increased transcription in GLU or GAL than expected, suggesting that clustering is associated with some aspect of their regulation. In addition, ORF-Ts flanked by annotated SUTs or CUTs (in any orientation) occur more often than expected and show a twofold to fourfold higher median expression upon change from GLU to GAL than the average median expression obtained through the simulations. This is consistent with CUTs and SUTs playing a role in modulating ORF-T transcription, particularly on environmental change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). Convergent overlapping arrangements occur three times more frequently than expected, whether the feature is a non-coding transcript (NC) such as a SUT or a CUT, or an ORF-T, with a median overlap of 92 bp for convergent ORF-Ts and 462 bp for ORF-Ts with non-coding transcripts. Thus clustering with overlapping transcription and transcriptional regulation are common features of the yeast genome.</p><p>As the genes whose transcription changed during the GLU/GAL shift are enriched for OX and RC YMC genes, we examined whether the nature of the flanking gene influences transcription, focusing on the tandem, and divergent combinations of these genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1F</xref>). OX genes, regardless of the nature (OX or RC) or orientation (divergent or tandem) of the upstream feature showed higher than expected transcriptional rates in GLU, but not in GAL, suggesting they are activated in GLU but not repressed in GAL. Similarly, RC genes are more likely to show higher than expected transcriptional rates in GAL. The behaviour of RC genes in GLU, however, does appear to be dependent on the orientation of the upstream OX gene. With a divergent upstream OX gene, the transcription of the downstream RC pair is not enriched or depleted in GLU. However, if the OX gene is in tandem, the RC gene is repressed in GLU. This raises the possibility that at the OX.RC tandem pair, transcription of the OX gene is mediating transcriptional interference and repressing the transcription of the RC gene in GLU. We note that the downstream gene in a tandem RC.RC pair also shows significant repression in glucose. To investigate further, we examined three different data sets: (i) three groups of tandemly arranged genes; OX.RC, RC.OX, and non-cycling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1G</xref>); (ii) three sets of 20 consecutive ORF-Ts from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref> showing a sevenfold increase, no change or a sevenfold decrease on the GLU/GAL shift (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1H</xref>); and (iii) GLU/GAL-regulated genes with an annotated antisense CUT or SUT that is also GLU/GAL-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1I</xref>). From this analysis, we picked tandem gene clusters where the transcription of the target gene is regulated by GAL/GAL shift or not, and examined how neighbouring genes behave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2 fig1s3 fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 1–4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1J</xref>). The tandem partner of a GLU/GAL-regulated gene is often also regulated by the GLU/GAL shift and the YMC, while non-regulated genes are less likely to be in tandem and if they are, are surrounded by genes that are also not regulated by the GLU/GAL shift or the YMC. Common features of the regulated tandem clusters include reciprocal transcription in GLU and GAL, reciprocally cycling transcripts in the YMC, reciprocal AS transcription to OX genes, di-cistronic transcripts, and/or antisense transcripts spanning promoters that could mediate temporal transcriptional interference and thus facilitate cycling transcription. We chose the OX.RC pair <italic>HMS2:BAT2</italic> for further study, as all the above characteristics are present and because the relatively abundant <italic>HMS2</italic> antisense transcript, <italic>SUT650</italic>, can be detected experimentally in both GLU and GAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Characterisation of transcripts and transcription at the <italic>HMS2:BAT2</italic> locus</title><p>We examined the relationship between <italic>HMS2</italic> and <italic>BAT2</italic> (transcripts A and D respectively). <italic>BAT2</italic> transcripts peak in the RC phase of the YMC and in GAL, reciprocal to <italic>HMS2</italic> sense transcripts, which peak in the OX phase of the YMC and in GLU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Interestingly, there is also a reciprocal relationship between <italic>HMS2</italic> and its antisense <italic>SUT650</italic> (transcripts A and B respectively). Dual-labelled RNA FISH revealed a degree of temporal separation in the production of the <italic>HMS2</italic> and <italic>SUT650</italic> transcripts. In multiple analyses, no examples of FISH signals for both <italic>HMS2</italic> and <italic>SUT650</italic> at the site of transcription in the nucleus are observed in either GLU or GAL. Cells with nascent transcripts (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) often have the opposite transcript type or both <italic>SUT650</italic> and <italic>HMS2</italic> transcripts in the cytoplasm, suggesting they are changing state. 35.5 ± 7.9% of the cells contained both transcripts in GLU, 22.8 ± 10.5% of all cells lacked both the <italic>SUT650</italic> and <italic>HMS2</italic> sense transcripts. The remaining cells contained either <italic>HMS2</italic> or <italic>SUT650</italic> transcripts but not both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For cells containing a single type of transcript, more cells contained antisense transcripts in GAL than GLU while more cells contained sense transcripts in GLU than GAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, the increase in levels of <italic>SUT650</italic> transcripts in GAL reflects an increase in the number of cells expressing <italic>SUT650</italic> and a concomitant decrease in the number of cells expressing <italic>HMS2</italic>, rather than a change in the levels of transcripts within a fixed number of cells in the population. We conclude that the expression of <italic>HMS2</italic> and <italic>SUT650</italic> is temporally separated, similar to the <italic>PHO84</italic> sense and antisense transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castelnuovo et al., 2013</xref>).

This suggests that the carbon source responsive signal is received at the <italic>HMS2</italic> promoter and that reciprocal switching of <italic>HMS2</italic> and <italic>SUT650</italic> is a function of sense transcription. However, as the levels of <italic>HMS2</italic> sense transcripts are higher without the antisense transcript, we asked if antisense transcription plays a role in limiting the number of cells containing sense transcript using RNA FISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

To ablate <italic>SUT650</italic> whilst ensuring that the regulatory elements in the flanking sequences between <italic>HMS2</italic> and <italic>BAT2</italic> remained intact, we removed the transcription start sites (TSS) for <italic>SUT650</italic> located between +953 and +1038 relative to the <italic>HMS2</italic> ATG, near the end of the <italic>HMS2</italic> coding region. We chose to do this by substituting the complete coding region of <italic>HMS2</italic> with that of <italic>URA3</italic>, to ensure a natural ORF between the <italic>HMS2</italic> promoter and terminator, rather than mutating the regions containing multiple TSSs for <italic>SUT650</italic> within the ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We note that insertion of the <italic>URA3</italic> ORF could affect transcript stability, although the nature of the promoter may be the primary determinant of transcript stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bregman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Trcek et al., 2011</xref>), so we focused on transcript size and relative abundance. We observed two clear effects. First, loss of the antisense transcript (B), which could be explained either by introduction of a unidirectional terminator in the <italic>URA3</italic> ORF coding region or loss of TSSs for <italic>SUT650</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, an increase in the read-through transcripts (C<sub>1</sub><sup>U</sup>) relative to the <italic>HMS2</italic>:<italic>URA3</italic> sense transcript (A<sup>U</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). We confirmed these were read-through transcripts by inserting a terminator (T) at the 3′ region of the <italic>HMS2:URA3</italic> hybrid gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and observing loss of the read-through transcripts and increased levels of a shorter transcript (A<sup>U</sup>T) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). We note that transcripts initiated at the <italic>HMS2</italic> promoter remain sensitive to a change in carbon source in the absence of antisense transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), as we observed using <italic>HMS2:ADH1t</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and consistent with a regulatory input at the promoter. The increase in the read-through transcript (C<sub>1</sub><sup>U</sup>) relative to the <italic>HMS2</italic>:<italic>URA3</italic> sense transcript (A<sup>U</sup>) in the absence of antisense transcription suggests a role for antisense transcription in attenuating sense transcription and preventing interference at the <italic>BAT2</italic> promoter. Consistent with this, a twofold decrease in <italic>BAT2</italic> sense transcript is observed in the antisense-less <italic>HMS2:URA3</italic> strain relative to WT in GLU, concomitant with a threefold increase in A<sup>U</sup> and C<sub>1</sub><sup>U</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Taken together, the effect of blocking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) or increasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) <italic>HMS2</italic> transcription on levels of <italic>BAT2</italic> transcript supports transcriptional interference by <italic>HMS2</italic> at the <italic>BAT2</italic> promoter and a reciprocal relationship between <italic>HMS2</italic> and <italic>BAT2</italic>. We sought evidence for transcriptional interference resulting from increased levels of A<sup>U</sup> and C<sub>1,2</sub><sup>U</sup>. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis at the <italic>HMS2:BAT2</italic> intergenic region reveals reduced initiation-related modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K56ac) and increased elongation-related modifications (H3K79me3 and H3K36me3) in the <italic>HMS2</italic>:<italic>URA3</italic> hybrid gene, consistent with transcriptional interference leading to repression of <italic>BAT2</italic> transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

We envisage that at any one time in a single cell, formation of the <italic>HMS2</italic> and <italic>SUT650</italic> transcription units (TUs) is mutually exclusive, but the formation of the <italic>SUT650</italic> TU and the <italic>BAT2</italic> TU is not.

When cultured in glucose, the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter is repressed but becomes induced about 2 h after transfer to galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). <italic>SUT650</italic> is normally induced during the GLU-GAL shift (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However in the p<italic>GAL1:HMS2</italic> strain, an antisense transcript (B<sup>G</sup>) is evident in GLU and remains until the sense transcript is induced by GAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). This suggests that sense transcription represses the antisense transcript. We used the inducible p<italic>GAL1:HMS2</italic> system in conjunction with the Anchor Away technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>) to deplete the nucleus of the Gal4p activator during growth in GAL. Removal of Gal4p by treatment with rapamycin (Rap) for 1 h, after activation of p<italic>GAL1:HMS2</italic> for 3 h with GAL, abolishes the <italic>HMS2</italic> transcript (A<sup>G</sup>) and leads to restoration of the antisense transcript (B<sup>G</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). This confirms that the reduction in the antisense transcript is a consequence of sense transcription, rather than the change in condition (GLU to GAL). To determine whether antisense transcription had any effect on p<italic>GAL1:HMS2</italic> sense transcript induction rates, the antisense--less <italic>HMS2:URA3</italic> construct was placed under the control of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). The sense transcript profile in poly(A)<sup>+</sup>-enriched RNA was examined using a probe for the <italic>HMS2:BAT2</italic> intergenic region (probe IG), a region transcribed in both constructs. No changes in induction rate were apparent, with the sense transcript only detectable after 2 h in both strains, signifying that antisense transcription does not impair sense activation kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Rather, this finding is compatible with our observation that without antisense, more cells would express the sense transcript (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Activation of the p<italic>GAL1:HMS2</italic> sense transcript results in up to 3.5-fold repression of <italic>BAT2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), consistent with p<italic>GAL1:HMS2</italic> sense polyadenylation at 426 nt, just upstream of the <italic>BAT2</italic> ATG, interfering with <italic>BAT2</italic> transcription initiation in galactose (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We observed marked differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1K</xref>). Of particular interest are the predominance of chromatin modulators and components at RC gene promoters, suggesting that RC promoters are particularly sensitive to chromatin-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tirosh and Barkai, 2008</xref>). These features, coupled with the distinct behaviour of OX and RC genes in GLU and GAL, particularly OX.RC genes in tandem (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1F</xref>), lead us to propose chromatin-mediated repression of RC genes by transcriptional interference.

Using the <italic>HMS2:TEF:Kan</italic> construct as a starting point, mutations were introduced into the <italic>TEF</italic> promoter, including deletions of putative transcription factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). A long deletion (<italic>HMS2.TEFdel1:Kan</italic>), removing all the <italic>TEF</italic> promoter sequences upstream of the TATA box, results in a significant reduction in expression of the <italic>KanMX</italic> cassette itself (transcript K) and in levels of the antisense transcript (E) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Remarkably, in this strain, we observed a new antisense transcript from the 3′ end of <italic>HMS2</italic> that reads through <italic>TEF</italic>t (B<sup>pTEFdel</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>). We confirmed that the B<sup>pTEFdel</sup> transcript spans the 3′ region of <italic>HMS2</italic> using the H3AS probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, the disabled weak p<italic>TEFdel1</italic> resulted in reduced functionality at <italic>TEF</italic>t allowing B<sup>pTEFdel</sup>, initiating at the <italic>SUT650</italic> antisense promoter, to read through <italic>TEF</italic>t, the <italic>KanMX</italic> cassette and into the <italic>HMS2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>). This experiment illustrates (i) the conditional nature of the bi-directional <italic>TEF</italic> terminator and (ii) the remarkable plasticity of interleaved transcription units. We suggest that the p<italic>TEF.KanMX.TEF</italic>t expression cassette is strongly expressed (compare levels of transcripts A<sup>K</sup> and K in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), effectively preventing the formation of the <italic>HMS2:SUT650</italic> transcription units. When the <italic>TEF</italic> promoter is disabled, reducing expression of the p<italic>TEF.KanMX.TEF</italic>t expression cassette, the <italic>SUT650</italic> antisense transcription unit can form, resulting in the appearance of the long antisense transcript. Alternatively, reduced <italic>KanMX</italic> sense transcription decreases the ability of a terminator to stop antisense transcription from the <italic>SUT650</italic> antisense promoter. This illustrates the complex relationships that control levels of expression in the interleaved yeast genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We propose a two-state model for transcription at <italic>HMS2</italic> and <italic>BAT2</italic> that combines the effects of temporal separation, overlapping interfering transcription able to bypass typical termination and promoter signals, and insulation from interference by the formation of an antisense transcription unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). There are two states: a sense-dominant state (blue transcripts) and an antisense-dominant state (orange transcripts) with respect to <italic>HMS2</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6B and 7G</xref>). Transcription factors (Input) at the <italic>HMS2</italic> promoter regulate sense transcription and loss of input results in the antisense-dominant state. <italic>SUT650</italic> transcription insulates <italic>BAT2</italic> from interference by <italic>HMS2</italic>, reinforcing the antisense dominant state-switch. We propose that transcription in the <italic>HMS2</italic> sense orientation transmits the state-defining regulatory signals to neighbouring genes through mechanisms of <italic>cis</italic>-acting transcriptional interference, thus repressing <italic>BAT2, YJR149W,</italic> and <italic>SUT650</italic>. By these means, reciprocal regulation in cycles or on environmental change could be achieved.</p><p>More generally, how far a transcription event extends into the regulatory sequences of its SAP, or the regulatory sequences of an upstream or downstream gene may determine whether that region is competent to make a state-switch or not and respond to environmental or metabolic cues. Our genome-wide analysis supports many more examples of the type of organisation we observe at <italic>HMS2:BAT2</italic>. Moreover, the <italic>HMS2:BAT2</italic> cluster is conserved in a range of yeast strains expected of a functional linkage. There are many loci at which di-cistronic read-through transcripts are evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pelechano et al., 2013</xref>), raising the possibility that transcriptional interference leading to reciprocal expression of genes in tandem arrays is a much more widespread phenomenon in yeast.</p><p>A di-cistronic transcript means that RNA polymerase has to read through the region determining polyadenylation and termination (the terminator). Moreover, antisense transcription arising from divergent promoters may have to bypass the terminator of the upstream gene. This work indicates the capacity of a terminator to function is conditional on the strength of the proximal promoter. We suggest that this reflects the role for promoters in defining the beginnings and ends of TUs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">El Kaderi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Sullivan et al., 2004</xref>); stronger promoters preferentially selecting the proximal terminator.</p><p>The role of Sua7 in preventing read-through transcription is intriguing given its association with the 3′ region of genes, polyadenylation/transcription termination, and higher order structures in chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Medler et al., 2011</xref>). This raises the possibility of an antisense transcription unit-specific function for TFIIB at the 3′ ends of genes, characterised here using the <italic>sua7-1</italic> allele. A simple scenario in which 3′end TFIIB directs transcription by promoting both antisense transcription and physically terminating sense transcription is compatible with the interference/insulation model proposed here. It is also plausible that alternative higher order structures linking the sense or antisense promoters to one of a possible number of terminators could also explain dynamic state-switching between sense and antisense or multi-cistronic transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murray et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Only one structure would exist in each cell at any one time leading to temporal separation of the different TUs. By this model only the juxtaposed regions would function in transcription initiation and termination, allowing other promoters or terminators between these regions to be ignored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,G</xref>). In either case, our data support the idea that the functions of these linked regulatory elements are coupled through the act of transcription. Thus, the interleaved architecture of the yeast genome not only lends itself to high degrees of transcriptional overlap, but more importantly, to an equally high degree of transcription unit interdependency by co-opting transcription itself as a regulatory mechanism.</p><p>While this study has been predominantly conducted using a single locus approach in yeast, the implications of this work could be far reaching. For instance, establishing wider, biologically relevant transcriptional landscapes through sense/antisense state-switching could be pertinent to aspects of chronobiology such as circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kramer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng and Lazar, 2012</xref>), the mitotic/meiotic cell cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morris and Vogt, 2010</xref>), and other developmental processes in higher eukaryotes.

Your article has been favourably evaluated by James Manley (senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>After a thorough discussion, the consensus among the reviewers and the editors was that this is an excellent paper reporting some remarkable findings, which would be worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after addressing the concerns listed below.</p><p>The metabolic cycle has emerged as a fundamental biological phenomenon that is critical for proper cell function. It has been appreciated that oxidative conditions are in conflict with reducing reactions, and vice versa. Consequently, cells have evolved mechanisms to temporarily separate these conflicting conditions, by oscillating both the oxygen consumption as well as the expression of ∼3000 genes. The remarkable precision of the synchrony in maintaining oscillating levels of mRNAs must involve intracellular events and communication, the basis of which remains obscure. This paper provides some solutions to this enigma by demonstrating how transcription of tandemly arrayed genes can regulate a bi-modal switch so that activation of one gene would repress the other and vice versa. This paper will serve the scientific community in various aspects. First, it will drive the attention of the readers to the complexity of the YMC, an issue that is still underrepresented in the literature. Second, it illustrates the critical roles played by transcription terminators in both terminating transcription and initiating transcription in the anti-sense direction. Third, transcription of anti-sense (AS) as a key modulator of gene expression, in general, and its involvement in the bi-modal switch, in particular. Fourth, and most importantly, the paper demonstrates, in many ways, the intricate relationship between transcription of sense, anti-sense and neighbouring genes in a manner that supports the bimodal switch.</p><p>The major concerns raised by the reviewers are:</p><p>1) Generality of findings. The impact of this work would certainly be higher upon defining the prevalence of the key regulatory mechanisms described. The paper focuses on two tandemly arrayed genes (HMS2/BAT2) whose expression switches during the YMC. They provide a detailed mechanism of the switching whereby transcription read-through into the downstream promoter downregulates transcription of the downstream gene and how AS transcription is involved. Their conclusion that the sense and AS transcription are in conflict, and that cells tend to separate the “sense state” from the “AS state” temporarily is by itself remarkable. However, how general is this mechanism? What fraction of YMC-regulated genes is adjacent or anti-sense? More than expected by chance? And then what fraction of adjacent or anti-sense transcripts is co-regulated in the YMC? Moreover, if the mechanism is more prevalent than just HMS2/BAT2, do the anti-sense transcripts always fall into opposite YMC categories, i.e., oxidative vs reductive? Is this locus even representative of other glu-gal clusters? If 10 loci are chosen at random (based on having one strong glu-gal-regulated transcript), do the neighbouring genes show potent regulation like the one well-explored region? Reviewers agreed that a more global assessment of the prevalence of the mechanism described would raise the impact significantly. However, it was noted that the bioinformatics involved for a global analysis would not be trivial. Thus, reviewers request that the authors manually mine the NET-seq data regarding transcript isoforms (like the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1D</xref>) and examine whether transcription of one gene invades the promoter of its neighbouring gene, and whether the AS transcription is anti-correlated. The control should be the same number of tandemly positioned gene pairs that are chosen at random. If the authors have the bioinformatic means to take a whole genome view, all the better.</p><p>2) Weak links to YMC and circadian rhythms. Although the reviewers appreciated the novelty and elegance of the molecular mechanisms discovered, there was agreement that in its current form the manuscript does not make a convincing argument about general relevance to YMC or circadian rhythms and it was agreed that the writing, including the title, should be tempered to focus more on the mechanistic aspects and less on the YMC and circadian biology. It is proposed that the title be changed to “Transcription mediated insulation and interference direct gene cluster expression switches”.</p><p>3) The choice of sua7-1 is not well communicated. The reader of the “Results” section is puzzled why TFIIB was chosen to begin, and why this specific allele was used, in particular. Only in the Discussion the reader learns that sua7-1 is defective in loop formation.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows that the insertion of ADH1t abolished the signal detected by probe H2. From the point of view of the AS transcription, this probe is located downstream of ADH1t. The authors concluded that ADH1t blocks SUT650 AS transcription. However, it is possible that ADHt acts in both orientation and simply terminated transcription and therefore H2 could not detect any transcript. If the authors know that ADH1t does not act as terminator in the reverse orientation, they should indicate it. Moreover, even if the ADH1t is not acting as terminator of the AS, it can introduce a destabilization element that leads to its rapid degradation. In order to support this important conclusion, the authors could use a decay mutant strain (e.g., rrp6) and probe the membrane to detect the region between the ADHt and SUT650 promoter.</p><p>5) The replacement of HMS2 ORF with URA3 requires some clarifications. Why didn't the authors simply remove the region around the TSS, leaving all other sequences unchanged? Why did they prefer to introduce the entire URA3? There are two issues that need to be addressed. (1) The possibility that URA3 sequences, in both orientations, introduce stability biases onto the RNAs. (2) The possibility that the URA3 sequence contains a terminator in the AS direction, explaining why the AS RNA was not detected by H1 probe, located downstream of this hypothetical terminator. These issues can be discussed or addressed experimentally.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>, the authors used TFs with putative binding sites at intergenic region between HMS2 and BAT2 (no references were included). The membranes were probed only with the H1 probe. This case might be an opportunity to examine if any of these factors play a role in the transcription of BAT2, by probing the membrane with an appropriate probe. URA3 ORF can be replaced back to HMS2 ORF by homologous recombination and selection on 5-FOA, thus resulting in a precise deletion of just the region around the TSS. Maybe one of these TFs is required for BAT2 transcriptional repression by C1 transcription (e.g., transcription through the binding site might displace the TF).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03635.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Generality of findings.

More than expected by chance? And then what fraction of adjacent or anti-sense transcripts is co-regulated in the YMC?</italic></p><p>We have data in the revised manuscript addressing these issues (Tables S5 to S9). The antisense question is hard to address adequately due to the relatively poor annotation of the antisense transcriptome – being limited to CUTs and SUTs. There are 1772 annotated CUTs and SUTs but much more transcription antisense to genes is evident from the NET-seq analysis. A separate analysis suggests that 75% of all yeast genes are subject to some antisense transcription in the vicinity of the sense promoter that influences the chromatin organization around that promoter. Nevertheless, our analysis for this work suggests that YMC genes are much more likely to have antisense transcription, although the number of genes is relatively small because of the high thresholds (&gt;3-fold change in GLU/GAL both the YMC gene and the SUT or CUT). 71 of the 206 genes (34.4%) with regulated sense and antisense have SUTs/CUTs whose transcription also changes 3-fold in the GLU/GAL shift. 26% of all SUTs and CUTs show a &gt;3-fold change on the GLU/GAL shift.

These issues can be discussed or addressed experimentally</italic>.</p><p>We cannot address this using experimental data as BY4741 is <italic>ura3Δ</italic> and thus the <italic>URA3</italic> gene is not in our datasets to test for the presence of an early terminator. Given that the promoter of a gene is reported to determine sense RNA stability (Bregman A, Avraham-Kelbert M, Barkai O, Duek L, Guterman A and Choder M: Promoter elements regulate cytoplasmic mRNA decay. Cell 147: 1473-83; Trcek T, Larson DR, Moldon A, Query CC and Singer RH: Single-molecule mRNA decay measurements reveal promoter- regulated mRNA stability in yeast. Cell 147: 1484-97), we felt the <italic>URA3</italic> ORF replacement was an appropriate strategy. We have discussed these potential problems in the text and how we have interpreted our data given these provisos.</p><p><italic>6) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1"><italic>Figure 6–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>, the authors used TFs with putative binding sites at intergenic region between HMS2 and BAT2 (no references were included). The membranes were probed only with the H1 probe. This case might be an opportunity to examine if any of these factors play a role in the transcription of BAT2, by probing the membrane with an appropriate probe. URA3 ORF can be replaced back to HMS2 ORF by homologous recombination and selection on 5-FOA, thus resulting in a precise deletion of just the region around the TSS. Maybe one of these TFs is required for BAT2 transcriptional repression by C1 transcription (e.g., transcription through the binding site might displace the TF)</italic>.</p><p>We apologise for not including references to the putative TF binding sites – this is now done. Putative factor binding sites, and even ChIP data with tagged factors, does not provide evidence that a particular factor is functional at a particular site, for a variety of reasons (Lenstra TL, Benschop JJ, Kim T, Schulze JM, Brabers NA, Margaritis T, van de Pasch LA, van Heesch SA, Brok MO, Groot Koerkamp MJ, Ko CW, van Leenen D, Sameith K, van Hooff SR, Lijnzaad P, Kemmeren P, Hentrich T, Kobor MS, Buratowski S and Holstege FC: The specificity and topology of chromatin interaction pathways in yeast. Mol Cell 42: 536-49, 2011). Indeed, many of the experiments linking transcription factors to changes in particular transcriptional responses at genes are likely to be artefacts resulting simply from altered growth rate as a result of the genetic intervention (O'Duibhir E, Lijnzaad P, Benschop JJ, Lenstra TL, Leenen D van, Groot Koerkamp MJA, Margaritis T, Brok MO, Kemmeren P and FCP H: Cell cycle population effects in perturbation studies. Mol Syst Biol. 10: 2014; Slavov N, Airoldi EM, van Oudenaarden A and Botstein D: A conserved cell growth cycle can account for the environmental stress responses of divergent eukaryotes. Mol Biol Cell 23: 1986-97, 2013), (and the different times spent in the OX and RC phases of the YMC). We think this criticism applies to all the experiments we have done with TF KO strains in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref> and have been careful not to over-interpret the data to infer that these TFs actually bind to the DNA. Rather, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> showing the switching of the balance of <italic>HMS2</italic> sense and <italic>SUT650</italic> antisense suggest that ablation of some factors coupled to mild nutrient limitation leads to cells where transcription in the <italic>HMS2:SUT650</italic> region is predominantly in sense or antisense orientations. This provides evidence for reciprocal switching between <italic>HMS2</italic> sense and <italic>SUT650</italic> antisense and suggests a signalling input regulates this only at the <italic>HMS2</italic> promoter. We have a number of experiments in the paper to support this, particularly those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. In summary these experiments show that expression of the antisense state (<italic>SUT650</italic> and <italic>BAT2</italic>) is constitutive in the absence of sense transcription, regardless of growth conditions (GLU or GAL). Normally <italic>SUT650</italic> transcription increases on the GLU to GAL shift but this reflects the reduction in <italic>HMS2</italic> sense transcription in GAL. Without sense, SUT650 levels remain high in GLU. Similar arguments apply to <italic>BAT2</italic>. Elimination of sense transcript in the p<italic>GAL1:HMS2</italic> anchor away experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, by addition of Rapamycin to deplete nuclear Gal4 from cells in GAL, restores <italic>BAT2</italic> transcript levels. Thus the primary <italic>BAT2</italic> regulation is transcriptional interference by the sense transcription in GAL (in this experiment only as the inserted <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter is GAL-regulated).</p><p>Our view is that the (semi-) quiescent RC phase in the YMC is likely to be the default and RC genes would be expressed unless a specific growth signal is received. <italic>HMS2</italic> switches on and interferes with the transcription of <italic>SUT650</italic> and <italic>BAT2</italic> as long as the growth signal remains. If there is no growth signal, transcription of <italic>BAT2</italic> and <italic>SUT650</italic> is constitutive, as if cells are in the quiescent state that occurs naturally when nutrients are limited. In fact all the changes that occur when yeast naturally enter stationary phase due to nutrient depletion also occur in RC cells (Shi L, Sutter BM, Ye X and Tu BP: Trehalose is a key determinant of the quiescent metabolic state that fuels cell cycle progression upon return to growth. Mol Biol Cell 21: 1982-90). This does not rule out TFs in the regulation of RC genes, but it does suggest they are not condition-specific. This is supported by our two new genome-wide analyses now included in the manuscript (Table S10). We have examined the nature of the transcription factors’ association with the promoters of RC or OX genes (in GLU) from the Venters and Pugh work (2011) (now included in reference list). They looked at the association of 202 factors at yeast promoters. We used their dataset to ask whether OX and RC genes are enriched for particular factors, as both will be expressed in GLU-grown cells. We show significantly different (p&lt;0.01) ChIP-Chip binding patterns for factors at the two groups of genes. The RC genes are enriched for cohesion, the CCR4/NOT complex, elongator, chromatin and chromatin remodelling factors and four TFs, (Fhl1, Ino4, Ume6 and Skn7). By contrast, OX genes are associated with GTFs, TEFs, TFIID, and the TFs Ifh1 and Rap1. Although “stress” related transcription factors may play a role at the RC genes, these data suggest chromatin-mediated regulation as a central feature for RC genes. Our data support TI-mediated chromatin changes at the <italic>BAT2</italic> promoter.</p><p>So to the question of whether the putative TF binding sites between <italic>HMS2</italic> and <italic>BAT2</italic> regulate <italic>BAT2</italic> expression or more simply, contribute to limiting <italic>HMS2</italic> read-through (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>). As it stands, our data, albeit quite crude, provides no evidence for a role for these factors in activation of either <italic>HMS2</italic> or <italic>SUT650</italic>. We rule out TFs as roadblocks (at least Gal4 for <italic>SUT650</italic> transcribed into the <italic>GAL</italic> promoter) but do see a role for Gln3 (only in minimal medium) in preventing transcript C (<italic>HMS2:BAT2</italic> read through) and a reduction in <italic>SUT650</italic> levels (supporting increased TI at the <italic>HMS2:BAT2</italic> intergenic region). Given the literature supports a role for TFs and promoters in determining transcript stability, another explanation for the effect of loss of Gln3 is that transcript C is stabilised, but there is no change in transcription <italic>per se</italic> and thus no change in the transcript ratios. How RC genes are regulated is clearly complicated and beyond the scope of what we can do for a 2 month revision. We think the suggestion of the referee is excellent but have a number of reservations about this type of approach, especially as some of the putative TF binding sites are within the <italic>HMS2</italic> ORF (similar arguments to the <italic>URA3</italic> question above). Instead we have provided an Anchor-Away experiment to deplete nuclear Gln3 in Galactose (conditions expected to increase <italic>BAT2</italic> and <italic>SUT650</italic> expression). In the same experiment nuclear depletion of Sua7 results in loss of both <italic>BAT2</italic> and <italic>SUT650</italic> transcripts. We find no evidence that Gln3 is required for <italic>BAT2</italic> or <italic>SUT650</italic> expression in these conditions and the Sua7 control suggests this is not simple a result of the <italic>BAT2</italic> transcript being particularly stable in GAL. These data are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
