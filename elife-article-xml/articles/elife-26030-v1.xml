Biology</ext-link>, we published a Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fiehn et al., 2016</xref>), that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper &quot;The common feature of leukemia-associated IDH1 and IDH2 mutations is a neomorphic enzyme activity converting alpha-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate&quot; (Ward et al., 2010). Here, we report the results of those experiments. We found that cells expressing R172K mutant IDH2 did not display isocitrate-dependent NADPH production above vector control levels, in contrast to the increased production observed with wild-type IDH2. Conversely, expression of R172K mutant IDH2 resulted in increased alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent consumption of NADPH compared to wild-type IDH2 or vector control. These results are similar to those reported in the original study (Figure 2; Ward et al., 2010). Further, expression of R172K mutant IDH2 resulted in increased 2HG levels within cells compared to the background levels observed in wild-type IDH2 and vector control, similar to the original study (Figure 3D; Ward et al., 2010). In primary human AML samples, the 2HG levels observed in samples with mutant <italic>IDH1</italic> or <italic>IDH2</italic> status were higher than those observed in samples without an <italic>IDH</italic> mutation, similar to what was observed in the original study (Figure 5C; Ward et al., 2010). Finally, we report meta-analyses for each result.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26030.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26030.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>metascience</kwd><kwd>reproducibility</kwd><kwd>2-HG</kwd><kwd>acute myeloid leukemia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009827</institution-id><institution>Laura and John Arnold Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><institution>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</institution></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Editors' Summary: This Replication Study has reproduced important parts of the original paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> (RP:CB) is a collaboration between the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://centerforopenscience.org/">Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/">Science Exchange</ext-link> that seeks to address concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Errington et al., 2014</xref>). For each of these papers a Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for the replications was peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The present paper is a Replication Study that reports the results of the replication experiments detailed in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fiehn et al., 2016</xref>) for a paper by Ward et al., and uses a number of approaches to compare the outcomes of the original experiments and the replications.</p><p>In 2010, Ward et al. demonstrated that a shared feature of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations identified in gliomas and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the acquisition of a neomorphic enzyme activity. This study built upon a previous study demonstrating cancer-associated <italic>IDH1</italic> mutations resulted in increased production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dang et al., 2009</xref>). Similar to the IDH1 R132 mutation, the cancer-associated IDH2 R172 mutation was demonstrated to be deficient in isocitrate-dependent NADPH production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ward et al., 2010</xref>), while acquiring a gain of function for alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption that resulted in the production of 2HG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ward et al., 2010</xref>). 2HG was also reported to be detectable in AML patient samples and predictive of <italic>IDH</italic> mutational status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ward et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The Registered Report for the paper by Ward et al. described the experiments to be replicated (Figures 2, 3D and 5), and summarized the current evidence for these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fiehn et al., 2016</xref>). Since that publication, additional studies have reported R172 mutant IDH2 exhibiting decreased NADPH production, as well as increased intracellular accumulation of 2HG compared to wild-type IDH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carbonneau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Robinson et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, there have been numerous studies that have observed this with IDH1 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chaturvedi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ward et al., 2013</xref>). There have also been numerous studies reporting the utility of using 2HG as a predictive biomarker for the presence of <italic>IDH</italic> mutations. This includes the detection of 2HG in the peripheral blood of patients with AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiNardo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McGehee et al., 2016</xref>), serum samples from patients with a myeloid sarcoma diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Willekens et al., 2015</xref>), serum samples from patients with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lemonnier et al., 2016</xref>), as well as plasma, urine, and the cerebrospinal fluid in glioma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fathi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalinina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lombardi et al., 2015</xref>). Additional strategies have also been reported to detect 2HG noninvasively in glioma that are based on advanced imaging and spectroscopy approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de la Fuente et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ganji et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Verma et al., 2016</xref>).

This experiment is similar to what was reported in Figure 2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ward et al. (2010)</xref> and described in Protocol 1 in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fiehn et al., 2016</xref>). HEK293T cells, which endogenously express wild-type IDH2, were transfected to ectopically express wild-type or R172 mutant IDH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Extracts from cells expressing wild-type IDH2 displayed an increase in isocitrate-dependent NADPH production (0.49 [n = 7, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.090] change in OD<sub>340</sub> after 30 min); while, extracts from cells expressing R172K mutant IDH2 reached a 0.12 [n = 7, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.069] change in OD<sub>340</sub> over the same period, similar to the levels observed in extracts from vector control transfected cells (0.094 [n = 7, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.055] change in OD<sub>340</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This compares to the original study that reported extracts from wild-type IDH2 expressing cells increased isocitrate-dependent NADPH production (~1.3 change in OD<sub>340</sub> after 30 min), while R172K mutant IDH2 and vector control resulted in an ~0.1 and ~0.02 change in OD<sub>340</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ward et al., 2010</xref>). The same extracts were also tested for alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Expression of R172K mutant IDH2 resulted in a 0.022 [n = 7, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.0077] change in OD<sub>340</sub> after 180 min, while wild-type IDH2 transfected cell extracts had minimal activity (0.0034 [n = 7, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.0019] change in OD<sub>340</sub>), similar to vector control (0.0019 [n = 7, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.0040] change in OD<sub>340</sub>). This compares to the original study that reported an ~0.06 change in OD<sub>340</sub> for R172K mutant IDH2 expression, an ~0.014 change in OD<sub>340</sub> for wild-type IDH2, and an ~0.003 change in OD<sub>340</sub> for vector control after 171 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ward et al., 2010</xref>). The variation in the change in OD<sub>340</sub> observed between the original and replication studies might be due to methodological differences such as the adjustment in the amount of extract and substrate added to each reaction to generate a sufficient signal to noise, as well as other critical experimental and plate reader settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chavez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giehm and Otzen, 2010</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26030.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Isocitrate-dependent NADPH production and alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption of wild-type or R172 mutant IDH2.</title><p>IDH oxidative and reductive activity assays were performed on lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with wild-type or R172K mutant IDH2, or empty vector.

As outlined in the Registered Report, we planned to determine the linear regression slope for each biological repeat and compare vector control to wild-type IDH2 or R172K mutant IDH2 for both assays. To account for these multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was used, making the <italic>a priori</italic> Bonferroni adjusted significance threshold 0.0125. For the isocitrate-dependent NADPH production assay, we performed a test on the slopes from vector control compared to wild-type IDH2, which was statistically significant (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test; <italic>Z</italic> = 3.13, uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.00058, corrected <italic>p</italic>=0.0023). Thus, the null hypothesis that wild-type IDH2 and vector control have similar rates of isocitrate-dependent NADPH production can be rejected, while the test on the slopes from vector control compared to R172K mutant IDH2 was not statistically significant (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test; <italic>Z</italic> = 1.60, uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.13, corrected <italic>p</italic>=0.51). Conversely, for the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption assay, the test on the slopes from vector control compared to wild-type IDH2 was not statistically significant (Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test; <italic>t</italic>(9.42) = 0.29, uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.78, corrected <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.99), while the test on the slopes from vector control compared to R172K mutant IDH2 was statistically significant (Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test; <italic>t</italic>(6.95) = 5.97, uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.00058, corrected <italic>p</italic>=0.0023). To summarize, for this experiment we found results that were in the same direction as the original study and statistically significant where predicted.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Production of 2HG from wild-type or R172K mutant IDH2 transfected cells</title><p>HEK293T cells expressing ectopic wild-type IDH2, R172K mutant IDH2, or vector control were analyzed for accumulation of the metabolite 2HG to test if R172K mutant IDH2 acquired enhanced conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to 2HG. This experiment is similar to what was reported in Figure 3D of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ward et al. (2010)</xref>, and described in Protocol 2 in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fiehn et al., 2016</xref>), with cells analyzed 24 and 48 hr after transfection. Following expression of the ectopic proteins, the accumulation of 2HG, as well as other organic acids including aspartate and glutamate, were assessed by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after MTBSTFA derivatization. Metabolites were identified based on retention times and electron ionization (EI) spectra that matched with derivatized commercial standards. The intracellular levels of 2HG in HEK293T cells expressing R172K mutant IDH2 were determined using the total ion chromatograms (TIC) and found to be over 600 times the levels detected in vector control and wild-type IDH2 expressing cells 48 hr after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). This compares to the original study, which reported an approximately 100 times increase in intracellular 2HG levels in cells expressing R172K mutant IDH2 compared to vector control and wild-type IDH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ward et al., 2010</xref>). The difference in magnitude between the original and replication studies is not due to the observed intracellular 2HG/glutamate levels in R172K mutant IDH2 expressing cells, but rather the lower bounds of detection in the vector control and wild-type IDH2 conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>).

This is comparable to the experiment that was reported in Figure 5 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ward et al. (2010)</xref>, and described in Protocol 3 in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fiehn et al., 2016</xref>), except the mutational status of <italic>IDH1</italic> and <italic>IDH2</italic> were determined prior to conducting the metabolite analysis to have adequate samples for each genetically distinct group. Similar to the original study, all wild-type <italic>IDH</italic> samples displayed a 2HG/glutamate level less than 1%, while samples that had an <italic>IDH1</italic> or <italic>IDH2</italic> mutation had a 2HG/glutamate level greater than 1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Like the metabolite analysis conducted with HEK293T cells, the lower limits of detection in the patient samples without an <italic>IDH</italic> mutation were lower in this replication attempt (mean 2HG/glutamate ratio of 0.001) than what was reported in the original study (mean 2HG/glutamate ratio of ~0.005). However, the average ratio in the samples with <italic>IDH</italic> mutations reported in this replication attempt (mean 2HG/glutamate ratio of 0.20) were lower than what was reported in the original study (mean 2HG/glutamate ratio of ~0.8). Although these ratios do not allow for a true comparison of the absolute 2HG levels, a comparison of the 2HG peaks between samples with or without <italic>IDH</italic> mutations resulted in a similar trend. Of interest, detection of 2HG in wild-type <italic>IDH</italic> samples, albeit at much lower levels than in samples with an <italic>IDH</italic> mutation, has also been reported in other studies measuring 2HG levels in patient samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiNardo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fathi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gross et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lemonnier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Natsumeda et al., 2014</xref>).

Confirmatory statistical analysis was pre-registered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/t873r/">https://osf.io/t873r/</ext-link>) before the experimental work began as outlined in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fiehn et al., 2016</xref>). Proposed analysis of GC-MS data was conducted on TIC data, with additional exploratory analysis performed using the EIC data. Data were checked to ensure assumptions of statistical tests were met. When described in the results, the Bonferroni correction, to account for multiple testings, was applied to the alpha error or the <italic>p</italic>-value. The Bonferroni corrected value was determined by dividing the uncorrected value (.05) by the number of tests performed. Although the Bonferroni method is conservative, it was accounted for in the power calculations to ensure sample size was sufficient.

The concentrations of protein used was increased for the IDH oxidative (0.3 µg to 15 µg) and reductive (3 µg to 30 µg) assays, as well as the amount of substrate (D-(+)-threo-isocitrate: 0.1 mM to 0.4 mM; alpha-ketoglutarate: 0.5 mM to 1 mM). This was due to an inability to detect a signal above the noise with the originally specified protein concentrations, with the need to increase the substrate concentration due to saturation before the end of the time points. Cell lysates were also homogenized instead of sonicated to generate protein extracts. Following this optimization, the same procedure was carried out for the biological repeats reported. For the Western blot, Actin was not used as the additional control since it overlapped with IDH2; Alpha-Tubulin was used instead. For the GC-MS, the Registered Report listed MTBSTFA in the materials, but incorrectly listed MSTFA in the procedure. MTBSTFA was used in this replication attempt, similar to the original study. For the GC-MS run, it was unstated how ramping to 300°C was to be performed, as such 30 °C/min was used. Derivatized extracts were diluted 1:4 to ensure metabolites were in proper concentration range for the GC-MS instrument used since the cell number, derivatization volume, and injection volume were not listed in the original study. Additional materials and instrumentation not listed in the Registered Report, but needed during experimentation are also listed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology would like to thank Courtney Soderberg at the Center for Open Science for assistance with statistical analyses and the following companies for generously donating reagents to the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology; American Type and Tissue Collection (ATCC), Applied Biological Materials, BioLegend, Charles River Laboratories, Corning Incorporated, DDC Medical, EMD Millipore, Harlan Laboratories, LI-COR Biosciences, Mirus Bio, Novus Biologicals, Sigma-Aldrich, and System Biosciences (SBI).</p></ack><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>MRS: West Coast Metabolomics Center, University of California, Davis is a Science Exchange associated lab.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf3"><p>TC: West Coast Metabolomics Center, University of California, Davis is a Science Exchange associated lab.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf4"><p>OF: West Coast Metabolomics Center, University of California, Davis is a Science Exchange associated lab.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf5"><p>RP:CB: EI, NP: Employed by and hold shares in Science Exchange Inc</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf2"><p>The other authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>MRS, Acquisition of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>JH, Acquisition of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>TC, Acquisition of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>KV, Acquisition of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>KLC, RP:CB, Acquisition of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>OF, Acquisition of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Patient samples were obtained from Roswell Park Cancer Institute.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary</p><p>The inherent property of any reproducibility study is that its design is directly related to the original work and set of experiments and cannot extend beyond. This exact situation has arisen with the current reproducibility study, that has been conducted according to the approved plan and results were carefully taken and were adequately statistically treated. It is not surprising that with exception of certain absolute values which did not match to the original publication of Ward et al., the results were reproduced with a high accuracy. The methodical approach is excellent and of the top level, adequate to the task, including derivatization and temperature gradients. Overall, the experiments appear to be performed to a high standard and clearly reproduce the majority of findings from the Ward paper, which is expected based on other independently published studies.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) It should be pointed out that specifically precleaning of samples on a column adds to a straightforward analysis. However, it should be verified, whether such precleaning does not withdraw from the sample any desired species to be tested.</p><p>2) To bring an additional value besides the simple fact of reproducibility, the authors should discuss why certain other studies have found non zero levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate in cells with wild-type IDH2, or in patients plasma or urine. Discussion (or even the Result section) should include comparison of the absolute values and not only ratios towards glutamate (even if this has been a strict condition of the reproducibility study). Authors may comment on conditions under which the activity of wt IDH2 of mutant IDH2 was surveyed. Since 2010 research on the topic has identified numerous factors affecting IDH2 (and IDH1) reactions, namely affecting 2-oxoglutarate as the primary reactant. Distinct contribution of e.g. one-carbon metabolism, state of aerobic glycolysis vs. oxphos and glutaminolysis, etc., are different even in the same immune cells under different conditions. Moreover, enantiomers of 2-hydroxyglutarate have been found to be produced by different enzymes and having distinct metabolism (e.g. dehydrogenases). In the light of these new views, the current reproducibility study represents just a solid beginning in our understanding.</p><p>3) Authors should correct the confused labels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> Title legend NADPH −&gt; NADP+ (which actually stands for consumption whereas figure panel A shows the production) is confused with the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> Title legend.

Correct, sample extraction and clean-up steps may lead to unwanted losses of metabolite levels in samples. For this replication study, we used the exact same methods as the original authors as specified in the Registered Report. The extraction and resin methods are found in other publications by the Thompson group<sup>1,2</sup>. An external validation of the extraction and resin purification methods was not performed as it was outside of the scope of the Replication Study presented here. We have also revised the manuscript to highlight this point.</p><p><italic>2) To bring an additional value besides the simple fact of reproducibility, the authors should discuss why certain other studies have found non zero levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate in cells with wild-type IDH2, or in patients plasma or urine.

We did not perform this replication in a manner to provide accurate quantification of 2HG concentrations in the samples because this would have required standard curves, isotope labeled internal standards and recovery experiments. We therefore present semi-quantified data similar the original paper and as outlined in the replication report. However, we did include comments that raw 2HG peak intensities detected in this study followed the trend of 2HG/glutamate ratios.</p><p>We also expanded the final section to include that additional biological factors affecting IDH reactions have been published since the original study, specifically differential metabolism of 2HG enantiomers. Specifically, it has been reported that normal tissues can produce <italic>S-</italic>2HG under times of hypoxic stress, which is distinct from <italic>R</italic>-2HG, produced from mutations in IDH1/2. For studies that do not chromatographically separate enantiomers (<italic>R-</italic> vs. <italic>S-</italic> 2HG) both species will give the same <italic>m/z</italic> and spectra, and therefore appear as the same species. It is possible the low levels of <italic>S-</italic>2HG are contributing to the non-zero values. Additionally, depending on type of mass spectral analysis and standard of data processing for each group, the lowest values reported can vary.</p><p><italic>3) Authors should correct the confused labels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>:</italic> </p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> Title legend NADPH −&gt; NADP+ (which actually stands for consumption whereas figure panel A shows the production) is confused with the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> Title legend.
