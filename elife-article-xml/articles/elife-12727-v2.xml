over times of milliseconds to months. Although GFP-based GECIs are widely used for in vivo neurophysiology, GECIs with red-shifted excitation and emission spectra have advantages for in vivo imaging because of reduced scattering and absorption in tissue, and a consequent reduction in phototoxicity. However, current red GECIs are inferior to the state-of-the-art GFP-based GCaMP6 indicators for detecting and quantifying neural activity. Here we present improved red GECIs based on mRuby (jRCaMP1a, b) and mApple (jRGECO1a), with sensitivity comparable to GCaMP6. We characterized the performance of the new red GECIs in cultured neurons and in mouse, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, zebrafish and <italic>C. elegans</italic> in vivo. Red GECIs facilitate deep-tissue imaging, dual-color imaging together with GFP-based reporters, and the use of optogenetics in combination with calcium imaging.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12727.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12727.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12727.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons encode information with brief electrical pulses called spikes. Monitoring spikes in large populations of neurons is a powerful method for studying how networks of neurons process information and produce behavior. This activity can be detected using fluorescent protein indicators, or “probes”, which light up when neurons are active.</p><p>The best existing probes produce green fluorescence. However, red fluorescent probes would allow us to see deeper into the brain, and could also be used with green probes to image the activity and interactions of different neuron types simultaneously. However, existing red fluorescent probes are not as good at detecting neural activity as green probes.</p><p>By optimizing two existing red fluorescent proteins, Dana et al. have now produced two new red fluorescent probes, each with different advantages. The new protein indicators detect neural activity with high sensitivity and allow researchers to image previously unseen brain activity.

Activity can be tracked across multiple spatial scales, from synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>) to populations of thousands of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peron et al., 2015</xref>). Neuronal dynamics can be probed over times of milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Connor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015</xref>) to months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Margolis et al., 2012</xref>). Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based GECIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akerboom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohkura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>), such as GCaMP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>), are widely used for imaging neural activity. GCaMP6 indicators exhibit excellent signal-to-noise ratio, allowing detection of single action potentials (APs) in many situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peron et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Applications of GCaMPs and other widely used GECIs are limited by their excitation and emission spectra. GCaMPs are difficult to use in transgenic animals that already express other GFP-based proteins. The blue excitation light used in standard wide-field microscopy can cause photodamage and is highly scattered in tissue. The green GCaMP emission is absorbed by blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Svoboda and Block, 1994</xref>), which reduces the penetration depth of imaging in vertebrates in vivo. In addition, the GCaMP excitation spectrum overlaps with those of light-sensitive ion channels, including channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nagel et al., 2003</xref>), which complicates the simultaneous use of green GECIs and optogenetics. Red-shifted GECIs thus promise three main advantages over GFP-based sensors: increased maximal imaging depth, parallel use of a red GECI with light-sensitive ion channels for all-optical neurophysiology experiments, and reduced photodamage. In addition, together with existing green GECIs, red GECIs allow simultaneous imaging of multiple components of neuronal circuitry.</p><p>Current red GECIs share overall architecture with the GCaMP sensors. They are based on circularly permuted red fluorescent proteins (RFPs), a calcium-binding protein (calmodulin) and a binding peptide (M13 or ckkap). RCaMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akerboom et al., 2013</xref>) is derived from mRuby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kredel et al., 2009</xref>), whereas R-GECO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2014</xref>) and R-CaMP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Inoue et al., 2015</xref>) are derived from mApple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shaner et al., 2008</xref>). R-GECO is more sensitive than RCaMP1. However, mApple-based GECIs, such as R-GECO and R-CaMP2, exhibit photoswitching when illuminated with blue light, causing a transient increase of red fluorescence that complicates their use in optogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akerboom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Here we performed large-scale structure-guided mutagenesis and neuron-based screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wardill et al., 2013</xref>) to develop improved red GECIs, starting with RCaMP1h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akerboom et al., 2013</xref>) and R-GECO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). We report on the mRuby-based jRCaMP1a and jRCaMP1b, and mApple-based jRGECO1a, all of which show several-fold improved sensitivity for detecting neural activity compared to their parent scaffolds.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Protein engineering</title><p>R-GECO1 and RCaMP1 are based on circularly permuted mApple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shaner et al., 2008</xref>) and mRuby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kredel et al., 2009</xref>), respectively, fused to calmodulin (CaM) and the CaM-interacting M13 peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crivici and Ikura, 1995</xref>). In the presence of calcium, CaM undergoes a conformational change and associates with M13 to form a complex proximal to the chromophore inside the RFP β-barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akerboom et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2013</xref>). The conformational change modifies the chromophore environment, modulating solvent access, chromophore pK<sub>a</sub>, absorption, and quantum yield, and altogether results in increased RFP brightness. Structure-guided mutagenesis and screening in a neuron-based assay have been successful in improving GCaMP sensitivity and kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akerboom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>). Here we applied a similar approach to red GECIs.</p><p>We focused mutagenesis on the interfaces between the RFP and CaM, between CaM and M13, and within CaM itself (78/442 and 87/451 amino acid positions were mutated to near saturation in RCaMP1h and R-GECO1, respectively, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary files 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). These regions are structurally homologous to the regions previously explored in the engineering of GCaMP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>). Single-mutation variants (934 RCaMP1h; 689 R-GECO1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary files 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">2</xref>) were tested in an automated neuronal assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wardill et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–d</xref>). Dissociated rat hippocampal neurons in 96-well plates were transfected with plasmids expressing red GECI variants (RCaMP1h variant or R-GECO1 variant). To normalize for expression level, the plasmid also expressed GFP that was localized to the nucleus. R-GECO1 and RCaMP1h were both expressed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus (data not shown). To sense calcium selectively in the cytoplasm we added a nuclear export sequence (NES) to the N-termini of R-GECO1, RCaMP1h, and all their variants. As expected, addition of the NES restricted expression to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). R-CaMP2 was excluded from the nucleus without the NES.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12727.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mutagenesis and screening of jRCaMP1 and jRGECO1 in dissociated neurons.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) RCaMP1h and R-GECO1 structure and mutations introduced in jRCaMP1a, jRCaMP1b, and jRGECO1a.

Green fluorescence was visible with 900 nm excitation, but not with 1040 nm excitation, suggesting that red GECIs partition into at least two species. The green fluorescence was distributed unevenly across the cytoplasm and does not report calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3a–b</xref>). Indeed, jRGECO1a neurons with larger fractional fluorescence intensity at 900 nm showed lower response amplitudes.

Current state-of-the-art green GECIs, such as GCaMP6, have sufficient sensitivity to detect single action potentials in diverse cell types and even detect activity of single synapses. They can be targeted to specific cell types and subcellular compartments. Red GECIs can potentially be used in a similar manner with additional advantages. For example, they suffer less from tissue scattering and absorption. In addition, rhodopsin-based optogenetic tools have substantial absorption in the blue region of the wavelength spectrum, which overlaps with the excitation spectrum of GFP. Red GECIs can be imaged without exciting ChR2. We developed red GECIs that rival best-of-class green GECIs in terms of sensitivity for detecting neural activity, thereby closing a significant performance gap between red and green GECIs.</p><p>The new mApple-based jRGECO1a and the mRuby-based jRCaMP1a and jRCaMP1b are all improved several-fold compared to their parent indicators. jRGECO1a exhibits similar performance to the GCaMP6 indicators. jRCaMP1a and jRCaMP1b are less sensitive, but do not show photoswitching after illumination with blue light, making them suitable for experiments that combine calcium imaging and optogenetics. jRCaMP1a and jRCaMP1b are also slightly redder than jRGECO1a. This improved performance will enable a wide range of applications for red GECIs, for example, dual color imaging, where green and red GECIs are used in parallel to study the relation between two components of a neural circuit.</p><p>Red GECIs will be useful for all-optical neurophysiology experiments, especially when there is spatial overlap between the stimulated and imaged parts of the neural circuit. The large spectral separation between ChR2 activation spectrum and the red GECI excitation spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akerboom et al., 2013</xref>) is preferable in situations when using a red-shifted light sensitive ion channel and a green GECI produces cross-talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rickgauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Packer et al., 2015</xref>). The two-photon absorption spectra of red GECIs peak around 1040 nm, which overlaps with the output of cost-effective and powerful fiber lasers.</p><p>Red GECIs still face challenges. First, all tested red GECIs show smaller (3- to 4-fold less) maximal fluorescence changes upon calcium binding than the GCaMP6 indicators. This limits the overall dynamic range of red GECIs. Second, the relatively low absorption cross-section of the red GECIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) further reduces the achievable signal-to-noise ratio for in vivo imaging. Third, red GECIs show complex intracellular behavior, such as accumulation in lysosomes (jRGECO1a) with long-term expression in the mouse brain. The presence of green fluorescence in all tested GECIs suggests the existence of multiple protein species, some of which do not produce functional signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>). These issues seem to be related to the red fluorescent protein component of the sensor (see, for example, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, engineering red GECIs to produce less non-productive fluorescence might require replacing or re-engineering the RFP itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moore et al., 2012</xref>), a direction that we plan to pursue in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All surgical and experimental procedures were in accordance with protocols approved by the HHMI Janelia Research Campus Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Institutional Biosafety Committee.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Neuronal culture screen</title><p>GCaMP indicators are naturally excluded from the nucleus, presumably due to a cryptic nuclear exclusion sequence (NES) motif.

Absorption spectra were taken on a UV/VIS spectrometer (Lambda 35, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Fluorescence emission and excitation spectra were measured on a LS-55 fluorimeter (Perkin-Elmer) with 5 nm slits, and excitation/emission wavelengths of 555 nm/600 nm.

Dim solutions (<italic>e.g.</italic> jRGECO1a or GCaMP6s in EGTA buffer) were not measurable on the Quantaurus, so relative quantum yields were determined from measured absorption in the UV/VIS spectrometer and integrated fluorescence measured in the fluorimeter, in comparison to the reference fluorophores mCherry (measured absolute QY of 0.22) or fluorescein (QY =0.93 in pH 9.5 borate buffer) for either red or green GECIs.

Peak brightness is the experimentally determined maximum rate of fluorescence per molecule for a given focusing geometry and is a measure of the brightness and photostability of a fluorophore under 2-photon excitation. To determine peak brightness, 20–100 nM solutions of protein in calcium buffer were illuminated at either 1070 nm or 1140 nm at increasing laser power, where at each power setting the mean fluorescence rate F and the mean number of fluorophores N in the laser beam volume were determined by FCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mütze et al., 2012</xref>). The 2-photon peak brightness was then found from the maximum value of the quantity F/N as the laser power was increased.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Two-photon bleaching measurements</title><p>Two-photon bleaching measurements of green and red GECIs were acquired from isolated aqueous droplets of protein using a resonant-galvo scanning 2-photon microscope (MPM-200, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ). The microscope was equipped with a 40x 1.15 NA water immersion objective (Nikon), a primary dichroic (680–1600 nm longpass filter, Thorlabs), and a secondary dichroic (FF562-Di03, Semrock) with green (530/43, Semrock) and red (605/70, Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT) filters each followed by GaAsP PMTs (H7422PA-40, Hamamatsu). Laser excitation was at 1000 nm or 1070 nm for red GECIs, and 940nm for GCaMP6s. To completely bleach the protein droplets (thickness, 5 μm) repetitive z-stacks were taken. Beam scan area was 160 μm x 160 μm, and the scan rate was 8 frames/sec. Light intensity was kept constant across measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The objective was a 16x 0.8 NA water immersion lens (Nikon, Japan). Images were acquired using ScanImage 5 (vidriotechnologies.com) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pologruto et al., 2003</xref>). For L2/3, L4, and L5 imaging, functional images (512x512 pixels, 250x250 μm<sup>2</sup>) were collected at 15 Hz. Typical laser powers were 15–60, 30–75, and 50–100 mW at the front aperture of the objective for L2/3, L4, and L5 imaging, respectively. For L6 imaging, functional images (512x512 pixels, 165x165 μm<sup>2</sup> or 125x125 μm<sup>2</sup>) were collected at 5 Hz.

Each stimulus trial consisted of a 4 s blank period (uniform gray at mean luminance) followed by a 4 s drifting sinusoidal grating (0.05 cycles per degree, 1 Hz temporal frequency). Eight drifting directions were used, separated by 45° , and 5 trials were recorded for each direction, giving a total of 40 stimulus trials per recording session (320 s recording time). The gratings were presented with an LCD monitor (30 x 40 cm), placed 25 cm in front of the center of the right eye of the mouse. The monitor subtended an angle of ± 38° horizontally and ± 31° vertically around the eye of the mouse. For experiments with cell-attached recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), pipette access required the use of a smaller LCD monitor (12 x 16 cm) placed 10 cm in front of the right eye. During simultaneous imaging and electrophysiology, the optimal grating stimulus was repeatedly played, but the contrast of the stimulus grating was adjusted online to record variable spike rates. To minimize stimulus contamination in the red detection channel, a green colored plexiglass filter (500–555 nm FWHM) was placed in front of the mouse eye.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analysis of V1 functional imaging</title><p>Data from mice expressing GECIs for 16 to 64 days were used for the following analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–f</xref>).

Neuropil correction was applied only to cells with baseline fluorescence (F<sub>0</sub>) signal stronger than the surrounding neuropil signal by more than 3%; other cells (approximately 15–20%) were excluded from the analysis because F<sub>0</sub> could not be reliably estimated. After neuropil correction, the ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> of each trial was calculated as (F-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>0</sub> was averaged over a 1 s period immediately before the start of grating stimulation. Visually responsive neurons were defined as cells with ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> &gt;0.05 during at least one stimulus period, and using ANOVA across blank and eight direction periods (p&lt;0.01).</p><p>We calculated the decay time of fluorescence after the end of the preferred stimulus. For each cell we averaged responses from five trials; baseline fluorescence and standard deviation were calculated from 1 s before the start of the stimulus. Only cells with fluorescence response peaks with &gt;4 times the standard deviation of the baseline during the last 1 s of the stimulus were analyzed. The time required for each trace to reach half of its peak value (baseline fluorescence subtracted) was calculated by linear interpolation. The same cells were used for plotting the average response showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>.

First, the preferred orientation (θ<sub>pref</sub>) of the cell was determined as the stimulus evoking the greatest response. The orientation tuning curve was constructed by measuring the mean ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, averaged over the stimulus period, for each orientation. We then fitted the tuning curve with the sum of two Gaussians centered on θ<sub>pref</sub> and θ<sub>pref</sub>+π/2, both with width σ, amplitudes A1 and A2, and a constant baseline B. The OSI was defined as OSI =(R<sub>pref</sub> -R<sub>ortho</sub>)/(R<sub>pref</sub>+R<sub>ortho</sub>), where R<sub>pref</sub> and R<sub>ortho</sub> are the response amplitudes at the preferred (θpref) and the orthogonal orientation (θ<sub>pref</sub>+π/2) respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Simultaneous electrophysiology and functional imaging in V1</title><p>In vivo cell-attached recordings were performed using glass pipettes (~7–12 MΩ) filled with (in mM): 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgSO4, and 0.1 Alexa Fluor 488; pH 7.4). Signals were amplified using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), filtered at 5 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz. Spikes were recorded using current clamp mode. The frame trigger pulses of ScanImage 5 were also recorded and used offline to synchronize individual frames to electrophysiological recordings. After establishment of a low-resistance seal (15–50 MΩ), the stimulus orientation was quickly optimized for individual neurons using recorded spikes. The optimal grating stimulus was repeated with variable contrast to acquire a range of spiking rates.</p><p>Images (512x512 pixels, typically 40x40 μm<sup>2</sup>) were acquired at 30 Hz and 15 Hz for jRGECO1a and jRCaMP1a, respectively. Ring-shaped ROIs were placed over the cytosolic regions of the cells, and neuropil contamination was subtracted. To quantify the fidelity of single AP detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), we identified single AP events isolated from other APs by &gt;1 s, and 2 APs within a time window of 100 and 150 ms for jRGECO1a and jRCaMP1a respectively, isolated from other APs by &gt;1 s. Noise traces were taken from periods without APs. F<sub>0</sub> values were calculated as the average of 10 frames before the first AP, and peak ΔF/ F<sub>0</sub> was calculated as the maximum of the ΔF/ F<sub>0</sub> trace after the first spike firing, or the maximal ΔF/ F<sub>0</sub> noise value for the noise traces. For d-prime calculation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, response templates for various APs were calculated by averaging response traces. Unit vectors were calculated from the templates by subtracting means and normalizing the vectors. The measured n-AP responses were projected on the unit vectors, where n indicates the number of APs in a time bin, as well as noise traces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>).

Time bins were chosen to reflect the accumulation of calcium signal for large number of APs (longer for the slower jRCaMP1a/b, shorter for the faster jRGECO1a). Half rise and decay times were calculated from 2 AP responses. Only isolated responses (without APs &gt; 2 s before the recorded spikes) were used.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes the development and testing of improved red-shifted genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs). For optimization of the parental R-CaMP and R-GECO the team at Janelia Farm employed the same strategy that previously had been successfully used for a new generation of G-CaMPs, which are now widely used. It consists of structure-guided mutagenesis of the indicator proteins, followed by a neuronal screening assay using field stimulation to elicit action potential firing. Screening was followed by a careful and detailed characterization of the new probes in several model organisms in vivo.</p><p>The authors convincingly demonstrate that especially the variant jRGECO1a shows greatly improved performance compared to previous red GECIs in many preparations, rivaling state-of-the-art green GECIs. The mRuby-based jRCaMP1a, which could be used for combined optogenetic photostimulation and imaging experiments, shows promise, but still has very slow decay kinetics and a limited dynamic range. It should be noted that some of the bugs of the parental probes that make their use difficult at times have not been fixed: jRGECOs still show photoswitching upon blue light illumination, and all sensors still partition into green and red species, with the green species not being calcium sensitive, buffering calcium without contributing signal (complicating co-use with GCaMPs).</p><p>Overall this is a very thorough manuscript, providing extensive data about the new red GECI variants in several preparations. These new calcium indicators and the information provided about them will be of great value and interest to the field. There are some issues which still need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The green GCaMP6 variants can begin to show adverse effects on neuronal health after long-term expression of several weeks. It is therefore important to assess the degree to which this is a problem for the red GECIs, with and without NES (nuclear export sequences). For example, as in supplementary Figure 7 from Chen et al. 2013 (same group): Do the signals change? Do cell nuclei tend to fill after a long time? Please provide a comparison of biophysical properties and in vivo response properties such as spontaneous activity levels, response reliability and calcium transient shape (orientation selectivity is not a good indicator for the health of a neuron!) after short- and longer-term expression of the red GECIs (e.g. after 3 and 10 weeks).</p><p>2) The authors claim that these new red GECIs have &quot;sensitivity comparable to GCaMP6&quot;. They also mention in what ways they are different. It would be nice if some of these key comparisons were included in main figures. (a) It would be wise to move <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel c to a main figure. (b) It would also be helpful to show how the brightness and bleaching compare. To address that: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> – please plot similar measurements from GCaMP6 variants (at least 6s… 6f would be nice to have as well). Finally, (c) could the authors please add statistical information to statements describing increased/decreased performance of specific GECIs in comparison to others, for instance in the last few sentences of the second paragraph of subsection “Red protein calcium indicators in mouse V1”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C, E, F</xref>.</p><p>3) The authors provide data on photobleaching of the purified proteins in aqueous droplets. It is not clear how this translates to the protein expressed in live tissue. Could the authors please provide information on the extent of photobleaching under realistic in vivo imaging conditions?</p><p>4) When estimating spike detection from calcium signals in simultaneous imaging and cell-attached recordings, the authors use a small field-of-view of 40 μm x 40 μm. This is a much smaller field-of-view than those normally used in imaging experiments (250 μm x 250 μm in this study). At the larger zoom the imaged cells will contain many more pixels over which the response is averaged, signal-to-noise will therefore be larger and spike-related transients will be easier to detect. It would be much more useful for the imaging community to perform such &quot;ground-truth&quot; experiments with the experimental settings generally used in the actual imaging experiments, otherwise information such as detection probability of single spikes has only limited applicability. Ideally the authors should provide new electrophysiological ground-truth calibrations to address this issue; but in light of the fact that such experiments are difficult, the authors should at the very least acknowledge the limitations of the way they have performed the calibration. If it is not possible to provide new data, we also suggest some new analysis to address this issue: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> suggests that peak dF/F is a linear function of the number of spikes, but it actually depends on frequency as well. The authors currently obscure this by using time bins (which aren't even held constant across the two reporters). We suggest doing this analysis and adding it to the report; i.e. simply show that the max dF/F varies significantly with the frequency of the spike train (this is true for GCaMP6 at least). Moreover, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> should have the individual data points indicated as well. This is a case in which the SD really matters more than the SEM, and thus seeing the spread of the actual data can be informative.</p><p>5) Appearance of the green species: Is it present right after onset of expression or a consequence of long term expression? If so, it would be useful to see a time course of green species expression profiles in vivo after viral gene delivery. This could help users to find a suitable time window that offers best conditions for their experiments.</p><p>6) How do the authors explain the differing performance of the sensors in the various model organisms? G-CaMP6s appears to clearly outperform jRGECO1 in layer 2/3 neurons of mouse visual cortex, whereas at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ preparation, jRGECO1 overall appears to do better than GCaMP6s. Given that the NMJ prep has essentially no tissue covering the boutons the brighter green GCaMP6s should have an easy game while in layer 2/3 mouse cortex the higher penetration of red light might favor jRGECO1. Why is this not the case?</p><p>7) The authors write, &quot;GECI responses are larger and faster in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus (unpublished data).&quot; Although the &quot;faster&quot; part is consistent with the findings in other labs, it has been observed by others that the signal can sometimes actually be larger in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. Thus, it would be helpful if the authors could share some of this unpublished data in the supplement.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12727.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) The green GCaMP6 variants can begin to show adverse effects on neuronal health after long-term expression of several weeks.

We compared four different parameters: proportion of stimulus responsive cells, proportion of orientation-tuned cells, peak response amplitudes, and response decay times. Previous studies (Tian et al., Nature Methods, 2009, and Chen et al., Nature, 2013) showed that GCaMP accumulation in the nucleus is correlated with changes in these parameters. For the red GECIs there were no nuclear-filled cells under any conditions due to the effects of NES in the red GECI sequences. All parameters were stable as a function of time (with the possible exception of jRCaMP1b).</p><p><italic>2) The authors claim that these new red GECIs have &quot;sensitivity comparable to GCaMP6&quot;.

This is a case in which the SD really matters more than the SEM, and thus seeing the spread of the actual data can be informative.</italic>We performed the cell-attached recording and fluorescence imaging under favorable conditions in order to get the optimal detection sensitivity for the GECIs (similar to Chen et al., 2013). By subsampling the number of pixels per cell, more realistic experimental conditions can be simulated. The data we acquired will be deposited for free use by other laboratories to achieve that goal (at crcns.org, similar to our GCaMP5 and GCaMP6 data).</p><p>A) We added a note to the text that these experiments were done under favorable conditions.</p><p>B) The frequency analysis suggested by the reviewer requires a larger database. Data would have to be divided into groups according to the number of spikes in a time bin <italic>and</italic> the burst frequency. We and others in this field have grouped the responses according to the number of spikes in a time bin. Results of the suggested analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><p>C) The time bins we used reflect the different GECI kinetics (longer for slower GECIs). Performing the same analysis with a constant time bin (i.e. 250ms like in Chen et al., 2013) does not change the mean response much, but increases the variability, and reduces the detection sensitivity. We added a clarification to the text.</p><p>D) We modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> in the revised manuscript) to show the data distribution.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12727.032</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12727.032">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12727.032</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-12727-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>5) Appearance of the green species: Is it present right after onset of expression or a consequence of long term expression? If so, it would be useful to see a time course of green species expression profiles in vivo after viral gene delivery. This could help users to find a suitable time window that offers best conditions for their experiments.</italic>We now show that jRGECO1a (but not jRCaMP1a/b) accumulates in lysosomes and that this phenomenon is more pronounced during long-term expression in vivo compared to cultured neurons. We also show that this accumulation contributes to lower response amplitudes (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). In addition we added a more detailed characterization of the greenish emission and the change of the jRGECO1a greenish component with time, as the reviewers suggested (Figure 6—figure supplement 3).</p><p><italic>6) How do the authors explain the differing performance of the sensors in the various model organisms? G-CaMP6s appears to clearly outperform jRGECO1 in layer 2/3 neurons of mouse visual cortex, whereas at the Drosophila NMJ preparation, jRGECO1 overall appears to do better than GCaMP6s. Given that the NMJ prep has essentially no tissue covering the boutons the brighter green GCaMP6s should have an easy game while in layer 2/3 mouse cortex the higher penetration of red light might favor jRGECO1. Why is this not the case?</italic> We agree that the red sensors responses in the mouse cortex are lower than what is expected based on the cultured cells assay results. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ data is similar to the cultured neuron data, and the mouse V1 data appears to be the exception here. The sources of the reduced V1 performance were studied (see response above) and are now presented in Figure 6—figure supplements 1-3, and mentioned in the Discussion. Multiple mechanisms might contribute, including non-productive fluorescence in lysosomes and non-productive green species.</p><p><italic>7) The authors write, &quot;GECI responses are larger and faster in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus (unpublished data).&quot; Although the &quot;faster&quot; part is consistent with the findings in other labs, it has been observed by others that the signal can sometimes actually be larger in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. Thus, it would be helpful if the authors could share some of this unpublished data in the supplement.</italic></p><p>In comparisons using red GECIs with and without an NES we consistently find smaller responses without an NES (where sensor is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus). See for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 2</xref>. The data show that responses are smaller and slower in the nucleus.
