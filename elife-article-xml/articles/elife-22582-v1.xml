which led us to propose a model for its role in chromosome compaction during meiosis. As a component of the SC lateral element, SYCP3 has a critical role in defining the specific chromosome architecture required for correct meiotic progression. In the model, the reported compaction of chromosomal DNA caused by SYCP3 would result from its ability to bridge distant sites on a DNA molecule with the DNA-binding domains located at each end of its strut-like structure. Here, we describe a single-molecule assay based on optical tweezers, fluorescence microscopy and microfluidics that, in combination with bulk biochemical data, provides direct visual evidence for our proposed mechanism of SYCP3-mediated chromosome organisation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22582.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22582.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>SYCP3</kwd><kwd>Synaptonemal complex</kwd><kwd>Meiosis</kwd><kwd>Protein-DNA interactions</kwd><kwd>Single-molecule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DTP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Syrjänen</surname><given-names>Johanna L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104158/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>Owen R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>654148</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peterman</surname><given-names>Erwin J G</given-names></name><name><surname>Wuite</surname><given-names>Gijs J L</given-names></name><name><surname>Pellegrini</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N000161/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pellegrini</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104641/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pellegrini</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Syrjänen, Pellegrini, &amp; Davies, 2014), it is shown that SYCP3 contributes to the architecture of meiotic chromosomes through local bridging interactions that result in large-scale compaction of the chromosome axis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a dynamic proteinaceous ultra-structure that mediates the synapsis of homologous chromosomes pairs during meiotic prophase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cahoon and Hawley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fraune et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang and Wang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zickler and Kleckner, 2015</xref>). Morphologically, the SC is composed of three parts: lateral elements, transverse filaments and a central element. Lateral elements are protein scaffolds that extend along the entire length of each chromosome axis. They become linked together by transverse filaments, which connect the chromosomes in a homologous pair to the midline central element, to induce chromosome synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schücker et al., 2015</xref>). The tripartite SC ultra-structure provides an essential three-dimensional scaffold for meiotic progression and its absence or defective formation can lead to failure of meiotic progression and infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolcun-Filas et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vries et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hamer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schramm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yuan et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The lateral element is the first part of the synaptonemal complex to assemble. In most organisms, its formation coincides with the controlled induction of double-strand DNA breaks and subsequent homology searches that bring homologous chromosomes into alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baudat et al., 2013</xref>). It is at this step that SYCP2 and SYCP3, the major protein components of the lateral element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lammers et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Offenberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schalk et al., 1998</xref>), assemble on the chromosome axis, in a manner dependent on each other and on the presence of meiosis-specific cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukuda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Llano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pelttari et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Winters et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Correct SYCP3 function is crucial for fertility. Male mice lacking SYCP3 are infertile as their germ cells undergo apoptosis due to failure in meiotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yuan et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, females are sub-fertile, with increased aneuploidy leading to fetal deaths during gestation. SYCP3 is regarded as an important architectural component of the lateral element, and its disruption in mice has consequences for the morphology and structural integrity of the meiotic chromosome: in SYCP3-deficient mice, the chromosome axis is twice the length of that in wild-type mice and cohesin disassembles prematurely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kouznetsova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yuan et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The large-scale architecture of the meiotic chromosome consists of a regular array of DNA loops that emanate from a chromosome axis consisting of conjoined sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zickler and Kleckner, 1999</xref>). Sister chromatid cohesion is enforced at the loop base by meiotic ring-like cohesin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rankin, 2015</xref>). In addition to SC components, other factors such as meiotic cohesins, condensins and HORMAD proteins localise to the chromosome axis and contribute to its organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Novak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wood et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zickler and Kleckner, 2015</xref>). Thus, it is likely that SYCP3’s role is to provide local DNA compaction to modulate the existing axis-loop structure of the meiotic chromosome, in the specific manner required for efficient recombination between homologues.</p><p>Crystallographic analysis shows that SYCP3 adopts a highly elongated tetrameric assembly of antiparallel α-helices, with flexible termini protruding from the helical core. The N-terminal sequences located at each end of the SYCP3 structure bind double-stranded (ds) DNA, suggesting that SYCP3 can act as a 20 nm-long physical strut to hold distinct regions of DNA together. In addition, SYCP3 can polymerise into regular supra-structures resembling the SC lateral element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Syrjänen et al., 2014</xref>), in a self-assembly reaction that requires both N- and C-terminal motifs. These findings provide the basis for a possible explanation of SYCP3’s role in shaping the architecture of meiotic chromosomes, whereby concurrent DNA bridging and self-association by SYCP3 would explain the observed SYCP3-dependent DNA compaction that is required for full SC assembly and meiotic progression.</p><p>To further assess this potential mechanism of SYCP3 function, we developed a single-molecule assay based on optical tweezers and fluorescence microscopy in a microfluidics flow cell. The results of the assay, in combination with bulk biochemical data, provide direct visual evidence for our proposed model of SYCP3-mediated chromosome compaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The crystal structure of SYCP3 showed a tetrameric assembly with N-terminal DNA-binding domains located at both ends of the central helical core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To study the mechanism of DNA binding separately from higher-order assembly and alleviate the limited solubility of the full-length protein, we used a version of SYCP3 missing the last six amino acids, SYCP3<sub>1-230</sub>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Syrjänen et al., 2014</xref>).

To provide further evidence of multivalent DNA binding, we showed that SYCP3 can bridge between a fluorescently-labelled dsDNA and a distinct biotin-labelled dsDNA immobilised on streptavidin-coated beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>To gain mechanistic insight into the mode and dynamics of DNA binding by SYCP3, we took a single-molecule approach using an experimental setup that has been successfully used for the study of protein-DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brouwer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Candelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heller et al., 2014a</xref>). In this system, the biotinylated ends of a bacteriophage λ DNA molecule are tethered between two streptavidin-coated polystyrene beads that are controlled by focused laser beams acting as optical tweezers. A unique advantage of the use of optical tweezers is the high degree of control over the conformation and tension of the DNA. The experiment is performed in a multi-channel laminar flow cell that allows tethering of DNA to optically-trapped beads and moving the tethered DNA to parallel laminar-flow lanes containing, for example, the fluorescently-labelled components to be analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Beam-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy is then used to image the labelled DNA-bound proteins.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22582.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Optical tweezers can be used to study the binding of SYCP3 to double-stranded DNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The focused trapping laser beams hold two streptavidin-coated polystyrene beads in place, while the λ DNA is tethered between the beads (right). A four-channel laminar flow cell on a mobile platform was used to perform the single-molecule experiments. The streptavidin-coated polystyrene beads were trapped with the lasers in Channel 1 and biotinylated λ DNA was then captured in Channel 2, by tethering its ends to two beads. The flow cell was subsequently moved to Channel 4, to allow fluorescently-labelled SYCP3 to bind λ DNA and, after an incubation time of 30 s, the beads were moved into Channel 3 for visualisation and analysis of DNA binding (left).

The engineered cysteine was linked to the fluorescent dye Alexa555 using maleimide chemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), yielding one fluorescent label per helical chain, or four fluorophores per SYCP3 tetramer. Mass spectrometry confirmed that all SYCP3 molecules were labelled with Alexa555, and that the majority of SYCP3 molecules had one label per helical chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Binding of fluorescently-labelled SYCP3 to λ DNA in the single-molecule setup was readily observed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Kymographs, acquired from repeated confocal line-scans along the DNA, revealed binding and one-dimensional diffusive behaviour of SYCP3 on dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As a control, a construct lacking the N-terminal DNA-binding domain, SYCP3<sub>91-230</sub>, did not interact with λ DNA. In 'DNA compaction' experiments, we used the optical tweezers to control the end-to-end distance of the DNA and test the DNA-binding and bridging behaviour of SYCP3 on stretched versus conformationally relaxed DNA. We first incubated the DNA in the protein channel for 30 s, returning subsequently the DNA into the buffer channel, to prevent binding of additional SYCP3 molecules, where it was held in an extended conformation at a force of 5 pN and an end-to-end distance near to 16 µm. Next, we relaxed the conformation of the DNA by moving the beads closer together at constant speed of 0.6 µm/s, reducing the end-to-end distance to 8 µm. The beads were held at reduced distance for a period of 5.5 s, after which the trap lasers were moved apart, extending the DNA molecule again.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22582.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>A single-molecule DNA-compaction assay shows two modes of SYCP3 binding to dsDNA.</title><p>Two representative kymographs are shown.

In the initial phase of the compaction experiment, when λ DNA is in an extended conformation, the majority of SYCP3 molecules interacted with DNA in a diffusive manner, displaying a one-dimensional sliding motion along the DNA molecule. Mean-squared displacement analysis of diffusive trajectories revealed a 1D-diffusion constant of 0.16 ± 0.05 µm<sup>2</sup>/s (<italic>N</italic> = 8, see Materials and methods section ‘1D-Diffusion coefficient analysis’). Intriguingly, when the DNA was temporarily relaxed and then pulled taut again, a drastic alteration in SYCP3’s binding behaviour was observed: the majority of diffusing SYCP3 molecules co-localised in clusters that remained static and stable over time.</p><p>These findings indicate that SYCP3 has two different modes of binding to DNA. We hypothesise that the diffusive binding mode reflects the interaction with the extended λ DNA of a single DNA-binding domain at one end of the rigid SYCP3 strut, allowing SYCP3 to slide along the DNA molecule (first-binding mode). Upon relaxation of the DNA substrate, DNA-bound SYCP3 would engage concurrently a distinct DNA site with its other DNA-binding domain, in a bridging interaction leading to formation of a DNA loop (second binding-mode). This transient juxtaposition of distinct DNA segments would facilitate bivalent DNA interactions of neighbouring SYCP3 molecules, stabilising the DNA loop and leading to the formation of a static cluster of DNA-bound SYCP3 molecules. Consistent with the presence of SYCP3-dependent loops in the DNA that might resist extension, higher forces were required to extend λ DNA after the compaction step relative to naked DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In our experiments, SYCP3-dependent DNA bridges did not exhibit extensive and distinct bond-rupture events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), as previously observed for DNA-bridging proteins H-NS and Alba1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dame et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Laurens et al., 2012</xref>). The lack of pronounced rupture events suggests a comparatively high stability of SYCP3-compacted DNA, although further quantitative analysis would require quadruple optical trapping experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heller et al., 2016</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22582.005</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Characterisation and analysis of DNA-bound SYCP3 in the DNA-compaction assay.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Force-distance curves measured for SYCP3-free λ DNA (blue curve), and during re-extension of SYCP3-compacted λ DNA (purple curve).

To obtain a quantitative estimate of the number of SYCP3 tetramers in a cluster, we measured the fluorescence of distinct DNA-bound SYCP3 traces after compaction, by estimating the signal of a single Alexa555 fluorophore and assuming that each SYCP3 molecule bound to DNA as a tetrameric species (see Materials and methods, section ‘SYCP3 cluster-size determination’). After correction for bleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), we determined that the SYCP3 cluster size was distributed around a mean value of 67 tetramers per cluster, with individual clusters showing a range of 20 to 160 tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>These figures highlight SYCP3’s propensity to self-assemble in large DNA-bound aggregates.

We have shown biochemically that SYCP3 is a multivalent DNA-binding protein and have developed a single-molecule assay to provide experimental evidence consistent with a mechanism of DNA compaction based on non-sequence specific bridging interaction by individual SYCP3 tetramers.</p><p>The observed tendency of SYCP3 to accumulate in discrete clusters on dsDNA might form the basis of its ability to compact chromosomal DNA in meiosis. How would transient bridging events account for the formation of stable SYCP3 clusters on dsDNA? Cooperative protein-protein interactions between DNA-bound SYCP3 tetramers might play a role, even in the recombinant SYCP3 protein used for the experiment, which lacked 6 C-terminal residues that are important for self-assembly in the absence of DNA.</p><p>Of note, formation of a transient DNA loop by a single bridging event would by itself facilitate further bridging interactions of neighbouring SYCP3 tetramers, even in the absence of cooperative protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Such a mechanism of DNA compaction, driven by the reduced entropic penalty of successive DNA-bridging events, has been predicted by molecular dynamics studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brackley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>). Apparently cooperative DNA-binding behavior of DNA-bridging proteins has been attributed to the induced proximity of distinct protein-bound DNA sites in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dame et al., 2006</xref>). The observed footprint size of SYCP3, corresponding approximately to one helical turn of DNA, is similar to that of the DNA-bridging protein H-NS that was found to bridge two parallel DNA molecules in register with the helical repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dame et al., 2006</xref>). A preferential DNA-binding orientation correlated to the DNA helix is further supported by the observed value of the 1D-diffusion constant of SYCP3, which is in good agreement with rotation-coupled 1D-sliding along the DNA helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blainey et al., 2009</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22582.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model for the mechanism of λ-DNA compaction by SYCP3, based on its observed behaviour in the single-particle experiments.</title><p>According to the model, SYCP3 has a diffusive DNA-binding mode, likely mediated by DNA interaction at one end of its strut-like structure, and a DNA-bridging mode, where SYCP3 engages two distinct sites on the DNA with its two DNA-binding domains.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mark Williams and Micah McCauley (together contributed a single review report).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript builds upon a previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper from the same group that provided a structural description of the synaptonemal complex protein SYCP3. In the current manuscript, the authors combine single-molecule optical tweezers, fluorescence spectroscopy and microfluidics to study DNA binding by SYCP3. The ends of this tetrameric protein are shown to bind to and diffuse along DNA. This manuscript shows that multimers of this protein stabilize DNA loops, and suggests that this is done by bridging the sides of DNA loops and stabilizing them. The key quantitative findings of this paper reveal that the binding site size of a single tetramer is 3 nm, and that between 20 and 90 tetramers are found to stabilize each loop.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This work is certainly of general interest, both the controls and experiments are well done, and the paper is clearly written. It should be noted that one reviewer raised serious concerns about the physiological relevance of the observations. However, we feel that the demonstration of DNA looping that was hypothesized in the 2014 paper is a sufficient novel advance to be considered for publication as a Research Advance. Before a decision can be made, a number of key shortcomings should be addressed in a revised manuscript (listed below), however. In particular, it will be necessary to provide additional experimental evidence that verifies the loop formation and growth model presented in the manuscript.</p><p>As noted by the authors, previous work (Yuan et al. 2002) showed that SYCP3-/- mice have chromosome axes that are roughly 2-fold longer than normal. This is inconsistent with the idea that SYCP3 is a major loop-forming protein – if it were, there would be essentially no axis-loop structure in a SYCP3 mutant, and the chromosomes would be much, much longer. Additionally, a large and growing body of data from cytological, biochemical, and chromosome conformation capture approaches indicates that cohesins bind the base of loops in interphase, mitotic, and meiotic chromosomes. Emerging models also suggest that cohesins actively form the loops, perhaps through an ATP-dependent extrusion activity. SYCP3 is not an ATPase, and simple multivalent DNA binding activity is not sufficient to explain the linear, regular array of loops observed in meiotic chromosomes. In some metazoans, it seems likely that SYCP3 interacts with cohesin-bound DNAs to create regular spacing between the bases of adjacent loops. Alternatively, SYCP3 may impact axis assembly by modulating interactions between cohesins and DNA. The authors should provide more discussion to argue that the evidence in this work implicates SYCP3 as the critical loop-forming protein of the axis, or indeed as a loop-forming protein. The same evidence (that SYCP3 has the ability to simultaneously bind 2 DNA molecules) could be used to argue that the protein mediates synapsis between homologous chromosomes, but it clearly is not in the right place to do this.</p><p>This optical trap approach offers great potential to reveal novel and quantitative insights into the organization/condensation of meiotic chromosomes. Optical tweezers might allow the authors to measure relevant biophysical parameters of DNA compaction by SYCP3 such as binding dynamics, typical cluster size or the critical force, as demonstrated by numerous previous studies (e.g. RT Dame, MC Noom, GJL Wuite. Nature, 2006 and many other studies cited in Heller et al. 2014). However, the authors fail to take advantage of their experimental design. In particular, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows one (!) force-extension curve for free and SYCP3-bound DNA, with a comment in the text that &quot;several&quot; such measurements were made. It is not clear from the manuscript how these (this?) force extension curves were acquired. If SYCP3 behaves as suggested by the authors, it should be possible to show stepwise extension of SYCP3-bound DNA using a constant-force regime in the optical trap. The authors should show such stepwise extension data or explain why their experiments did not visualize such behavior.</p><p>Other important points to address:</p><p>The Methods section refers to Heller et al. 2014, which is a review article that does not include experimental details. Important parameters that should be described in detail include:</p><p>1) What is the extension rate in their experiments (this is important, since different extension rates will result in different rupture forces)?</p><p>2) How are DNA molecules attached to the beads?</p><p>3) Do extension curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> show the same DNA molecule? Since they seem to be relying on absolute lengths for their analysis, are lengths of different DNA molecules identical?</p><p>Based on the claim that most SYCP3 molecules are conjugated to a single dye molecule, it should be possible to demonstrate the number of molecules in each &quot;monovalent&quot; binding complex by photobleaching (the fluorescence should bleach in 4 equal, discrete steps). The authors should explain whether the fluorescence data can be used to arrive at conclusions related to stoichiometry.</p><p>The footprint calculation and comparison to theory should be more transparent since this was only done for three DNA molecules. What was the length change for each molecule and how many loops did each have? What was the error in the tetramers/cluster of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>? The uncertainty shown is written as &quot;sdom&quot;, which we assume means standard deviation of the mean. This is easily confused with standard deviation, so it is preferable to use &quot;sem&quot; for standard error of the mean. If this is what was used, was N taken to be the number of DNA molecules used or the number of clusters?</p><p>The authors should better justify their statement that, &quot;SYCP3 is regarded as the main architectural component of the lateral element?&quot; I think many investigators would dispute this idea, and would argue instead that cohesins are the most broadly conserved and thus most essential components.</p><p>The authors' model posits that multiple protein complexes merge to form a cluster instead of forming their own mini-bridges. For merging to occur, multiple protein complexes must diffuse to merge. The kymograph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> during force reduction suggests that indeed diffusion and merging is happening but no quantification is given.</p><p>The beads were held at a short (loop forming) extension of 8 micrometers for 5.5 seconds. If this time were varied, the authors could conclusively determine whether SYCP3 traps a DNA loop of fixed size, which then does not change in time, or if the loop grows continuously with further protein migration along the DNA (as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> would seem to indicate).</p><p>No dissociation of SYCP3 is assumed during the cluster-size determination with photobleaching correction, though this dissociation rate is unknown. Was any effort made to justify this assumption, and to be certain that bleaching was the only reason for the decrease in intensity? One way to resolve this would be to turn the excitation laser off for the duration of an experiment after compaction, and then turn it on again.</p><p>In their previous paper, the authors showed that the protein aggregates into large assemblies in the absence of DNA. It is not clear to me how they use the observation of clusters on DNA and interpret these as associated with looping. How do they exclude cluster formation on DNA that is independent on looping? And if aggregation in the absence of DNA occurs, why do they not observe it in the experiment shown in the top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> does not seem to support the conclusion in that it does not compare the DNA/protein state before and after a low-tension incubation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22582.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>This work is certainly of general interest, both the controls and experiments are well done, and the paper is clearly written.

SYCP3 is not an ATPase, and simple multivalent DNA binding activity is not sufficient to explain the linear, regular array of loops observed in meiotic chromosomes. In some metazoans, it seems likely that SYCP3 interacts with cohesin-bound DNAs to create regular spacing between the bases of adjacent loops. Alternatively, SYCP3 may impact axis assembly by modulating interactions between cohesins and DNA. The authors should provide more discussion to argue that the evidence in this work implicates SYCP3 as the critical loop-forming protein of the axis, or indeed as a loop-forming protein. The same evidence (that SYCP3 has the ability to simultaneously bind 2 DNA molecules) could be used to argue that the protein mediates synapsis between homologous chromosomes, but it clearly is not in the right place to do this.</italic> </p><p>We agree that SYCP3’s principal role is probably to provide local compaction of existing loop structures in the meiotic chromosome, rather than being the main driver of large-scale chromosome organization. Indeed, formation of an initial loose looping structure by cohesins and condensins may favour binding and assembly of SYCP3, and thus looping in vitromight be more challenging to achieve. Our findings and our model are fully compatible with this interpretation of SYCP3 function. We have re-written the relevant section of the Introduction (fourth paragraph) to clarify this point.</p><p><italic>This optical trap approach offers great potential to reveal novel and quantitative insights into the organization/condensation of meiotic chromosomes. Optical tweezers might allow the authors to measure relevant biophysical parameters of DNA compaction by SYCP3 such as binding dynamics, typical cluster size or the critical force, as demonstrated by numerous previous studies (e.g. RT Dame, MC Noom, GJL Wuite. Nature, 2006 and many other studies cited in Heller et al. 2014). However, the authors fail to take advantage of their experimental design. In particular, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows one (!) force-extension curve for free and SYCP3-bound DNA, with a comment in the text that &quot;several&quot; such measurements were made. It is not clear from the manuscript how these (this?) force extension curves were acquired. If SYCP3 behaves as suggested by the authors, it should be possible to show stepwise extension of SYCP3-bound DNA using a constant-force regime in the optical trap. The authors should show such stepwise extension data or explain why their experiments did not visualize such behavior.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that optical tweezers can quantify many biophysical parameters. However, the full range of quantifiable parameters is not experimentally accessible in our current setup, nor is their knowledge essential to support our main conclusion. Here we would like to reiterate that the aim of our study is to provide direct evidence of DNA compaction by SYCP3, rather than investigating in detail the architecture and stability of the resulting protein-DNA structures. Our force- fluorescence data show clearly that upon providing slack to the DNA in presence of SYCP3, the DNA is compacted mechanically in direct correlation to the formation of stable SYCP3 clusters on the DNA.</p><p>The reviewers make reference to our previously published experiments (Dame et al., Nature2006), where breakdown of protein-mediated DNA bridges is probed using a specialized instrument that is capable of quadruple optical trapping. Quadruple optical tweezers allow independent manipulation of two DNA molecules, which provides control over the molecular architecture of the DNA bridges. This control is essential to interpret and quantify bridge rupture correctly: in our current dual optical trapping assay (not a quadruple optical trap), there is insufficient control over the molecular architecture, such that forces can be applied over a single terminal bridge in an ‘unzipping’ geometry, or over multiple bridges in a ‘shearing’ geometry, or in a combination of these geometries. This lack of control makes detailed mechanistic interpretation of bridge rupture/rearrangement data unfeasible.</p><p>We nevertheless inspected our data for signatures of such bond rupture/bridge rearrangements, and found that the compacted DNA structure appears relatively stable, even at forces approaching the DNA overstretching force of ~65 pN. These observations suggest that SYCP3-DNA bridges appear more stable than previously measured H-NS and Alba1 F60A bridges (Dame et al. Nature 2006 &amp; Laurens et al. Nat Comm2012). We have now added the evidence of long-term stability of the SYCP3-DNA interaction at ~30 pN and ~60 pN to the revised manuscript as a figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and have included a comment in the main text (–Results, seventh paragraph).</p><p><italic>Other important points to address:</italic> </p><p><italic>The Methods section refers to Heller et al. 2014, which is a review article that does not include experimental details. Important parameters that should be described in detail include:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) What is the extension rate in their experiments (this is important, since different extension rates will result in different rupture forces)?</italic> </p><p><italic>2) How are DNA molecules attached to the beads?</italic> </p><p><italic>3) Do extension curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> show the same DNA molecule? Since they seem to be relying on absolute lengths for their analysis, are lengths of different DNA molecules identical?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the missing information and the erroneous reference. We have revised the relevant section of the Methods and have updated the reference that describes the details of the experimental procedure, as Heller et al. Nat Meth2013. In answer to the specific questions:</p><p>1) The extension rate in the DNA-compaction assay was 0.6 µm/s. This is now mentioned in the text (Results, fifth paragraph).</p><p>2) The linear, double-stranded λ DNA molecule is attached to two streptavidin-coated beads by means of biotin labels incorporated at each end of the DNA molecule.</p><p>3) The extension curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> refer to the same DNA molecule. All DNA molecules used in the experiments are bacteriophage λ dsDNA, of identical length.</p><p><italic>Based on the claim that most SYCP3 molecules are conjugated to a single dye molecule, it should be possible to demonstrate the number of molecules in each &quot;monovalent&quot; binding complex by photobleaching (the fluorescence should bleach in 4 equal, discrete steps). The authors should explain whether the fluorescence data can be used to arrive at conclusions related to stoichiometry.</italic> </p><p>We have indeed observed stepwise bleaching in our fluorescence traces (see Materials and methods, section ‘SYCP3 cluster-size determination’, and bleaching-rate analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The analysis of bleaching steps was performed on static clusters of multiple SYCP3 tetramers, not on individual tetramers, as our experimental conditions did not allow us to resolve individual DNA-bound tetramers during or right after incubation, due to the high protein density on the DNA. Only after compaction and/or photobleaching we could resolve 1D-diffusive traces that we attribute to individual tetramers. We have added such as trace as an example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. The fluorescence intensity of these diffusive traces was 5 +/- 2 photons (N=8), which is consistent with 6.0 photons/tetramer as estimated based on 1.5 photons/dye (see Materials and methods section ‘SYCP3 cluster-size determination’) and a stoichiometry of 4 dyes/tetramer. Photobleaching explains a slightly lower apparent stoichiometry.</p><p><italic>The footprint calculation and comparison to theory should be more transparent since this was only done for three DNA molecules. What was the length change for each molecule and how many loops did each have? What was the error in the tetramers/cluster of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>? The uncertainty shown is written as &quot;sdom&quot;, which we assume means standard deviation of the mean. This is easily confused with standard deviation, so it is preferable to use &quot;sem&quot; for standard error of the mean. If this is what was used, was N taken to be the number of DNA molecules used or the number of clusters?</italic> </p><p>We have added the requested information relative to length change and loop numbers per DNA molecule in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), and have revised the description of the calculation in the relevant section of the Methods, to make it easier to follow. The error in footprint length is reported as standard error of the mean, as correctly interpreted by the reviewer; we have now changed ‘sdom’ to ‘sem’, as requested. N was taken as the number of DNA molecules analysed in the experiment.</p><p><italic>The authors should better justify their statement that, &quot;SYCP3 is regarded as the main architectural component of the lateral element?&quot; I think many investigators would dispute this idea, and would argue instead that cohesins are the most broadly conserved and thus most essential components.</italic> </p><p>We have now modified the relevant section of the Introduction (–fourth paragraph), to provide a more accurate description of SYCP3’s likely role in the organization of the meiotic chromosome structure.</p><p><italic>The authors' model posits that multiple protein complexes merge to form a cluster instead of forming their own mini-bridges. For merging to occur, multiple protein complexes must diffuse to merge. The kymograph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> during force reduction suggests that indeed diffusion and merging is happening but no quantification is given.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that, after putting enough slack onto the DNA molecule, protein complexes can diffuse and merge into a cluster. Since stochastic nucleation and subsequent growth of a cluster causes an increasing fraction of the DNA to be sequestered into protein-stabilized loops, the process terminates when either all of the initial slack in the DNA is removed, or when all DNA-bound SYCP3 ends up in static clusters. The time scale of this termination process is similar to that of the DNA retraction time, in the seconds range.</p><p>We have now quantified the 1D-diffusion constant of the mobile SYCP3 molecules (see Materials and methods “1D-Diffusion coefficient analysis” section for details). The 1D-diffusion constant was estimated to be 0.16 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, which is consistent with rotation-coupled diffusion along the helical pitch of the DNA. We now mention the 1D-diffusion constant in the text (Results, sixth paragraph) and comment on it in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>The beads were held at a short (loop forming) extension of 8 micrometers for 5.5 seconds. If this time were varied, the authors could conclusively determine whether SYCP3 traps a DNA loop of fixed size, which then does not change in time, or if the loop grows continuously with further protein migration along the DNA (as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> would seem to indicate).</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows that, upon DNA relaxation, SYCP3 concentrates in static clusters and is depleted from flanking DNA regions. This indicates that the protein supply feeding cluster growth has been exhausted and so longer relaxation times would not change cluster size. Under these conditions, we measure SYCP3 clusters of different size. Accordingly, the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows SYCP3-bound DNA loops of different size, to highlight the stochastic nature of the process of loop nucleation and growth.</p><p>Rather than increasing the relaxation time, it might be possible to determine whether an upper limit for the size of SYCP3 clusters exists by repeating the experiment with higher concentrations of SYCP3. However, we believe that this experiment would have only limited physiological relevance, as in the cell nucleus the extent of SYCP3-dependent DNA compaction will be influenced by important protein determinants of chromosome structure such as meiotic cohesin (see for instance, Novak et al., 2008).</p><p><italic>No dissociation of SYCP3 is assumed during the cluster-size determination with photobleaching correction, though this dissociation rate is unknown. Was any effort made to justify this assumption, and to be certain that bleaching was the only reason for the decrease in intensity? One way to resolve this would be to turn the excitation laser off for the duration of an experiment after compaction, and then turn it on again.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the referee and have added an analysis of the bleaching rate to the supplementary information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), in which we varied the excitation laser intensity while monitoring the bleaching rate. Indeed, this analysis confirms that the intensity changes under the experimental conditions is dominated by bleaching.</p><p><italic>In their previous paper, the authors showed that the protein aggregates into large assemblies in the absence of DNA. It is not clear to me how they use the observation of clusters on DNA and interpret these as associated with looping. How do they exclude cluster formation on DNA that is independent on looping? And if aggregation in the absence of DNA occurs, why do they not observe it in the experiment shown in the top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>?</italic> </p><p>For our experiments, we used a version of SYCP3 that lacks the last six amino acids (described in the first paragraph of the Results section). This SYCP3 construct retains DNA binding but has lost the ability of DNA-independent aggregation (Syrjanen et al., 2014; Bauer et al., 2007). We are therefore confident that the cluster formation that we observe in our experiments is dependent on DNA binding.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> does not seem to support the conclusion in that it does not compare the DNA/protein state before and after a low-tension incubation.</italic> </p><p>We thank the referee for pointing out that our explanation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> was not sufficiently clear. The FD curves of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> were, in fact, acquired before and after a low-tension incubation: the blue curve was acquired on ‘bare’ DNA, in absence of SYCP3, and it represents the ‘before’ situation; the purple curve, on the other hand, was acquired after incubation with SYCP3, and corresponds to the re- extension curve after the low-tension incubation. We have now clarified this in the figure caption and removed the cartoons in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> to avoid confusion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
