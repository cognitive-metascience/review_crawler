Using inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 2 knockout (<italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) mice to specifically disturb somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in astrocytes, we showed that developmental elimination of the ventral posteromedial nucleus relay synapse was impaired.

As the brain develops, many synapses turn out to be redundant. Just like trees in a garden that need to be trimmed, these redundant synapses must be pruned in order to form the right pattern of connections between different neurons. Brain cells called astrocytes play a key role in synaptic pruning, but it is unclear exactly how astrocytes coordinate this process.</p><p>One important way in which astrocytes communicate with neurons is through a process called calcium signaling, in which the movement of calcium ions into or out of the cell sets off a cascade of activity inside the astrocytes. Yang et al. have now studied developing mice that lacked a gene that is essential for calcium signaling in astrocytes. Two weeks after they were born, these mice still had redundant synapses that are normally lost after birth. However, injecting the developing brain with a substance called ATP prevented this defect and allowed synapses to be correctly pruned. This is likely to be because astrocytes also use ATP to communicate with neurons, and ATP compensated for the missing calcium signaling.</p><p>The experiments also uncovered the specific structure – called the P2Y1 receptor – on the outer surface of a neuron that ATP latches on to in order to help remove synapses. Further work is now needed to reveal how activating the P2Y1 receptor coordinates synaptic removal.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

inappropriate synapses during development is essential for the formation of neuronal circuits and proper brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katz and Shatz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paolicelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>). Disruption of this process is likely involved in many neurological diseases such as schizophrenia and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoffman and McGlashan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). Although activity-dependent competition among different inputs has been suggested as the key mechanisms for synapse elimination, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain unclear. In addition to the retino-geniculate and climbing fiber-Purkinje cell pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Regehr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kano and Hashimoto, 2009</xref>), the principal trigeminal nucleus-ventral posteriormedial thalamic nucleus (Pr5-VPm) connection in mice has proven to be an excellent model in which to investigate developmental synapse elimination in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arsenault and Zhang, 2006</xref>). VPm neurons receive a contra-lateral Pr5 projection and relay the information to the somatosensory cortex. At an early age like postnatal day 7 (P7), each VPm neuron receives an average of 7–8 Pr5 inputs. Most of these inputs are eliminated in an activity-dependent manner during development and the majority of VPm neurons only receive a single Pr5 input by P16.</p><p>Over the past decade, emerging evidence has suggested that astrocytes not only provide structural and metabolic support to neighboring neurons, but also participate in synapse formation, synaptic transmission, and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henneberger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). Structurally, astrocytes contact 50–90% of the synapses in a given brain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Genoud et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oliet et al., 2001</xref>) and form one component of the “tripartite synapse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araque et al., 1999</xref>). Functionally, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) elevation in neighboring astrocytes can be induced by activation of the synapse, triggering the release of gliotransmitters such as ATP and D-serine that modulate synaptic efficacy and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fields and Burnstock, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henneberger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 2003</xref>). It is generally accepted that astrocytes release gliotransmitters in a G-protein-coupled receptor/ inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (GPCR/IP3R)-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. Studies in both acute slice preparations and in vivo have shown that, in response to neuronal activity, GPCR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in astrocytes depends on the activation of IP3R2, a subunit that is solely expressed in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fiacco and McCarthy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Navarrete et al., 2012</xref>). Controversially, studies also indicated that IP3R2-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in astrocytes may not be involved in the acute modulation of neuronal activity and synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agulhon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Petravicz et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, there are other Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways in astrocytes which do not involve IP3R2. A recent study showed that although the somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling was eliminated, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in processes was intact in the astrocyes of <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Srinivasan et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, IP3-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase is only the major source for somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in astrocytes. Recent studies have shown that astrocytes could mediate synapse elimination in a neuronal activity-dependent manner through two distinct pathways: either directly by phagocytosis through the MEGF10 and MERTK pathways, or by activating the classical complement cascade <italic>via</italic> astrocyte-derived transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bialas and Stevens, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we hypothesized that IP3R2-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in astrocytes might be involved in regulating developmental synapse elimination. The results from studies in the cerebellum suggested that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeableα-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in Bergmann glia are required for the developmental elimination of climbing fiber-Purkinje cell inputs, which provides a clue that astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling might be involved in synapse elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iino et al., 2001</xref>). Unfortunately, it is difficult to draw an exclusive conclusion since Bergmann glia are morphologically distinct from astrocytes and detect synaptic activity at cerebellar synapses primarily though activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs as well as GPCRs.</p><p>By combining electrophysiological, pharmacological, and immunohistochemical methods, we discovered that selectively disturbing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signaling in astrocytes using <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice impaired the developmental elimination of VPm relay synapses. Intracerebroventricular injection of ATP, but not adenosine, rescued the impaired synapse elimination in these mice. We further found that developmental synapse elimination was also impaired in <italic>P2ry1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice and could not be rescued by ATP. Last, the deficit of synapse elimination in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice was rescued by intracerebroventricular injection a selective P2Y1 receptors agonist MRS-2365. Overall, we provide direct evidence to show that astrocytes contribute to synapse elimination in an IP3R2-dependent manner through activation of purinergic signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synapse elimination is disrupted at the VPm relay synapse in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/− </sup></italic>mice at P16-17</title><p>To determine the role of astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in synapse elimination, we need an effective way to selectively disrupt the function of astrocytes. In mammals, astrocytes rely on IP3R2-mediated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling to perform their functions. A large literature suggested that IP3R2 is the only subtype astrocytes expressed and is not expressed in microglia and neurons in the cerebrum. Thus <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice could be used to study the specific roles of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in astrocytes for synapse function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hertle and Yeckel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sharp et al., 1999</xref>). In line with previous studies, we also found that IP3R2 was co-expressed with GFAP, but not bio-markers for microglia or neurons in the brain areas we tested including hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in acute brain slices, we next found that the ATP -induced somatic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation in the astrocytes but not in the neurons of <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b,c</xref>) was abolished in both of the VPm and hippocampus, confirming that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling was selectively impaired in astrocytes in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. Next, we examined developmental synapse elimination by whole-cell patch recording in acute brain slices. Interestingly, we found a marked difference in the mean number of inputs received by each VPm neuron between WT and <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice at P16-18 (WT = 1.2 ± 0.02, n = 26 cells from 4 mice; <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> = 2.1 ± 0.10, n = 40 cells from 6 mice; p&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). In WT mice, only 27% (7 of 26) of VPm relay neurons received multiple Pr5 inputs at this age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,c</xref>), whereas most of these neurons (72%, 32 of 42) in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice received multiple Pr5 inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). VPm relay neurons receive two major excitatory inputs: from layer VI cortex and the other from the Pr5 that express vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) and VGluT2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graziano et al., 2008</xref>). Each Pr5 input forms multiple synaptic contacts with VPm neurons and thus, the number of inputs indicates how many axonal projections while the VGluT2 staining represents number of synaptic terminals. The pruning of somatic innervations by Pr5 inputs in the VPm is always related to the elimination of VPm relay synapses, as showed by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takeuchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). To further verify that there were more synapses in KO mice, we immunostained for VGluT2. Consistent with the electrophysiological results, we observed more VGluT2 puncta around the soma as well as the total numbers of puncta in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,f</xref>), indicating that there were more synapses in KO mice. In addition, we found that neuron number did not significantly change in the VPm between WT and <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice at this age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results strongly suggested that astrocytic IP3R2-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is required for synapse elimination.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15043.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Developmental synapse elimination was impaired in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice at P16-17.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold>) Left panels, sample traces of membrane current in response to stimuli over a range of intensities in VPm neurons at P16-17 in WT (<bold>a</bold>) and <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<bold>b</bold>).

Among these gliotransmitters, we were particularly interested in ATP and assumed that it might play a role in synapse elimination for the following reasons: 1) the basal ATP levels are reduced in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2013</xref>); 2) astrocytes release ATP in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lalo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>); and 3) ATP regulates synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). We then tested whether the basal ATP level in the VPm changes during development at the time when exploratory activity increases in WT mice. A significant increase in the basal ATP level occurred at P18 compared with that at P7 in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). This developmental up-regulation of the basal ATP level was absent in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). In addition, we found that the basal ATP level was comparable between WT and <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice at P7 but was significantly reduced in KO mice at P18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). These results suggested that, during development, the basal ATP level increases in WT but not in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. Next, we tested whether the deficit of synapse elimination in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice could be rescued by compensatory ATP. To achieve this goal, we implanted a cannula in the left lateral ventricular of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) and found that intracerebroventricular injection of ATP from P11 to P15 rescued the synapse elimination deficit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e,i,l,m</xref>). At P16-17, unlike aCSF-treated mice, the majority of VPm neurons in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice that had received ATP (50 µM) treatment was innervated by a single Pr5 input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3l</xref>). Immunostaining for VGluT2 also revealed that the number of synapses significantly decreased in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice with ATP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3p,q</xref>). These results indicate that ATP treatment is sufficient to rescue synapse elimination deficit in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice and the removal of redundant synapses is independent of IP3R2-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Cannula implantation caused injury may induce inflammatory responses of astrocytes and microglia differentially between aCSF and ATP treated-<italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, thereby affected the rescue effects.

In the CNS, ATP could activate purinegic signaling through P2X or P2Y receptors to modulate synapse function. Particularly, P2Y1 receptors have been shown participated in ATP-induced heterosynaptic long-term depression (LTD) in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), and LTD has been suggested correlated to synapse elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastrikova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wiegert and Oertner, 2013</xref>). To test the possibility of involvement of P2Y1 receptors in synapse elimination at the VPm, we first examined the expression pattern of P2Y1 receptors and found that unlike in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhu and Kimelberg, 2004</xref>), they were only expressed in neurons in the VPm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next found that ATP-induced somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in astrocytes was impaired in hippocampus, but not in the VPm in <italic>P2ry1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), further indicated that the expression pattern of P2Y1 receptors might be different in hippocampus when compared with that in the VPm. In line with immunostaining results, we also found that ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in VPm neurons of <italic>P2ry1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggested that even in the VPm, the expression pattern of P2Y1 may have specificity among different cell types. Next, we determined whether synapse elimination was disrupted in <italic>P2ry1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. Compared to WT mice, the majority of VPm neurons in <italic>P2ry1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice received multiple Pr5 inputs at P16 (WT = 30%, 13 of 33 cells; <italic>P2ry1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> = 72%, 34 of 47 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Consistent with the electrophysiological results, we confirmed the synapse elimination deficit in <italic>P2ry1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice with immunostaining for VGluT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). There was more VGluT2 staining around the somata of VPm neurons in <italic>P2ry1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4i,j</xref>). Therefore, synapse elimination was also impaired in <italic>P2ry1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. To address the abnormal of synaptic connectivity in <italic>P2ry1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice at P16 was actually due to developmental failure, we tested Pr5-VPm synapses at P7. We found that the connectivity of Pr5-VPm pathway was comparable between WT and <italic>P2ry1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition, the synapse elimination deficit in these mice was not rescued by intracerebroventricular injection of ATP from P11 to P15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c, f, g, h</xref>). These results suggested that synapse elimination promoted by ATP may depend on P2Y1 receptors.

Specifically, we demonstrated that (1) developmental synapse elimination in the VPm was impaired in the <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice; (2) intracerebroventricular injection of ATP and ATPγS, but not adenosine, from P11 to P15, rescued the synapse elimination deficit in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice; (3) <italic>P2ry1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice also showed impaired synapse elimination and this could not be rescued by ATP; and (4) deficient of synapse elimination in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice was rescued by intracerebroventricular injection of MRS-2365, a selective P2Y1 receptors agonist, from P11 to P15.</p><p>In the CNS, neurons make redundant synaptic connections early in development, and most of inappropriate synapses are eliminated later to form precise neural circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lichtman and Colman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo and O'Leary, 2005</xref>). This process is believed to largely rely on neuronal activity, while the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Recent studies have shown that astrocytes show a transient [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation, which depends on the GPCR/IP3R pathway, in response to neuronal activity and subsequently release gliotransmitters to modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araque et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, astrocytic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation is a consequence of neuronal activity. Based on these reasons, we proposed that activity-dependent competition for synapse elimination involves both postsynaptic neuronal activation and astrocytic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>I</sub> elevation. A large literature has shown that GPCR/IP3R-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is critical for astrocytes to release gliotransmitters and modulate synaptic transmission. Conversely, recent studies from McCarthy’s laboratory have suggested that IP3R2-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in astrocytes may not be involved in the acute modulation of neuronal activity and synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fiacco et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Petravicz et al., 2008</xref>). Two studies have shown that there were still some Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations occurring in astrocytes process, although the somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling was eliminated in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanemaru et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Srinivasan et al., 2015</xref>). These results suggested that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling was not totally removed in these mutants. In line with previous studies, we found that the lack of ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase in astrocytes soma in these mutants. Our studies strongly suggested that astrocytic IP3R2-dependent somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is required for developmental synapse elimination. Considering the dynamic and complexity, the astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the process and the soma may play different roles in gliotransmitter release and regulating neuronal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Volterra et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that synapse elimination was only partly impaired in the <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>P2ry1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. Although we found both anatomical and electrophysiological evidence that these mice had significant deficits in developmental synapse elimination, some degree of synaptic pruning still occurred during P7 to P16, suggesting that there are multiple mechanisms for controlling synapse elimination. Indeed, synaptic pruning in the VPm relay synapses occurs at several developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang and Zhang, 2008</xref>). Before P10, pruning is insensitive to whisker deprivation, but then later, the elimination of redundant inputs is largely dependent on somatosensory experience. In the mutants, such as <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup> </italic>mice, the nature of sensory information transmitted from whisker to the VPm might be altered, thus causes the defects of synapse elimination. We found surprisingly, the connectivity between Pr5 and VPm in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice undergone ATP and ATPγS treatments restored to WT mice level. These results suggested that no matter sensory information had been changed or not, ATP was sufficient to rescue the impairment of synapse elimination in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. However, the rescue effect of ATP may occur at a site between the whisker and VPm, and this possibility could not be ruled out by our study.</p><p>It is about P13 that mice open their eyes and start to use their vibrissae to explore the environment. Accompanying this behavioral change, we found a significant enhancement of the basal ATP level in the VPm of WT mice between P7 and P18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). However, the basal ATP level failed to be up-regulated in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice during development. In line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2013</xref>), we also found a decreased basal ATP level in the brain of <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. ATP can be released by both neurons and glia. The decreased ATP level in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice was most likely due to astrocytes since IP3R2 was not expressed in neurons and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation did not change in neurons. Although ATP itself is a signaling molecule by activating P2X or P2Y receptors, the degraded form adenosine is also a ligand for adenosine receptors and causes synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu and Saggau, 1994</xref>). The fact that adenosine injection through P11-15 did not rescue the synapse elimination deficit in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice excludes the possibility of a role for adenosine in synapse elimination. In addition to being a signal molecule, ATP is also energy currency in the brain and the phenotype of <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice could be a result of global metabolic stress. This possibility is very unlikely because either ATPγS, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog or one selective P2Y1 receptors agonist MRS-2365 could rescue the deficit of synapse elimination in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. In our study, we concluded that ATP was not acting as an energy supply to play a role in synapse elimination.</p><p>Although both of <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>P2ry1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice showed deficits of developmental elimination of relay synapses at the VPm, it is not necessary that they are mechanistically related. That is, the phenotypes in these two mutants are two independent events. The results of P2Y1 receptors agonist injection rescued the deficient of synapse elimination in <italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice provided a direct linkage between IP3R2-dependent releasing of ATP and its downstream purinergic pathway. Unlike IP3R2, studies have shown that P2Y1 receptors are widely expressed in astrocytes, microglia and neurons. Thus, loss function of P2Y1 receptors in all three types of cell may contribute to the phenomenon of impaired synapse elimination in <italic>P2ry1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. First, P2Y1 receptors have been shown to be expressed by astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pascual et al., 2012</xref>), therefore the finding that <italic>P2ry1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice has impaired synapse elimination could be due to a failure to increase calcium levels in astrocytes in response to ATP. This possibility could be excluded by the results of astrocytes in the VPm of <italic>P2ry1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice responded to ATP with a similar increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> when compared to cells in the WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, we found that P2Y1 receptors were not expressed by astrocytes in the VPm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>), but abundantly expressed in the hippocampus astrocytes (data not shown). Second, P2Y1 receptors have been reported to be expressed in microglia and ATP activates microglia. The phenotype of synapse elimination defects in <italic>P2ry1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice could be explained by injection of ATP activates microglia-mediated synapse elimination. At present, there were some mRNA and functional clues showing that microglia expressed P2Y1 receptors, whereas the protein evidence was very few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fields and Burnstock, 2006</xref>). In our study, we did not find any P2Y1 protein expression on microglia in both of hippocampus (data not shown) and the VPm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Therefore, the protein level of P2Y1 receptors expressed on microglia in the VPm, if any, was very low. However, we still could not totally exclude the possibility that microglia may contribute to synapse elimination through P2Y1 receptors. Further studies by using cell-type specific knockout mice are needed to answer this question. Last, ATP-mediates synapse elimination may occur through activation of neuronal P2Y1 receptors. This speculation is most likely due to P2Y1 receptors are abundantly expressed in VPm neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). In addition, our Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data showing that ATP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in VPm neurons was significantly decreased in <italic>P2ry1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Our findings strongly suggest that ATP may activate neuronal P2Y1 receptors to promote synapse elimination. This hypothesis is supported by a previous study showing that activation of neuronal P2Y1 receptors is required for astrocytes derived ATP mediated LTD in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Due to a close linkage proposed between LTD and synapse elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wiegert and Oertner, 2013</xref>), one possible model is that ATP and downstream purinergic signaling could recognize unwanted synapses. Certainly, further studies are needed to elucidate the whole picture of pathways that how activation of purinergic signal mediating synapse elimination.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>IP3R2-knockout (<italic>Itpr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) mice were a kind gift from Dr. Ju Chen (University of California, San Diego) and maintained as a heterozygous line.

To quantify the average VGluT2 puncta per neuron, the density of VGluT2 puncta was analyzed using the Analyze Particles command in ImageJ (version 1.43). Thalamic VPm neuron number was counted manually using the Cell Counter plugin of ImageJ. The puncta/neuron is then determined by all the puncta number divided by all neuron number in a given image.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Neuron density quantification in the VPm</title><p>For quantification of neuron density, 9 sections from 3 different animals (3 sections per animal) were used. The VPm was acquired by using a 10×objective (NA 0.4). Thalamic VPm neuron numbers were counted manually by using the Cell Counter plugin of Image J. To calculate the density of neurons, only the area of the VPm was measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cannula implantation and pharmacological experiments</title><p>Mice at P10 were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and placed into a stereotactic apparatus. A 30-gauge stainless steel infusion cannula (RWD life science) was implanted unilaterally in the left lateral ventricle (-0.4 mm from bregma, 0.9 mm lateral from midline, and 2.5 mm vertical from the cortical surface) and was fixed to the skull with dental cement. After one day recovery, drugs including aCSF, ATP (5 or 50 µM, 2 µl), adenosine (50 µM, 2 µl), ATPγS (50 µM, 2 µl), MRS-2365 (20 µM, 2 µl) were delivered to lateral ventricle slowly by using a microsyringe pump which was connected to the infusion cannula by a PE20 tube. Injections were given twice per day at the interval of 12 hr from P11 to P15. After experiments, the location of the cannula was verified histologically and discarded the animal which did not target to lateral ventricle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Inflammatory response quantification</title><p>To analysis the inflammatory responses of astrocytes and microglia, fixed sections were immunolabeled for GFAP and Iba1. For quantification the maximum distance of reactive cells to the injury site, three images were collected from each animal on a confocal microscopy by using 1 µm z-step. Astrocytes in the cortex express a low level of GFAP in normal situation. They were very sensitive to injury as indicated by an increased GFAP expression. Therefore, the distance of GFAP positive cells to injury site was measured as the distance of inflammatory responses. For quantification of reactive astrocyte, the number of GFAP positive cells within 150 µm from the injury site was counted. For quantification of microglia activation, the number of Iba1<sup>+</sup> microglia within 150 µm from the injury site was counted. Then the percentage of amedoid-like activated microglia was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All results are presented as mean ± SEM. GraphPad Prism 5 (La Jolla, CA) software was used for all statistical analyses. Differences between two groups were evaluated by un-paired or paired Student’s t-test. For multi-group comparisons, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparisons test was used. Two-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni <italic>post hoc</italic> test was used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. Frequency distributions were analyzed with χ<sup>2</sup> test. The significance level was set at p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We thank Dr. Zhong-wei Zhang, Dr. Da-ting Lin, Dr. Xiang-yao Li, Dr. Jia-dong Chen, and Dr. IC Bruce for critical comments on this manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior editor) and two reviewers. This study is interesting and informative as it identifies molecular mechanisms important to synapse refinement. In the revision, the authors have removed the problematic ATP induced LTD model, improved the quality of their images and rewritten their Discussion section.

The authors propose that the synapse elimination defect is due to a decrease in astrocytic ATP release in the absence of astrocyte calcium signaling, and that ATP acts via presynaptic P2Y1 receptors to induce LTD at weak synapses, which leads to their elimination. The series of experiments to determine if calcium-dependent astrocyte release of ATP is mediating synapse elimination by inducing LTD via P2Y1 receptors could each have an alternative explanation by themselves, but taken together make a strong case in support of this hypothesis. For example, the P2Y1 KO phenocopies the IP3R2 KO, in terms of synapse elimination. Injection of a P2Y1 agonist to the IP3R2 KO mouse rescues the synapse elimination phenotype.

Reviewer #1: This manuscript by Yang et al.</italic></p><p><italic>examines the contribution of IP(3)R2 dependent calcium signaling in astrocytes to developmental synapse elimination at the Pr5-VPm synapse. The authors use a IP(3)R2 knockout mouse (Itpr2<sup>–/–</sup>) that exhibits disrupted calcium signaling in astrocytes, combined with manipulations of CSF ATP, P2Y1 receptor agonists and P2Y1 KO mouse, to argue for a model where ATP is release from astrocytes through an activity- and IP3R2-dependent pathway. ATP then activates P2Y1 receptors on presumably presynaptic terminals, inducing a reduction of release probability, leading to elimination of presynaptic inputs. Although the authors do show that both Itpr2<sup>–/–</sup> and P2Y1<sup>–/–</sup> mice exhibit abnormal convergence of afferent inputs onto relay neurons, their conclusions with regard to the model are overstated as they fail to consider and rule out alternative explanations including, 1) IP(3) R2 has been shown to be present in neuronal processes in the CNS (Holtzclaw et al., Glia 2002). The authors do not convincingly demonstrate that their manipulation targets only astrocytes and not neurons in the circuit, including relay neurons and afferent inputs onto relay neurons.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important concern. As the reviewer mentioned, Holtzclaw et al. showed that IP3R2 was expressed not only in astrocytes, but also in neuronal processes in the cerebellum. Also, they found that IP3R2 was expressed in somata of few cells with neuronal profile in hippocampus and cortex, which is controversial from other studies suggested that IP3R2 was not expressed in neurons of these brain regions (Hertle and Yeckel, 2007; Li et al., 2015; Petravicz et al., 2014; Sharp et al., 1999). Our immunostaining results in hippocampus are in line with the opinion that IP3R2 was not expressed in the neurons, as showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. Unfortunately, we tried different types of IP3R2 antibodies (Santa cruz, sc-7278; Millipore, RB3000) and found no cells could be labeled in the VPm. In this study, we use IP3R2 deficient mice to selectively eliminate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in astrocytes but not in neurons, which is further confirmed by calcium imaging experiments as showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. Moreover, IP3R2 knockout mice have been extensively used to study the contribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in astrocytes for synaptic transmission (Martin et al., 2015; Petravicz et al., 2008), synaptic plasticity (Agulhon et al., 2010; Di Castro et al., 2011; Navarrete et al., 2012), cerebral blood flow (Bonder and McCarthy, 2014; Nizar et al., 2013), neuroprotection after brain injury (Hertle and Yeckel, 2007) and depression (Cao et al., 2013). These literatures together indicate that IP3R2-KO mice are well accepted in the field as a mouse model for studying the specific role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in astrocytes.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15043.017</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15043.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15043.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15043-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) A previous study by one of the authors showed that sensory deprivation leads to defects in refinement at this synapse. In this study, the authors do not rule out the possibility that disruption of IP(3)R2 or P2Y1 (in astrocytes, glia or neurons) might alter the nature of sensory information transmitted from the whiskers to thalamus. To clearly support the authors' hypothesis, cell-type and region specific KOs are needed.</italic> We agree with the reviewer that cell-type and region specific KOs’ experiments are very important, and needed to be carried out in the future. In the current study, we found that both of RTP and one selective P2Y1 receptors agonist MRS-2365 could rescue the deficient of synapse elimination in IP3R2-KO mice. These results indicate no matter the nature of sensory information has been changed or not in the IP3R2-KO mice, RTP and its downstream purinergic signaling are sufficient to rescue the defects of synapse elimination in the mutants. We discuss this issue in the third paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) The phenotype of Itpr2<sup>–/–</sup> mice could be a nonspecific sequela of reduced ATP and global metabolic stress leading to halted or disrupted development.</italic> We agree with the reviewer that global metabolic stress caused by reduced RTP may be one of the reasons leading to disruption of synapse elimination in <italic>Itpr2<sup>–/–</sup></italic>mice, but this is very unlikely. First, these mutant mice have normal brain cytoarchitecture, neuron and astrocyte numbers, and comparable body weight as well as lifespan with WT mice. Second, we found that impaired synapse elimination in <italic>Itpr2<sup>–/–</sup></italic>mice could be rescued by either RTPçS, a non-hydrolyzable RTP analog, or MRS-2365, a selective P2ry1 agonist. Both molecules could barely provide energy. We discuss this issue in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>4) Rescue by ATP in Itpr2<sup>–/–</sup> mice may be through an entirely different pathway from astrocyte signaling. For example, injection of ATP could activate microglia-mediated synapse elimination. P2RY1 has been reported to be expressed in microglia (Ballerini et al., 2005 Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol.18(2):255-68) and ATP activates microglia (Davalos et al., Nat Neurosci. 2005 Jun;8(6):752-8).</italic> We agree with the reviewer that rescue effects by RTP may be through activation of microglia. At present, there are mRNR expressions and functional evidences (pharmacological data) showing that microglia express P2Y1 receptors, but the protein evidence is very few. In our study, we did not observe any P2Y1 receptors expression in VPm microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). So, the expression level of P2Y1 receptors in microglia of the VPm, if any, may be too low to be detected by antibody. However, we cannot totally exclude the possibility that RTP activates microglia P2RY1 to rescue synapse elimination defects in IP3R2-KO mice. We re-discuss this in the last paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Specific Comments:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>: More detail is needed on how the authors are counting VGlut2 puncta.
