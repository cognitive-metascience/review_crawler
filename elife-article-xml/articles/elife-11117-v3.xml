cells. Despite their important role in protecting tissues against mechanical force, no cytoplasmic IF proteins have been convincingly identified in arthropods. Here we show that the ancestral cytoplasmic IF protein gene was lost in the entire panarthropod (onychophoran + tardigrade + arthropod) rather than arthropod lineage and that nuclear, lamin-derived proteins instead acquired new cytoplasmic roles at least three times independently in collembolans, copepods, and tardigrades. Transcriptomic and genomic data revealed three IF protein genes in the tardigrade <italic>Hypsibius dujardini</italic>, one of which (cytotardin) occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm of epidermal and foregut epithelia, where it forms belt-like filaments around each epithelial cell. These results suggest that a lamin derivative has been co-opted to enhance tissue stability in tardigrades, a function otherwise served by cytoplasmic IF proteins in all other bilaterians.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11117.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11117.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11117.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Different proteins exist to support the stability of animal cells. The intermediate filament proteins are an important example. One type – called lamins – stabilizes the nucleus (the structure within an animal cell that stores most of its DNA), while another forms scaffold-like structures in the rest of cell. The second type, referred to as “cytoplasmic” intermediate filaments, are not found in many hard-bodied creatures including insects and their closest relatives. This is probably because these animals, which are collectively known as arthropods, are instead supported by their tough external skeleton.</p><p>The soft-bodied animals called tardigrades (also known as water bears or moss piglets) are closely related to the arthropods. These microscopic animals can endure extreme environmental conditions such as freezing. The tardigrade’s endurance is likely to require some way to stabilize the animal’s cells. This might involve cytoplasmic intermediate filaments, but nothing was known about these proteins in tardigrades.</p><p>Now, Hering, Bouameur, Reichelt et al. have investigated if, and where, intermediate filaments are found in the cells of tardigrades. First, the complete set of active genes was analyzed for a species of tardigrade called <italic>Hypsibius dujardini</italic>; this revealed that three genes for intermediate filament proteins were active. Staining tissue slices or whole tardigrades with a marker that binds to intermediate filament proteins revealed that two of the three proteins were lamins and located within the nucleus. The third protein, which has been named &quot;cytotardin&quot;, was found outside of the nucleus. However, unlike well-known cytoplasmic intermediate filaments, this protein did not form scaffold-like structures throughout the cell. Instead, cytotardin formed belt-like filaments that encircled each cell in the skin of the tardigrades.</p><p>Hering, Bouameur, Reichelt et al. then discovered that cytotardin seems to be more closely related to lamins than it is to cytoplasmic intermediate filaments. This suggests that cytotardin actually evolved from a tardigrade lamin and then acquired a new role in building filaments outside of the nucleus.</p><p>The fact that cytotardin is only found in the skin of the tardigrade and in those tissues that experience mechanical stress (for example, the mouth and legs) hints that it might help stabilize these cells. This could mean that the protein also helps these animals to resist extreme conditions. Further studies should focus on clarifying cytotardin’s role in stabilizing cells, in particular if it is required for the tardigrades' tolerance to environmental stress.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11117.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11117.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>intermediate filament</kwd><kwd>lamin</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>tardigrada</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INF 268/230-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Magin</surname><given-names>Thomas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MA1316/21-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Magin</surname><given-names>Thomas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ma 4147/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mayer</surname><given-names>Georg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A newly discovered cytoplasmic intermediate filament in water bears may help these animals to resist extreme environmental conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tardigrades, also known as water bears, are microscopic invertebrates that live in marine, freshwater and semi-aquatic/limno-terrestrial environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kinchin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nelson, 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

The integrity and plasticity of tardigrade tissues might be achieved by specialised cytoskeletal components, such as IF proteins, which are known to be essential for stress resilience of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herrmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coulombe and Wong, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim and Coulombe, 2007</xref>). While lamins, a group of IF proteins found in the nucleus, occur in most eukaryotes, including social amoebae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krüger et al., 2012</xref>) and all metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dittmer and Misteli, 2011</xref>), cytoplasmic IF proteins are thought to have evolved from an ancestral <italic>lamin</italic> gene by duplication in the bilaterian lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erber et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herrmann and Strelkov, 2011</xref>). Genomic and biochemical studies have revealed that the cytoplasmic IF proteins are present in all bilaterian taxa excluding arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartnik and Weber, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldstein and Gunawardena, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erber et al., 1998</xref>) [but see a contradictory report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mencarelli et al., 2011</xref>) of a putative cytoplasmic IF protein in a collembolan].

Although this model tardigrade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gabriel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gross et al., 2015</xref>) shows only a limited ability to tolerate desiccation (anhydrobiosis), it clearly survives immediate freezing (cryobiosis; see <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Our analyses revealed only one putative IF protein transcript in each of the five onychophoran species but three in <italic>H. dujardini</italic>. Additional screening of the recently sequenced genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boothby et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koutsovoulos et al., 2015</xref>) of <italic>H. dujardini</italic> confirms that the identified transcripts correspond to the three potential IF protein-coding genes of this species. According to sequence comparisons with well-characterized IF proteins from humans and the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, all corresponding proteins of the three identified genes share a similar α-helical rod domain organization with three coiled coil-forming segments (coil 1A, coil 1B, coil 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>) (review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chernyatina et al., 2015</xref>).This, in conjunction with the highly conserved intermediate filament consensus motifs (review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herrmann and Aebi, 2004</xref>) at the beginning and end of the rod domain of all three tardigrade proteins, classify them as intermediate filament proteins. The three tardigrade IF proteins further possess 42 residues in the coil 1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) — a feature that is shared between all eukaryote lamins and protostome cytoplasmic IF proteins but that must have been deleted from the ancestral cytoplasmic IF protein gene in chordates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herrmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peter and Stick, 2015</xref>). In contrast to the similar organization of the rod domain, the flanking sequences vary between all three tardigrade IF proteins. One of them, which we named lamin-2, possesses all major regions known from other eukaryote lamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herrmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dittmer and Misteli, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burke and Stewart, 2013</xref>), including the nuclear localization signal (NLS) — which generally mediates the import of proteins into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mical et al., 2004</xref>) — the lamin-tail domain (LTD), and the carboxy-terminal CaaX motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). In contrast, the second tardigrade IF protein (named lamin-1) lacks the CaaX box, whereas the third IF protein from <italic>H. dujardini</italic> is missing all three motifs, including the NLS, indicating this protein may instead localize in the cytoplasm rather than the nuclear lamina of <italic>H. dujardini</italic> cells. Since the structure of the latter resembles the domain composition of known bilaterian cytoplasmic IF proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>) we consequently named it cytotardin.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-11117-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11117.004</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>The tardigrade <italic>Hypsibius dujardini</italic> survives freezing.</title><p>This time-lapse video shows thawing specimens of the tardigrade <italic>H. dujardini</italic> after 4 days frozen in ice.

In our phylogenetic analyses, all identified tardigrade and onychophoran sequences cluster within the bilaterian lamin clade, whereas none of them groups with cytoplasmic IF protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). Surprisingly, the three identified IF sequences of <italic>H. dujardini</italic>, together with two sequences from <italic>Milnesium tardigradum</italic>, form a strongly supported monophyletic clade of tardigrade lamins (GTR+G: Bootstrap support BS=77, LG+G: BS=80) in our analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). This implies that there were at least two duplication events in the tardigrade lineage that gave rise to <italic>lamin-1, lamin-2</italic> and <italic>cytotardin</italic> genes — consequently characterizing the tardigrade IFs (including cytotardin), for example, as co-orthologous to nematode lamins rather than orthologous to nematode cytoplasmic IFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). Our results further show that the isomin sequence of the collembolan <italic>Isotomurus maculatus</italic> does in fact cluster with other identified collembolan transcripts (GTR+G: BS=74, LG+G: BS=70) within the clade of arthropod lamins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>); it had previously been interpreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mencarelli et al., 2011</xref>) as closely related to cytoplasmic IF proteins of nematodes and therefore as an ortholog of the bilaterian cytoplasmic IF proteins, likely due to the narrower dataset used for their phylogenetic analysis. These results clearly challenge the identity of isomin as a member of the bilaterian cytoplasmic IF protein clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mencarelli et al., 2011</xref>) and suggest that orthologs of genes encoding these proteins are entirely missing in arthropods, at least in those with known genomic sequences. In fact, besides the putative IF proteins from chelicerates, crustaceans and hexapods obtained from publicly available databases (e.g. GenBank), our transcriptomic and genomic analyses, which included screening of the genome of the centipede <italic>Strigamia maritima</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chipman et al., 2014</xref>), the water flea <italic>Daphnia pulex</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colbourne et al., 2011</xref>), and more than 70 transcriptomes from hexapod species sequenced as part of the 1KITE project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Misof et al., 2014</xref>), strongly suggest that these genes were already lost in the panarthropod lineage, since all of these panarthropod IF proteins cluster within a well-supported monophyletic clade of bilaterian lamins (GTR+G: BS=84, LG+G: BS=76; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). In this respect, even if the metazoan lamins are polyphyletic, as recently proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kollmar, 2015</xref> based on the finding of putative nematocilin homologs in Bilateria, our results favour the tardigrade, copepod, and collembolan IF proteins as members of the bilaterian lamins rather than the bilaterian cytoplasmic IFs or nematocilins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11117.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Phylogeny of the metazoan intermediate filament proteins illustrating the position of the three tardigrade IF proteins (highlighted in red).</title><p>The tree was obtained from a Maximum likelihood analysis under a dataset-specific GTR+G substitution model of 447 eukaryotic intermediate filament proteins (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for the full tree).

Immunofluorescence analyses using cytotardin antibody revealed that this protein is located exclusively in the cytoplasm of transfected MCF-7 cells, where it forms both short filaments and extensive cytoskeletal networks which most likely are homopolymeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–F</xref>). Notably, some of the cytotardin arrays display cage-like perinuclear structures, while others are located in the periphery close to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). Double labelling for cytotardin and desmoplakin, a desmosomal protein mediating membrane attachment of mammalian IF proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simpson et al., 2011</xref>), shows that cytotardin occurs close to desmosomes but is not co-localised with desmoplakin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). To examine whether this arrangement was mediated by interactions between cytotardin and keratins endogenously expressed in MCF-7 cells, we double-labelled the transfectants for cytotardin and keratin-8. Our data show that these two proteins are not co-localised and that the endogenous keratin networks are displaced in cells with dense cytotardin arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>).

This process was most likely triggered by an initial loss of the CaaX motif and nuclear localization signal from the ancestral <italic>lamin</italic> gene in the tardigrade lineage. Expression of the cytotardin protein in tissues that are subject to mechanical stress might have served as a pre-adaptation for the ability of tardigrades to survive extreme environmental conditions. Similar duplication and neofunctionalization events might have occurred in the collembolan and copepod lineages, as our findings demonstrate that these two taxa also show duplicated lamins that have lost their nuclear localization signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). While isomin might stabilize the intestinal epithelial cells in collembolans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mencarelli et al., 2011</xref>), the localization and function of the putative lamin-derived cytoplasmic IF protein in copepods has yet to be clarified.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Culturing of specimens, transcriptomics, genomics and phylogenetic analyses</title><p>Specimens of <italic>Hypsibius dujardini</italic> (Doyère, 1840) were purchased from Sciento (Manchester, UK) and cultured as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mayer et al., 2015</xref>.

In total, 447 eukaryotic lamin and cytoplasmic IF genes were manually curated and selected for further analyses.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Novel origin of lamin-derived cytoplasmic intermediate filaments in tardigrades&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Guest Reviewing Editor (who also served as one of the reviewers) and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Schaffeld (peer reviewer 2) and Reimer Stick (peer reviewer 3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>All four reviewers found the article very interesting, i.e. intermediate filament (IF) proteins in evolution. Here is a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis about their appearance in the water bear (Tardigrada) as an example of a very simple and fascinating &quot;micro-animal&quot; and how their sequences fit into the complex evolutionary tree of IF proteins.</p><p>Central conclusions:</p><p>1) The water bear <italic>Hypsibius dujardini</italic> genome exhibits three coding units for potential intermediate filament (IF) proteins, two with a nuclear localization signal sequence, one without.</p><p>2) A potential structural fold is introduced and the proteins are grouped – according to their primary sequence – into an evolutionary tree.</p><p>3) The proteins are called, because of sequence homology with lamins, lamin-1 to -3. Lamin-1 and lamin-2 exhibit nuclear localization signals and an Ig fold-like domain. Lamin-2 does not have a CAAX box for isoprenylation and hence resembles a lamin C of vertebrates.</p><p>4) Lamin-1 and lamin-2 are localized at the nuclear envelope in authentic <italic>Hypsibius dujardini</italic> tissue sections, lamin-3 is found in epithelial cells. It is essential to change the name lamin-3, since naming a cytoplasmic protein &quot;lamin&quot; will confuse readers tremendously. For instance, Hd-IF-1 would make sense – provided the protein is demonstrated to be really IF-like by sequence criteria.</p><p>5) Transfection of lamin-3 cDNA into human epithelial MCF-7 cells revealed that these proteins were able to form filaments that organized into extensive cytoplasmic networks.</p><p>6) The cytoplasmic IF protein of <italic>Hypsibius dujardini</italic> is most probably, like the cytoplasmic IF protein of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, derived from the nuclear version by loss of the nuclear localization signal.</p><p>Required revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raise a number of concerns that should be appropriately considered before the paper can be accepted. Those comments concerning the sequences used to construct the &quot;tree&quot; may cause some extra work, but the remainder of the comments concern the improvement of the text, in particular the background of the research.</p><p>1) The amino acid sequence of the α-helical rod provides a good starting point to characterize potential intermediate filament (IF) proteins by comparing them to authentic vertebrate ones. As the conserved end domains are evolutionary signatures with functional roles, those segments should be looked at in particular. Hence, an amino acid comparison of lamin-1 to lamin-2 to lamin-3 with each other and with e.g. human, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and Hydra or a protist lamin would be a meaningful way to analyze these new proteins before drawing domain schemes.</p><p>2) With respect to the last comment, the work by Martin Kollmar (Scientific Reports 5:10652) has to be discussed appropriately.</p><p>3) The fact that cytoplasmic IF proteins (which are essentially not lamins) are derived from lamins is not so new as one would learn from the work over the last two decades of the Weber group in Göttingen. How can one leave out this worm in light of its close relatedness to water bears?</p><p>4) A figure with an evolutionary &quot;tree&quot; that can be printed on one page would be good – as it would only allow giving main relationships. The Weber group did such overviews in their papers.</p><p>5) The issue of cytoplasmic IFs – as well as isomin – may be discussed with a broader perspective. In the light of the million insect species, <italic>Drosophila</italic> is surely not &quot;the&quot; insect.</p><p>6) The sequences used to build the tree should be &quot;cleaned&quot;.</p><p>7) IF proteins form – with very rare exceptions (Keratin 18) – parallel coiled-coil dimers. Meaningful molecular modeling should consider that fact.</p><p>Full Reviews</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Lars Hering and colleagues report on the occurrence of both nuclear and cytoplasmic intermediate filament (IF) proteins in Tardigrades, the water bear. Based on in silico work done for <italic>Hypsibius dujardini</italic> they derive two amino acid sequences that exhibit similarity to lamins and one that is cytoplasmic. As tardigrades are very special organisms, tolerating various extreme stresses, they are of high interest for every life scientist. These data they use to investigate evolutionary relationships. The evolutionary trees provided are interesting, but the definition of the proteins is poor (see below). But immuno-cytochemical methods the authors demonstrate that the two nuclear IF proteins localize to the nuclear envelope. Moreover, these authors use cDNAs to transfect human epithelial cells and demonstrate that the cytoplasmic lamin-3 (what a misnomer) assembles into some type of regular network. All the cell biological data are very interesting and of high quality.</p><p>For a reader following the DNA-RNA-protein dogma for the last decades, a protein is still defined by its sequence, and not its position in a phylogenetic tree. Old fashioned as it may be, it would be good to discuss such issues as domain size, coiled-coil forming ability, i.e. the occurrence of heptad or hendcad patterns. The sequences are, however, not shown neither are they directly compared with authentic lamins such as those from Hydra, man or <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Strange enough, the latter organism is not centrally discussed, as for this worm Klaus Weber and his group in Göttingen demonstrated how lamins and invertebrate cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins are related, i.e. by loss of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) the cytoplasmic IF proteins emerged (Dodemont et al. 1990 &amp; 1994 EMBO J., Andreas Erber et al. 1998 &amp; J. Mol. Evol., and several more papers). Obviously a fruitful strategy.</p><p>A selected paradigmatic-type comparison would be very instructive. I took the CAAX-box-free version and compared its sequence with human lamin A: 1. Coil 1B is missing 4 amino acids and coil 2 carries a 3-amino acid insertion. The size of these helical segments including coil 1A is highly conserved, with the rare exception of coil 2 of the single lamin of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which is missing 2 heptads or 14 amino acids. Notably, the IF consensus motif in coil 1A exhibits high conservation as does the IF consensus motif at the end of the rod in coil 2. More surprisingly, the linker segment L1 is entirely kept both to the very amino acid number and with respect to the quality of amino acids, which all are good for α-helix formation; the same holds true for linker L12 from what one can conclude that structural principals in the α-helical rod domain are highly conserved. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> does not give any clue to how related these domains are. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> the subdivision in 2A and 2B is completely illusory, it is wrong. The authors should refer to a recent structural review of Sergei Strelkov (Leuven) in Current Opinion in Cell Biology (2015). &quot;Head&quot; and &quot;tail&quot; sequences vary very much in IF proteins – notably here: the Ig fold sequence in the carboxyl-terminal domain exhibits highest identity with that of human lamin A, when the whole amino acid sequence is considered. The NLS shows an interesting variation from the standard, both CDK1 sequences flanking the rod are there but slightly shifted compared with the position of lamin A. In summary, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> gives the impression that everything is like in every IF protein and that lamin-1 to -3 are identical: to what extent are they? The tree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> does not tell anything in detail. So how different is the tardigrade cytoplasmic IF protein from its lamins, and how closely is it related to human keratins K8 and K18? Does it have features that are anything like &quot;keratin-related&quot;? Along these lines: the structural models shown as Figure 1—figure supplement 3 are pretty meaningless – all three lamin-1 to -3 should form coiled coils.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>The amino acid sequences and the kind how coiled-coil forming regions are present and can/do define a domain should definitively be provided.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>By whole-transcriptome analysis (using NGS), database mining and subsequent thorough phylogenetic analysis Hering and colleagues revealed that the ancestral genes encoding cytoplasmic IFs in bilaterians have once been lost in the entire panarthropod lineage, including the soft skinned velvet worms (Onychophora) and water bears (Tardigrada). This important finding suggests that the development of an exoskeleton may not have been the main driving force for the loss of cytoplasmic IFs in euarthropods. Moreover, the presented phylogenetic analysis strongly supports that several members of this taxon, notably tardigrades, collembolans and copepods each independently evolved novel cytoplasmic IFs, again originating from gene duplications of a nuclear lamin gene, long after the first bilaterian cytoplasmic IF arose. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated the capacity of the novel cytoplasmic IF protein lamin-3 to form IF networks within transfected cultured cells and traced its expression in the tardigrade <italic>H. dujardini</italic>, showing a unique, belt-like distribution within the peripheral cytoplasm of ectodermally derived epithelial cells, such as the epidermis.</p><p>In the study presented here, the authors do not only provide a sound and comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, but also combine their results with a broad survey of expression data as well as functional analyses. This is a well and carefully reasoned scientific approach, providing important insights into the early evolutionary steps that ultimately led to the high diversity of metazoan IF proteins as well as to the role of selective pressure that may have triggered those evolutionary events. The structure and function of a given protein or protein family is a result of a long-term evolutionary process and therefore cannot be completely understood without such phylogenetic considerations. Overall the results and conclusions presented in the submitted manuscript are convincing, making a valuable contribution to both, a better understanding of the evolutionary history of the IF protein family and how the novel cytoplasmic IF may account for the tardigrades ability to withstand the extraordinary mechanical stress enforced by extreme environmental conditions such as desiccation and cryobiosis.</p><p>Therefore, this referee strongly recommends the publication of the submitted manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Hering et al. report on the evolution of cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins (cIF) in the panarthropod lineage. They have characterized three tardigrade IF proteins in more detail: two lamins and one cytoplasmic IF protein. They convincingly show by immunofluorescence microscopy that the two lamins are nuclear and that the third protein is cytoplasmic. It forms filamentous structures in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. This part of the manuscript is clear and convincing.</p><p>From their data they conclude that the genes for cytoplasmic IF proteins have been lost at the base of the panarthropod lineage and that cIF genes have been acquired at least three times independently in collembolans, copepods, and tardigrades. This is a very interesting point. This statement is based solely on evolutionary tree construction of a broad range of IF rod sequences. However, it is not fully convincing. For the collembolan lineage it is based solely on the fact that the isomin rod sequence groups with bilaterian lamin rod sequences. At none of the nodes of the two trees bootstrap values exceed 50%. Given that collembolans are at the base of the arthropod lineage this conclusion requires more solid evidence.</p><p>In general, the tree construction needs a more careful handling of the sequence data. A closer look at some of the sequences revealed that the presence of cyclin and UDG motifs in the putative IF sequences is probably an artifact due to errors in the automatic gene predictions; e. g.: XP 003386754_1 and GAA48725_1 predict a lamin-cyclin chimera and a lamin-uracil−DNA glycosylase chimera, respectively. The existence of such chimeric proteins is not supported by expression data. Other sequences are incomplete precluding an assignment as either lamin or cytoplasmic IF. The sequence data used for the tree building should be carefully checked to avoid unnecessary confusion.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>1) The sequences of the proteins described in this study should be given in the supplementary information together with the accession numbers of the corresponding genomic contigs (at least for the three tardigrade proteins).</p><p>2) A sequence alignment with a selection of other lamin/cytoplasmic IF proteins would be desirable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting paper which is based on two pieces of evidence.</p><p>First, the authors perform a detailed phylogenetic analysis of IF proteins and their relatives, including isomin. They conclude that isomin clusters with lamins rather than with cytoplasmic IFs.</p><p>Second, the authors experimentally explore the localization of three lamins (1,2 and 3) present in a tardigrade. They show that while 1 and 2 are located in the nucleus as expected, lamin-3 is observed in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells.</p><p>The main conclusion of the paper is that the true cytoplasmic IFs were lost in panarthropods, but lamin-like IFs can take over their functions in the cytoplasm. While this theory certainly needs additional proof (beyond the reported data on tardigrade lamin-3 and in fact on isomin as well), I think that this is an important advance.</p><p>The new findings also suggest that the current terminology may need some adjustment, as the name 'cytoplasmic IFs' becomes ambiguous as one reads through the paper. Should one speak of 'non-lamin' IFs vs. lamins to reflect the phylogeny, which would then be uncoupled from the cytoplasmic vs. nuclear localization?</p><p>The phylogenetic analysis of Mencarelli et al. was less rigorous than the one presented here. As far as I can tell from that paper, Mencarelli et al. simply claimed that isomin was an IF relative, found in the cytoplasm (just like the tardigrade lam3 discussed here). The new phylogenetic analysis is much more systematic, relating isomin to lamins.</p><p>Thus there does not seem to be a real contradiction between Mencarelli et al. and the current paper (as suggested in the first paragraph of the Results and Discussion section). I think that the authors should adjust this part of the text accordingly.</p><p>In any case, the new paper is an important step forward.</p><p>1) While it is clear that the full phylogenetic tree can only fit in the supplement, the authors should present some simplified but yet scientifically rigorous view of such a tree. The current drawing shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> is oversimplified. (In fact, the tree shown in Mencarelli et al. would be a good example).</p><p>2) Regarding Figure 1—figure supplement, it has been known for decades how coiled coils fold. Trying to model a structure of a monomer without taking into account the interaction between the chains (usually two) of the coiled coil clearly yields a nonsense result here. The authors should either re-do the modelling properly or remove the figure (which I believe is not important here).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11117.055</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Required revisions: The reviewers raise a number of concerns that should be appropriately considered before the paper can be accepted.

The sequence data used for the tree building should be carefully checked to avoid unnecessary confusion.</italic>We excluded chimeric and incomplete sequences from our datasets and performed completely new analyses with these cleaned datasets.</p><p> <italic>Additional data files and statistical comments: 1) The sequences of the proteins described in this study should be given in the supplementary information together with the accession numbers of the corresponding genomic contigs (at least for the three tardigrade proteins).</italic></p><p>All sequences obtained for this work were submitted to GenBank and the corresponding accession numbers are provided in the Material and methods section as well as in the supporting trees of our revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) A sequence alignment with a selection of other lamin/cytoplasmic IF proteins would be desirable.</italic>We included alignments with well-known IF proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>) to better characterize the domain structure of the described proteins.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4: This is an interesting paper which is based on two pieces of evidence. First, the authors perform a detailed phylogenetic analysis of IF proteins and their relatives, including isomin. They conclude that isomin clusters with lamins rather than with cytoplasmic IFs. Second, the authors experimentally explore the localization of three lamins (1,2 and 3) present in a tardigrade. They show that while 1 and 2 are located in the nucleus as expected, lamin-3 is observed in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. The main conclusion of the paper is that the true cytoplasmic IFs were lost in panarthropods, but lamin-like IFs can take over their functions in the cytoplasm. While this theory certainly needs additional proof (beyond the reported data on tardigrade lamin-3 and in fact on isomin as well), I think that this is an important advance. The new findings also suggest that the current terminology may need some adjustment, as the name 'cytoplasmic IFs' becomes ambiguous as one reads through the paper. Should one speak of 'non-lamin' IFs vs. lamins to reflect the phylogeny, which would then be uncoupled from the cytoplasmic vs. nuclear localization?</italic></p><p>Since the terms “lamin” and “cytoplasmic IF” are mostly understood as functional terms rather than taxonomic ones from an evolutionary point of view and to prevent confusion for the readers, we renamed lamin-3 into “cytotardin”, referring to the cytoplasmic nature of this IF.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the terminology is indeed ambiguous in general, depending on the readers’ personal point of view. From a functional perspective, all lamins occur in the nuclear lamina and all cytoplasmic IF within the cytoplasm, irrespective of their evolutionary history. But as we could show in the manuscript, some “functional cytoplasmic IFs” are more closely related to lamins than to other cytoplasmic IFs.</p><p> <italic>The phylogenetic analysis of Mencarelli et al. was less rigorous than the one presented here. As far as I can tell from that paper, Mencarelli et al. simply claimed that isomin was an IF relative, found in the cytoplasm (just like the tardigrade lam3 discussed here). The new phylogenetic analysis is much more systematic, relating isomin to lamins. Thus there does not seem to be a real contradiction between Mencarelli et al. and the current paper (as suggested in the first paragraph of the Results and Discussion section). I think that the authors should adjust this part of the text accordingly.</italic>Mencarelli et al. suggested that isomin is closely related to the cIFs from nematodes (which are indeed members of the monophyletic bilaterian cIF clade), which is – according to our analyses – not the case. Consequently, these authors concluded that “the expression of an IF terminal web in the midgut of <italic>Isotomurus</italic> species appears to be evolutionarily related to the original intestine organization present in the ancestor common to arthropods and nematodes”. This indeed contradicts our findings, since not a single IF homolog of panarthropods clusters within the bilaterian cIF clade (as the nematode cIFs and priapulid cIFs do). Nevertheless, we slightly rephrased our sentence to mitigate the tone.</p><p><italic>In any case, the new paper is an important step forward.1) While it is clear that the full phylogenetic tree can only fit in the supplement, the authors should present some simplified but yet scientifically rigorous view of such a tree. The current drawing shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> is oversimplified. (In fact, the tree shown in Mencarelli et al. would be a good example).</italic>We removed the oversimplified drawing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Instead we included a completely new and more descriptive figure of the tree, which would fit on a single page of the main manuscript (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Regarding Figure 1—figure supplement 3, it has been known for decades how coiled coils fold. Trying to model a structure of a monomer without taking into account the interaction between the chains (usually two) of the coiled coil clearly yields a nonsense result here. The authors should either re-do the modelling properly or remove the figure (which I believe is not important here).</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this figure is unnecessary here and decided to remove it. Instead, we included alignments with well-known IF proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>) to better characterize the domain structure of the described proteins.</p></body></sub-article></article>
