single-cell level. Here, we studied the GRNs controlling the emergence of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from mouse embryonic endothelium using a combination of single-cell transcriptome assays. We found that a heptad of transcription factors (Runx1, Gata2, Tal1, Fli1, Lyl1, Erg and Lmo2) is specifically co-expressed in an intermediate population expressing both endothelial and hematopoietic markers. Within the heptad, we identified two sets of factors of opposing functions: one (Erg/Fli1) promoting the endothelial cell fate, the other (Runx1/Gata2) promoting the hematopoietic fate. Surprisingly, our data suggest that even though Fli1 initially supports the endothelial cell fate, it acquires a pro-hematopoietic role when co-expressed with Runx1. This work demonstrates the power of single-cell RNA-sequencing for characterizing complex transcription factor dynamics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Stem Cells</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>developmental biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EMBL Interdisciplinary Postdocs (EIPOD) Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post-doc fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bergiers</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell transcriptomics analysis identifies the dynamic activity of transcription factors at the onset of hematopoeitic stem and progenitor cells formation during embryonic development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past decade, advances in high-throughput transcriptomics and DNA occupancy analyses have provided valuable insights into how transcription factors (TFs) regulate cell fate decisions and determine cell identity. It has become clear that during embryonic development, the expression of key TFs is strictly regulated, and it has been shown that the combinatorial expression of a relatively limited number of TFs is sufficient to establish (and potentially change) cell identity and differentiation through their action on the underlying gene regulatory networks (GRNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iwafuchi-Doi and Zaret, 2016</xref>). In this context, bulk transcriptomics analysis and chromatin immuno-precipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) were used to describe TF interactions, thereby providing GRN models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dunn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mullen et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, these techniques were successfully used to study the embryonic hematopoietic system in an in vitro embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goode et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>However, the use of bulk cell populations constitutes an important limitation in our efforts to fully understand the GRNs. Although bulk transcriptomics can reveal crucial overall gene correlations between semi-stable cellular states, it cannot resolve subtler gene interactions occurring in complex transitional states. In addition, using a bulk approach makes it difficult to infer the direct consequences on the transcriptional landscape upon which these TFs are acting.</p><p>These limitations can be overcome by the use of single-cell approaches. Over the past five years, tremendous technical progress has been achieved in the field. Gene expression can be efficiently assessed at the single-cell level, making it possible to distinguish subpopulations within tissues and cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolodziejczyk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scialdone et al., 2016</xref>). Single-cell transcriptomics has previously been used to unravel complex developmental transitions such as gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scialdone et al., 2016</xref>), demonstrating that it is possible to determine combinations of TFs that are expressed at the single-cell level as cellular differentiation progresses.</p><p>In the present work, we applied single-cell transcriptomics approaches to the ontogeny of the blood system in the mouse embryo. The GRNs that are involved in the production of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) at the origin of all blood cells are not well understood. During mouse embryogenesis, HSPCs are generated mainly in the yolk sac (YS), from E7–E7.5, and in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, from E10.5. They emerge from the endothelial cells forming the vasculature, through a process called the endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boisset et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eilken et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lancrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zovein et al., 2008</xref>). It has been proposed that a heptad of seven TFs (Gata2, Runx1, Erg, Fli1, Lmo2, Lyl1 and Tal1) known to be essential for blood development form a transcriptional complex that is potentially involved in the generation of HSPCs. This proposal was based on bulk ChIP-seq analysis of the binding of these seven TFs to the regulatory elements of 927 genes in the HPC7 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>). Nonetheless, there was no direct evidence that all seven TFs were expressed together at the single-cell level during embryogenesis or that the heptad targets play a crucial role in development. Employing single-cell transcriptomics analysis and an in vitro ESC differentiation system that gives rise to blood cells, we addressed these questions and provided novel insights into the formation of HSPCs from endothelial cells. Our data show that during EHT, two sets of TFs have opposite effects that allow proper differentiation. Through the transition, Erg and Fli1 support the endothelial cell fate while Runx1 and Gata2 promote the hematopoietic one. Unexpectedly, we found that the endothelial transcription factor Fli1 could acquire a hematopoietic function when expressed together with the hematopoietic master regulator Runx1. This work shows that GRN analysis based on single-cell transcriptomics data can highlight biological aspects that are missed by classical bulk methods, emphasizing the power of single-cell approaches in the understanding of complex developmental transitions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Key transcription factors identify a population intermediary between endothelial and blood cells during EHT in vivo and in vitro</title><p>We performed single-cell quantitative RT-PCR (sc-q-RT-PCR) on 95 genes associated with hematopoietic, endothelial (Endo), and vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We plated the cells from both the i8TFs – dox and the i8TFs + dox conditions in the absence of dox in a medium that allows the growth of both myeloid and erythroid cells. We observed a dramatic increase in the number of colony-forming units from the +dox cells, suggesting that the induction of the eight TFs increases hematopoietic differentiation potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>The overexpression of the eight TFs led to the production of a majority of VE-Cad<sup>+</sup> CD41<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, at the beginning of dox treatment, the majority of cells were VE-Cad<sup>–</sup> CD41<sup>–</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), which were enriched in vascular smooth muscle cells (named eVSMs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). To understand the impact of the expression of the eight TFs on the two main non-hematopoietic populations — the VE-Cad<sup>+</sup> CD41<sup>-</sup> endothelial population (named Endo) and the eVSM — we isolated Endo and eVSM cells at day 1 of BL-CFC culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and cultured them in hemogenic endothelial (HE) culture conditions with or without dox for 48 hr. Using flow cytometry, we showed that both populations were affected by the dox treatment and became almost entirely VE-Cad<sup>+</sup> CD41<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Furthermore, the CFU-assay showed an increased hematopoietic differentiation capacity for the Endo +dox compared to the –dox condition, confirming their successful conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). By contrast, the eVSM cells did not show a comparable effect, and together with the flow cytometry data, this evidence suggests that even though the eVSMs gained the Pre-HSPCs phenotype, they probably remained more immature than the Endo +dox cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). To further characterize the effect of the eight TFs on the eVSM and Endo populations, we carried out a microarray analysis on i8TFs eVSM and Endo conditions before (t0) and 24 hr after differentiation with or without dox treatment (+dox and –dox) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). The Empty ESC line eVSM was used as control. As expected, the dox treatment of these cells had little effect on the transcriptome as shown by PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). By contrast, the expression of the eight TFs changed the Endo and eVSM cells dramatically. Interestingly, the eVSM +dox group clustered closely to the Endo -dox and Endo +dox conditions but far apart from the eVSM -dox group. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis highlighted the genes responsible for these changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the DEGs showed that overexpression of the eight TFs led to the reduced expression of genes involved in vasculature and heart development, while there was an increase in the expression of genes linked to immune system and vasculature development for eVSM (compatible with the dual endothelial-hematopoietic identity of Pre-HSPCs) and cellular detoxification as well as vesicles for Endo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Surprisingly, when comparing these DEGs with the 927 targets of the heptad identified by ChIP-seq, the overlap was only 26 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B and C</xref>). This would suggest that the DEGs that we observed were not a direct consequence of the complex of eight TFs binding at the regulatory elements of these genes.</p><p>To find out whether the striking effect of the eight TFs is really due to the expression of several of these genes and not to the effect of one particular transcription factor, we generated eight inducible ESC lines for each of the single transcription factors (i1TF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Inducible expression of each TF was confirmed using western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Using the same experimental layout as that used previously for i8TFs and Empty ESC lines, we performed BL-CFC assays and FACS analyses with these eight new ESC lines and studied the effect of dox treatment on each of them. We found that none of the i1TF lines were qualitatively similar to the i8TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5C and D</xref>).</p><p>To better distinguish differentiated cell populations, we repeated the BL-CFC culture with –dox/+dox treatment for the ten cell lines followed by sc-q-RT-PCR of the 95 genes used previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).

Indeed, between Endo +dox and Endo –dox, there was only a two-fold increase in VE-Cad<sup>+</sup> CD41<sup>+</sup> population. On the other hand, there was a tenfold increase in VE-Cad<sup>+</sup> CD41<sup>+</sup> population between eVSM +dox and eVSM –dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Moreover, this population shows the largest gene expression contrast in our microarray data upon dox treatment, facilitating the identification of the GRNs controlled by the eight TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). As in the microarray experiments, VE-Cad<sup>–</sup> CD41<sup>–</sup> cells were sorted at day 1 of BL-CFC culture and cultured in the absence or presence of dox for 24 hr. Subsequently, cells from the –dox and +dox conditions were pooled at a 1:1 ratio and put on a Fluidigm C1 chip. The Fluidigm system allowed a higher sensitivity than the Wafergen system, but it did not allow the processing of several conditions and a large number of cells at the same time. The experimental design whereby cells were mixed and loaded onto one chip minimized the technical variability that would invariably arise from using two separate chips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We obtained two biological replicates, and from each chip 96 cells (192 cells in total) were isolated and sequenced together. To determine which cells were exposed to dox we used the expression of the transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). A PCA of the sequencing data showed that cells expressing high levels of the 8TFs transcripts clustered separately from those expressing low levels of these transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To identify regulatory relationships for the eight TFs, we performed a network analysis using the generalized distance correlation measure, dcor statistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Székely et al., 2007</xref>), together with its conditional version pdcor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Székely and Rizzo, 2014</xref>). This measure has the advantage of being able to detect both linear and non-linear relationships between the transcriptome and the seed genes. However, when only the eight TFs were used as seeds, the resulting network was very small with only five of the eight TFs represented (not shown). Thus, we expanded the set of seed genes to include <italic>Gata1</italic>, <italic>Gfi1b</italic>, <italic>Spi1</italic> (or <italic>Pu.1</italic>), <italic>Ldb1</italic> and <italic>Cbfa2t3,</italic> which are known to play important roles in hematopoiesis. Using this extended set of genes, we obtained a network that illustrated how the eight TFs indirectly interacted through a common regulatory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferreira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goardon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Imperato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lancrin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mylona et al., 2013</xref>). The directionality of the relationships, positive correlation or negative correlation, was defined using the sign of a two-tailed t-test (gene-pairs with p&gt;0.05 were assigned to ‘other’). Finally, interactions between seed genes were identified by conditioning the ‘targets’ of each seed gene on the expression of each other seed gene. An interaction was inferred if the relationships between both seed genes and a particular ‘target’ gene increased in strength when conditioning on the other seed gene.</p><p>When visualizing the resulting network, we only plotted the seeds that interacted with at least with one other seed (black lines) and the gene targets of at least two seed interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Since Dcor is a slow correlation method, it was computationally infeasible to calculate the global network with it. That is why we used Spearman correlation, a very fast correlation method. We combined the two datasets and kept all correlations where the absolute value of the average correlation was greater than 0.25 and where the sign was consistent across Remove Unwanted Variation (RUV) and Size Factors (SF) normalizations. This resulted in a network containing 7,262 genes and 163,474 edges of which 123,394 were positive and 40,080 negative. Importantly, 11 genes out of the 13 seed genes used in the previous analysis where found in this large network: <italic>Cbfa2t3</italic>, <italic>Fli1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Lmo2</italic>, <italic>Erg</italic>, <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gfi1b</italic>, <italic>Gata1</italic>, <italic>Runx1</italic>, <italic>Spi1</italic> and <italic>Lyl1</italic>.

The number of genes among the 11 seed genes with values above the median was significantly higher than that expected by chance for all three measures (degree p-value=0.0005, betweenness p-value=0.006, eigen p-value=0.03). Interestingly, for the 26 heptad targets, only the betweenness presented a higher number of targets above the median than would be expected by chance (p-value=0.04). This highlights the expected central role of the heptad targets by their position ‘in between’ the main players of the network.</p><p>As <italic>Grp56</italic> appeared as a top candidate in our two network analyses, we chose it for further experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). <italic>Gpr56</italic> has been shown to be expressed in the hematopoietic clusters of the aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Solaimani Kartalaei et al., 2015</xref>) and to be upregulated along the EHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goode et al., 2016</xref>). ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>) show that there are two <italic>Gpr56</italic> regulatory elements bound by seven out of the eight TFs in the HPC7 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We selected these putative enhancers and cloned them in a plasmid upstream of the Firefly luciferase reporter gene. A gene reporter assay in the i8TFs ESC line demonstrated that the induction of the eight TFs led to a strong increase in luciferase gene expression with the two <italic>Grp56</italic> enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

It was not clear, however, why the cells were blocked in this normally ‘transient’ intermediate stage of the EHT. To unravel this, we applied our network analysis to a sc-RNA-seq dataset of endothelial cells and HSPCs, before and after the EHT, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pereira et al., 2016</xref>). We generated a network using the same seeds as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and the most striking feature of the new network is that Fli1 and Runx1 share several targets, but with opposing directions of correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). A genome-wide network analysis based on Spearman correlations showed a similar pattern in which 210 genes were correlated to both Fli1 and Runx1 but in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). Furthermore, GO analysis revealed that genes whose expression is positively correlated with Fli1 and negatively correlated with Runx1 (yellow rectangle) are enriched for the terms vascular development, angiogenesis and cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). On the other hand, genes whose expression is positively correlated with that of Runx1 and negatively correlated with that of Fli1 (green rectangle) are associated with the GO term immune system process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Hence, Runx1 is more associated with hematopoietic genes whereas Fli1 is more associated with vascular genes. Interestingly, ChIP-seq data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al.

The observed opposite correlation could be due to the fact that most endothelial cells express only Fli1 and not Runx1, while HSPC co-express Runx1 and Fli1. There is indeed a clear shift in the relative expression of Fli1 compared to that of Runx1 between the two cellular stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In conclusion, our network analysis revealed that Fli1 and Runx1 are connected to 210 genes but with opposite correlations, which might be linked to the contrasting expression patterns of Fli1 and Runx1 and/or to the opposing functional properties of these TFs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29312.024</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Single-cell transcriptome analysis suggests that Runx1 and Fli1 have opposite functions during EHT.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Network built from gene correlations found in the Peirera dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pereira et al., 2016</xref>).

According to these results, we identified two main groups of TFs. The first one includes Fli1 and Erg while the second one includes Runx1 and Gata2. Indeed, in +dox condition, iFli1 and iErg both displayed an increase in Endo population as well as Pre-HSPCs population, although at much lower level than with i8TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). By contrast, iRunx1 and iGata2 cells showed an increased frequency in the EryPCs_II population and a decrease in the MyePCs population in the +dox condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This result is consistent with the hypothesis that some of the eight TFs have opposing effects.</p><p>We next evaluated the functional consequences of the removal of Runx1/Gata2 or Erg/Fli1 from the 8TFs construct. We hypothesized that removing Runx1 and Gata2 would enhance the endothelial cell fate, whereas removing Erg and Fli1 would increase the hematopoietic cell fate. We consequently generated two additional ESC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The first, i6TFs, contains 6TFs that are also found in i8TFs but is without Erg and Fli1. The second, i5TFs, lacks Runx1, Gata2 as well as Cbfb, crucial partner of Runx1. We performed ESC differentiation of these cell lines in the same way as before and analyzed the consequences of the overexpression of these two sets of TFs. Interestingly, the overexpression of the five TFs partly recapitulated the effect of overexpressing the eight TFs and led to a clear increase of the frequency of VE-cad<sup>+</sup> CD41<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Remarkably, the frequency of the VE-Cad<sup>+</sup> CD41<sup>–</sup> population was significantly increased too, in stark contrast to what we observed with the eight TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Consistent with this result, there was a clear decrease of the number of round cells formed during the BL-CFC assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). By contrast, the overexpression of the six TFs only had a minor impact on the expression pattern of VE-cad and CD41 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). However, there was a clear increase of round hematopoietic cells as shown by image analysis, suggesting an enhancement of blood cell formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The observed impact of the induction on the number of round cells was confirmed specifically with endothelial cells isolated at day 1 BL-CFC and cultured for two days in the presence of doxycycline in HE medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

While these results were initially obtained with a single batch of embryos, all key patterns were reproduced in a separate batch in an additional study (Morgan Oatley, unpublished results). Despite slight timing differences, there were strong similarities in gene expression between the yolk sac and the AGM EHT, suggesting a similar process in both sites. However, due to the blood circulation, we cannot rule out cellular exchange between these two sites.</p><p>Bulk ChIP-seq analyses have suggested that Erg, Fli1, Tal1, Lyl1, Lmo2, Runx1 and Gata2 work together as a heptad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we show for the first time that the heptad genes are specifically co-expressed at the single-cell level within the Pre-HSPCs, and that this combination was not found in any other population along the transition. This specific co-expression may be conserved in the human species, as it was shown recently in the in vitro human EHT model system that the intermediate population between endothelial and blood cells co-expresses <italic>Runx1</italic>, <italic>Lyl1</italic>, <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Erg</italic> and <italic>Fli1</italic> (<italic>Lmo2</italic> was not assessed) at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guibentif et al., 2017</xref>) similarly to the Pre-HSPC population that we described. In contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guibentif et al. (2017</xref>), we investigated the functional meaning of the co-expression of these transcription factors. We showed that their enforced expression, together with that of Cbfb, during hematopoietic differentiation gave rise to Pre-HSPCs in culture. This suggests that the co-expression of the heptad genes is necessary for cells to reach the transient Pre-HSPCs stage before pursuing the transition.</p><p>These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of the existence of a heptad protein complex. Surprisingly, only ten percent of the differentially expressed genes are heptad targets and only ten percent of the heptad targets are differentially expressed. This suggests that the gene expression changes that we observed were not a direct consequence of the binding of the eight TFs complex at the regulatory elements of these genes. This implies that the formation of Pre-HSPCs is probably due to a combination of individual functions acting on the GRNs rather than to the sole action of an eight-protein complex.</p><p>To define these GRNs, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline for sc-RNA-seq data. We characterized the tight relationships involved in the formation of Pre-HSPCs, thereby giving directionality to the protein–DNA interactions previously identified by ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goode et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>). Network analyses of the Pereira dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pereira et al., 2016</xref>) together with our in vitro results revealed a new and unexpected opposite relationship between Runx1 and Fli1 functions. In addition, this network suggests that Gata2 and Lmo2 might act as cooperative co-regulators with Runx1 and Fli1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of our data and what is known in the literature, we propose the following model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Initially, the endothelial cell fate program is driven by Erg and Fli1, both ETS transcription factors, which is consistent with our functional analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and studies published before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McLaughlin et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al. (2010</xref>) showed that more than 90% of the loci targeted by Fli1 are also targeted by Erg in the HPC7 cell line, suggesting functional redundancy. Then, the expression of Runx1 commenses and this — along with the expression of Gata2, which has pro-hematopoietic function — initiates the hematopoietic transcriptional program . Previous data support this functional interaction as <italic>Runx1</italic><sup>+/−</sup>::<italic>Gata2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> compound heterozygous embryos are not viable due to their severe hematopoietic defects, reinforcing the notion that the two proteins are involved in the same biological process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>). At this intermediate Pre-HSPCs stage, endothelial genes are progressively downregulated as shown by our data. As Fli1 and Erg gene expression remain stable between the Endo and the Pre-HSPCs stages, this could be explained by a functional switch for these factors in favor of the hematopoietic cell fate and a decrease in the fraction dedicated to the maintenance of the endothelial program at the single-cell level. Specifically, Fli1 may be involved both in endothelial and hematopoietic gene expression depending on the cellular context. Indeed, in presence of Runx1, Fli1 could potentially activate common target genes such as <italic>Gfi1</italic> and <italic>Gfi1b</italic>, which are involved in the repression of endothelial gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lancrin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thambyrajah et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively (or concomitantly), Runx1 and Fli1 could bind together on endothelial gene loci as shown for <italic>Sox17</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lichtinger et al., 2012</xref>) and repress their expression. On the other hand, Fli1 could switch its function upon physical interaction with Runx1, as shown during megakaryocytic differentiation where there is a synergistic transcriptional activation upon Fli1–Runx1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29312.028</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for the dynamical function of transcription factors during the formation of blood stem and progenitor cells.</title><p>Proposed model for the dynamical function of transcription factors during the endothelial to hematopoietic transition.

In the lower blue arrow section, a possible mechanism for the functional switch of Erg/Fli1 in presence of Runx1/Gata2 is depicted. During the transition, epigenetically closed hematopoietic gene loci are progressively opened and activated in the presence of Runx1/Gata2 together with Fli1/Erg while the endothelial loci are progressively closed through Gfi1 and Gfi1b transcriptional repression. The DNA-binding data combined with single-cell GRN analysis suggests a dual function for Fli1 that is dependent on the cellular context (see main text for full description).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29312-fig9-v1"/></fig><p>At the end of the EHT, in the HSPCs, the endothelial program is completely suppressed along with the expression of Erg. At this development stage, Fli1 is fully dedicated to the hematopoietic cell fate program and works with Runx1 to carry on blood cell development. This is supported by the observation that almost all the Runx1 target genes specific to the HSPCs are also bound by Fli1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our work gives an important insight into the switch between endothelial and hematopoietic cell fates that is required for blood cell formation. We have identified the Pre-HSPCs as the pivotal stage in this process, at which a competition between developmental programs takes place at the single-cell level. The expression of the heptad of TFs is directly linked to this transitional stage. The balance of activity of Erg, Fli1, Gata2 and Runx1 appears to have the most important role in the EHT, whereas the Tal1/Lmo2/Lyl1 axis might have an essential role in priming it. Indeed, Tal1 acts as a repressor of alternative cellular programs such as the cardiac lineage and is actively needed to initiate the EHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lancrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Org et al., 2015</xref>). In this context, our single-cell transcriptomics approach allowed us to shed light on an unexpected change in Fli1 activity as a consequence of Runx1 expression. This appears to be a critical process for the proper completion of the EHT. Conditions reinforcing the interaction between Runx1 and Fli1 would probably help to tilt the balance towards the hematopoietic cell fate. Likewise, preventing the Fli1–Runx1 interaction could potentially impair the formation of blood cells from endothelium.</p><p>More generally, a dual competing function for a unique transcription factor might be a key process for other developmental transitions such as the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The bioinformatics approach that we have used in this work could be readily applicable to the study of other developmental processes and could help to address this type of question. Finally, the discrepancy observed between bulk and single-cell analyses in this work could also exist in other studies of TF complexes, which could prompt researchers in different fields to revisit previous assumptions using our approach.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6 N, <italic>Gfi1:GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yücel et al., 2004</xref>) and <italic>Gfi1b:GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vassen et al., 2007</xref>) mouse lines were used. <italic>Gfi1</italic><sup>+/GFP</sup> and <italic>Gfi1b</italic><sup>+/GFP</sup> were crossed with each other to generate <italic>Gfi1</italic><sup>+/GFP</sup><italic>Gfi1b</italic><sup>+/GFP</sup> animals.

For iCbfb, iRunx1, iLmo2, iGata2 and iFli1 ESC lines, the transcription factor coding sequences were tagged in 5’ with an 8His-tag and amplified by PCR from differentiated ESC cDNA. The 8His-tagged coding sequences were then inserted into a pGEM-t-easy before cloning into the p2lox plasmid. For iTal1, iLyl1 and iErg, the 8His-tagged coding sequences were synthetized and cloned into a pUC57 Simple by the GenScript Gene Synthesis Service (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genscript.com/">http://www.genscript.com/</ext-link> gene_synthesis.html). The 8His-tagged coding sequences were then cloned from the pUC57 Simple into the p2lox plasmid. For each of the generated p2lox plasmids, a Kozak sequence was then added at the start codon by PCR cloning.

For the i8TFs ESC line, three individual constructs were synthetized and cloned into a pUC57 plasmid by the GenScript Gene Synthesis Service. Construct one was composed of the coding sequence for V5-Erg-T2A-V5-Lmo2. Construct two was composed of the coding sequence for HA-Tal1-T2A-cmyc-Fli1-T2A-FLAG-Lyl1-T2A. Construct three was composed of the coding sequence for FLAG-Runx1-T2A-FLAG-Cbfb-T2A-HA-Gata2-T2A. All three constructs were flanked by a start codon and two stop codons, together with the proper restriction sites for cloning into the p2lox plasmid, in order to allow their individual use. They also contain specific restriction sites for their excision, the addition of any of the other constructs, or the removal of any of the factor sequences. Construct one together with the start codon and two stop codons was cloned into the p2lox plasmid. Then, Construct two was added between the start codon and Construct one by classic cloning. Finally, Construct three was added between the start codon and Construct two to obtain the p2lox-8TFs. This plasmid was then transfected into the A2lox.Cre ESC line for the generation of the i8TFs. For the i5TFs, the intermediate p2lox construct containing Construct one and Construct two was used to generate the ESC line. For the i6TFs, V5-Erg and cmyc-Fli1 were successively excised from the p2lox-8TFs by classic cloning to generate the p2lox-6TFs used for the generation of the inducible ESC lines. The empty ESC line was generated using the basic p2lox plasmid and following the same procedure.

Cells from Anti-Mouse CD41 PE (MWReg30, eBioscience)/Anti Mouse CD144 (VE-cadherin) eFluor 660 (eBioBV13, eBioscience) staining were single-cell sorted in the pre-filled 96-well plates (BioRad) using the FACSAria system (Becton Dickinson). The plates were snap-frozen on dry ice immediately after sorting and stored at −80°C for a maximum of 1 week. To perform RT/Specific Target Amplification (RT/STA), 4 µl of a reaction mix — composed of 2.8 µl of Resuspension buffer, 0.2 µl of SuperScript III and Platinum Taq polymerase from the CellsDirect One-Step qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) and 1 µl of 500 nM outer primer mix (primer sequence list, see table below) — was added to each well. Plates were first incubated at 50°C for 15 min. followed by incubation at 95°C for 2 min. Then, they were incubated at 95°C for 15 s. followed by incubation at 60°C for 4 min. for 20 cycles. To prepare the sample mixes, 1/5x diluted cDNAs were mixed wiyj the loading reagent (Fluidigm) and SsoFastTM EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad). In parallel, individual assay mixes were prepared as 5 μM inner primer mix, with DNA suspension buffer and the assay loading reagent (Fluidigm). After the priming of 96.96 dynamic array IFC (Fluidigm), the sample mixes and assay mixes were put together in the corresponding inlets and loaded into the chip. Finally, the chip was run in the Fluidigm Biomark HD system by using the Biomark Data Collection Software and the GE96 ×96PCR + Meltv2.pcl program.</p><p>To control for technical variation in our sc-qRT-PCR runs, we used the universal cDNA reverse transcribed by Random Hexamer: Mouse Normal Tissues (BioChain). It allowed us to detect consistently 93 out of our 95 genes of interest. A sample without DNA template was also run each time to test for unspecific PCR amplification.</p><p>The primer list is as follows:</p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table

using FACS enrichment, Fluidigm Suspension Reagent was added in a 3:2 ratio and gently mixed by pipetting. A Fluidigm C1 10–17 uM IFC Chip was primed, 5 µl of cell suspension mix was added to the cell inlet, and the chip was loaded into the C1 instrument. Annotation of cell capture was carried out on a brightfield microscope at 40x magnification and each captured site was noted for having single-cell capture, doublet cell capture or debris. Lysis, reverse transcription, and PCR reagents (Clontech Takara) were then loaded into appropriate inlets as per Fluidigm layout. ERCC spike-in controls (Ambion) were added at a dilution of 1:4000 within the lysis mix to gain limit of detection and normalization in downstream analysis. The IFC was loaded into the C1 instrument overnight using the mRNA-Seq RT and the Amp script, and ~3 µl of cDNA was harvested and diluted in 5 µl of Fluidigm C1 DNA dilution buffer. Size distribution and quantification of individual cDNA samples was obtained using an AATI Fragment Analyzer (AATI) and the cDNA concentration was diluted to 100 pg/µl in 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 for library preparation. Illumina library preparation was carried out using the Nextera XT DNA system (Illumina), but volumes were reduced as per the modified Fluidigm C1 protocol. Tagmentation was performed on all 96 samples using 1.25 µl of cDNA (125 pg total concentration) combined with 2.5 µl of tagmentation buffer (TD) and 1.25 µl of Amplicon Tagment Mix (ATM), and incubated for 10 min at 55 degrees. After incubation, 1.25 µl of Neutrilize Tagment Mix (NT) was added. Illumina PCR barcoded indexes were combined to obtain 96 distinct combinations of i7 and i5 barcodes, and 2.5 µl of combined index was added along with 3.75 µl of Nextera PCR Mix (NPM). Samples were then put through 12 cycles of PCR as per the Illumina protocol. Each column was then pooled into a 0.2 mL 8-strip PCR tube and Ampure XP purification was performed, after which each pool was combined to obtain a single 96-sample multiplexed pool of barcoded library. The final sequencing library was quantified by Qubit (Life Technologies) and size distribution was measured on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. Samples were sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq 2000.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-11"><title>Wafergen single-cell RNA sequencing</title><p>Cells were stained with the Cell Viability Imaging kit (Molecular Probes), which contains Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide, and afterwards were counted with the Moxi Z Mini Automated Cell Counter (ORFLO). Stained cell solution was diluted in a mix with diluent and RNase inhibitor (New England Biolabs) to 1 cell/50 nl for dispensing on the ICell8-chip (Wafergen) with the MultiSample NanoDispenser (Wafergen). Positive and negative controls were prepared according to the ICell8 protocol and dispensed with the MSND into the respective nanowells of the chip. All nanowells of the ICell8 chip were imaged with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus). The images were analyzed with the CellSelect software (Wafergen). Alive single cells, which are Hoechst-33342-positive and propidium-iodide-negative, were selected for lysis and reverse transcription inside the ICell8 chip (200 cells i8TFs + dox, 150 cells i8TFs –dox, 150 Empty –dox and 150 Empty +dox). RT reaction mix containing 5X RT buffer, dNTPs, RT e5-oligo (Wafergen), nuclease-free water, Maxima H Minus RT (Thermo Scientific) and Triton X-100 was prepared and dispensed into the previously selected nanowells with single cells inside. The chip was placed inside a modified SmartChip Cycler (Bio-Rad) for the RT reaction (42°C for 90 min, 85°C for 5 min, 4°C forever).</p><p>The cDNA of all single cells was collected together and further concentrated with the DNA Clean and Concentrator−5 kit (Zymo Research). The Exonuclease I (New England Biolabs) reaction of the cDNA (37°C for 30 min, 80°C for 20 min, 4°C forever) was performed inside a conventional thermal cycler. Afterwards, the cDNA was amplified with the Advantage 2 PCR Kit (Clontech Takara) containing buffer, dNTPs, Amp Primer (Wafergen), polymerase mix and nuclease-free water (95°C for 1 min, 18 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 65°C for 30 s and 68°C for 6 min, followed by 72°C for 10 min and 4°C forever). The amplified cDNA was purified with Ampure XP Beads (Beckmann Coulter). The cDNA size distribution was obtained with the High Sensitivity DNA BioAnalyzer (Agilent) and quantification was performed with the Qubit (Life Technologies). Illumina library preparation was carried out by using Nextera XT DNA (Illumina). Tagmentation was performed in tagment DNA buffer, Amplicon Tagment Mix and 1 ng of purified cDNA (55°C for 5 min and 10°C forever), next Neutralize Tagment Buffer was added (room temperature for 5 min). After incubation, the Nextera<sup>®</sup>XT PCR reaction mix was prepared with Nextera PCR Mastermix, i7 Index Primer from the Nextera Index Kit (Illumina), Nextera Primer P5 and Tagmented cDNA-NT buffer mix (72°C for 3 min, 95°C for 30 s, 12 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s, final 72°C for 5 min and 10°C forever).

Hierarchical clustering and PCAs were performed using the SINGuLAR Analysis toolset (Fluidigm version 3.5) package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">R Core Team , 2016</xref>). Using this toolset, the Ct values were converted into log2ex. Ct value is a relative gene expression value in the log2 domain (assuming that the PCR efficiency is equal to 1). The conversion from Ct to log2ex value is based on the following formulae:</p><p>Log2ex = LOD – Ct, if Ct is less than the limit of detection (LOD)</p><p>Log2ex = 0, if Ct is equal to or greater than LOD.</p><p>Where the default is 24 (the typical Ct value for a single copy of input in the Fluidigm chip). In our case, the Ct value is a relative expression and does not have unit. Hence, following conversion to the Log2ex domain, we labelled the resulting values ‘Log2 Gene Expression’.</p><p>Hierarchical clustering and PCA analyses were performed with the HC() and PCA() functions of this package. The HC function clusters genes by the Pearson Correlation method, that is, co-profiled genes are clustered together and samples are clustered by normalized Euclidian distance (distance/number of genes), representing the average fold change. The HC analysis uses the ‘complete linkage’ method (a bottom-up method) to find similar clusters.

For each chip and each normalization method (four configurations), all significant relationships between the transcriptome and the seed genes were identified using the dcor statistic. The seed genes used for this analysis included the 8 TFs as well as Gata1, Gfi1b, Spi1, Ldb1 and Cbfa2t3. The additional seed genes were selected if they appeared in networks published by at least two different authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonzanni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moignard et al., 2013</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>). The directionality of the relationships (positive correlation, negative correlation or ‘other’) was defined using a two-tailed t-test, direct was based on the sign of the test and ‘other’ was assigned to all genes with uncorrected p-value&gt;0.05. To ensure robustness, we only included relationships that were identified in at least two of the four configurations, and any relationships with conflicting directionalities were assigned to ‘other’. Finally, interactions between seed genes were identified by conditioning the ‘targets’ of each seed gene on the expression of each other seed gene. An interaction was inferred if the relationships between both seed genes and a particular ‘target’ gene increased in strength when conditioned on the other seed gene.</p><p>For the Spearman network analysis, we combined Exp1 and Exp2 into a single expression matrix for each normalization (SF and RUV).

Pooling, library construction and sequencing generated 179 million paired-end sequences using the Illumina Nextera protocol. Note that this shallower sequencing greatly reduces the detection rate of TFs, but the larger number of cells facilitated evaluation of heterogeneity within and between populations. The first read of the pair encodes the well barcode and the UMI (unique molecular identifier) barcode, the second encodes the 3′ end of the transcript. Reads were assigned to the well with the matching barcode. Up to two mismatches are tolerated within the well barcode if the assignment remained non-ambiguous. Cutadapt trimmed poly-A, poly-G and adapter sequences and STAR aligned the reads to the mouse genome build mm10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin, 2011</xref>). FeatureCounts determined all reads in a strand-specific way so that they overlap with exactly one gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liao et al., 2014</xref>). Gene expression levels are calculated by counting the number of distinct UMIs of all gene specific reads (‘UMIs per gene’), as determined by featureCounts. Only uniquely aligned reads were counted. To further reduce the impact of mapping and sequencing errors on the quantification, an UMI barcode error correction and filtering step was introduced. If two or more of the distinct UMIs per gene share a similar barcode, differing by at most one or two mismatches, then they may originate from the same UMI barcode. The UMI barcode is corrected only if it has less than 10% of reads compared to the most abundant one. This correction procedure starts with the UMI barcode, which is supported by the highest number of gene-specific reads, and which determines all similar barcodes and corrects them if applicable. It restarts with all UMI barcodes that have not been considered in a previous iteration until none is left. In a separate filtering step, any of the distinct UMIs per gene that is only supported by one or two aligned reads is completely omitted from the counting. From the resulting count table, all counts originating from the 23 control wells were removed for the subsequent explorative analysis. All remaining wells correspond to single cells. Additional filtering reduced the sparseness found in this gene per cell matrix of UMI counts. Only cells with 1000 or more genes with at least one UMI count and genes with at least one UMI count in 10 or more cells were selected, leaving a matrix of 478 single cells and 10,238 genes. This matrix was scaled and normalized with the Bioconductor package <italic>scater</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCarthy et al., 2017</xref>). The principal components were calculated for the 400 genes that showed the highest variance after subtracting the mean-variance trend of all genes.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Amy J Wagers (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Aviv Regev as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Bergiers et al. leverage the power of single cell gene expression analysis to demonstrate co-expression of heptad transcription factors (Erg, Fli1, Tal1, Lyl1, Lmo2, Runx1 and Gata2) in a subset of embryonic YS and AGM cells that appear to represent pre-HSPCs. They further document distinct patterns of expression of these and other selected genes in other embryonic populations at these anatomical sites at distinct developmental stages, ultimately suggesting the existence of multiple distinct populations with different lineage potential. Finally, applying clever systems for inducible overexpression of one or multiple of these transcription factors in an in vitro ES differentiation system, they demonstrate unique features of the gene expression networks controlled by these TFs, including unexpectedly opposing actions in the specification of endothelial versus pre-HSPC fates that depend upon the specific subset of factors expressed (notably involving a dual role of Fli1, which in collaboration with Erg supports a cell endothelial fate and in collaboration with Runx1/Gata2 supports a hematopoietic fate). They also described the transcriptional changes occurring in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells upon overexpression of the heptad TFs (+Cbfb). Together, these results allow the authors to propose a new molecular model for EHT, and possibly other key developmental transitions that may invoke dual competing TF function. The systems and data described also may be of use in ongoing efforts to optimize the generation of definitive HSCs from pluripotent cell sources. Overall, the work presents new mechanistic insights into the process of blood formation and identifies a previously unrecognized transient population of progenitors in between endothelium and HSPCs. The work is likely to be of interest to a range of investigators studying development and hematopoiesis; however, there are several aspects of the work and presentation that require revision/modification.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript is written in a rather long-winded and confusing manner, such that the main message (Fli1 dual role) is highly diluted. In addition, the figure panels are very small and the text is difficult to read. The authors should edit the manuscript to improve the figure quality/design and flow of the narrative, and to present a more concise and clear analysis of the data and conclusions.</p><p>2) The assumption that the authors identified a pre-HSPC population (in AGM and yolk sac (YS)) based on the expression of hematopoietic and endothelial markers should be better justified. The authors claim that they produced a homogeneous population of pre-HSPCs (+8iTFs + Dox). However, this population does not completely cluster with the pre-HSPCs (detected in vivo in AGM and YS). Does it mean that a certain type of pre-HSPCs is produced in vitro (pro-HSCs, pre-HSCs type I or type II)? The authors should provide a more informative (phenotypic/functional) characterization of this population to support their conclusion.</p><p>3) The rationale for the analysis of the VSM population produced in vitro is unclear. This part of the results cuts the flow of the paper and is very confusing. The enriched VSM population is contaminated by 20% of endothelial cells, rendering the data difficult to interpret. Moreover, the eVSM population is never compared to the VSM cells from the AGM/YS. As VSM cells never give rise to HSCs in the AGM or YS in vivo, the authors should explain why the eVSM population is used to identify the gene regulatory network and not the endothelial cells?</p><p>4) It is not clear whether Erg and Fli1 (or similarly Gata2 and Runx1) have a redundant, complementary or synergistic roles. It would thus be interesting to test them separately (8iTFs without each TF and not without the two TFs at the same time); however, unless the authors have already generated the requisite hES lines, this is likely to require extensive additional studies. If such data are available, they should be added to the paper; however, if these experiments cannot be completed and added to the paper in a timely manner, the authors should instead comment/speculate on their possible individual or redundant roles.</p><p>5) The authors present several sets of sc-qRT-PCR data and use correlative analyses to make comparisons. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>, cell clusters are defined independently by hierarchical clustering (HC) in AGM and YS. The clusters are then aligned by correlation coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or in a PCA projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and the authors state they are similar. How would the HC analysis look if the data was analysed together? Ideally, an integrated analysis of all sc-qRT-PCR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) together should be added to give a more objective impression of similarities / differences.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> the authors use a low-dimensional space defined by the PCA of AGM and YS cells and map additional data (from <italic>Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup> Gfi1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells) on top. They conclude from the location of these data in between Endo and pre-HSPC that the mutant cells were trapped in a transition state. In my experience, mapping data onto existing PCA spaces tends to map the data somewhere in the middle. How would this look if PCA was performed on all data? Which genes are responsible for the similarity and which ones fail to make the switch to pre-HSPC?</p><p>7) Why did the authors choose to include Cbfb with the heptad of TFs from Wilson et al. (Introduction section)? This seems kind of arbitrary and should be explicitly justified. Is this important for the results?</p><p>8) There seems to be a lot of fluctuation in the counts of the differentiation assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, even in -dox (in which all cells should be the same). At the same time, the statistics on these data seem questionable. Why would the difference between 7=&gt;16 (iFli1 VSM) be significant, but the difference 22=&gt;0 (i8TFs EryPCs_II) not? Overall, the effects for the i8TFs seem striking enough compared to the rest to be convincing, but the more subtle differences between the single TF lines could be easily overlooked. The authors may need to increase the numbers on these data to make the conclusions more robust, and they also should check their statistics.</p><p>9) The authors use the PCA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> to illustrate that i8TFs+dox make a very homogeneous population of pre-HSPCs. However, there seems to be a lot of variance not explained by the two shown dimensions. Why is that and does this bring into question the homogeneity of the population? Please provide additional text to explain/justify the conclusions drawn.</p><p>10) The focus on eVSM (subsection “Identification of gene regulatory network from single cell RNA sequencing data”) is confusing. Earlier they say that eVSM did not convert so well to pre-HSPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Their microarray data shows more DEGs, but the induced cells from eVSM also had limited differentiation capacity (would that capacity be better if fully converted cells were FACS-purified first?). Is the limited efficiency in the induction in any way related to the fact that only a small percentage of the transcriptional variation is due to the difference between +dox and -dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> =&gt; PC2, variance explained = 1%)? Please add text to address/explain these points.</p><p>11) The GRN analyses are also rather confusing: Why were two networks used? The authors depict one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) but show descriptive metrics for another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, network not shown anywhere). This is a bit misleading. Why were additional genes used to infer the first, smaller network? Did it not work otherwise? How were the additional TFs chosen? What does the network really tell us? 26 of 145 target genes were found in the network. That's only 18%. Given that the network has over 7k genes in it, is this actually any more than expected by pure chance? In the end, the authors derive from the whole GRN part of the analysis the conclusion that there are subsets of TFs tilting the cell fate either toward hematopoiesis or toward endothelial fate (which is good and interesting), but it seems that maybe this could have been achieved by just looking at the correlation matrix in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>? Please add further text addressing these points and explaining/justifying the analytical workflow and output.</p><p>12) The authors deliberately chose a design to minimize batch effects (subsection “Identification of gene regulatory network from single cell RNA sequencing data”) for the C1 scRNA-seq data (which is great). However, they should also address in the text whether batch effects might in any way have affected other conclusions in the paper. Many runs of the PCR assays were performed; the authors should explain how they were balanced.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Single cell transcriptomics reveals a new dynamical function of transcription factors during embryonic hematopoiesis&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Aviv Regev (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>In particular, while the manuscript has been greatly improved, there is a remaining confusion on the number of mice and independent experiments conducted in critical points in the paper, and on how a limited number of replicates in some places can be mitigated. Three items in particular need to be addressed:</p><p>1) The initial experiment (single cell qPCR) was based on a single litter replicate (one experiment, 4-6 embryos). This is partly mitigated by the follow ups, but needs to be stated clearly by discussing the shortcomings of the initial experiments. In addition, if any other data (including published data from other studies) can be highlighted as an external replicate it would be helpful as well, but is not strictly required.</p><p>2) Throughout the study, it is exceedingly difficult to follow the number of animals and independent experiments performed and thus to assess the strength of key conclusions. This is exacerbated because of the number of datasets and heterogeneity of technologies and experimental setups. We ask that the authors prepare an overview table listing clearly all the different samples used for the analyses in this paper. (We note that the meaning of &quot;n=&quot; is often quite obscure in the context of the paper).</p><p>3) The low numbers in the colony-forming assays is a particular concern. As it limits the reliability of the results presented in the respective part of the paper. To their credit, the authors are rather cautious about their claims about these assays. We appreciate that the comparison in the same assay enhances the validity, but ask that the authors note the samm number.</p><p>The full reviews are provided for context below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Bergiers and colleagues made great efforts to respond to my comments and concerns, and to improve the fluidity and understanding of the manuscript. Figures are more readable and better organized (although the readability of the gene names beside the heatmaps could be improved).</p><p>Major comments</p><p>1) A better identification of the pre-HSPC population generated by the authors was necessary. However, the fact that the population resembles to phenotypically defined pro-HSCs but to molecularly defined pre-HSCs type I reflect (to my opinion) the heterogeneity of the population generated. A functional analysis (e.g. transplantation, reaggregated in vitro culture) would have certainly better identified the pre-HSPC population. These experiments are time consuming but would have been of a great interest for the readers.</p><p>2) The part of the eVSM population was reduced and the indication that this population was used as a tool clarifies this part of the manuscript.</p><p>3) It would have been very interesting to test each TF separately (8iTFs without each TF and not without the two TFs at the same time). But discussing the potent redundancy or complementarity of these factors improved the discussion.</p><p>Finally, I was extremely surprised that in the revised version (where the number of experiments performed was specified), it was mentioned that only one experiment was performed by tissue and time point, using very few embryos (4 to 6 embryos). Three independent experiments are usually performed to avoid the risk of biased data.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In brief, the revised manuscript submitted by Bergiers and colleagues has been markedly improved. I appreciate the additional analyses added and I can sort of accept the rationale / justification for starting experiment with eVSM, for arbitrarily including Cfcb, etc.</p><p>There are two main problems with this manuscript that still bother me:</p><p>1) Network analysis: The construction of the &quot;small&quot; network seems too arbitrary and the authors' rebuttal does little to convince me otherwise. Basically, the authors tried to build a network from the heptad of TFs (+Cfcb which they had arbitrarily added in before) and found it didn't give them any insights. So they looked at their favourite papers and added more nodes until they got an interesting result. How robust is this analysis? Can the same conclusions be reached by adding other TFs into the network? Do the conclusions hold if some nodes are removed? If those TFs are also considered of central importance to the processes studied, why were they not included in the previous experiments (&quot;i12TFs&quot;)? To me, it would make a lot more sense and be much less biased, to build the &quot;big&quot; network (using a fast, but no-so-good correlation measure) first and to use this to inform which additional TFs to add to the small network (by using unbiased metrics calculated on the network, such as the. In their rebuttal, the authors state &quot;the local network […] does not give a global picture of the network in the cell&quot; – I agree, so what's the point of showing this at all? It's just to provide some nice-to-look-at (if you're into that kind of thing) network-y graphics that contains genes that ring interesting to people (because they were hand-picked from previous literature!). In a way, none of this would matter much if the network analysis was just a means to an end – i.e. to find the complementary TF networks biasing cells to different fates. However, the authors try to sell their network analysis approach as some sort of novel tool with wide applicability – which I just think it is not.</p><p>2) Colony-forming assays: The numbers here are weak and the authors pretty much admit that. I understand the experiments are difficult and time-consuming to perform and it wouldn't have been reasonable to ask for additional experiments. Still, I find these data as they stand somewhat unsatisfactory. Do the other reviewers find this convincing enough?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29312.055</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript is written in a rather long-winded and confusing manner, such that the main message (Fli1 dual role) is highly diluted.

To answer it, we have added experiments that are now presented in a part called “in vitro generated Pre-HSPCs share similarities with AGM Pre-HSCs type I”. See also the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>. We characterized the population produced in vitro with the eight TFs and compared it to in vivo cells identified by the group of Alexander Medvinsky (Rybtsov et al., 2014). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, the i8TFs+dox cells are VE-cad+CD45-CD41+CD43- similarly to the in vivo Pro-HSCs. However, a closer transcriptional characterization showed that transcriptionally the i8TFs+dox cells look like Pre-HSCs type I. This is in line with the functional data showing that i8TFs+dox cells are able to generate colonies in CFU-assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) like the Pre-HSCs type I while the Pro-HSCs have little CFU-C activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of Rybtsov et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The rationale for the analysis of the VSM population produced in vitro is unclear.

As VSM cells never give rise to HSCs in the AGM or YS in vivo, the authors should explain why the eVSM population is used to identify the gene regulatory network and not the endothelial cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers; the flow of our manuscript was slowed down because of the part on the eVSM population. We have drastically reduced this section as we explained in our response to the point 1.</p><p>As the reviewers pointed out correctly, the VSM cells do not generate HSC in vivo. That is why we did not isolate them from AGM and Yolk Sac. On the other hand, we did consider them in our in vitro model because the data obtained suggested that these cells were also changing dramatically. Indeed, at the moment of the dox treatment, they were very numerous in the BL-CFC culture (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) while after 48-hours treatment most of the culture is VE-Cad<sup>+</sup> CD41<sup>+</sup> suggesting that all the cells, including VSM cells, reacted to the treatment (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We showed that it was indeed the case (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We found that very interesting and thought that it emphasized the crucial function of the eight TFs.</p><p>Since our main goal was to use single-cell RNA sequencing to study the impact of the simultaneous expression of the eight TFs on the transcriptome, we found that VSM cells were very useful as a tool. Indeed, they express almost none of these TFs while the Endo cells express already Erg, Fli1, Lmo2 and Tal1. To understand how the 8TF induction by dox treatment affected GRNs, we needed to avoid as much as possible cells, which were already undergoing the EHT like the Endo population (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). If we had used the Endo population for this analysis, we would have only a two-fold increase in VE-Cad<sup>+</sup> CD41<sup>+</sup> population between -dox and +dox conditions (43% versus 98%). On the other hand, the eVSM in no dox condition only gave rise to 9% of VE-Cad<sup>+</sup> CD41<sup>+</sup> in comparison to 88% in +dox condition. From this point of view, the eVSM was the most optimal solution because of this difference and also because of the gene expression difference detected by microarrays (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref> and new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary File 5</xref>). Indeed, upregulated genes in eVSM+dox compared to eVSM-dox belonged to the “Immune system process” and “Vascular development” GO terms (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). This suggest the induction in these cells of a dual Endothelial/Hematopoietic identity compatible with the Pre-HSPCs population. Overall, these characteristics facilitated the development of the bioinformatics pipeline necessary to resolve the GRNs. It turned out to be the right approach as we identified Gpr56 as a key target of these TFs and the tools/approaches that we have developed with the eVSMs could be readily used with the Pereira dataset putting us on the track of the Runx1/Fli1 antagonistic function.</p><p>We have added text to explain better the reasons we used the eVSMs (see the first paragraph of the section called “Identification of gene regulatory network from single cell RNA sequencing data”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is not clear whether Erg and Fli1 (or similarly Gata2 and Runx1) have a redundant, complementary or synergistic roles.

Unfortunately, these four additional ESC lines have not been generated and it would have taken more than two months to do the required experiments. Based on sequence homology, we can hypothesize that some redundancy could exist between Erg and Fli1 that are both ETS transcription factors. Wilson and colleagues have also shown that in HPC7 more than 90% of the loci targeted by Fli1 are also targeted by Erg (Wilson et al., 2010). However, these loci represent only about 60% of the ones targeted by Erg, which might suggest a broader role for Erg. The possible redundancy between Erg and Fli1 is also supported by our single TF inducible cell line data. Flow cytometry and single-cell qRT-PCR analyses have shown that both TFs have similar effect on the differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Regarding Runx1 and Gata2, our single TF inducible cell line data support their functional similarities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Additionally, the network analysis suggests that Runx1 and Gata2 could cooperate together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Indeed, they have both similar directional correlations with common targets. Finally, Wilson et al., showed also that Gata2 and Runx1 interact physically in vitro and showed that Runx1<sup>+/−</sup>::Gata2<sup>+/−</sup> compound heterozygous embryos are not viable due to severe hematopoietic defects supporting the notion that the two proteins are involved in the same biological process. Since Gata2 and Runx1 are belonging to two different classes of transcription factors, it is more likely that they have complementary or synergistic role than being redundant.</p><p>Additional text has been added to the discussion in the section discussing our model (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors present several sets of sc-qRT-PCR data and use correlative analyses to make comparisons.

We first combined the populations of AGM and YS to do a hierarchical clustering analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). For both tissues, the groups shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> generally clustered according to their identity although some cells from the intermediary populations (AGM_SC_2 and YS_SC_2) clustered with the Endothelial groups (AGM_SC_1 and YS_SC_1), possibly because of a higher endothelial gene expression.</p><p>Moreover, we combined the single-cell qRT-PCR results of a total of 1,660 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) and compared them to each other using PCA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). As shown in this PCA analysis, the combined analysis of all the sc-qRT-PCR data confirmed what had been stated in the first figures of this manuscript. The expression of the selected 95 genes is sufficient to follow the endothelial to hematopoietic transition. Cells from in vivo AGM and yolk sac, together with in vitro cells from the inducible lines, are spread along the transition without major clustering due to the origin of the cells (in vivo, in vitro, embryonic regions, etc). The clusters identified based on the individual analyses presented in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> can be located on the PCA and fit with our previous observations. Vascular smooth muscle cells from in vitro analyses are clustering apart. Endothelial clusters from AGM, YS and in vitro samples are all in the same part of the PCA plot, connected to hematopoietic progenitors through the Pre-HSPCs from in vivo and in vitro samples and Pre-HSCs from in vivo. As expected, Pro-HSCs are located closer to the endothelial population while the Pre-HSCs type I are closer to the hematopoietic progenitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> the authors use a low-dimensional space defined by the PCA of AGM and YS cells and map additional data (from Gfi1<sup>-/-</sup> Gfi1b<sup>-/-</sup> cells) on top.

Moreover, Cbfb has been shown to be essential for Runx1 function in vivo (Wang et al., 1996; Tahirov et al., 2001). Based on these elements, we considered both proteins to be a single functional unit and that is why Cbfb was included in our polycistronic transgenic construct.

Overall, the effects for the i8TFs seem striking enough compared to the rest to be convincing, but the more subtle differences between the single TF lines could be easily overlooked.

Earlier they say that eVSM did not convert so well to pre-HSPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Their microarray data shows more DEGs, but the induced cells from eVSM also had limited differentiation capacity (would that capacity be better if fully converted cells were FACS-purified first?). Is the limited efficiency in the induction in any way related to the fact that only a small percentage of the transcriptional variation is due to the difference between +dox and -dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> =&gt; PC2, variance explained = 1%)? Please add text to address/explain these points.</p></disp-quote><p>For an explanation of our focus on the eVSM population, please see point 3. However, in order to understand why these cells were not able to give rise to more blood colonies in the CFU-assay, we re-examined our microarray data and compared eVSM+dox and Endo+dox (see contrast VSMact_Endoact worksheet in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary File 5</xref>). We found genes, which could potentially be responsible for the incapacity of the eVSM+dox to generate blood colonies. Tgfb2 an inhibitor of the EHT (Vargel et al., 2016), the VSM markers Pdgfrb, Tagln and Acta2 were all expressed at a higher level in eVSM+dox while Csf3r, coding for the receptor of the hematopoietic growth factor G-CSF was downregulated in eVSM+dox. Among all these genes, we believe that the expression of Tgfb2 could be the main reason why there were few colonies formed from eVSM+dox cells. The expression of VSM markers could be indicative of the fact that the VSM program has not been fully repressed which could also explain why few blood colonies were generated.

The authors depict one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) but show descriptive metrics for another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, network not shown anywhere).

The seed genes would by construction be the most important in the local network. However, because dCor is very slow it is computationally infeasible to calculate the global network with it.</p><p>In contrast, the second network in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) is the global network – i.e. the correlation between all possible pairs of genes was calculated – so it makes sense to look at how important the seed genes are in the whole network.

Since these factors are well established as important in EHT and hematopoiesis, we hypothesized that these factors may participate in more complex relationships through other TFs we had not initially considered. Thus, we considered several prominent papers (Beck et al., 2013; Moignard et al., 2015; Tanaka et al., 2012; Bonzanni et al., 2013; Moignard et al., 2013) examining these processes and added additional TFs which were included in the network in at least two papers by different authors. For consistency, all 13 TFs were used in the Pereira data as well, however the inverse relationship between Fli1 and Runx1 apparent in this network does not depend on the inclusion of the additional TFs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref> right panel).
