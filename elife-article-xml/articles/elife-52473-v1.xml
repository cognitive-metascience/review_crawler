helper cell (Tfh)-dependent structures that form in response to vaccination, producing long-lived antibody secreting plasma cells and memory B cells that protect against subsequent infection. With advancing age the GC and Tfh cell response declines, resulting in impaired humoral immunity. We sought to discover what underpins the poor Tfh cell response in ageing and whether it is possible to correct it. Here, we demonstrate that older people and aged mice have impaired Tfh cell differentiation upon vaccination. This deficit is preceded by poor activation of conventional dendritic cells type 2 (cDC2) due to reduced type 1 interferon signalling. Importantly, the Tfh and cDC2 cell response can be boosted in aged mice by treatment with a TLR7 agonist. This demonstrates that age-associated defects in the cDC2 and Tfh cell response are not irreversible and can be enhanced to improve vaccine responses in older individuals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>germinal centre response</kwd><kwd>ageing</kwd><kwd>t follicular helper cells</kwd><kwd>dendritic cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BBS/E/B/000C0407</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linterman</surname><given-names>Michelle A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BBS/E/B/000C0408</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linterman</surname><given-names>Michelle A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>637801</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linterman</surname><given-names>Michelle A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>675395</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linterman</surname><given-names>Michelle A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Older individuals have impaired conventional dendritic cell and T follicular helper cell formation upon vaccination, which can be rescued by treatment with a TLR7 agonist.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Successful T cell-dependent vaccines induce the formation of germinal centres (GCs) in secondary lymphoid organs. The GC is a specialised microenvironment that produces long-lived humoral immunity that can provide protection against subsequent infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vinuesa et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the success of T cell-dependent vaccines to date in children and younger adults, vaccination is less effective in older persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Govaert et al., 1994</xref>). This has been proposed to be a result of a deterioration in the magnitude and quality of the GC response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aberle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Linterman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gustafson et al., 2018</xref>). Within the GC, antigen-specific GC B cells clonally expand and somatically hypermutate the genes encoding their B cell receptor. This mutational process, coupled with subsequent affinity-based selection, results in the emergence of plasma cells and memory B cells that bind antigen with improved affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stebegg et al., 2018</xref>). The GC response is a highly collaborative process that requires multiple cell types to interact at the right place and the right time: therefore, defects in one or more of these cell types could underlie the poor GC response observed after vaccination of older individuals. Both T cell-intrinsic defects and changes in the microenvironment have been implicated in the diminished GC response observed in older individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garcia and Miller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eaton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lefebvre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Linterman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sage et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gustafson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nikolich-Žugich, 2018</xref>), but the precise cellular and molecular changes that cause the age-dependent defects in the GC response remain unclear.</p><p>The GC response is absolutely dependent on T cell help. This is delivered by a specialised subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells called T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which provide survival and differentiation signals to GC B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vinuesa et al., 2016</xref>). Tfh cell differentiation from naïve T cells is initiated by priming by dendritic cells (DCs), which provide three signals to support Tfh cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Krishnaswamy et al., 2018</xref>): peptide-MHC-II, co-stimulation in the form of the CD28 ligands CD80 and CD86, and cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12 and IL-27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eddahri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vinuesa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Webb and Linterman, 2017</xref>). Several DC subtypes can initiate Tfh cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chakarov and Fazilleau, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dahlgren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Levin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barbet et al., 2018</xref>), but migratory conventional type 2 dendritic cells (cDC2s) have been proposed as the dominant Tfh cell-priming DC subset after vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krishnaswamy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Krishnaswamy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Durand et al., 2019</xref>). Tfh precursor cells form after interactions with cDC2s, and subsequent interactions with B cells support completion of Tfh cell differentiation and localisation to the GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goenka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Baumjohann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barnett et al., 2014</xref>). Once within the GC, Tfh cells act as the gatekeepers of the B cell response by providing survival signals to the highest-affinity GC B cells, thereby regulating which B cells are able to exit the GC as long-lived plasma cells or memory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Victora et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gitlin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goenka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vinuesa et al., 2016</xref>). The selective help that Tfh cells provide is essential for the quality of the GC response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Victora et al., 2010</xref>), and for preventing the emergence of autoreactive B cell clones from the GC as long-lived plasma cells or memory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Linterman et al., 2009</xref>). An impairment in the formation of Tfh cells has been implicated in the defective GC response in aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lefebvre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sage et al., 2015</xref>). In this study we sought to identify the mechanism that underlies poor Tfh cell formation in ageing, and to test whether it is possible to reverse the age-dependent defects in Tfh cells.</p><p>Here, we report that the circulating counterparts of GC-Tfh cells are diminished in older persons after seasonal influenza vaccination. This impairment in Tfh cell differentiation in humans could be recapitulated in 2-year-old mice, which had fewer antigen-specific Tfh cells in the draining lymph node (LN) after immunisation than younger adult mice. The defective Tfh cell response in aged mice was linked with impaired T cell priming by cDC2s: after immunisation, fewer antigen-bearing cDC2s were found in the draining LN of aged mice, and those that were present had reduced expression of the co-stimulatory ligands CD80 and CD86. Transcriptional profiling of cDC2s from aged mice revealed that they had a defective response to type I interferon (IFN-I) due to the reduced induction of <italic>Ifnb1 </italic> after immunisation. Topical application of the TLR7 agonist imiquimod increased the number of antigen-bearing cDC2s, their expression of CD80 and CD86, and restored the formation of antigen-specific Tfh cells in aged animals. This demonstrates that age-associated defects in Tfh cell differentiation are not irreversible and that DCs are a rational target to boost responses to vaccination in older individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Circulating Tfh cells are reduced in older persons after vaccination</title><p>Circulating Tfh-like (cTfh) cells can be used in humans as a biomarker of concomitant GC reactions after vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bentebibel et al., 2013</xref>). In our cohort of 18–36 year-old and 65–75 year-old individuals vaccinated with the 2014–2015 trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), there was a five-fold reduction in the production of vaccine-specific antibodies in the serum of older persons compared to younger participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Govaert et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goodwin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sasaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nakaya et al., 2015</xref>).

After vaccination there is an increase in the number of Ki67<sup>+</sup>Bcl6<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>+</sup> GC B cells in the draining inguinal LN in both younger 2–3 month-old adult and aged 22–24 month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, gating strategy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the number of GC B cells was ten-fold lower in the aged mice ten days after immunisation, compared to younger adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This corresponded to a reduction in GC size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and reduced levels of antigen-specific antibodies in the serum of aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>), consistent with previous reports that GC and antibody responses are reduced in magnitude in aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kosco et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Szakal et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van Dijk-Härd et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eaton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Linterman, 2014</xref>).

Consistent with these reports, after subcutaneous immunisation with Eα-GFP the majority of GFP<sup>+</sup> antigen-bearing cells in the draining LN were CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDC2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>; gating strategy from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guilliams et al.

One day after immunisation, aged mice had half the number of total and GFP<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDC2s compared to younger controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>). This was coupled with the reduced presentation of Eα peptide-MHC-II, despite normal total MHC-II expression on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). The expression of the costimulatory ligands CD86, CD80 and the receptor CD40 on the surface of GFP<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDC2s was also diminished, indicating impaired activation of cDC2s with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–P</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that defective T cell priming in draining LNs of aged mice may be due to impaired antigen presentation and/or co-stimulation from the cDC2 subset.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The cDC2 response to IFN-I is reduced in aged mice</title><p>To determine whether impaired T cell priming in aged mice could be due to reduced antigen presentation by cDC2, we used mice that are haploinsufficient for MHC-II (<italic>H2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> ), to mimic this age-associated phenotype in younger mice. cDC2s from <italic>H2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice present less peptide:MHC-II on their surface 22 hr after immunisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>), but do not have an impaired capacity to prime CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells three days after immunisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I–J</xref>). This indicates that a reduction in antigen-presentation alone does not phenocopy the defect in T cell priming seen in aged mice, suggesting other age-dependent changes drive impaired T cell activation. CD80/CD86 co-stimulation is critical for both T cell priming and Tfh cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Platt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2015b</xref>).

Moreover, Wang et al. had previously demonstrated that reducing the magnitude of CD28 signalling in vivo impairs Tfh cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang et al., 2015a</xref>). This implicates the age-associated reduction in the expression of CD80/CD86 on cDC2s as a likely factor that contributes to impaired T cell priming and Tfh cell formation in aged mice.</p><p>To understand the molecular mechanism that underpins the age-associated cellular changes in cDC2s, RNA sequencing was performed on sorted antigen-bearing cDC2s isolated from 2 to 3 month-old and 22–24 month-old mice 22 hr after immunisation with Eα-GFP (gating strategy shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Together, these data suggest that the poor activation of cDC2s in aged animals is not linked with cell-intrinsic defects in their IFN-I response, but rather with impaired early induction of IFN-I in their microenvironment.</p><p>Many different cell types can produce IFN-I upon infection or immunisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Swiecki and Colonna, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ali et al., 2019</xref>). To determine which cells express IFN-I in the draining LN after immunisation we performed RT-qPCR for <italic>Ifnb1</italic> in different FACS-sorted LN cell populations. This revealed that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and CD64<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages express the highest levels of <italic>Ifnb1</italic> 16 hr after immunisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>). This indicates a potential link between age-associated defects in cDC2s and the reduced production of <italic>Ifnb1</italic> by pDCs and macrophages.</p><p>Previous reports have described an age-associated decline in IFN-I production by pDCs in both humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stout-Delgado et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Panda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sridharan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agrawal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Agrawal et al., 2017</xref>). In line with this, we found that age-associated defects in cDC2 activation coincided with reduced numbers of pDCs in aged, 22–24 month-old mice compared to adult controls upon immunisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>). To understand whether the reduction in pDCs was due to the aged microenvironment, we irradiated aged mice and reconstituted these mice with BM cells from 2 to 3 month-old animals. This revealed that the reduced number of pDCs in ageing is not an intrinsic feature of aged stem cells, but is driven by age-associated changes in their microenvironment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P</xref>). In these chimeras GFP<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup>cDC2 cell numbers and the expression of CD80/86 on GFP<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDC2 cells derived from young stem cells were reduced in aged BM recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q–S</xref>). Together, this suggests that the poor activation of cDC2s in the LNs of aged animals could be driven by reduced numbers of IFN-I-producing pDCs due to age-related changes in their microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Older persons have impaired IFN-I responses after vaccination</title><p>As observed in mice, the expression of IFN-I inducible genes is increased in the blood of people in the first few days following vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nakaya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Athale et al., 2017</xref>). Using data from Henn and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Henn et al., 2013</xref>), an early IFN-I gene signature was identified after seasonal influenza vaccination in humans. This response peaks in the blood one day after vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We further curated this list of IFN-I responsive genes to identify those that are robustly induced in human blood one day after vaccination.

Day one samples from young people clustered distinctly from their pre-vaccination samples, whereas older persons showed a diminished early IFN-I response, as shown by a shorter IFN distance between day 0 and day 1 samples on the PCA plot. The IFN-I distance was reduced by half in older compared to younger individuals (p&lt;0.001).

Hence, we hypothesised that reduced IFN-I signalling in cDC2s of aged mice could be linked with defective T cell priming. Blockade of IFN-I signalling prior to immunisation significantly reduced the expression of the co-stimulatory ligands CD80 and CD86 on cDC2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>), showing that a reduction of IFN-I signalling can partly recapitulate the ageing cDC2 phenotype.

This, together with the data presented here, demonstrates that changing vaccination approaches is a rational strategy for improving vaccine efficacy in older persons, a challenge of increasing importance with the rising population age world-wide.</p><p>Ageing has been reported to impair DC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agrawal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Moretto et al., 2008</xref>), the production of IFN-I cytokines by pDCs in both humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stout-Delgado et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Panda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sridharan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agrawal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Agrawal et al., 2017</xref>), and the formation of Tfh cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garcia and Miller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eaton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lefebvre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Linterman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gustafson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nikolich-Žugich, 2018</xref>). In addition, Brahmakshatriya and colleagues have demonstrated that transferring activated, in vitro BM-derived DCs into aged mice can boost both the GC and Tfh cell response upon immunisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brahmakshatriya et al., 2017</xref>). Our study demonstrates that age-associated defects in the early induction of IFN-I expression, probably by pDCs and macrophages, results in impaired expression of co-stimulatory molecules on cDC2s. The impact of reduced IFN-I stimulation on cDC2s in aged mice can be multifactorial: in DCs, IFN-Is promote the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and the cytokines IL-6, IL-27 and IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Luft, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Moretto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cucak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Batten et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gringhuis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hassanzadeh-Kiabi et al., 2017</xref>). These molecules have been shown to enhance the expression of Bcl6, CXCR5 and ICOS by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, thereby supporting differentiation towards the Tfh cell phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cucak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barbet et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, IL-6 production is reduced in DCs from aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brahmakshatriya et al., 2017</xref>), which may act together with reduced co-stimulation to contribute to poor Tfh cell priming in aged mice.</p><p>In an attempt to enhance cDC2 and Tfh cell responses upon vaccination, we applied a cream containing the TLR7-agonist imiquimod, which has been shown to induce IFN-Is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bottrel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sauder, 2003</xref>) to the skin of mice upon immunisation. Treatment with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod at the time of immunisation restored IFN-I signalling in cDC2s in aged mice, increased their numbers in the draining lymph node and enhanced CD80/CD86 expression on their surface. This demonstrated that IFN-I is an important signalling pathway to target to improve cDC2 functions in ageing. However, IFN-I signalling in cDC2s was not uniquely required for the imiquimod-mediated increase in Tfh cell numbers in young mice. This suggests that other, non-IFN driven effects of imiquimod, such as IL-6 production, can support Tfh cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schön and Schön, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Walter et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively, it may be that the induction of IFN-I signalling in cells other than DCs, such as B cells or Tfh cells themselves is sufficient to promote Tfh cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Le Bon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hervas-Stubbs, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nakayamada et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Riteau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Together, this indicates that the TLR7 agonist imiquimod can boost cDC2 and Tfh cells using more than one mechanism, reinforcing its potential as a vaccine adjuvant.</p><p>In our experiments, imiquimod treatment rescued the age-dependent defects in cDC2s and Tfh cell differentiation but did not fully restore GC B cell numbers or early antigen-specific antibody responses in aged mice to levels observed in younger adult mice. This could be due to additional age-associated changes in other cell types involved in the GC and extrafollicular antibody response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Linterman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gustafson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nikolich-Žugich, 2018</xref>). The most obvious hypothesis to explain a poor GC response is that ageing results in cell-intrinsic defects in the GC B cells themselves. However, adoptive transfers of aged B cells into young hosts show that B cells from aged mice are capable of forming GCs in a young environment, suggesting that a B cell-intrinsic defect is not the cause of the poor GC response in aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yang et al., 1996</xref>). These data therefore implicate B cell-extrinsic factors as additional contributors to the poor GC response in ageing. It is noteworthy that both T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells and FDCs have been linked to the age-dependent diminution of the GC response. The GC response is negatively regulated by Tfr cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stebegg et al., 2018</xref>), that are reported to be increased in number in aged mice and this overrepresentation of Tfr cells may result in excessive suppression of the GC response in older animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sage et al., 2015</xref>). There is also evidence that FDCs, stromal cells which are essential for the maintenance of the GC, are impaired in ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). FDCs in aged mice form smaller networks and present fewer antigen-containing immune complexes on their surfaces after immunisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aydar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Turner and Mabbott, 2017</xref>). This is likely to affect the ability of B cells to capture antigen for presentation to Tfh cells, which in turn provide B cell growth and differentiation cues. This suggests that the age-associated defect in GC B cell expansion in mice is linked not only with a defect in T cell priming but also with other factors such as reduced antigen retention on FDCs and increased suppression by Tfr cells.</p><p>Several strategies are currently being used to enhance the response to vaccination in older persons, including modifications of adjuvants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frech et al., 2005</xref>) or administration of increased antigen doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Remarque et al., 1993</xref>). Hung and co-workers have shown that topical imiquimod treatment at the time of vaccination enhances the antibody responses to influenza vaccination in both younger and older persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hung et al., 2016</xref>). We have previously shown that the poor gut GC response in aged mice can be boosted by replenishing the gut microbiome with that of a younger animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stebegg et al., 2019</xref>). Together with the data presented here, this demonstrates that age‐related defects in the GC response are not irreversible and can be targeted therapeutically to improve immune responses in older individuals. Because imiquimod can correct defective IFN-I signalling and the associated cellular defects in cDC2s, and can also boost Tfh cell formation in aged animals, this compound could play a key role in improving T-dependent vaccine responses, especially in the older members of our communities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human seasonal influenza vaccination cohort</title><p>The main research objective of the human seasonal influenza vaccination study was to characterise the cTfh and antibody response against seasonal influenza vaccination in humans in different age groups.

Blinding was not always possible due to visible phenotypic differences between aged and young mice. For ageing experiments, a minimum of 5 mice per group were chosen based on previous experience in the lab comparing GC responses in young and aged mice. Limited availability of aged mice was a restricting factor in our study design. A minimum of 3 mice per group were chosen for mechanistic studies, based on a literature-based assessment of the expected effect size between study groups. Due to limited availability of aged female mice, all experiments with aged mice were conducted with males. Other experiments were conducted with both male and female mice. All experiments were repeated 2–4 times. Significant changes were reproducible between experimental repeats. Some of the aged mice carried lymphomas or solid tumours which affected their immune system, these mice were excluded from the analysis based on the following criteria: Mice with visible lymphomas or large expansions of Ki67<sup>+</sup> proliferating lymphocytes (as determined by Tukey's outlier test) were excluded.

The next day, a single colony was transferred into 5 ml LB and incubated at 37 °C while shaking. The next day, these 5 ml were used to inoculate 1L LB. When the culture was growing in log phase, IPTG was added to a final volume of 1 mM. The culture was left to shake overnight at 37 °C, then the bacteria were pelleted at 5000 g for 15 min. After discarding the supernatant, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 20 ml lysis buffer (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole at pH 8.0) by vortexing and incubated on ice for 15 min in ice. After five repeated sonication steps on ice at 30 W for 60 s, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 30 min. This step was repeated until all Eα-GFP was released and the bacterial pellet did not appear green anymore. The clear, green lysate was filtered first through a 0.45 µm syringe filter, then through a 0.22 µm syringe filter.

IFNAR1 blocking was achieved by intraperitoneal injection of 0.75 mg of anti-IFNAR1 blocking antibody or the appropriate isotype control (BioXCell #BE0083) in 200 µl PBS 20 hr before immunisation with Eα-GFP. To block CD28 co-stimulation, 10–100 µg of Abatacept were injected intraperitoneally immediately prior to immunisations with HEL in Alum.

As a result, it is a topic of current interest to discover the details of how this occurs in order to find strategies to improve vaccine response in aged cohorts. In this study, Stebegg et al., demonstrate that Tfh responses are reduced in both aged humans and mice and suggest that impaired type-I interferon signaling in cDC2 results in reduced CD80 and CD86, which in turn affects Tfh formation and antibody responses. Overall, the paper is well written and covers a topic of significant interest. However, there are a few issues that need to be cleaned up.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Impaired DC activation/Tfh generation in ageing, and the importance of type-I IFN signaling in DCs for Tfh generation, have been previously published. In this regard, the current study mechanistically links previous observation to explain the defective Tfh generation in ageing by finding the reduced type-I IFN signaling in DCs in aged mice. Given that DCs from aged mice were able to respond normally to exogenous IFNa, the reduced amount of IFNa/b produced in aged mice after immunization or infection could explain the defective Tfh generation. What type of cells produce IFNa/b in response to immunization for proper cDC2 activation? The IFNb producing cells should be identified in Figure 5F.</p><p>2) Figure 8: The authors use Imiquimod to induce IFN signaling and restore cDC2 function in aged mice. While these data are of interest Imiquimod is not a specific inducer of interferon signaling and also acts via a range of other pathways to induce other Tfh relevant factors such as IL-6. (Br J Dermatol. 2007 Dec;157 Suppl 2:8-13. Imiquimod: mode of action. Schön MP1, Schön M.). This is brought into particular focus by the title of the paper. The CD11c conditional IFNαR mouse used in Figure 7 should be used to confirm if the effect of imiquimod is dependent on IFN signaling in this context.</p><p>1) In Figure 3G, # of GFP+cDC2 in draining LNs was reduced after immunization of aged mice with Ea-GFP. Does this mean that ability of cDC2s in aged mice to endocytose antigens is defective or that total number of cDC2 in draining LNs of aged mice is decreased?</p><p>2) Antigen-specific antibody response (High affinity vs low affinity in case of NP immunization) should be shown in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 7, Figure 8.</p><p>3) Does Imiquimod also have a Tfh enhancing effect in young mice? Some caution has to be used when an agent that enhances responses in all populations is interpreted as specifically restoring a sub-population specific defect.</p><p>4) In Figure 3 the authors note that the aged cDC2 have reduced MHCII, CD80, CD86 and CD40. In Figure 4 they attempt to unpick this by using CTLA-4Ig in Figure 4 which reduces T-cell proliferation. Does it also reduce the% Tfh? However, while it is possible to use CTLA-4Ig to demonstrate the broad point that blocking CD80 and CD86 impacts T-cell proliferation and Tfh formation it not clear how this provides any evidence that loss of CD80 and CD86 on cDC2 is the specific cause of low of Tfh in aged mice. These data could be moved to the supplemental material. It is reasonable to speculate that the changes to CD86 and CD80 seen in Figure 3 may have a role, and it has previously been demonstrated that even modest changes to CD28 signaling may be enough to alter Tfh formation (Wang, 2015), but the authors should be aware that they have not proved this experimentally.</p><p>5) Figure 7: E and G. Representative data are shown from only one group and so does not allow any comparison. Please include examples from both groups.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52473.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>A number of studies have demonstrated that vaccine responses are impaired in older patient populations leaving them vulnerable to infections such as influenza.

In this regard, the current study mechanistically links previous observation to explain the defective Tfh generation in ageing by finding the reduced type-I IFN signaling in DCs in aged mice.

What type of cells produce IFNa/b in response to immunization for proper cDC2 activation? The IFNb producing cells should be identified in Figure 5F.</p></disp-quote><p>To identify the cellular source of <italic>Ifnb1</italic> production after immunisation we sorted T cells, B cells, macrophages, plasmacytoid DCs (pDC), cDC1 and cDC2/Langerhans cells from the lymph node of either unimmunised or immunised mice. RT-qPCR shows that pDCs and CD64<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages produced the highest levels of <italic>Ifnb1</italic> after immunisation. This potentially implicates changes in the number or function of these cells in ageing that leads to a reduced IFN-I response in cDC2s. Interestingly, there is an age-associated decrease in pDC numbers which may contribute to the phenotype observed in aged mice. In bone marrow (BM) chimeras where aged mice were irradiated and reconstituted with BM from younger adult mice, the reduction in pDC numbers persists in the aged host, indicating a cell-extrinsic cause of reduced pDCs in aged mice. In these chimeras, the number of GFP<sup>+</sup> cDC2 is diminished, as was their expression of CD80/86, suggesting that the aged microenvironment, and potentially the reduction of IFN-I-producing pDC contributes to impaired dendritic cell activation in ageing. All these data have been included in Figure 4. We have also included a section in the Material and Methods section to describe how the cell sort was performed.</p><p>To further exclude any contribution of cell-intrinsic factors to the reduced IFN-I response of cDC2s in aged mice, we compared the expression of Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in cDC2s from adult and aged mice upon ex vivo treatment with low levels of IFNα. These data are included in Figure 4 and revealed that the upregulation of the ISGs <italic>Ifit1</italic> and <italic>Mx1</italic> in cDC2s are intact in aged mice, consistent with the pSTAT1 data provided in the original version of the paper. This supports the interpretation of the data that aged cDC2s are capable of responding to IFN-I and do not exhibit cell-intrinsic defects in IFN signalling.</p><p>These new results have been incorporated into the manuscript as follows:</p><p>Subsection “The cDC2 response to IFN-I is reduced in aged mice”:</p><p>“STAT1 phosphorylation levels and the upregulation of the ISGs <italic>Ifit1</italic> and <italic>Mx1</italic> in cDC2s were intact in aged mice upon ex vivo treatment with low levels of IFNα (Figure 4G-J). […] Together, this suggests that the poor activation of cDC2s in the LNs of aged animals could be driven by reduced numbers of IFN-I-producing pDCs due to age-related changes in their microenvironment.”</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“Ageing has been reported to impair DC activation (Agrawal et al., 2007; Moretto, Lawlor and Khan, 2008), the production of IFN-I cytokines by pDCs in both humans and mice (Stout-Delgado et al., 2008b; Panda et al., 2010; Sridharan et al., 2011; Agrawal, 2013; Agrawal, Agrawal and Gupta, 2017), and the formation of Tfh cells (Garcia and Miller, 2001b; Eaton et al., 2004; Lefebvre et al., 2012; Linterman, 2014; Gustafson, Weyand and Goronzy, 2018; Nikolich-Žugich, 2018). In addition, Brahmakshatriya and colleagues have demonstrated that transferring activated, in vitro BM-derived DCs into aged mice can boost both the GC and Tfh cell response upon immunisation (Brahmakshatriya et al., 2017). Our study demonstrates that age-associated defects in the early induction of IFN-I expression, probably by pDCs and macrophages, results in impaired expression of co-stimulatory molecules on cDC2s.”</p><p>Figure 4 legend:</p><p>“(I-J) <italic>Ifit1</italic> (I) and <italic>Mx1</italic> (J) mRNA levels were determined in sorted GFP<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDC2s by RT-qPCR upon ex vivo treatment of LN cells with 50 U murine IFNα for 3 hours.

BM chimeras were administered neomycin in their drinking water for the first four weeks after BM transfers and were used for experiments eight weeks after successful reconstitution.”</p><p>Subsection “Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)”:</p><p>“To determine the IFN-I responsiveness of DCsex vivo, ~2 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells isolated from the inguinal LNs of naïve mice were seeded into sterile round-bottom 96-well plates in 200 µl complete RPMI.

We have done two sets of experiments to address this key point.</p><p>1) <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> miceand controls were treated with imiquimod to determine whether effects of imiquimod on DC numbers and activation early after immunisation are also mediated by IFN-I signalling. These data show that the effect of imiquimod on cDC2 numbers and CD80/86 expression are largely IFN-I driven. These data are now included in Figure 7H-J, and discussed in subsection “The TLR7 agonist imiquimod boosts cDC2s and Tfh cell numbers”.</p><p>“Topical imiquimod treatment of <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice revealed that the enhancing effects of imiquimod on cDC2 numbers and activation were largely, but not completely, dependent on IFN-I signalling (Figure7H-J). This demonstrates that imiquimod treatment can boost the reduced IFN-I response, and revert the numerical and co-stimulatory defects observed in cDC2s from aged mice.”</p><p>Figure 7 legend:</p><p>“(H-J) 2 month old <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice were immunised subcutaneously with Eα-GFP in IFA and some of the mice were additionally treated with imiquimod cream over their immunisation sites. (H) 22 hours later the number of GFP<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDC2 cells in the draining lymph nodes (LNs) were quantified. (I-J) Quantitation of median fluorescence intensity (MFI) levels of CD86 (I) and CD80 (J) on the surface of these GFP<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDC2s. Bar graphs show the results of one of two independent experiments (B-G; n=6 per group/experiment) or the pooled results from two experiments (H-J; n=3-11 per group). Bar height corresponds to the median, and each circle represents one biological replicate. In (B-G) <italic>p</italic>-values were determined using the Mann-Whitney test. In (H-J) <italic>p</italic>-values were determined by comparing each group to the “<italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> no imiquimod control” group using the Kruskal Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple testing correction. Supporting data are shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</p><p>2) To investigate whether the effect of imiquimod on Tfh cell formation is IFN-I-independent, we conducted the experiment suggested by the reviewer and treated 2 month old <italic>Ifnar1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Itgax<sup>cre/+</sup></italic>or <italic>Ifnar1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Itgax<sup>+/+</sup></italic> control mice with imiquimod upon immunisation and analysed Tfh cell formation seven days later. These data show that imiquimod is able to boost Tfh cells to the same extent in <italic>Ifnar1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Itgax<sup>cre/+</sup></italic>mice as in control animals. These data demonstrate that there are IFN-independent effects of imiquimod that are able to boost Tfh cells in younger mice, these data are now included as Figure 8G-H and discussed on page 14. Because of these results we have revised the manuscript to ensure that all conclusions and interpretations are consistent with these new data, this includes revising the Title, Abstract and Discussion section of the paper.</p><p>Title: Rejuvenating conventional dendritic cells and T follicular helper cell formation after vaccination</p><p>Abstract: […] Here, we demonstrate that older people and aged mice have impaired Tfh cell differentiation upon vaccination. This deficit is preceded by poor activation of conventional dendritic cells type 2 (cDC2) due to reduced type 1 interferon signalling. Importantly, the Tfh and cDC2 cell response can be boosted in aged mice by treatment with a TLR7 agonist. This demonstrates that age-associated defects in the cDC2 and Tfh cell response are not irreversible and can be enhanced to improve vaccine responses in older individuals.</p><p>Subsection “The TLR7 agonist imiquimod boosts cDC2s and Tfh cell numbers” “Topical imiquimod treatment potently enhanced total and 1W1K-specific Tfh cell numbers in both 2-3- and 22-24-month-old mice seven days after immunisation (Figure 8A-F).

In Figure 4 they attempt to unpick this by using CTLA-4Ig in Figure 4 which reduces T-cell proliferation. Does it also reduce the% Tfh? However, while it is possible to use CTLA-4Ig to demonstrate the broad point that blocking CD80 and CD86 impacts T-cell proliferation and Tfh formation it not clear how this provides any evidence that loss of CD80 and CD86 on cDC2 is the specific cause of low of Tfh in aged mice. These data could be moved to the supplemental material. It is reasonable to speculate that the changes to CD86 and CD80 seen in Figure 3 may have a role, and it has previously been demonstrated that even modest changes to CD28 signaling may be enough to alter Tfh formation (Wang, 2015), but the authors should be aware that they have not proved this experimentally.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have moved Figure 4 to Supplementary Figure 3—figure supplement 1H-L and changed subsection “The cDC2 response to IFN-I is reduced in aged mice” to clarify our interpretation of the data, particularly with respect to Wang, 2015.</p><p>“By partially blocking these co-stimulatory ligands using a CTLA4-Ig fusion protein in vivo, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in early T cell proliferation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1K-L).
