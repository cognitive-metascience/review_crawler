Although many patients with asthma develop type-2 dominated eosinophilic inflammation, a number of individuals develop paucigranulocytic asthma, which occurs in the absence of eosinophilia or neutrophilia. The aetiology of paucigranulocytic asthma is unknown. However, both respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and mutations in the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (<italic>RAGE</italic>) are risk factors for asthma development. Here, we show that RAGE deficiency impairs anti-viral immunity during an early-life infection with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM; a murine analogue of RSV). The elevated viral load was associated with the release of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) which triggered airway smooth muscle remodelling in early-life. Re-infection with PVM in later-life induced many of the cardinal features of asthma in the absence of eosinophilic or neutrophilic inflammation. Anti-HMGB1 mitigated both early-life viral disease and asthma-like features, highlighting HMGB1 as a possible novel therapeutic target.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21199.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21199.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>asthma</kwd><kwd>paucigranulocytic</kwd><kwd>virus infection</kwd><kwd>RAGE</kwd><kwd>HMGB1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1054081</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Short</surname><given-names>Kirsty Renfree</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1023756</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Upham</surname><given-names>John W</given-names></name><name><surname>Phipps</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Australian Infectious Disease Research Excellence Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phipps</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phipps</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001061</institution-id><institution>Rebecca L.

The asthmatic airway is characterised by numerous structural changes (collectively referred to as ‘airway remodelling’) including increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass, sub-epithelial fibrosis and goblet cell hyperplasia/hypersecretion. Asthma is often considered to be driven by type-2 eosinophilic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lambrecht and Hammad, 2003</xref>). However, approximately half of all patients with asthma do not exhibit eosinophilic inflammation, and accordingly, other asthma phenotypes have been described that include neutrophilic, mixed granulocytic and paucigranulocytic inflammatory phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Simpson et al., 2006</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hinks et al., 2016</xref>). Paucigranulocytic asthma occurs in the absence of pronounced eosinophilia or neutrophilia and in the few studies performed to date, is reported to affect between 32% and 52% of patients with asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Simpson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schleich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Simpson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Porsbjerg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). At present, there is limited information available regarding the stability of this phenotype and little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms or ‘endotype’ that underlies disease development.</p><p>The majority of asthma cases begin in early childhood. Interestingly, O’Reilly and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">O'Reilly et al., 2013</xref>) showed that wheezy preschool children displayed ASM remodelling prior to their diagnosis of asthma as school aged children. Wheeze in children is often associated with a lower respiratory tract infection, raising the possibility that paediatric viral infections contribute to airway remodelling in early life and the subsequent development of asthma in later life. Consistent with this notion, epidemiological studies have documented an association between severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection early in life and asthma development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">James et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, persistent RSV-induced wheezing before 3 years of age is associated with chronic asthma persisting into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taussig et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wright et al., 1989</xref>). However, whether early life viral infections contribute to the development of paucigranulocytic asthma has yet to be investigated.</p><p>In addition to viral infections, specific immune signaling pathways have also been implicated in the development of asthma. For example, we have previously shown that <italic>Tlr7<sup>-/</sup></italic><sup>-</sup> mice display the cardinal features of asthma following an earlier life and later life infection with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM; a murine analogue of RSV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaiko et al., 2013</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that, compared to non-asthmatic individuals, TLR7 function is reduced in adolescents with asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roponen et al., 2010</xref>). There is also a growing body of evidence implicating high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) in disease development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sukkar et al., 2012</xref>). HMGB1 is an alarmin that acts as a non-histone nuclear protein in quiescent cells. Upon cell stimulation (such as by the presence of a pathogen) HMGB1 becomes phosphorylated and is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Upon release, extracellular HMGB1 can bind to receptors such as RAGE, toll-like receptor (TLR) two and TLR4, and trigger a pro-inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lotze and Tracey, 2005</xref>). Increased levels of HMGB1 have been detected in the sputum of patients with asthma and high levels of HMGB1 have been associated with reduced lung function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hou et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The contribution of RAGE to asthma risk and symptoms is less well understood. This receptor is expressed as membrane-bound (mRAGE) and soluble (sRAGE) forms; the latter is produced primarily by shedding of mRAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Raucci et al., 2008</xref>) and is thought to function as a ‘decoy’ receptor, preventing RAGE ligands from interacting with mRAGE, which would normally trigger inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schmidt, 2015</xref>). Of note, a non-synonymous variant (rs2070600) in the <italic>AGER</italic> gene (which encodes RAGE) is a strong determinant of serum sRAGE levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maruthur et al., 2015</xref>), with the rs2070600:C allele (encoding a Gly at position 82) being associated with increased sRAGE. This same allele is associated with decreased risk of allergic asthma (OR = 0.87, p=0.003 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ferreira et al., 2014</xref>]). Taken together, the results from these genetic studies indicate that decreased signalling through mRAGE (as a result of increased sRAGE production) might have a protective effect in allergic asthma. This prediction is complicated by the apparently conflicting observation that rs2070600:C (which results in increased sRAGE) is associated with decreased FEV1/FVC ratio. However, it is important to note that this analysis was performed in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Repapi et al., 2010</xref>), and hence cannot be associated with asthma or allergic disease. Intriguingly, RAGE deficiency or HMGB1 neutralisation ameliorates type-2 inflammation in preclinical models of allergic asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ullah et al., 2014</xref>). However, whether RAGE or HMGB1 contribute to viral bronchiolitis in early life, and the subsequent development of viral-induced asthma, remains to be determined.</p><p>Here, using RAGE deficient mice and PVM infection we show that RAGE deficiency severely impairs antiviral immunity. The resulting increase in viral load in the airway epithelium led to the release of HMGB1, which via the activation of TLR4 was instrumental in driving ASM remodelling during an early life viral infection, as well as the development of mucus hypersecretion and airway hyperreactivity in later life. Critically, these features occurred independently of type-2 inflammation and granulocytic inflammation, suggesting that blocking HMGB1 may be a promising therapeutic approach to prevent the development of airway remodelling, which can occur in the absence of eosinophilic or neutrophilic inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RAGE deficiency results in increased viral infection and reduced anti-viral immunity during a PVM infection in early life</title><p>To understand the role of RAGE in an early life respiratory viral infection, seven-day old RAGE-deficient (RAGE<sup>-</sup>) and wild-type (WT) mice were inoculated with PVM and viral infection was assessed by qPCR at seven days post-infection (dpi). Day seven was selected as the time point of interest, as this represents the peak of PVM replication in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaiko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonville et al., 2006</xref>). Infected RAGE deficient mice had significantly higher levels of PVM RNA seven dpi compared to infected WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, in light of the fact that qPCR cannot differentiate between infectious and non-infectious viral particles, and the fact that PVM titres are notoriously difficult to assess by plaque assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dyer et al., 2007</xref>), we also measured active PVM infection by immunohistochemistry. RAGE deficient mice displayed a significantly higher percentage of PVM infected airway epithelial cells (AECs) in the respiratory tract compared to WT mice at seven dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B &amp; C</xref>). This increased infection was associated with lower levels of IFNα, IFNλ and IFNγ in the BAL fluid and lungs at seven dpi in PVM-infected RAGE deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, there was no significant difference in IFN production between mock- and PVM-infected RAGE deficient mice, suggesting that RAGE deficient mice were unable to mount an IFN response following infection with PVM (p&gt;0.999). Consistent with this notion, PVM-infected RAGE deficient mice had significantly lower expression of interferon regulatory factor (<italic>IRF7</italic>) (which regulates IFNα production) relative to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21199.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Increased virus replication and defective innate immunity in PVM-infected neonatal RAGE deficient mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RAGE deficient (RAGE<sup>−</sup>) and WT (RAGE<sup>+</sup>) mice were infected with 10 PFU of PVM at seven days of age and the viral load in the lungs (as determined by qPCR) was assessed 7 days post-infection (dpi).

We thus reasoned that the attenuated IFN production and associated increased viral infection observed in RAGE deficient mice would be associated with defective pDC recruitment. To determine whether lung pDCs expressed RAGE, we took advantage of the RAGE deficient mouse in which the functional <italic>Ager</italic> gene is replaced by <italic>GFP</italic>. Using flow cytometry, we demonstrated that pDCs derived from RAGE deficient mice were GFP<sup>+</sup>, indicating that under normal circumstances, wild-type lung pDCs express RAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We next determined whether the absence of RAGE would affect pDC recruitment to the lungs.

In the present study, we demonstrated impaired pDC recruitment and decreased production of IFN-α, -γ, -λ in RAGE deficient mice during an early life PVM infection, resulting in a higher viral load in the airway epithelium. The increased viral replication in neonatal RAGE deficient mice observed in this study was associated with the extracellular release of HMGB1, most likely as a consequence of virus-induced AEC stress. Increased levels of HMGB1 then drove an increase in ASM mass. This increase in ASM mass was dependent upon TLR4. Re-inoculation of RAGE deficient mice with PVM later in life, whilst resulting in a non-productive infection, exacerbated ASM growth and induced other characteristic features of asthma such as mucus hyper-secretion and airway hyperreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>). Importantly, this asthma-like phenotype occurred in the absence of a pronounced eosinophilic or neutrophilic response. Thus, this model represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first mouse model that recapitulates the cardinal features of paucigranulocytic asthma.<fig id="fig14" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21199.015</object-id><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><title>A schematic representation of the proposed model of disease.</title><p>During a primary PVM infection, reduced interferon production results in increased virus replication. This is then associated with the release of HMGB1 (assumedly due to virus-induced stress/damage). In a TLR4-dependent fashion, HMGB1 drives the growth of airway smooth muscle (ASM). Upon reinfection with PVM later in life, there is no active virus replication (presumably due to a protective immune response). However, exposure to PVM triggers the production of HMGB1 which then drives ASM growth and mucus production in a TLR4 dependent manner.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21199.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21199.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-21199-fig14-v1"/></fig></p><p>In the present study anti-HMGB1 treatment in RAGE deficient mice reduced the levels of cytoplasmic HMGB1, which was associated with reduced airway remodelling (both in early and later life). The ability of anti-HMGB1 treatment to reduce cytoplasmic HMGB1 staining most likely reflects the ability of this antibody to inhibit extracellular HMGB1. Upon its release, HMGB1 can act back on cells to induce de novo HMGB1 synthesis and its release, to amplify the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Porto et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, blocking extracellular HMGB1 can indirectly lower intracellular levels of HMGB1. Previous studies have also demonstrated that extracellular HMGB1 can be internalised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that blocking extracellular HMGB1 reduced intracellular HMGB1 by decreasing HMGB1 uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is important to note that HMGB1 internalisation is a RAGE-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2014</xref>) and hence less likely to be relevant in RAGE deficient mice.</p><p>At present, it remains to be determined how HMGB1 induces ASM growth. HMGB1 can induce smooth muscle proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Porto et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that HMGB1 is capable of mediating ASM growth in the absence of any other intermediary signalling molecule. Interestingly, blocking HMGB1 during the primary PVM infection also served to increase IFN–α and IFN-λ production and reduced viral load in RAGE deficient mice. We did not explore the mechanism by which anti-HMGB1 augments IFN production in our model. However, HMGB1 can inhibit IFN-α production by pDCs in response to CpG containing DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lotze and Tracey, 2005</xref>), highlighting an important role for HMGB1 in regulating type I interferon responses.</p><p>The data presented herein raise the intriguing possibility that blocking HMGB1 may be a novel and effective treatment for early life viral infections and a possible preventative for asthma onset. Although this hypothesis requires further investigation, blocking HMGB1 could be an approach that is readily translated to the clinic given that anti-HMGB1 treatments have already been approved for clinical trials to block systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ulloa and Messmer, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, several of the viruses and bacteria that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma are also known to induce HMGB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moisy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">1999</xref>). Indeed, our preliminary data suggest that later life exposure to either influenza A virus or lipopolysaccharide (known HMGB1 stimuli) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nosaka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gardella et al., 2002</xref>) are able to induce at least some features of airway remodelling in RAGE deficient mice that were infected with PVM in early life (data not shown). These data thus also raise the possibility that the mechanisms of disease shown here may not be limited to PVM-induced asthma. Similarly, we previously identified that HMGB1 was common to the pathogenesis of house dust mite- and cockroach-induced allergic asthma in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ullah et al., 2014</xref>). Collectively, these findings and others highlight a central role for HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of multiple subtypes of asthma.</p><p>The redox state of HMGB1 controls which host receptors it will interact with. Specifically, when the cysteine in location C106 is in the reduced thiol form and C23 and C45 are involved in a disulphide bridge (HMGB1<sup>C23–C45C106h</sup>, disulphide HMGB1), HMGB1 functions as a TLR4 ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2010</xref>). In light of the fact that TLR4 was essential for ASM growth and the cardinal features of asthma in this model, it is tempting to speculate that disulphide HMGB1/TLR4 interactions are sufficient to induce early life airway remodelling and the development of asthma later in life. This is consistent with the fact that the protective anti-HMGB1 antibody used in the present study blocks all-thiol and disulphide HMGB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the specific role of disulphide HMGB1 in the development of asthma represents an area of ongoing investigation.</p><p>Whilst the absence of both TLR7 and RAGE mediate asthma via similar mechanisms (i.e. a defective interferon response and an increase in ASM mass), this study showed that PVM-infected RAGE deficient mice displayed a markedly different inflammatory profile to that which we previously described in PVM-infected TLR7 deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaiko et al., 2013</xref>). Compared to TLR7 deficient mice, re-infected RAGE deficient mice did not develop type-2 eosinophilic inflammation nor did they generate a neutrophilic response. In TLR7 deficient mice, the type-2 inflammation was underpinned by an IFN-α<sup>low</sup>/IL-33<sup>high</sup> cytokine microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaiko et al., 2013</xref>), whereas the absence of RAGE attenuated the production of both IFN–α and IL-33. Others have demonstrated that RAGE deficient mice produce lower levels of both type-1 and type-2 cytokines in an ovalbumin model of allergic asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akirav et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, we have previously shown that type-2 eosinophilic inflammation, induced in response to either house dust mite or cockroach sensitisation/challenge, is significantly reduced in the absence of RAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ullah et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanism by which the activation of RAGE contributes to type-2 inflammation remains poorly defined. However, it is noteworthy that RAGE is necessary for the lung infiltration of type-2 innate lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oczypok et al., 2015</xref>), a cell type that is increasingly implicated in the priming and amplification of type two immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oliphant et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, the absence of a pronounced neutrophilic response in re-infected RAGE deficient mice is consistent with the role of RAGE in neutrophil recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Orlova et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, although HMGB1-mediated activation of RAGE promotes type-2 inflammation (which is known to induce the hallmark pathologies of asthma), in the absence of RAGE HMGB1 can directly induce features of airway remodelling and thus contribute to airway hyperreactivity independently of type-2 inflammation.</p><p>Paucigranulocytic asthma is a poorly understood subtype of asthma. The mechanism of airway hyperreactivity and remodelling in these patients remains unclear, and indeed HMGB1 levels, although known to be elevated in eosinophilic asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Watanabe et al., 2011</xref>) have never been thoroughly investigated in in paucigranulocytic asthma. Moreover, whether specific genetic mutations lead to a propensity to develop pauciogranulocytic asthma (instead of, for example, eosinophilic asthma) has yet to be studied. However, the data presented here suggest that defective RAGE signaling contributes to the development and progression of airway remodeling in the absence of Th2/Th17-mediated granulocytic inflammation Given that we identified HMGB1 as a central mediator in the pathogenesis of airway remodelling, our findings suggest that anti-HMGB1 therapy may be a novel therapeutic for the treatment of asthma, irrespective of inflammatory cell subtype.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice strains</title><p>C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice were purchased from the University of Queensland (Brisbane, Australia).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Wenhui Li (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Jos WM van der Meer (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sebastian Johnston (Reviewer #2); Jeff Whitsett (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript, reporting that RAGE deficiency pre-disposes mice to develop some features of asthma that do not include increased numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils, thus bearing some resemblance to a human phenotype of asthma which has been coined paucigranulocytic. Based on extensive and well-performed mouse studies, the paper elucidates pathways that are likely to be important in the human pathology. The paper opens up ways for a possible new treatment (anti HMGB1) for the human disease.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While paucigranulocytic asthma has been identified in quite a large number of studies now, in most it is not as common as the authors suggest, with a prevalence much lower than 40%. Also, tone down the references used to &quot;paucigranulocytic asthma&quot; because this is a concept that has really only been identified in a cross-sectional manner with no longitudinal demonstration that is a stable phenotype over time, and therefore a real stable asthma phenotype in man. It is interesting that the asthma end points that the authors studied in mice showed changes that are relevant to asthma; they find no increases in neutrophils and eosinophils and this does suggest that if paucigranulocytic asthma is a real stable phenotype, and that the mechanisms they have identified may be relevant to that phenotype. As mentioned, it is not yet accepted as a stable phenotype different from other phenotypes.</p><p>2) As said, most experiments are well executed, and in a series of sequential experiments the relevant pathways probed. Still the sequence of events is not completely clear. It would help if the authors would provide a scheme.</p><p>3) In line with the previous comment, the authors should comment on their finding that anti-HMGB1 also increased the IFN expression and reduced viral load (–subsection “Neutralising HMGB1 reduces PVM infection and ASM mass in RAGE<sup>-/-</sup> mice during an early life PVM infection”). Do they think this is a positive feedback loop, or is HMGB1acting proximal to the IFN pathway? The administration of IFN α does not support the latter possibility (subsection “Administration of exogenous IFN-α limits viral replication, ASM remodelling and HMGB1 release in RAGE<sup>-/-</sup> mice during an early life PVM infection”). At least this deserves more discussion.</p><p>4) The reinfection experiment is a bit puzzling: despite quite some protective immunity, a rather dramatic effect is seen. Do the authors have information whether dead virus (or more relevant an unrelated HMGB1 stimulus) would be able to do the same in RAGE<sup>-/-</sup> mice?</p><p>5) It is unclear how many times experiments were repeated. It is a normal requirement that experiments are repeated at least twice to give a total of 3. Please state how many times each experiment was repeated in the legend, and if they have only been done once then they should be repeated.</p><p>6) Most end points are assessed only on day 7 with 1 or 2 additionally assessed on day 3. This is unusual with a virus infection which is a dynamic event and it is particularly unusual to present virus load data only on a single time point, as is done for the SH gene copy number. Please either provide a full-time course for the virus load data or reference previous work if it has been established by previous work that day 7 is the optimum day for assessment of the majority of outcomes.</p><p>7) The Discussion should not start with a new introduction, but rather present the major findings first. So delete the first paragraph, and rephrase the second paragraph.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21199.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) While paucigranulocytic asthma has been identified in quite a large number of studies now, in most it is not as common as the authors suggest, with a prevalence much lower than 40%.

Still the sequence of events is not completely clear. It would help if the authors would provide a scheme.</italic> </p><p>In order to improve the clarity of the various experiments, we have now included schematic models of the experimental design in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">12</xref>. We have also created a summary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>) to show the proposed model of disease.</p><p> <italic>3) In line with the previous comment, the authors should comment on their finding that anti-HMGB1 also increased the IFN expression and reduced viral load (–subsection “Neutralising HMGB1 reduces PVM infection and ASM mass in RAGE<sup>-/-</sup> mice during an early life PVM infection”). Do they think this is a positive feedback loop, or is HMGB1acting proximal to the IFN pathway? The administration of IFN α does not support the latter possibility (subsection “Administration of exogenous IFN-α limits viral replication, ASM remodelling and HMGB1 release in RAGE<sup>-/-</sup> mice during an early life PVM infection”). At least this deserves more discussion.</italic> </p><p>We hypothesise that RAGE signalling is required for recognition of viral RNA and the early induction of antiviral immunity. In the absence of viral control, the elevated viral load in the epithelium leads to the release of HMGB1. We hypothesise that the HMGB1 further blunts the antiviral host response by inhibiting type I IFN production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, as described by Lotze and Tracey (Nat. Immunol. 2005). Inhibition of interferon production then results in increased viral replication which, in turn, results in increased HMGB1 release in a positive feedback loop. In response to the reviewer’s query we have now included a discussion of this point in the third paragraph of the Discussion. As described above, we have also created a summary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>) to show the proposed feedback loop.</p><p> <italic>4) The reinfection experiment is a bit puzzling: despite quite some protective immunity, a rather dramatic effect is seen. Do the authors have information whether dead virus (or more relevant an unrelated HMGB1 stimulus) would be able to do the same in RAGE<sup>-/-</sup> mice?</italic> </p><p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s puzzlement, as we ourselves do not fully understand the mechanism by which the secondary infection induces the asthma-like features in the absence of a robust infection. Our working hypothesis is that the virus infects but does not replicate in macrophages or the airway epithelium and that the infection is sufficient to activate a pathway that induces the release of HMGB1. In addition to the experiments performed herein, we were also interested in determining whether the observed effects were restricted to reinfection with PVM. To answer this question we have performed experiments whereby we replaced the secondary infection with PVM with influenza A virus (PR8/34[H1N1]), a known stimulant of HMGB1 production (e.g. Nosaka et al., Critical Care, 2015). The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Author response image 1</xref> demonstrate that influenza A virus (IAV) is also able to trigger ASM growth in RAGE<sup>-/-</sup> mice that have been infected with PVM in early life. In an attempt to address the reviewers’ question, we also investigated whether LPS, an inducer of HMGB1 release (Gardella et al.,2002; EMBO reports) but also a ligand of TLR4, would be sufficient to promote airway remodelling. Mice were infected with PVM in early life were treated intranasally with LPS at 42-47 days post primary infection. LPS increased ASM levels above those observed in PVM + mock treated mice. How an early life infection with PVM alters the pulmonary environment such that the mice are ‘sensitised’ to a later life viral infection or pro-inflammatory stimulus remains an area of ongoing research in our laboratory. We have now included discussion of these data in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion.<fig id="fig15" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21199.018</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21199.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21199.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21199-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p> <italic>5) It is unclear how many times experiments were repeated. It is a normal requirement that experiments are repeated at least twice to give a total of 3. Please state how many times each experiment was repeated in the legend, and if they have only been done once then they should be repeated.</italic> </p><p>Unfortunately, our animal ethics committee prohibits the repetition of in vivoexperiments three times in order to uphold the three Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement) underpinning the humane use of animals in scientific research. Thus, all experiments are representative of two independent experiments. The only exceptions to this are experiments where mice were treated with anti-HMGB1 and anti- sIL-13Ra2-Fc. This decision was made due to the limited availability of both the anti-HMGB1 and sIL-13Ra2-Fc (both were gifts from overseas researchers/companies and hence we only had a finite amount of material to work with). For transparency, all this information is now included in the relevant figure legends and alongside the relevant ‘n’ numbers.</p><p> <italic>6) Most end points are assessed only on day 7 with 1 or 2 additionally assessed on day 3.

We have now included these references in the first paragraph of the subsection “RAGE deficiency results in increased viral infection and reduced anti-viral immunity during a PVM infection in early life”.</p><p><italic>7) The Discussion should not start with a new introduction, but rather present the major findings first.
