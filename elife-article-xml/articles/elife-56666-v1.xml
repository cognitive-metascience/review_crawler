Here we use the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mouse, with delayed cortical bone consolidation, to characterise cortical maturation and identify control signals. We show that cortical maturation requires a reduction in cortical porosity, and a transition from low to high density bone, which continues even after cortical shape is established. Both processes were delayed in <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice. SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signalling 3) inhibits signalling by leptin, G-CSF, and IL-6 family cytokines (gp130). In <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> bone, STAT3 phosphorylation was prolonged in response to gp130-signalling cytokines, but not G-CSF or leptin. Deletion of gp130 in <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation in osteocytes and osteoclastic resorption within cortical bone, leading to rescue of the corticalisation defect, and restoration of compromised bone strength. We conclude that cortical bone development includes both pore closure and accumulation of high density bone, and that these processes require suppression of gp130-STAT3 signalling in osteocytes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bone</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>osteocyte</kwd><kwd>cytokine</kwd><kwd>cortical bone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1120978</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sims</surname><given-names>Natalie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1154819</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sims</surname><given-names>Natalie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sims</surname><given-names>Natalie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>St. Vincent's Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Brenda Shanahan Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sims</surname><given-names>Natalie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeted SOCS3 null mice reveal that maturation of cortical bone comprises both pore closure and accumulation of high density bone, requiring local suppression of gp130-STAT3 in osteocytes and subsequent osteoclastogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The characteristic external structure of bone (cortical bone) forms during development and continues to consolidate as bones grow in length. During longitudinal growth, thin bony trabeculae arise from the cartilaginous growth plate, and, at the periphery of the metaphysis, they coalesce to form the cortical shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Enlow, 1962</xref>). As well as achieving the distinctive thickened cortical shape, the woven bone that makes up the initial cortex is gradually replaced with a stronger layered (lamellar) structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Enlow, 1962</xref>). In rodent bone, the woven bone is partially replaced by modelling drift during growth: new lamellar bone is deposited asymmetrically on both inner (endocortical) and outer (periosteal) cortical surfaces, and woven endochondral bone remains in the centre of the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shipov et al., 2013</xref>). In larger mammalian bones, including human, in addition to deposition of lamellar bone on endocortical and periosteal surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maggiano et al., 2015</xref>), the inner cortical bone is remodelled into lamellar Haversian systems surrounding intracortical blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Enlow, 1962</xref>). The cellular changes and molecular mechanisms that control the establishment of the initial compact cortical bone structure remain undefined.</p><p>Since corticalisation occurs during rapid longitudinal growth, the process has been difficult to quantify. Bone growth in length occurs at the growth plate, and measurement of a cortical region of interest in the developing cortex in animals and humans during bone lengthening is difficult because a fixed position on the bone cannot be reliably identified due to the non-linear pattern of growth. Differences in positioning of a region of interest by even 1 to 2 mm may alter the analysis of any structural changes in bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seeman and Ghasem-Zadeh, 2016</xref>). Adding to this challenge, multiple scans of children with developing bones would be required to measure the process of corticalisation in humans, which raises safety concerns about radiation exposure effects on growing bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Williams and Davies, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenner and Hall, 2007</xref>).</p><p>A focus on the development and consolidation of cortical bone structure will improve our understanding of a process shared by all vertebrates and improve methods used for age estimation in bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maggiano et al., 2015</xref>). I, if the signalling pathways controlling cortical structure are identified, this could provide methods to improve bone strength in patients prone to fracture. Peak bone mass achieved in early adulthood strongly predicts later fracture risk after skeletal structure begins to decline with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seeman, 2002</xref>). Abnormalities in trabecular formation from the growth plate influence the structure of bone and determines fragility and risk of fracture; healthy girls and pre- and postmenopausal women with thinner or fewer trabeculae exhibit lower cortical area and higher cortical porosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bala et al., 2015</xref>). In older individuals, a reversal of this process (trabecularisation) also occurs on the endocortical surface of bone, leading to a high cortical porosity and increased skeletal fragility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zebaze et al., 2010</xref>); individuals over the age of 65 lose up to 50% of cortical bone mass during this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riggs et al., 1981</xref>). Cortical mass and dimensions determine the strength of long bones (e.g. femur, radius, ulna) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ammann and Rizzoli, 2003</xref>), and fractures in long bones account for 80% of all osteoporotic fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zebaze et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clarke, 2008</xref>). However, current treatments for osteoporosis are less effective at cortical sites, even though they prevent fractures in vertebral bone that contains a high proportion of trabecular bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clarke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindsay et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>We recently identified the first cell communication mechanism required for cortical bone maturation. Cortical bone consolidation was delayed in <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice lacking suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) in <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> expressing cells (osteocytes and late osteoblasts), particularly females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, deletion of SOCS3 in the osteo-chondral lineage also delayed formation of dense cortical bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). This indicates that inhibition of cytokine signalling in osteocytes by SOCS3 is needed for timely formation of cortical bone. However, SOCS3 provides negative feedback for a range of cytokine receptors, including the leptin, G-CSF, and gp130 receptors. The latter is utilized by the IL-6 family of cytokines, which includes Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Interleukin 11 (IL-11), oncostatin M (OSM), cardiotrophin 1 (CT-1) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Leptin, G-CSF and IL-6 family cytokines all have the potential to modify cortical development since they each promote bone formation through local action in bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McGregor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sims et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cornish et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Winkler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scheller et al., 2010</xref>), modify gene expression by osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McGregor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walker et al., 2010</xref>), and, in some cases, promote bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tamura et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richards et al., 2000</xref>). Although phenotypes caused by SOCS3 deficiency in other organs were rescued by IL-6 deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Croker et al., 2003</xref>), this was not the case in <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2017</xref>). The specific cytokine receptor that must be suppressed for cortical development remains unidentified.</p><p>In our earlier study we realised the limitations of morphological analyses of cortical bone, and here we develop unbiased micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) methods to track the changes in tissue mineral content during cortical bone development; these methods are applicable to a wide range of applications in human and animal biology. We use them to identify not only morphological changes, but also, and for the first time, find an increase in bone material density with cortical maturation that occurs after the morphological character of the cortex has been formed. In addition, we show that IL-6 family cytokines have amplified and extended STAT3 phosphorylation responses in bone in the absence of SOCS3 and that deletion of gp130 in osteocytes rescues the features of delayed corticalisation in <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visualisation of cortical maturation between 12 and 15 weeks of age in murine femora and its delay in <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice</title><p>There was no significant difference in femoral length between <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice when scanned on a weekly basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

While cortical porosity reflected the changes that we were seeing, the standard manual or algorithm-based methods could not distinguish between cortical and trabecular bone in this model. We realised that the distinction of cortical and trabecular bone was possibly arbitrary in this situation. To overcome this, and to develop an objective way to quantify the changes that occur during cortical bone formation, we used unbiased multi-level Otsu thresholding (see Materials and Methods) of the entire metaphysis including all forms of bone to identify quantities of high-, mid-, and low-density bone, regardless of whether it could be defined as trabecular, cortical or undifferentiated.

This shows that the transition from low to high density cortical bone that occurs as bone matures between 12 to 15 weeks can also be assessed at a single time point by a slice-by-slice analysis of the metaphysis, and that bone tissue matures even after cortical consolidation has occurred.</p><p>In <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice at 12 weeks of age the shape of the density curve was distinctly different to that of age-matched <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This was most notable in low density bone which was doubled in the proximal region compared to <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice; this was statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> shows comparisons between genotypes at each slice and bone density level). The proportion of low density bone reduced significantly with distance from the growth plate, as mid-density bone increased (distance effect, p&lt;0.0001 for both). There was no significant change in the very low proportion of high density bone, which was absent in most samples even in the proximal slices. This confirms the delayed cortical maturation in 12 week old <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice. Their femora accumulate mid-density bone in regions furthest from the growth plate in the same manner as the control mice, but it is on the background of a high level of immature low density bone.</p><p>At 15 weeks of age the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> femora, like the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> femora, had more high density bone in regions furthest from the growth plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Although <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> femora started with a lower level of high density bone than controls, they reached the same level of high density bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> femora at 15 weeks of age also had more low density bone than age-matched controls in the region closest to the growth plate, as at 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>); and unlike age-matched <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> controls, this declined significantly along the length of the bone. <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> femora also had a higher proportion of mid-density bone compared to controls along almost the full length of the metaphysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> femora therefore exhibit both the reduction in cortical porosity and the increase in bone density associated with corticalisation. However, this process occurs in the presence of a greater quantity of low density bone than in control mice of the same age and sex. This confirms that <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice have immature cortical bone compared with their age-matched controls.</p><p>The less mature nature of <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> bone was also clear from pseudocolourised micro-CT images of the most mature regions of bone, which showed more mid-density bone than controls (compare images on the right of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). When longitudinal femoral sections of these bones were taken at 16 weeks old and assessed by Ploton silver staining for osteocyte canaliculi and cement lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaudin-Audrain et al., 2008</xref>), it was clear that the nature of the bone material was different. At this site, in approximately 40% of the bone closest to the endocortical edge, control bone exhibited mature lamellar bone, characterised by flattened and aligned osteocytes with dendritic processes primarily running perpendicular to the endocortical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In contrast, osteocytes in <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> bone at the same anatomical location were more rounded, showed no ordered orientation, and the bone contained many cement lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Since we have previously reported that the newly forming <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> cortical bone does not contain cartilage remnants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2017</xref>), the abundant cement lines of <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> cortical bone do not reflect retention of immature endochondral cartilage and woven bone. Rather, it reflects rapid remodelling and replacement of that structure with woven bone. Although the control cortical bone had accrued lamellar bone at this time point, this has not occurred in the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> cortex. This confirms our earlier assertion that cortical bone maturation is delayed in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We also analysed archived micro-CT femoral scans from male and female 26 week old <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice which we previously reported to have normalised cortical morphology, but impaired strength in females only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2017</xref>).

STAT3 phosphorylation was elevated in osteocytes by immunohistochemical quantitation of phospho-STAT3 positive osteocytes, which were significantly elevated in both male and female tibial samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), confirming that a lack of SOCS3 negative feedback results in elevated STAT3 signalling in response to endogenous stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Development of a new mouse with <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> -targeted deletion of gp130</title><p>We previously reported that the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> phenotype is not rescued by IL-6 deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2017</xref>), and since all other gp130-binding cytokines tested induced prolonged phosphorylation, we next determined whether gp130 deletion in osteocytes might resolve the phenotype.

Indeed, in this more mature region, <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup>:Il6st<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice exhibited a more mature osteocyte canalicular network than <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M,N</xref>). This was indicated by a greater proportion of osteocyte cell bodies aligned parallel to the bone surface, and less cement lines within the cortex. The normalized structure resembled the canalicular network of <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice in the same region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This normalization of cortical bone structure and maturation was associated with a significant reduction in phospho-STAT3 staining in osteocytes within the newly forming cortical bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O–Q</xref>). This indicates that for cortical consolidation to occur in the metaphysis, bone resorption must be suppressed, and this can be achieved by reducing gp130-dependent STAT3 phosphorylation in osteocytes.</p><p>We previously reported lower mechanical strength of the femoral diaphysis of 26 week old <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice compared to <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (tested by three point bending) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2017</xref>). This included a 50% reduction in post-yield deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2017</xref>). In the present study, when <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice were crossed with <italic>Il6st<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice, this parameter was approximately doubled in both male and female mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), representing a significant improvement. Male mice <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup>:Il6st<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice also exhibited a significant reduction in yield force. This suggests that the bone of <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup>:Il6st<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice is more ductile. While this prevents the bones from fracturing earlier (reflected in the low yield force in the male mice), this does not prevent the bone from fracturing at the same force as the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> bone. Notably, in our earlier study, we also did not see a change in the ultimate force, indicating that the defect in corticalisation changes bone ductility, and behaviour under strain, but does not change its ultimate maximal strength. In addition, post-yield strain (which corrects the mechanical testing data for the size and shape of each individual bone sample) was significantly greater in both male and female <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup>:Il6st<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice compared to the mutant <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). This suggests that the rescue of the strength defect in these mice resulted from an improvement in the material quality of the cortical bone at the diaphysis, consistent with an improvement in cortical bone maturation.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Results of three point bending tests of femora from male and female 12 week old <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> and <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup>:Il6st<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice.</title><p>Data is mean ± SEM. *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01 vs <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> by two-way ANOVA with Šidák post-hoc test.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Parameter</th><th colspan="2" valign="top">male</th><th colspan="2" valign="top">female</th></tr><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top"><italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic></th><th valign="top"><italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup>:Il6st<sup>f/f</sup></italic></th><th valign="top"><italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic></th><th valign="top"><italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup>:Il6st<sup>f/f</sup></italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Number of samples</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">11</td><td valign="top">10</td><td valign="top">9</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ultimate Force (N) <break/>Ultimate Deformation (mm) <break/>Yield Force (N) <break/>Yield Deformation (mm) <break/>Post-Yield Deformation (mm) <break/>Energy to Failure (mJ) <break/>Ultimate Stress (MPa) <break/>Ultimate Strain (%) <break/>Yield Stress (MPa) <break/>Yield Strain (%) <break/>Post-Yield Strain (%)</td><td valign="top">16.48 ± 0.69 <break/>0.304 ± 0.025 <break/>15.44 ± 1.75 <break/>0.240 ± 0.022 <break/>0.063 ± 0.018 <break/>2.61 ± 0.31 <break/>47.30 ± 4.69 <break/>0.033 ± 0.003 <break/>41.65 ± 5.20 <break/>0.026 ± 0.003 <break/>0.007 ± 0.002</td><td valign="top">15.31 ± 0.60 <break/>0.330 ± 0.02 <break/><bold>11.29 ± 0.70**</bold> <break/>0.212 ± 0.022 <break/><bold>0.126 ± 0.019*</bold> <break/>2.94 ± 0.25 <break/>39.67 ± 1.72 <break/>0.036 ± 0.003 <break/><bold>28.97 ± 1.46*</bold> <break/>0.023 ± 0.003 <break/><bold>0.014 ± 0.002*</bold></td><td valign="top">13.40 ± 0.25 <break/>0.350 ± 0.029 <break/>11.03 ± 0.58 <break/>0.282 ± 0.024 <break/>0.068 ± 0.013 <break/>2.34 ± 0.16 <break/>63.96 ± 2.39 <break/>0.034 ± 0.003 <break/>52.46 ± 3.02 <break/>0.028 ± 0.002 <break/>0.007 ± 0.001</td><td valign="top">13.79 ± 0.59 <break/>0.350 ± 0.019 <break/>10.19 ± 0.69 <break/>0.219 ± 0.026 <break/><bold>0.152 ± 0.020**</bold> <break/><bold>2.99 ± 0.19*</bold> <break/>54.29 ± 2.33 <break/>0.037 ± 0.002 <break/>40.42 ± 3.44 <break/>0.023 ± 0.003 <break/><bold>0.016 ± 0.002**</bold></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study shows that cortical bone formation includes both consolidation of structural elements and a transition from less organised and less mineralized bone to a mature lamellar structure; new methods were developed to show this. In addition, we show that consolidation, maturation, and mechanical performance of the cortical structure requires suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation downstream of gp130 signalling in osteocytes. When STAT3 phosphorylation is elevated, osteoclasts actively resorb the cortical structure, and formation of a lamellar structure is delayed. This process, outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, provides new insight into the changes in bone that determine cortical bone structure and into the cytokine signalling pathways and cell types involved.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of cortical maturation and the role of SOCS3 in osteocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During longitudinal growth, trabeculae arising from remodelling of the growth plate consolidate, initially forming porous woven cortical bone with irregular oriented osteocytes with rounded cell bodies. This bone is subsequently remodelled to form less porous, more highly mineralized lamellar cortical bone, with flattened regularly-oriented osteocytes. (<bold>B</bold>) During normal cortical bone formation IL-6 family cytokines signal through gp130 in osteocytes, initiating STAT3 phosphorylation. This stimulates osteoclast formation within cortical pores and on the endocortical surface; the STAT3 signal and subsequent osteoclast formation is moderated by the SOCS3 negative feedback loop. (<bold>C</bold>) In the absence of SOCS3 in osteocytes, the unchecked STAT3 phosphorylation is prolonged, leading to increased osteoclast formation, and increased remodelling of the cortical bone, delaying the formation of the more highly mineralized lamellar structure.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56666-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In earlier work, we reported delayed closure of cortical pores until after 12 weeks of age in female <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2017</xref>). That was associated with an extremely high trabecular bone volume (which would have included unconsolidated cortical bone). This is consistent with the high total bone volume we have observed in the present study. Normally the transformation from a foamy woven bone cortex to a continuous cortical mass occurs between 10 and 14 days of age in C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bortel et al., 2015</xref>). This coincides with rapid longitudinal growth, and occurs prior to development of the femoral elliptical shape. Since cortical consolidation in <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice occurred after both bone length and femoral shape are established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2017</xref>), we reasoned that their metaphyses could be used to track cortical consolidation without the complication of coincident changes in bone size and shape.</p><p>By studying these mice, we observed that cortical consolidation includes both coalescence of trabecular bone to form a thickened cortical shell followed by a transformation of the cortex from a less mineralized structure to one that contains more highly mineralized bone. Closure of pores and increased mineralisation were both delayed in <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice, consistent with very early work showing that new bone deposited at the growth plate is progressively replaced with bone of higher mineral density as the bone ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Enlow, 1962</xref>), and more recent work showing that adolescent bone has higher mineral content than infant bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zimmermann et al., 2019</xref>). Clearly in the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice, this process is slowed, a defect that may explain the reduced ductility of bone in the presence of normal bone mass in the 6 month old female <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2017</xref>). This raised the question of whether delayed cortical development in childhood could lead to compromised bone strength later in life. We found here that the alteration in cortical bone material behaviour generated by <italic>Socs3</italic> deficiency, like other aspects of the phenotype, was corrected by deletion of gp130.</p><p>Measurement of cortical porosity is a technique now common in micro-computed tomography studies of murine bone, but in this case, measuring the cortical pores in the metaphysis was challenging due to the difficulty of defining cortical and trabecular bone compartments. At the resolution of a standard micro-CT instrument, the pores measured by this technique are significantly larger than osteocyte lacunae, and the majority of these pores are ‘open pores’ that connect with other pores, and with the top or bottom of the measurement region. In control mice, very few pores were observed, and the smallest closed pores detected in the metaphyseal region were 5–10,000 micron (at the lower limit of detection for this parameter); this is approximately 10x the size of an osteocyte lacuna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buenzli and Sims, 2015</xref>). In 12 week old female <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> samples, the closed pores were much larger, on average 146,000 ± 33,000 micron. This is approximately the size of 150 osteocyte lacunae (in 3 dimensions). They are complex pores – with a surface area to volume ratio of (on average) 120 ± 24. This indicates they are large enough to contain blood vessels, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and bone marrow, and similar to the pores detected histologically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>.</p><p>We were surprised to observe a significant transformation from mid- to high-density bone in control mice between 12 and 15 weeks, after the cortical bone had formed. It is often surmised that rodent bone does not remodel after the cortical shape has been established. However, although resorption cavities have only been described in murine bone after 52 weeks of age, lamellar bone content in bone increases even between 22 and 91 weeks of age; this occurs through an asymmetrical process where woven bone on the periosteum or the endocortical surface is resorbed and replaced by lamellar bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferguson et al., 2003</xref>). However, in the control mice, it is surprising that such a dramatic increase in the proportion of highly mineralized bone has occurred within a three week time period, suggesting that the increase in mineral content may also reflect secondary mineralization of the established bone matrix.</p><p>This transition to bone of higher material density, and the difficulty of defining cortical bone in the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> model, led us to develop a new non-invasive method to quantify cortical bone maturation in the metaphysis, which may be applied to a range of biological and medical applications. This unbiased method also helped us to resolve underlying concerns about the subjective definitions of cortical and trabecular bone in mouse models with atypical bone structure. To achieve this, we used multi-level Otsu thresholding. This method makes use of an algorithm that segments pixels from the raw micro-CT images into different classes based on the gray level intensities within the image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Otsu, 1979</xref>). Even though the micro-CT scans did not exhibit deep troughs in pixel intensity, Otsu-based segmenting thresholds were highly consistent across samples. This provided a relatively simple way to measure the changes in bone maturation that occur with bone age in the same tissue samples, since the metaphysis contains both young and older bone. Furthermore, this method enabled comparisons between animal models and subjects in which cortical bone development is modified; this had previously been challenging due to the peculiar nature of the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> bone and may be valuable for other models in which the distinction between trabecular and cortical bone is difficult to define, such as models of osteopetrosis, chronic kidney disease or vitamin D deficiency. Since the method is non-invasive, application to human CT scans or primate scans could provide additional information about changes in bone structure during growth and ageing or in response to pharmacological agents, including predicting fracture in patients with normal bone mass. Since it is non-destructive, it may also be useful for assessing bone in bioarchaeological, forensic, or other archived human or zoological specimens.</p><p>The delayed metaphyseal development of <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> bone indicates that cortical formation requires SOCS3 expression by <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> positive cells (most likely late-stage ostoblasts and osteocytes). SOCS3 is an intracellular protein that provides negative feedback for a wide range of cytokine receptors, including leptin receptor, G-CSF, and all IL-6 family receptor subunits that signal by complexing with gp130 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morris et al., 2018</xref>). Since the presence or absence of specific receptors in osteocytes is difficult to prove due to lack of purity of cell preparations, and the loss of the osteocyte phenotype when primary cells are cultured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chia et al., 2015</xref>), we tested STAT3 responses to oncostatin M, leukaemia inhibitory factor, IL-11, leptin, and G-CSF, and how they were modified in <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> bone. Although pharmacological treatment with erythropoietin modifies bone mass, and activates JAK/STAT signalling, we did not test the response to erythropoietin since in vivo lineage tracing studies have shown that osteoblast lineage cells do not express this receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Singbrant et al., 2011</xref>). G-CSF did not induce a STAT3 phosphorylation response even in control animals, consistent with earlier studies reporting that G-CSFR mRNA (<italic>Csf3r</italic>) is not found in cultured osteoblast lineage cells (primary osteoblasts, osteoblast cell lines, and the MLO-Y4 osteocyte-like cell line) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Katayama et al., 2006</xref>). We also observed no STAT3 response to leptin, a cytokine hypothesized to have both direct and indirect effects on bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takeda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yue et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ducy et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, the gp130-dependent cytokines Oncostatin M (OSM), Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and IL-11 all induced STAT3 phosphorylation. OSM and LIF have been shown previously to stimulate STAT3 phosphorylation in osteoblasts cultured to express osteocyte markers in vitro, and to suppress sclerostin expression in osteocytes in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walker et al., 2016</xref>). A response of osteocytes to IL-11 has not been reported previously, but IL-11 stimulates STAT3 phosphorylation in primary calvarial osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Romas et al., 1996</xref>), and we have observed downregulation of sclerostin by IL-11 in an osteosarcoma-derived cell line (UMR106-01, Patricia W.M. Ho, unpublished data). In <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> bone, STAT3 responses to these cytokines were elevated and prolonged in mice lacking SOCS3. This indicates that at least three members of this cytokine family may require suppression to enable cortical maturation.</p><p>Indeed, when gp130 was deleted in osteocytes, in <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup>:Il6st<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice, the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> phenotype – including the high cortical porosity and the high proportion of low density bone close to the growth plate – was prevented. This not only normalised the cortical porosity, and bone density maturation pattern, but also reduced osteocytic STAT3 phosphorylation and the high level of intracortical bone resorption of <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice. This suggests gp130-dependent STAT3 phosphorylation in cortical osteocytes must be suppressed to limit osteoclast formation in the developing cortex, and that continued resorption at the periphery prevents trabecular coalescence.</p><p>While we identified that gp130 is the receptor that must be suppressed for cortical consolidation, we did not identify a responsible hyperactive gp130-dependent cytokine. There are many candidates since gp130 is a signalling receptor for a wide range of bone-active cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sims, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sims, 2016</xref>). Previously, we identified that IL-6 is not responsible for the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> phenotype since it was not improved by deleting IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2017</xref>). Our western blot data suggest that IL-11, OSM and LIF are all candidates. All three showed extended STAT3 phosphorylation in the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice, and all three are required for normal osteoclast formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sims et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poulton et al., 2012</xref>). There are other candidates that we did not test: Cardiotrophin-1 may be involved since it modifies osteoclast formation and activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walker et al., 2008</xref>), and acts directly on osteocytes to reduce sclerostin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walker et al., 2010</xref>); CNTFR-binding cytokines may also play a role, since CNTFR is expressed in osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGregor et al., 2010</xref>), but CNTFR-binding cytokines do not stimulate osteoclastogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGregor et al., 2010</xref>) so this seems unlikely. We suggest that IL-11, OSM, and LIF at least must be suppressed in osteocytes to limit their production of factors, such as RANKL, that promote osteoclastogenesis in the developing cortical region, thereby allowing bone formation to dominate and consolidate the cortical structure.</p><p>The effects of the gp130-dependent cytokines on cortical consolidation appear to be local, since high levels of osteoclast formation were not observed in trabecular bone of female <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2017</xref>). This indicates separate mechanisms controlling osteoclast formation in the trabecular bone of the secondary spongiosa and the regions undergoing cortical consolidation of the metaphysis. Differential effects of cytokines and receptors in cortical and trabecular bone have been noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calvi et al., 2001</xref>), although mechanisms to explain these differences remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sims and Vrahnas, 2014</xref>). The cellular source and regulation of the critical cytokines may differ. This may relate to differences in mechanical strain between the regions: IL-11, OSM, OSM receptor, SOCS3 and STAT3 mRNA levels are all rapidly increased in bone in response to in vivo mechanical loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mantila Roosa et al., 2011</xref>), and mice lacking STAT3 in osteoblasts or in osteocytes both have impaired anabolic response to mechanical load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corry et al., 2019</xref>). Another possibility is differences in vascularisation and supply of osteoclast precursors between the sites, since LIF regulates vascular formation at the growth plate, but not in remodelling bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poulton et al., 2012</xref>). Our preliminary analysis of adult calvarial bone suggests that these mechanisms also exist in calvarial bone, even though bone formed at that site is generated through intramembranous, rather than endochondral, ossification. Further definition of actions of these cytokines in the developing cortical bone, both in the metaphysis and the calvariae, will require analysis of developing skeletons in cell-specific knockouts of these receptors.</p><p>In this study, we developed a new mouse model of gp130 deletion in osteocytes. Previously, we used mice generated with an earlier gp130-flox mouse model that targeted deletion of the transmembrane domain, rather than the first exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betz et al., 1998</xref>). Although that model blocked gp130-mediated intracellular responses, it also raised levels of soluble gp130 (sgp130) in target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betz et al., 1998</xref>). Soluble gp130 (sgp130) circulates in the serum as at least 3 isoforms (full-length sgp130 – the dominant form, sgp130-RAPS and sgp130-E10), and has been detected in concentrations of 390 ng/ml in healthy adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Narazaki et al., 1993</xref>). Endogenous sgp130 can exist as a monomer or a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wolf et al., 2016</xref>) and is generated by alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Narazaki et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanaka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sommer et al., 2014</xref>), alternative intronic polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sommer et al., 2014</xref>), and may be released by proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montero-Julian et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sherwin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou et al., 1998</xref>). All three forms of sgp130 can inhibit interleukin 6 (IL-6) action; full length sgp130 also inhibits ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), oncostatin M (OSM) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Narazaki et al., 1993</xref>). In our previous model, recombination of gp130 in osteocytes led to an impaired bone formation response to OSM, and impaired bone formation and reduced mechanical strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>). That phenotype may have resulted either from lack of gp130 signalling, or from inhibition due to elevated local production of soluble gp130, by osteocytes. To eliminate the possibility that the phenotype was due to elevated sgp130 production from osteocytes, we used a new gp130-flox mouse (<italic>Il6st<sup>f/f</sup></italic>) targeting exon 1, to delete all soluble isoforms. This resulted in a phenocopy of the earlier <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:gp130<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mouse, confirming that the earlier phenotype was not caused by sgp130 production, but by deletion of gp130 signalling within the target cells, and that signalling through gp130 in osteocytes maintains normal trabecular bone formation, and limits cortical width.</p><p>Mature murine cortical bone does not establish the Haversian systems characteristic of larger mammals, including humans. However, humans do not yet exhibit Haversian systems in early stages of metaphyseal development; at that stage, this region is made up of thin, porous, non-coalesced bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rauch, 2012</xref>), similar to the structure observed in the mouse model. This is why the border with the growth plate is a site of greater bone fragility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rauch, 2012</xref>). As the cortical bone becomes more compact it passes through a transitional state of ‘coarse, irregular whorls or convolutions’ of compact bone, described in Rhesus monkey by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Enlow, 1962</xref>. This bone is only later remodelled to form Haversian systems. We observed this transitional ‘coarse compact’ bone form in the metaphysis close to the growth plate in both control and <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> bone, and coarse compact (woven) bone was still seen in the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> metaphyseal region close to the diaphysis even at 12 weeks of age; it was seen particularly clearly with Ploton silver staining. In contrast, this region had been partially replaced with lamellar bone in the control animals. This suggests that the key difference in cortical development between small (non-Haversian) and large (Haversian) bone occurs after the transitional ‘coarse compact’ bone phase. The initial steps in cortical bone development are therefore likely to be the same in large and small mammals. Whether the STAT3/SOCS3 signalling is involved in this transition, independent of the establishment of Haversian systems, in larger mammals remains to be established.</p><p>In conclusion, this study shows (1) that the formation of consolidated cortical bone in the metaphysis involves both the closure of cortical pores by trabecular coalescence, and the replacement of low density bone with high density bone, (2) that these processes can be quantified, and (3) that this process requires suppression of gp130 cytokine signalling by SOCS3 in osteocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Lynda Bonewald (Indiana University, USA)</td><td valign="top">Tg(Dmp1-cre)1Jqfe</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6 background</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Socs3<sup>tm1Wsa</sup></td><td valign="top">Warren Alexander (Walter and Eliza Hal Institute)</td><td valign="top">Socs3<sup>tm1Wsa</sup></td><td valign="top">C57BL/6 background</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Il6st-flox</italic> mouse strain</td><td valign="top">NCRR-NIH-supported KOMP Repository</td><td valign="top">IL6st<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Mbp</sup></td><td valign="top">C57BL/6 background</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">phospho-STAT3 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signalling</td><td valign="top">Cat #9131 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_331586">AB_331586</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC (1:100), WB (1:400)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">STAT3 <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signalling</td><td valign="top">Cat#9139 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_331757">AB_331757</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB (1:400)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat anti-Mouse</td><td valign="top">Dako</td><td valign="top">Cat#P0447 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2617137">AB_2617137</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB (1:1500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Swine anti-Rabbit</td><td valign="top">Dako</td><td valign="top">Cat#P0217 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2728719">AB_2728719</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC (1:250) <break/>WB (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">Murine oncostatin M</td><td valign="top">R and D Systems</td><td valign="top">Cat#495-MO-025</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">human IL-11</td><td valign="top">R and D Systems</td><td valign="top">Cat#218-IL-025</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">murine LIF</td><td valign="top">Merck Millipore</td><td valign="top">#LIF2010</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, <break/>recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">Murine Leptin</td><td valign="top">R and D Systems</td><td valign="top">#498-OB-01M</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">murine G-CSF</td><td valign="top">R and D Systems</td><td valign="top">#414-CS-005</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains and tissue collection</title><p><italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2017</xref>) by crossing <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (Tg(Dmp1-cre)1Jqfe), provided by Lynda Bonewald (Indiana University, USA), with SOCS3 floxed mice (Socs3<sup>tm1Wsa</sup>), provided by Warren Alexander (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Croker et al., 2003</xref>).

Once anaesthetised, their legs were immobilised with a polystyrene cut-out to straighten the femur before scanning. The x-ray source was set at 44kV and 220µA. Projections were acquired over 180° (step of 0.6°), 9 µm voxel resolution, 0.5 mm aluminium filter, 2300 ms exposure time, frames averaging 1. Image slices were reconstructed and analysed using NRecon V1.7.0.4, Dataviewer V1.5.2.4 and CT Analyser V1.16.4.1. 3D- tomographic volume images of bone were created using CTVox V3.2.0. At 16 weeks of age, mice were culled and femora fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and scanned under the same conditions.

Trabecular bone mass was assessed in the metaphysis, in a region of interest that was 15% the length of the bone, commencing at a distance 7.5% of bone length from the distal femoral growth plate. To determine whether bone loss occurred by the repeated scanning, global thresholds for analysis of trabecular bone were set at a minimum of 0.238 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and cortical bone at a minimum of 0.632 g/cm<sup>3</sup> calcium hydroxyapatite. No significant difference was detected in trabecular or cortical bone mass between the mice scanned weekly and those scanned only at 12 and 15 weeks, confirming that the repeated in vivo scanning did not cause bone loss (data not shown).</p><p>To visualise changes in cortical consolidation over time, pseudocolorized images were used to create videos with CTVox V3.2.0 ‘Flight Recorder’. Images for each mouse from each consecutive scan were merged after geometrically aligning with 12-week-old images using Dataviewer v1.5.2.4.</p><p>Since the flight recorder images showed changes in mineral density over time, even in wild type mice, we developed a method to quantify newly forming cortical bone at three different levels of mineral density. To measure bone areas of low, medium, and high density bone, we used nonparametric unsupervised 4 level Otsu thresholding using CT Analyser V1.16.4.1. Otsu thresholding is a thresholding algorithm that segments the pixels into different classes based on the gray level intensities within the image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Otsu, 1979</xref>). We used 4 level Otsu thresholding across the entire metaphyseal region of 15 week old <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> femora to class the gray pixels into four density levels representative of the 4 densities within the mature metaphysis from 15 week old wild type bone. The threshold ranges for each of these levels were calibrated to calcium hydroxyapatite standards, as follows: low density (0.632–1.143 g/cm<sup>3</sup> CaHA); mid density (1.143–1.528 mg/cm<sup>3</sup> CaHA) and high density (&gt;1.528 g/cm<sup>3</sup> CaHA). The lowest density quartile (0–0.632 g/cm<sup>3</sup> CaHA) was excluded; although it contained some low-density bone, it also contained low density material detected outside the bone, suggesting inclusion of noise. Representative images showing three levels used and the matched raw image at the distal metaphysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Within the 15 week old <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> samples, despite the lack of deep troughs in pixel intensity, the segmenting thresholds were highly consistent across the group of samples; with the lowest threshold having a range of grayscale values of 76–85 (11% variance), mid-density threshold ranging from 130 to 137 (5% variance), and high-density ranging from 170 to 176 (3.5% variance). Samples from both genotypes and ages were subjected to analysis at the same three density thresholds. Bone volume at each of these densities were measured and are expressed relative to the total cross sectional volume. In addition, to obtain information about cortical bone maturation throughout the metaphysis, data were extracted using CT Analyser V1.16.4.1 for each 9 micron slice from the proximal to distal edge of the metaphyseal region, and bone areas at each density were calculated as a percentage of total cross sectional area for each slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>Cortical porosity and bone volume at each of the three densities were measured in female <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> and littermate <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (control) mice at 12 and 15 weeks of age (n = 9–10/group), and in male and female 12 week old <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> and <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup>:Il6st<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice. These were measured in the metaphysis (as described above). At 12 weeks of age, cortical porosity was also measured in the diaphysis (in a region of interest that was 15% the length of the bone, commencing at a distance 30% of bone length from the distal femoral growth plate). Cortical porosity measurements were determined with bone defined using a global threshold of a minimum of 0.238 g/cm<sup>3</sup> calcium hydroxyapatite.

Immunohistochemistry for phospho-STAT3 was carried out by the following method. 5 µm sections were dewaxed in Histoclear, rehydrated through graded ethanols and endogenous peroxidase blocked for 30 min in 100% methanol. Samples were permeabilized for 15 min in 0.5% trypsin in PBS, and rinsed. Before primary antibody was applied, samples were blocked with 10% swine serum in PBS with 0.01% Tween 20 (TBS) for 60 min. Phosph-STAT3 antibody (Cell Signalling #9131, 1:100), or IgG control (rabbit IgG, Dako) was applied in a humidified chamber at room temperature overnight. After rinsing, a secondary antibody (swine anti-rabbit, Dako) was applied for 45 min in TBS at 1:250, followed by streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (Dako) 1:500 in TBS for 45 min then biotin tyramine 1:50 in amplification diluent for 7 min (TSA Biotin system kit, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, USA).

author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Your study nicely focuses on a specified role of gp130 signaling in the regulation of cortical bone mass. Not much is known about how cortical bone is remodeled and lost, and in particular how cortical porosity effects bone strength. This study uniquely highlights the role of closure of cortical pores in determining bone strength and its mechanism. Cutting-edge methods that are widely applicable have been utilized, and you have provided a thoughtful and thorough response to the review critique.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cortical bone maturation in mice requires SOCS3 suppression of gp130/STAT3 signalling in osteocytes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Reviewing Editor and Clifford Rosen as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ulf Lerner (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers find the study interesting and a significant addition to our current knowledge on corticalization. Specifically, clear evidence is provided that deletion of gp130 specifically in osteocytes prolongs cytokine-induced STAT3 activation The reviewers also find methodological novelty in the development of an objective method based on unbiased multi-level Otsu thresholding of the CT-scans to determine how immature woven trabecular/cortical bone transforms into mature, well organized, cortical lamellar bone. They point out that these studies may have therapeutic implications in providing the framework for strategies that could increase cortical strength. Overall studies were well done and technically sound. With that said, the reviewers concurred that revision is required with the possible addition of new data to further strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be functionally important to conduct mechanical testing to determine bone strength and quality in the respective genotypes and its correlation with the described phenotypes. At least some basic biomechanical tests on bone specimens that may already be available is considered essential.</p><p>2) To provide further mechanistic insights, the authors are encouraged to consider measuring local and circulating levels of CTX as well as RANKL (IHC and ELISA).</p><p>3) Figure 4: please discuss why basal level of pSTAT3 in genetically manipulated mice is virtually indistinguishable from controls (at least in panels A and C). It would also be informative to determine if cells lacking SOCS3 are sensitized to IL-6 family cytokines.</p><p>4) There is lack of clarity on what the pores shown in Figure 1C represent, specifically in relation to their size. Furthermore, do the pores shown in the histological sections in Figure 5F and G contribute to this overall porosity? Is the increased porosity (Figure 1C) noted in both metaphyseal and diaphyseal areas?</p><p>5) Figure 2B shows that bone volume of the metaphyseal area in <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>:<italic>Socc<sup>3f/f</sup></italic> mice is increased at 12 and 15 weeks, but one of the reviewers cannot find any statement on whether the mice were male or female. The reviewer considers it important to compare these data to those in the previous Nature Communication report. There is also the question whether the increased bone volume is solely due to delayed corticalization, or are there other contributory mechanisms?</p><p>6) The authors nicely demonstrate in Figure 4 that deletion of Socs3 in <italic>Dmp1</italic> expressing cells results in prolonged activation of pSTAT3 in calvarial bones after local injections of LIF, OSM or IL-11 and that such prolonged activation is not observed after G-CSF or leptin injections. Since EPO also activates STAT3 and has been shown to affect bone mass it would have been important to inject this cytokine.</p><p>7) Please provide data on an absent bone resorption response (in Table 1) as it relates to the statement in the subsection “Development of a new mouse with <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>-targeted deletion of gp130”.</p><p>8) It is apparent that gp130 activation of STAT3 in <italic>Dmp1</italic> expressing cells needs to be dampened by SOCS3, but it is puzzling that deletion of this mechanism in <italic>Dmp1</italic> expressing late osteoblasts/osteocytes only affects osteoclast formation in metaphyseal pores during corticalization (gp130 cytokines are not likely to be expressed only in this area). One would anticipate that osteoclastogenesis in other parts of the skeleton also would be affected. It is argued in the Discussion section that osteoclast numbers in general are not affected by referring to the Nature Communication paper, where it is shown that osteoclast numbers in the secondary spongiosa are not affected by deletion of Socs3 in osteocytes. This might be due to low numbers of osteocytes in the trabecular bone in this area. The specific effect of SOCS3 during corticalization would be more convincing if the authors could count osteoclasts in other areas with higher numbers of osteocytes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56666.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It would be functionally important to conduct mechanical testing to determine bone strength and quality in the respective genotypes and its correlation with the described phenotypes.

We have now carried out three point bending tests on the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs<sup>3f/f</sup></italic> and <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>:<italic>Socs<sup>3f/f</sup>:Il6st<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice. To our delight, this has shown that the deletion of <italic>Il6st</italic> increases the post-yield deformation of the bones, the reverse of phenotype we previously reported when we compared the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs<sup>3f/f</sup></italic> bones to controls. This provides additional evidence of a rescue, and reinforces the importance of normal cortical development to bone strength. This data is included in a new Table 3, described in the subsection “Rescue of the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs<sup>3f/f</sup></italic> phenotype by <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> -targeted deletion of gp130”, and discussed in the third paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To provide further mechanistic insights, the authors are encouraged to consider measuring local and circulating levels of CTX as well as RANKL (IHC and ELISA).</p></disp-quote><p>In allocating tissues and samples in experiments we considered this but felt that measuring systemic levels of resorption markers would be unlikely to help us identify a mechanism for a local control mechanism since they address cumulative effects throughout the skeleton. As a way of addressing this, we have assessed RANKL (<italic>Tnfsf11</italic>), OPG (<italic>Tnfrsf11b</italic>), and TRAP (<italic>Acp5</italic>) mRNA levels in the flushed femoral samples (i.e. femoral cortex lacking the primary spongiosa). In this analysis, we see a mild increase in <italic>Tnfrsf11b</italic> and reduction in <italic>Acp5</italic> in the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs<sup>3f/f</sup>:Il6st<sup>f/f</sup></italic> bones compared to the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs<sup>3f/f</sup></italic> bones. This confirms our histomorphometric data, and suggests that the rescue may involve a local increase in OPG production rather than a reduction in RANKL. This data is now included in a new Table 2, described in the subsection “Rescue of the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs<sup>3f/f</sup></italic> phenotype by <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> -targeted deletion of gp130”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 4: please discuss why basal level of pSTAT3 in genetically manipulated mice is virtually indistinguishable from controls (at least in panels A and C). It would also be informative to determine if cells lacking SOCS3 are sensitized to IL-6 family cytokines.</p></disp-quote><p>The lack of difference in basal levels of pSTAT3 by Western blotting is consistent with observations in mice with SOCS3 deletion targeted to other cell types. In those studies, basal levels of pSTAT3 were not differentiated by Western blot (Croker et al., Journal of Immunology, 2003; Croker et al., 2004); this may be because of the low level of STAT3 phosphorylation in basal conditions relative to the stimulated response, or because the tissue contains a mixture of cell types, including cells with normal levels of SOCS3. Many studies have shown that a wide range primary cells lacking SOCS3 are sensitized to IL-6 family cytokines. Since cultured primary osteocytes lose their phenotype in vitro (see Chia et al., 2015), we have now measured pSTAT3 in vivo in <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs<sup>3f/f</sup></italic> osteocytes. We have added this data to Figure 4D and describe it in the subsection “STAT3 phosphorylation in response to IL-6 family cytokines is prolonged in <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs<sup>3f/f</sup> </italic>” Bone, with reference to the above papers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is lack of clarity on what the pores shown in Figure 1C represent, specifically in relation to their size. Furthermore, do the pores shown in the histological sections in Figure 5F and G contribute to this overall porosity? Is the increased porosity (Figure 1C) noted in both metaphyseal and diaphyseal areas?</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, the pores measured by micro-computed tomography are large pores, and are certainly larger than osteocyte lacunae (our resolution is insufficient for that); the pores shown in the histological sections in Figure 6F and G would certainly contribute to this porosity. The actual size of the pores is difficult to measure; they are measured in 3 dimensions, and 90% of them are open pores (open to the top or bottom of the metaphyseal region, through connections with other pores in the network), this means it is not possible to calculate their total size. The closed pores (fully encapsulated in bone) can be quantified. Most control samples did not exhibit measurable closed cortical pores; in those few that did, the pores were 5-10,000 micron<sup>3</sup> (which was at the lower limit of detection for this parameter); this is approximately 10x the size of an osteocyte lacuna. In 12 week old female <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs<sup>3f/f</sup></italic> samples, the closed pores are on average 146,000 ± 33,000 micron<sup>3</sup>. This is approximately the size of 150 osteocyte lacunae (in 3 dimensions), so large enough to contain blood vessels, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and bone marrow; they are very complex pores – with a surface area to volume ratio of (on average) 120 ± 24. Our goal in this study was to move away from the standard measure of cortical porosity precisely because it is difficult to understand its meaning in this mouse model. We have added more detail of the above into the Discussion section (fourth paragraph), and to the Materials and methods (subsection “Micro-computed tomography”).</p><p>To determine whether the increased porosity also exists in the diaphysis, we have now assessed diaphyseal cortical porosity in 12 week old female <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs<sup>3f/f</sup></italic> mice; indeed it was significantly elevated. This data is included in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 1, and described in the Results section (subsection “Visualisation of cortical maturation between 12 and 15 weeks of age in murine femora and its delay in <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs<sup>3f/f</sup> </italic>mice”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 2B shows that bone volume of the metaphyseal area in Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs<sup>3f/f</sup> mice is increased at 12 and 15 weeks, but one of the reviewers cannot find any statement on whether the mice were male or female. The reviewer considers it important to compare these data to those in the previous Nature Communication report. There is also the question whether the increased bone volume is solely due to delayed corticalization, or are there other contributory mechanisms?</p></disp-quote><p>The analysis shown in Figure 2B is of female mice. The sex of mice was mentioned in the Materials and methods section and has now been added to the figure legend for clarity. The greater total bone volume in female <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs<sup>3f/f</sup></italic> mice observed in the present study is consistent with our original observation of increased “trabecular bone volume” in female mice in our earlier Nature Communications paper; we have now added a note directly comparing this data to the earlier study in the Discussion (second paragraph).</p><p>Whether the delayed corticalisation is the sole cause of the high bone volume, or the high bone volume causes delayed corticalisation is not possible to determine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors nicely demonstrate in Figure 4 that deletion of Socs3 in Dmp1 expressing cells results in prolonged activation of pSTAT3 in calvarial bones after local injections of LIF, OSM or IL-11 and that such prolonged activation is not observed after G-CSF or leptin injections. Since EPO also activates STAT3 and has been shown to affect bone mass it would have been important to inject this cytokine.</p></disp-quote><p>Although EPO activates STAT3 in bone, we have previously reported, using in vivo lineage tracing, that the EPO receptor is not expressed in cells of the osteoblast lineage (see Singbrandt et al., 2011); Furthermore, our unpublished RNAseq analysis of the Ocy454 murine osteocyte cell line detected only negligible levels of <italic>Epor</italic> RNA (reads of 0-5 counts, in comparison to LIFR which had reads of 800-1000 counts). Since testing each cytokine requires 44 age- and sex-matched mice per genotype all bred to be tested at the same time, we felt this would not be a justifiable experiment. We have added a comment about our rationale for not testing erythropoietin in the Discussion (seventh paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Please provide data on an absent bone resorption response (in Table 1) as it relates to the statement in the subsection “Development of a new mouse with Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>-targeted deletion of gp130”.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for this omission – it has been added to Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It is apparent that gp130 activation of STAT3 in Dmp1 expressing cells needs to be dampened by SOCS3, but it is puzzling that deletion of this mechanism in Dmp1 expressing late osteoblasts/osteocytes only affects osteoclast formation in metaphyseal pores during corticalization (gp130 cytokines are not likely to be expressed only in this area). One would anticipate that osteoclastogenesis in other parts of the skeleton also would be affected. It is argued in the Discussion section that osteoclast numbers in general are not affected by referring to the Nature Communication paper, where it is shown that osteoclast numbers in the secondary spongiosa are not affected by deletion of Socs3 in osteocytes. This might be due to low numbers of osteocytes in the trabecular bone in this area. The specific effect of SOCS3 during corticalization would be more convincing if the authors could count osteoclasts in other areas with higher numbers of osteocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>To assess whether osteoclast formation is increased at a second cortical site, we have returned to our archived samples of calvariae from 12 week old <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs<sup>3f/f</sup></italic> mice collected in the original study. The calvarial bone from these mice contains significantly more marrow space – termed diplöe at this location – than control. These holes contain both a higher level of calcein label and more osteoclasts, indicating a greater level of remodelling of cortical bone at this site. This is particularly interesting because calvarial bone does not undergo endochondral ossification. This provides further evidence of a specific stimulatory effect on osteoclast activity in cortical bone in <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs<sup>3f/f</sup> </italic>mice. This data has been added to Figure 6—figure supplement 1B-D, and is described in the Results section (subsection “Rescue of the <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs<sup>3f/f</sup></italic> phenotype by <italic>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> -targeted deletion of gp130”) and Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
