disease (COPD). There are few specific therapies that reverse neutrophilic inflammation, but uncovering mechanisms regulating neutrophil survival is likely to identify novel therapeutic targets. Screening of 367 kinase inhibitors in human neutrophils and a zebrafish tail fin injury model identified ErbBs as common targets of compounds that accelerated inflammation resolution. The ErbB inhibitors gefitinib, CP-724714, erbstatin and tyrphostin AG825 significantly accelerated apoptosis of human neutrophils, including neutrophils from people with COPD. Neutrophil apoptosis was also increased in Tyrphostin AG825 treated-zebrafish in vivo. Tyrphostin AG825 decreased peritoneal inflammation in zymosan-treated mice, and increased lung neutrophil apoptosis and macrophage efferocytosis in a murine acute lung injury model. Tyrphostin AG825 and knockdown of <italic>egfra</italic> and <italic>erbb2</italic> by CRISPR/Cas9 reduced inflammation in zebrafish. Our work shows that inhibitors of ErbB kinases have therapeutic potential in neutrophilic inflammatory disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50990.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (or COPD) is a serious condition that causes the lungs to become inflamed for long periods of time, leading to permanent damage of the airways.</p><p>Immune cells known as neutrophils promote inflammation after an injury, or during an infection, to aid the healing process. However, if they are active for too long, they may also cause tissue damage and drive inflammatory diseases including COPD. To limit damage to the body, neutrophils usually have a very short lifespan and die by a regulated process known as apoptosis. Finding ways to stimulate apoptosis in neutrophils may be key to developing better treatments for inflammatory diseases.</p><p>Cells contain many enzymes known as kinases that control apoptosis and other cell processes. Drugs that inhibit specific kinases are effective treatments for some types of cancer and other conditions, and new kinase-inhibiting drugs are currently being developed. However, it remains unclear which kinases regulate apoptosis in neutrophils or which kinase-inhibiting drugs may have the potential to treat COPD and other inflammatory diseases.</p><p>To address these questions, Rahman et al. tested over 350 kinase-inhibiting drugs to identify ones that promote apoptosis in neutrophils. The experiments showed that human neutrophils treated with drugs that inhibit the ErbB family of kinases died by apoptosis more quickly than untreated neutrophils. Next, Rahman et al. used zebrafish with injured tail fins as models to study inflammation. Zebrafish treated with one of these drugs – known as Tyrphostin AG825 – had lower levels of inflammation and their neutrophils underwent apoptosis more frequently than untreated zebrafish. Since drugs can have off-target effects, Rahman et al. went on to show using gene-editing technology that reducing the activity of two genes that encode ErbB kinases in zebrafish also decreased the levels of inflammation in the fish.</p><p>Further experiments used mice that develop inflammation in the lungs similar to COPD in humans. As expected, neutrophils in the lungs of mice treated with Tyrphostin AG825 underwent apoptosis more frequently than those in untreated mice. These dead neutrophils were effectively cleared by other immune cells called macrophages, which also helps limit damage caused by neutrophils.</p><p>Together, these findings show that Tyrphostin AG825 and other drugs that inhibit ErbB kinases help to reduce inflammation by promoting the death of neutrophils. Since several of these drugs are already used to treat human cancers, it may be possible in the future to repurpose them for use in people with COPD and other long-term inflammatory diseases. Determining whether this is possible is an aim for future studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>neutrophil</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000867</institution-id><institution>Commonwealth Scholarship Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rahman</surname><given-names>Atiqur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/M004864/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Renshaw</surname><given-names>Stephen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0700091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Renshaw</surname><given-names>Stephen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PITG-GA-2011-289209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rougeot</surname><given-names>Julien JY</given-names></name><name><surname>Meijer</surname><given-names>Annemarie H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SGC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zuercher</surname><given-names>William J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intermediate Clinician Fellowship FS/18/13/33281</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reese</surname><given-names>Abigail E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeting ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases modifies neutrophil survival and inflammation across multiple species, and reveals a new use for ErbB therapeutics in resolving inflammatory disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neutrophilic inflammation is central to chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which impose an increasing social and economic burden on our aging population. Treatment of COPD by next-generation combination therapy with inhaled corticosteroids and newer bronchodilators are viewed as maintenance pharmacotherapies but they do not specifically target cellular inflammation. The anti-inflammatory phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, roflumilast, targets systemic inflammation associated with COPD and reduces moderate to severe exacerbations in severe disease, possibly via effects on eosinophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martinez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rabe et al., 2018</xref>). In these diseases, clearance of neutrophils by apoptosis is dysregulated particularly during exacerbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pletz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sapey et al., 2011</xref>), but to date it has not been possible to therapeutically modify this, indeed corticosteroids can supress neutrophil apoptosis and hence perpetuate inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liles et al., 1995</xref>). Recognising the urgent need for new therapies, we interrogated neutrophil inflammation and survival pathways using an unbiased approach focusing on potentially druggable kinases. Neutrophil persistence in tissues, caused by a delay in apoptosis, can result in a destructive cellular phenotype, whereby neutrophils have greater potential to expel histotoxic factors such as proteases and oxidative molecules onto surrounding tissue. This can occur either actively (by degranulation) or passively (by secondary necrosis). In COPD, among other diseases, delayed apoptosis is considered to be a key part of the pathogenesis, occurring either as a result of pro-survival factors that are present in the lung microenvironment or an innate apoptosis defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haslett, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pletz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Despite this mechanistic understanding, there are no effective treatment strategies in clinical use to specifically reverse this cellular mechanism.</p><p>Accelerating neutrophil apoptosis has been shown to promote the resolution of inflammation in multiple experimental models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chello et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rossi et al., 2006</xref>). A number of studies highlight the importance of protein kinases in regulating neutrophil apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rossi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Webb et al., 2000</xref>) and therefore reveal potential therapeutically targetable pathways for inflammatory disease. A growing class of clinically-exploited small molecule kinase inhibitors are being intensively developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2015</xref>), making this a timely investigation. Using parallel unbiased screening approaches in vitro and in vivo, we here identify inhibitors of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) as potential therapeutic drivers of inflammation resolution. The ErbB family consist of four RTKs with structural homology to the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1/Her-1). In an in vivo zebrafish model of inflammation, we show that inhibition of ErbBs, pharmacologically and genetically, reduced the number of neutrophils at the site of injury. Furthermore, ErbB inhibitors reduced inflammation in a murine peritonitis model and promoted neutrophil apoptosis and clearance by macrophages in the mouse lung. This study reveals an opportunity for the use of ErbB inhibitors as a treatment for chronic neutrophilic inflammatory disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identifying kinases regulating the resolution of neutrophilic inflammation in vivo</title><p>Using a well-characterised transgenic zebrafish inflammation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Renshaw et al., 2006</xref>), we adopted a chemical genetics approach, which has great potential for accelerated drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones and Bunnage, 2017</xref>). We initiated inflammation by controlled tissue injury of the zebrafish tail fin and screened a library of kinase inhibitors in order to establish which kinases could be exploited to enhance inflammation resolution in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We quantified the ability of a library of 367 publicly available kinase inhibitors (PKIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elkins et al., 2016</xref>) to reduce neutrophil number at the site of injury during the resolution phase of inflammation. The screen identified 16 hit compounds which reduced neutrophil number at the site of injury in the zebrafish model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For each compound the degree of kinase inhibition had been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elkins et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A number of kinases were inhibited by the 16 compounds, with Abelson murine leukaemia viral homolog 1 (ABL1), Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) α, PDGFRβ, p38α and ErbB4 being the top five most frequently targeted kinases overall. In addition to frequency of target, we also interrogated selectivity of compound. The most selective compounds, that is those that strongly inhibited individual kinases or kinase families, targeted the kinases YES, ABL1, p38 and the ErbB family. Apoptosis is an important mechanism contributing to inflammation resolution; we therefore sought to identify kinases common to both inflammation resolution and neutrophil apoptosis pathways.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50990.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A protein kinase inhibitor compound library screen identifies compounds that promote the resolution of inflammation in vivo and neutrophil apoptosis in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>mpx:GFP</italic> zebrafish larvae (three dpf) that had undergone tail fin transection resulting in an inflammatory response at six hpi were incubated with individual PKIS compounds [25 µM] three larvae/well for a further 6 hr.

A deleterious by-product of this is their remarkable histotoxic potential to host tissue, ordinarily held in check by the onset of apoptosis. The inappropriate suppression of neutrophil apoptosis underpins a number of chronic inflammatory diseases, and we are yet to have available an effective treatment strategy that can reverse this cellular defect in clinical practice. Here we show in human, mouse and zebrafish models of inflammation and neutrophil cell death that targeting the ErbB family of RTKs regulates neutrophil survival and resolves inflammation.</p><p>Promoting neutrophil apoptosis is a desirable approach for the resolution of inflammation, since apoptosis functionally downregulates the cell, promotes rapid cell clearance by efferocytosis and engages an anti-inflammatory phenotype in phagocytosing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Savill et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Whyte et al., 1999</xref>). As proof of principle, driving apoptosis experimentally promotes the resolution of inflammation across multiple disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chello et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rossi et al., 2006</xref>). Several compounds targeting the ErbB family have been approved as medicines for the treatment of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings open up the possibility of repurposing well-tolerated ErbB inhibitors for patients with inflammatory disease, potentially addressing a currently unmet clinical need.</p><p>The ErbB family are critical regulators of cell proliferation and are associated with the development of many human malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roskoski, 2014</xref>). In addition to the development of cancer, ErbB members have known roles in inflammatory diseases of the airway, skin and gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Finigan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frey and Brent Polk, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamilton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pastore et al., 2008</xref>). In the context of lung inflammation, ErbB2 is upregulated in whole lung lysates in murine bleomycin models of lung injury and EGFR ligands are increased in BAL from acute lung injury patients receiving mechanical ventilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Finigan et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting ErbB signalling axes may play a role in the process of airway inflammation in vivo. We show, in murine models where Tyrphostin AG825 was administered either at the time of inflammatory stimulus or once inflammation was established, an impact on cell number, proinflammatory cytokine production and neutrophil apoptosis, further validating the use of ErbB inhibitors to reduce inflammation. The benefit of EGFR inhibitors in reducing inflammation in ventilator-induced and OVA/LPS-induced lung injury rodent models is shown by others, further supporting the targetting of this pathway in inflammatory disease settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bierman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shimizu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takezawa et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Others have reported that neutrophils express members of the ErbB family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lewkowicz et al., 2005</xref>), particularly ErbB2 at low levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petryszak et al., 2016</xref>) and we show that they are phosphorylated and regulated following exposure to inflammatory stimuli. ErbBs have known roles in suppressing apoptosis of epithelial cells and keratinocytes, but this study is the first to show a role for ErbBs in survival signalling of myeloid cells. Little is known about the roles of ErbBs in neutrophil function. Erbstatin has been shown to inhibit neutrophil ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dreiem et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mócsai et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reistad et al., 2005</xref>) and chemotactic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yasui et al., 1994</xref>). Other kinase families have been found to play a role in neutrophil survival and neutrophilic inflammation, most notably the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rossi et al., 2006</xref>). In accordance with this, compounds targeting CDKs were identified as drivers of neutrophil apoptosis in both our primary and secondary screens. Moreover, p38 MAPK inhibitor compounds were also identified in both zebrafish and human screens, and since this kinase is known to mediate survival signals, these findings give confidence to the robustness of the screen design and execution.</p><p>The engagement of apoptosis by the ErbB inhibitors erbstatin and tyrphostin AG825 was confirmed both biochemically by phosphatidylserine exposure, and mechanistically by the caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh and loss of Mcl-1. This suggests that inhibiting ErbBs as a therapeutic strategy may achieve an overall anti-inflammatory effect in in vivo systems, facilitating clearance by macrophages. In support of this, we provide evidence of increased efferocytosis in vivo following tyrphostin AG825 treatment, with no evidence of secondary neutrophil necrosis due to overwhelming macrophage clearance capacity, evidenced both morphologically and by TO-PRO-3 staining.</p><p>The ability of ErbB inhibitors to promote neutrophil apoptosis even in the presence of multiple pro-survival stimuli emphasises the potential of ErbB inhibitors in the lung, at sites where inflammatory mediators are in abundance and where neutrophils are exposed to microorganisms. This is supported by the ability of tyrphostin AG825 to prevent early pro-survival signalling in response to GMCSF, including the phosphorylation of AKT. This precedes the onset of apoptosis, occurring at a time point (15 min) where apoptosis is typically less than 1%. Others have shown the ability of erbstatin to prevent GMCSF-mediated activation of PI3K in human neutrophils, although the impact on cell survival was not studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">al-Shami et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, ErbBs may function as an early and upstream component of the survival pathway in neutrophils. Subsequent impact on Mcl-1 destabilisation by tyrphostin AG825 at 8 hr suggests a cellular mechanism by which these pro-apoptotic effects are mediated.</p><p>The effects of ErbB inhibitors in driving spontaneous apoptosis suggest that, under certain circumstances, ErbB activity might be required for constitutive neutrophil survival. It is not clear what, if anything, engages ErbB signalling in culture. The rapid phosphorylation of ErbB2 following N<sup>6</sup>-MB-cAMP treatment (30 min) suggests that perhaps a ligand is not required, or that the neutrophils can rapidly release ErbB agonists in an autocrine manner. Unlike all other ErbBs, ErbB2 monomers exist in a constitutively active conformation and can form homodimers that do not require a ligand for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan et al., 2008</xref>). ErbBs achieve great signalling diversity: in part because of the individual biochemical properties of ligands and multiple homo-heterodimer combinations, and in part because they activate multiple components including those known to be critical in neutrophil cell survival such as PI3K, MAPK and GSK-3, as well as phosphorylating the Bcl-2 protein Bad which inhibits its death-promoting activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of our study is the genetically intractability of human neutrophils, meaning we cannot exclude the possibility that the inhibitors are having off target effects in this system. Mammalian models of ErbB deletion are limited by profound abnormalities in utero and during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Britsch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dackor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gassmann et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miettinen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Riethmacher et al., 1997</xref>). For this reason, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to knockdown <italic>egfra</italic> and <italic>erbb2</italic> in zebrafish, which confirmed a role for ErbBs in resolving inflammation. Targeting ErbBs genetically and pharmacologically reduces the number of neutrophils at the site of injury in zebrafish, which may reflect inhibition of a number of pathways that regulate neutrophil number in the tissue, including migration pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ellett et al., 2015</xref>). However, the increase in apoptotic neutrophil count at the site of injury with ErbB inhibitor treatment suggests ErbBs may be inducing anti-apoptotic signalling pathways within this inflammatory environment, which could at least in part be causing the phenotype. The reduced neutrophil count at the injury site may also be due to the increase in apoptotic neutrophils in the CHT, which may be preventing neutrophil migration to sites of injury. The unchanged whole body neutrophil number is potentially due to compensatory upregulation of neutrophil production within the CHT. Genetic deletion, but not pharmacological inhibition, of <italic>egfra</italic> and <italic>erbb2</italic> significantly reduced whole body neutrophil number, which may reflect crispants being without <italic>egfra</italic> and <italic>erbb2</italic> genes from a one-cell stage. Reduced neutrophils at the injury site of crispants may be explained by their reduced whole body neutrophil number, but potentially also defects in the migratory response of these neutrophils to a site of inflammation. Murine models of inflammatory disease, where tyrphostin AG825 was administered either at the time of inflammatory stimulus or once inflammation was established, show an impact on cell number, proinflammatory cytokine production and neutrophil apoptosis, further validating the use of ErbB inhibitors to reduce inflammation.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified a previously undefined role for ErbB RTKs in neutrophil survival pathways and a potential new use for ErbB inhibitors in accelerating inflammation resolution. These findings suggest the ErbB family of kinases may be novel targets for treatments of chronic inflammatory disease, and the potential for repurposing ErbB inhibitors currently in use for cancer may have significant clinical potential in a broader range of indications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Our objectives for this study are to identify compounds that are able to resolve neutrophilic inflammation.

IL-6, KC (Duoset ELISA kits, R and D systems) and IgM (Thermofisher Scientific) in cell free lavage were measured by ELISA as per manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analysed using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) using one-way or two-way ANOVA (with appropriate post-test detailed in the Figure legends) for all in vitro data and appropriate in vivo experiments. Non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U-test or Kruskal-Wallis test) were used for selected in vivo experiments with non-Gaussian distribution. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (standard error of mean), and significance was accepted at p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p><bold>General</bold>: We thank Lynne Williams, Carl Wright, Jessica Willis, Elizabeth Marsh and Catherine Loynes for help with animal experiments as well as volunteers and patients who donated blood to this study.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Defining the functional neutrophil kinome reveals ErbB kinases as potential therapeutic targets in inflammatory disease&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jean-Pierre Levraud.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Within our discussion, the reviewers all felt that while the story on the ErbB2 role in inflammation was interesting, more work was needed to really conclude its specific role, especially as this is not the first study to identify a role for ErbBs in neutrophil function and inflammation. Moreover, there was a consensus that the manuscript, as it stands now, really consists of two incomplete and disconnected stories: the kinome and the inhibitor screen. They were also more puzzled that ErB2, which was the main focus of the paper, did not even come up in the kinome. This brings up questions about both approaches. Overall, the impression was that this paper would be better understood as two separate stories but that both stories needed more experiments to be convincing, as outlined in the specific comments, below. One of the reviewers points out that there is a conditional (floxed) Erb2 mutant in mouse (Ozcelik et al., 2002). If the authors use this line and a neutrophil-specific Cre line, they could add genetic evidence. They also agreed that kinase assays needed to be performed to show that the effects were specific as well as live imaging of their zebrafish experiments to determine whether the effects were on cell migration or cell death. Because we all felt that it was unlikely for you produce more convincing data in less than 2 months, the usual turnaround for <italic>eLife</italic>, any resubmission would need to be as a new paper, and we would argue without the kinome data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors report that inhibition of ErbB kinase limits neutrophil inflammation by affecting neutrophil apoptosis. The paper uses several systems: human neutrophils, zebrafish and mice to probe the effect of ErbB kinase inhibition on inflammation. The observations are intriguing and suggest that ErbB inhibition may provide a therapeutic target for inflammatory disease.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Genetic approaches to implicate ErbB kinases in these processes, especially in the zebrafish model or cell lines would better support their conclusion that ErbB kinases regulate neutrophil apoptosis and inflammation. Are there genetic mutants or knockdowns in either cell lines or zebrafish?</p><p>More information about where ErbB kinases are expressed in human/mouse/zebrafish tissues would be informative. Is this a neutrophil intrinsic effect? The in vitro analysis supports this idea however it is unclear if this could be due to toxic effects of the compounds on neutrophils versus inhibition of a specific pathway.</p><p>Cell toxicity remains a concern (in particular Figure 4). Was there specificity of the inhibitors for ErbB kinases in neutrophils? Can a kinase activity assay be performed? What was the expression of ErbB kinases in human neutrophils? Was the activity/expression regulated by pro-survival signals?</p><p>Throughout the number of replicates and total N was not always clear. This should be indicated in the figures and figure legends.</p><p>Figure 1: The kinome figure is not user friendly. In Figure 1B, it would be useful to know what fold increase or decrease was observed with GMCSF treatment (and more information about the conditions of the treatment). Figure 1 should reference the tables that correspond with this data. An alternative would be to include a table within the figure (with fold changes in expression by GMCSF).</p><p>Figure 2: The kinetics of the assay was long duration (24 hour pre-treatment). What was the effect if larvae were treated with the drug for shorter times? What happens at earlier time points?</p><p>Figure 4: Is there a change in ErbB kinase expression or activity in normal/COPD donors? A western blot would be useful.</p><p>Figures 5 and 6: Do pro-survival signals increase ErbB kinase expression or activity?</p><p>Figure 7C: It was not entirely clear what is being measured here?</p><p>Figure 8: Was there an effect on neutrophil reverse migration or just apoptosis? The authors have reported the use of photoconversion to analyze neutrophil reverse migration and this would be informative in this context.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript is from an established group of respected neutrophil biologists and the study combines profiling of the neutrophil kinome with studies of selected kinase inhibitors as a strategy to advance understanding of neutrophil apoptosis regulation and to identify possible targets for therapeutic intervention in COPD and related diseases.</p><p>The main strengths of the study are the generation of a kinome profile of human neutrophils and evidence of significant overlap with the kinome of zebrafish.</p><p>The main weaknesses are the lack of validation of the kinome data and the results of the inhibitor screen. Thus, the kinome analsysis remains merely a list of enzymes, and the results of the associated inhibitor screen have not been directly validated.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Rather than characterizing the kinome itself, a library of kinase inhibitors was screened to identify compounds that accelerate neutrophil apoptosis. Based on these results, further experiments focused on inhibitors of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB. However, these data are incomplete. Thus, as presented, the manuscript contains two incomplete stories.</p><p>2) Regarding the screen, what accounts for the differential effects of inhibitors that target the same kinases? Why does the ErbB1/B4 inhibitor induces more apoptosis than the ErbB1/B/B4 inhibitor (Figure 3)?</p><p>3) Most experiments focus on ErbB2 as an inhibitor target of interest, yet the kinome suggests that only ErbB3 is present. What accounts for this discrepancy? Data demonstrating the abundance of all ErbB family proteins in neutrophils should be added.</p><p>4) There is no direct measurement of ErbB isoform activity or phosphorylation or analysis of relevant substrates (in the absence or presence of inhibitors). Thus, the effects could be indirect or non-specific. To address this, the activity and abundance of ErbB family members in resting, apoptotic, and cAMP- or GMCSF-stimulated cells is missing. Reliance on inhibitors without demonstration of specificity and efficacy is risky.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Rahman et al. use a drug discovery approach, combining an in vivo screen in zebrafish and an in vitro screen of human cells, to identify kinase inhibitors that would help resolve neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases. They focus on ErbB inhibitors and show that they promote neutrophil apoptosis, even in the presence of pro-survival stimuli. Then, they perform experiments in mouse and again in zebrafish to establish a proof-of-concept of the usefulness of this type of drugs in inflammatory diseases.</p><p>This combination of models makes for a powerful and exciting approach. In general, experiments are performed carefully, and the statistical analysis is sound. However, I find that the authors tend to overstate the novelty of their findings.</p><p>Inhibition of neutrophil function par erbstatin is not exactly something new – it has been described first in a 1990 paper (Naccache et al., 1990). Actually, searching PubMed with keywords &quot;neutrophil&quot; and &quot;erbstatin&quot; returns 38 references, of which not one is cited in the manuscript. Not all these references are relevant, but clearly the sentence at the end of the Introduction (&quot;This study is the first to identifiy a role for ErbBs in neutrophil function and inflammation&quot;) is an exaggeration. The relevant previous literature has to be incorporated in Introduction and Discussion section.</p><p>In the Introduction, the authors state &quot;there are no treatment strategies in clinical use to reverse this cellular mechanism&quot;: maybe not &quot;reverse&quot;, but roflumilast is an approved anti-inflammatory drug to prevent exacerbation in COPD. This should be discussed at the very least.</p><p>The final zebrafish experiment (Figure 8) is a disappointing, given the easy imaging of neutrophil migration and death in this system. It does not add much to the initial screen. A measurement of frequency of neutrophil death at the site of injury, in particular, would be desirable considering the general emphasis of the manuscript on induction of neutrophil apoptosis.</p><p>Table S1A: Please provide a quantitation of the expression level of each kinase in human neutrophils.

Moreover, there was a consensus that the manuscript, as it stands now, really consists of two incomplete and disconnected stories: the kinome and the inhibitor screen. They were also more puzzled that ErB2, which was the main focus of the paper, did not even come up in the kinome. This brings up questions about both approaches. Overall, the impression was that this paper would be better understood as two separate stories but that both stories needed more experiments to be convincing, as outlined in the specific comments, below. One of the reviewers points out that there is a conditional (floxed) Erb2 mutant in mouse (Ozcelik et al., 2002). If the authors use this line and a neutrophil-specific Cre line, they could add genetic evidence. They also agreed that kinase assays needed to be performed to show that the effects were specific as well as live imaging of their zebrafish experiments to determine whether the effects were on cell migration or cell death. Because we all felt that it was unlikely for you produce more convincing data in less than 2 months, the usual turnaround for eLife, any resubmission would need to be as a new paper, and we would argue without the kinome data.</p></disp-quote><p>On reflection, we agree that the description of the neutrophil kinome impaired the clarity of the subsequent experiments. We have therefore removed the kinome data (Figure 1). Comments relating to expression of ErbBs have resulted in new data in the form of a cellular ELISA and confirm ErbB3 protein expression by human neutrophils. We agree that adding genetic evidence would further support our conclusion. As a reviewer states, there is a conditional ErbB2 mutant in the mouse. However, we feel that a whole animal knockout may in fact be more informative since the use of ErbB inhibitors in an inflammatory disease setting, which is the long term aim of this work, would target multiple tissues and systems and not a single cell type. Both EGFR and ErbB2 whole organism knockouts in mice are limited by pre- and postnatal lethality. We have therefore addressed this in our zebrafish model of inflammation using CRISPR/Cas9 which recapitulate findings from the inhibitor studies. Furthermore, we show that targeting ErbBs induces neutrophil apoptosis in vivo, thus providing a potential mechanism for inflammation resolution, and this new data has been added to the manuscript as described in more detail below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors report that inhibition of ErbB kinase limits neutrophil inflammation by affecting neutrophil apoptosis. The paper uses several systems: human neutrophils, zebrafish and mice to probe the effect of ErbB kinase inhibition on inflammation. The observations are intriguing and suggest that ErbB inhibition may provide a therapeutic target for inflammatory disease.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments and are encouraged that they found our study interesting. We are glad that they were persuaded of the potential of ErbB inhibition as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases such as COPD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Genetic approaches to implicate ErbB kinases in these processes, especially in the zebrafish model or cell lines would better support their conclusion that ErbB kinases regulate neutrophil apoptosis and inflammation. Are there genetic mutants or knockdowns in either cell lines or zebrafish?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that genetic approaches would provide better evidence for our conclusion that ErbB kinase inhibition increases apoptosis and enhances inflammation resolution. In order to directly address this, we have performed genetic knockdown in our zebrafish model using CRISPR/Cas9. This work forms new panels of novel data. We find that in zebrafish larvae with knockdown of both <italic>egfra (EGFR/ERBB1</italic> orthologue) and <italic>erbb2</italic> genes, there is a reduction in neutrophil number at the tail fin injury site (new Figure 5D), which recapitulates the phenotype seen in zebrafish larvae treated with ErbB inhibitors (new Figure 5B-C). Whole body neutrophil number was also reduced in these larvae (new Figures 5F and 5J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More information about where ErbB kinases are expressed in human/mouse/zebrafish tissues would be informative. Is this a neutrophil intrinsic effect? The in vitro analysis supports this idea however it is unclear if this could be due to toxic effects of the compounds on neutrophils versus inhibition of a specific pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>EGFR is expressed in primary human neutrophils as confirmed by flow cytometry and CELISA (Lewkowicz et al., 2005) which is now referenced in the Discussion section. Datasets published on the online Expression Atlas (www.ebi.ac.uk) also confirm expression of ErbB family members in human and mouse neutrophils. Furthermore, we show human neutrophil expression of ErbB2 by western blot and RT-PCR (Figure 4) and have generated new data to show ErbB3 expression by ELISA (Figure 4C). Phosphorylated ErbB2 was detected in the Kinexus kinase antibody microarray (Table 1). We agree that the in vitro work suggests the effects of the inhibitors are mediated, at least in part, via intrinsic effects in neutrophils. Regarding toxic effects of inhibitors, we address this below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Cell toxicity remains a concern (in particular Figure 4). Was there specificity of the inhibitors for ErbB kinases in neutrophils? Can a kinase activity assay be performed? What was the expression of ErbB kinases in human neutrophils? Was the activity/expression regulated by pro-survival signals?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We show in preliminary experiments that a 60KDa version of ErbB2 is upregulated by the survival factors GMCSF and dbcAMP (Figure 4). Unfortunately, kinase activity kits for ErbBs are not commercially available, but we have demonstrated that ErbB2 is rapidly phosphorylated in the presence of dbcAMP (Table 1). In new experimental work, we also show ErbB3 protein expression in human neutrophils by ELISA (new Figure 4C). Expression of ErbB3 did not change with the addition of survival factors dbcAMP, GMCSF or LPS. This assay however, measured total ErbB3 rather than phosphorylated ErbB3 and may suggest post-translational regulation is more important than protein levels. This would require further study and while very interesting, characterising ErbB expression is not the primary focus of this current manuscript. With respect to specificity, the inhibitors we have used are well-characterised, demonstrate selectivity for individual ErbB family members (see IC<sub>50</sub> values below) and have been extensively used by others to study ErbBs. To add to strength to out conclusion, we have tested clinical ErbB inhibitors for their effect on neutrophil apoptosis (new Figure 2A). We agree however, that this does not preclude the possibility that they may have some off-target effects, and investigating this will form part of further studies in our laboratory. We argue that, since multiple ErbB-targeting compounds share a profound anti-inflammatory effect across several models and species, there is a strong likelihood of ErbBs being key to this process. Because human neutrophils are genetically intractable, we are unable to delete ErbB genes in these cells. However, new genetic evidence in zebrafish (as described above) further supports the conclusion that inhibition of ErbB signalling has anti-inflammatory effects.</p><p>IC<sub>50</sub> values for selected inhibitors used in this study:</p><p>Gefitinib inhibits purified EGFR and HER-2 at IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.033 and ≥3.7 μmol/L, respectively (Wakeling et al., 2002)</p><p>Tyrphostin AG825 inhibits EGFR and ErbB2 at IC<sub>50</sub> values of 19 and 0.35 μmol/L respectively (Osherov et al., 1993)</p><p>CP-724,714 inhibits EGFR and ErbB2 at IC<sub>50</sub> values of 6.4 and 0.010 μmol/L respectively (Jani et al., 2007)</p><p>Erbstatin inhibits purified EGFR at a value of 0.77μmol/L (Umezawa et al., 1992)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Throughout the number of replicates and total N was not always clear.

We have addressed this throughout the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1: The kinome figure is not user friendly. In Figure 1B, it would be useful to know what fold increase or decrease was observed with GMCSF treatment (and more information about the conditions of the treatment). Figure 1 should reference the tables that correspond with this data. An alternative would be to include a table within the figure (with fold changes in expression by GMCSF).</p></disp-quote><p>This section has been removed from our manuscript to aid the overall clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: The kinetics of the assay was long duration (24 hour pre-treatment). What was the effect if larvae were treated with the drug for shorter times? What happens at earlier time points?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for this ambiguity. Figure 2 which detailed the zebrafish screen is now Figure 1A. There is no 24 hour pre-treatment in these experiments. The larvae are treated for a total of 6 hours, beginning at 6 hours after injury until 12 hours after injury. This timing is in order to capture those compounds which enhance inflammation resolution. We have added further detail to Figure 1—figure supplement 1 to clarify the timescale.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: Is there a change in ErbB kinase expression or activity in normal/COPD donors? A western blot would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point. Since the rates of either baseline or modified apoptosis did not differ between healthy controls and COPD patients, we hypothesised that ErbB expression also would not differ between these groups and therefore did not prioritise this experiment. Unfortunately, the ethical approvals for this study have now expired and we are unable to explore this further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 5 and 6: Do pro-survival signals increase ErbB kinase expression or activity?</p></disp-quote><p>The Kinexus antibody array (Table 1) shows upregulation of phosphorylated ErbB2 by dbcAMP at both 30 and 60 minutes. We also show both dbcAMP and GMCSF upregulate ErbB2 protein (Figure 4). Total ErbB3 expression was unaltered with dbcAMP, GMCSF or LPS (Figure 4). Surprisingly there are no well-optimised commercially available activity kits for ErbBs and since neutrophils are not transfectable we are unable to use plasmid-based reporter systems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7C: It was not entirely clear what is being measured here?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for a lack of clarity. Figure 7C (now Figure 5C) shows the percentage neutrophil apoptosis on BALF cytocentrifuge slides from mice treated either with PBS (control) or tyrphostin (Tyr). The closed circles quantify ‘free’ (extracellular) neutrophils, i.e. not including neutrophils that have been ingested by macrophages. The closed triangles quantify both ‘free’ apoptotic neutrophils as well as those that are inside macrophages. This latter count takes into account apoptotic events (inclusions) that have been efferocytosed. Such apoptotic inclusions are highlighted by arrows in Figure 5E. We felt this was important to capture since ‘free’ apoptotic events in vivoare rare due to rapid efferocytosis. We have now made amendments to the figure legend to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 8: Was there an effect on neutrophil reverse migration or just apoptosis? The authors have reported the use of photoconversion to analyze neutrophil reverse migration and this would be informative in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 8 has been updated and is now a much expanded Figure 5. In addition to our original inhibitor data, we have added genetic evidence of a role of ErbB kinases in inflammation. We have also measured apoptosis in both inhibitor treated and <italic>egfra</italic> and <italic>erbb2</italic> ‘crispant’ larvae. Briefly, we find that neutrophil apoptosis was increased both at the tail fin injury site and in the caudal haematopoietic tissue of zebrafish treated overnight with ErbB inhibitors. Since we know from experience (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dmm.biologists.org/content/dmm/9/6/621.full.pdf">https://dmm.biologists.org/content/dmm/9/6/621.full.pdf</ext-link>) that reverse migration is unlikely to occur in parallel with apoptosis, we did not prioritise photoconversion experiments. Apoptosis was not significantly increased in <italic>egfra/erbb2</italic> crispant larvae at the tail fin injury site, however potential explanations for this have been explored in the discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript is from an established group of respected neutrophil biologists and the study combines profiling of the neutrophil kinome with studies of selected kinase inhibitors as a strategy to advance understanding of neutrophil apoptosis regulation and to identify possible targets for therapeutic intervention in COPD and related diseases.</p><p>The main strengths of the study are the generation of a kinome profile of human neutrophils and evidence of significant overlap with the kinome of zebrafish.</p><p>The main weaknesses are the lack of validation of the kinome data and the results of the inhibitor screen. Thus, the kinome analsysis remains merely a list of enzymes, and the results of the associated inhibitor screen have not been directly validated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments. The weaknesses that they identified are addressed point by point below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Rather than characterizing the kinome itself, a library of kinase inhibitors was screened to identify compounds that accelerate neutrophil apoptosis. Based on these results, further experiments focused on inhibitors of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB. However, these data are incomplete. Thus, as presented, the manuscript contains two incomplete stories.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that our original presentation of this work lacked clarity of the message we are trying to convey. In response to these comments, we have substantially rewritten the manuscript, removing the description of the kinome and focusing on the functional aspects by adding genetic evidence for the role of ErbB kinase in inflammation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding the screen, what accounts for the differential effects of inhibitors that target the same kinases? Why does the ErbB1/B4 inhibitor induces more apoptosis than the ErbB1/B/B4 inhibitor (Figure 3)?</p></disp-quote><p>These are interesting and insightful questions. Some of the effects are due to efficacy at the dose used, some due to cellular penetration of the drug (which we have not assessed) and other effects may relate to differential efficacy at the different receptors. Small changes in the balance of inhibition of one kinase over another might alter the final physiological effect. In addition, neutrophils are heterogenous cell populations with donor variability, so we would expect some variation in responses to treatment, even with the same compound.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Most experiments focus on ErbB2 as an inhibitor target of interest, yet the kinome suggests that only ErbB3 is present. What accounts for this discrepancy? Data demonstrating the abundance of all ErbB family proteins in neutrophils should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our original manuscript did overly focus on ErbB2. This was primarily because the Kinexus antibody array (Table 1) identified only phosphorylated ErbB2, but indeed our inhibitor and genetic studies show roles for other ErbBs. We have now reduced the emphasis on ErbB2 in order to include reflect the potential of other ErbB family members as important targets. The kinome data used an arbitrary threshold and ErbB2 was present in those data at lower levels – these data have now been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is no direct measurement of ErbB isoform activity or phosphorylation or analysis of relevant substrates (in the absence or presence of inhibitors). Thus, the effects could be indirect or non-specific. To address this, the activity and abundance of ErbB family members in resting, apoptotic, and cAMP- or GMCSF-stimulated cells is missing. Reliance on inhibitors without demonstration of specificity and efficacy is risky.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the effects of the inhibitors may be exerted through other targets. This is difficult to circumvent, given that neutrophils are genetically intractable and therefore preclude the use of plasmid-based reporter systems. We have however, directly analysed the ErbB substrate AKT, and show that phosphorylation of AKT is reduced in the presence of tyrphostin (Figure 3F). Surprisingly and frustratingly there are no well-optimised commercially-available activity kits for ErbBs. With respect to abundance and activity, we show in the Kinexus antibody array (Table 1) that phosphorylated ErbB2 is upregulated by dbcAMP at both 30 and 60 minutes (ErbB2 is itself an ErbB substrate). We also show both dbcAMP and GMCSF upregulate ErbB2 protein (Figure 4). In new experimental work, we found that ErbB3 expression in human neutrophils was not regulated by dbcAMP, GMCSF or LPS (Figure 4, new panel C). This assay however, measured total ErbB3 rather than phosphorylated ErbB3 and may suggest post-translational regulation is more important than protein levels. Proving this would require further study and while very interesting, characterising ErbB expression is not the primary focus of this current manuscript. We argue that, since multiple structurally-unrelated ErbB-targeting compounds share a profound anti-inflammatory effect across several models and species, there is a strong likelihood of ErbBs being key to this process. This is supported by the new genetic knockdown of <italic>egfra</italic> and <italic>erbb2</italic> in zebrafish, which also reduces neutrophilic inflammation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Rahman et al. use a drug discovery approach, combining an in vivo screen in zebrafish and an in vitro screen of human cells, to identify kinase inhibitors that would help resolve neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases. They focus on ErbB inhibitors and show that they promote neutrophil apoptosis, even in the presence of pro-survival stimuli. Then, they perform experiments in mouse and again in zebrafish to establish a proof-of-concept of the usefulness of this type of drugs in inflammatory diseases.</p><p>This combination of models makes for a powerful and exciting approach. In general, experiments are performed carefully, and the statistical analysis is sound. However, I find that the authors tend to overstate the novelty of their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments and for recognising the powerful approaches we have taken and the care with which we have performed this work. We have now addressed the issue of novelty in our revision of the manuscript, please see below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Inhibition of neutrophil function par erbstatin is not exactly something new – it has been described first in a 1990 paper (Naccache et al., 1990). Actually, searching PubMed with keywords &quot;neutrophil&quot; and &quot;erbstatin&quot; returns 38 references, of which not one is cited in the manuscript. Not all these references are relevant, but clearly the sentence at the end of the Introduction (&quot;This study is the first to identify a role for ErbBs in neutrophil function and inflammation&quot;) is an exaggeration.

We have also added additional citations describing the use of tyrphostin inhibitors (not AG825 specifically) in in vivo models to the discussion.

They observed that: (1) ErbB family were the common targets of compounds that leading to neutrophil apoptosis in both zebrafish inflammation model and human neutrophils; (2) the ErbBs inhibitors promoted the apoptosis of neutrophils from both healthy volunteers and COPD patients; (3) GMCSG and dbcAMP, the neutrophil survival stimuli, promoted ErbB2 and ErbB3 expression in human neutrophils; (4) tyrphostin AG825 (an ErbBs inhibitor) and knockdown of egfra and erbb2 reduced inflammation in vivo. Altogether, the authors conclude that ErbB family participate in neutrophil survival and ErbB inhibitors play positive roles in accelerating inflammation resolution.</p><p>Overall, this study appears interesting, and data presented in this manuscript look solid. However, some data are confusing and do not fully support the conclusion of this study.</p><p>There are several issues that need to be addressed by the authors. Specific issues are referenced below.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to reviewer #3 for evaluating our manuscript, and for suggesting modifications for improvement. Although post-review discussions concluded that these were not all necessary to carry out, we have made revisions based on these suggestions (detailed below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “Identifying kinases regulating the resolution of neutrophilic inflammation in vivo”: &quot;We quantified the ability of PKIS to reduce the number of neutrophils at the site of injury during the resolution phase of inflammation.&quot; Please provide the specific data. And how to determine the zebrafish inflammation model is in the phase of inflammatory resolution, not acute phase.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added “recruitment phase” and “resolution phase” to Figure 1—figure supplement 1 as well as a citation which establishes the timecourse of neutrophilic inflammation in this model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors just showed the statistic results about apoptosis assessed by flow cytometry. It would be better to show the specific flow images in different groups and compare the differences.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this excellent suggestion. We have now added representative flow cytometry dot plots as a new figure supplement (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Detection apoptosis using light microscopy is not an ideal option. Maybe some apoptosis-related proteins should be detected by Western Blot, such as Bcl-2 and Bax.</p></disp-quote><p>Morphological assessment of neutrophil apoptosis is considered to be the gold standard. We have used a combination of light microscopy (a morphological assay) and flow cytometry (a biochemical assay) to assess neutrophil apoptosis in this paper, as well as showing the cell death was a caspase-dependent mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 1B what does the x-axis represent?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for any ambiguity. We have changed Figure 1B x-axis to “Individual protein kinase inhibitor compounds [62.5 μM]”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors demonstrated that tyrphostin AG825-driven neutrophil apoptosis is caspase-dependent. It would be better to detect the caspase-3 expression by Western Blot.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we feel that showing both Annexin V positivity as well as inhibition of cell death by Q-VD-OPh (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) are robust measurements of apoptosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The author showed that the expressions of both total and phosphorylated ErbB2 (pErbB2) were elevated. Does the increase of total protein indirectly increase the amount of phosphorylated protein? It would be better to detect the expression of phosphorylated ErbB2 by Western Blot. And the ratio pErbB2/ErbB2 should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We were unable to find a clean and reliable antibody to pErbB2 that worked well in neutrophil lysates by Western blot.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The data in Figure 4 are not enough to support the conclusion. The flow cytometry images in different groups should be provided. Other methods for detecting neutrophil apoptosis in lung tissue should probably be provided, such as immunohistochemistry. Did Tyr accelerate the inflammatory resolution in lung tissue in zymosan treated mice? HE staining for lung tissue should be detected.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for any confusion caused. The data in Figure 4A-E (now Figure 5) data from light microscopy and this is stated in the legend. Other methods for detecting neutrophil apoptosis in lung tissue should probably be provided, such as immunohistochemistry. Did Tyr accelerate the inflammatory resolution in lung tissue in zymosan treated mice? HE staining for lung tissue should be detected. Thank you for this suggestion. Neutrophil apoptosis was enumerated in BALF by light microscopy, which is considered the gold standard. Unfortunately, lungs were not obtained from the zymosan peritonitis animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors didn't demonstrate the role of ErbB inhibitors in accelerating inflammatory resolution both in mice and zebrafish models. The process of inflammatory resolution is dynamic. It would be better to monitor the tissue injury dynamically.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. Measuring tissue injury dynamically in the mouse is very challenging and beyond the scope of this study. Because we have studied multiple timepoints in the fish we feel this gives information on the dynamics of inflammation resolution.</p></body></sub-article></article>
