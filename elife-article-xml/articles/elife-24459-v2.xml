are critical for reward-based associative learning. However, critical pathways by which reward-related visual information is relayed to DA neurons remain unclear. To address this question, we investigated Pavlovian conditioning in macaque monkeys with unilateral primary visual cortex (V1) lesions (an animal model of ‘blindsight’). Anticipatory licking responses to obtain juice drops were elicited in response to visual conditioned stimuli (CS) in the affected visual field. Subsequent pharmacological inactivation of the superior colliculus (SC) suppressed the anticipatory licking. Concurrent single unit recordings indicated that DA responses reflecting the reward expectation could be recorded in the absence of V1, and that these responses were also suppressed by SC inactivation. These results indicate that the subcortical visual circuit can relay reward-predicting visual information to DA neurons and integrity of the SC is necessary for visually-elicited classically conditioned responses after V1 lesion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24459.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24459.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24459.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To survive and thrive, animals must learn to approach cues in their environment that are likely to lead to a desirable outcome and avoid those that might lead them to harm. A group of brain regions known as the midbrain dopamine system helps many animals to achieve this. Dopamine is the brain’s reward signal. Cues that predict rewards, such as the sight or smell of food, activate midbrain dopamine neurons. However, the details of this process remained unclear.</p><p>Takakuwa et al. have now examined how visual information that signals reward reaches the midbrain dopamine neurons. The anatomy of the visual system suggests two main possibilities. Information may travel directly from the eyes to an area of the midbrain called the superior colliculus, and then onto the dopamine neurons. Alternatively, information may travel to the midbrain indirectly via a pathway that includes additional processing in the brain’s outer layer, the visual cortex.</p><p>To distinguish between these routes, Takakuwa et al. studied monkeys in which the indirect pathway via the visual cortex had been damaged. Some people with damage to this pathway have a disorder called blindsight. They are able to detect the movement or location of stimuli, but they cannot consciously see those stimuli. The monkeys with damage to visual cortex were able to learn that an image on a screen predicted the delivery of fruit juice. After repeated trials, the monkeys began to lick the spout dispensing the juice whenever the image appeared, even if no juice was delivered. The monkeys’ midbrain dopamine neurons also sent more signals in response to the images, and showed greater activity when the images predicted large rewards than small ones. Takakuwa et al. next inactivated the superior colliculus with a drug and showed that this prevented both the licking behavior and the increased signaling.</p><p>Together the findings show that visual information about potential rewards can reach midbrain dopamine neurons via a direct route through the superior colliculus, without needing to pass via the visual cortex. The next step is to determine how and when the visual cortex may get involved in this process to help animals maximize rewards.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24459.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24459.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>associative learning</kwd><kwd>dopamine neuron</kwd><kwd>prediction error</kwd><kwd>subcortical vision</kwd><kwd>blindsight</kwd><kwd>monkey</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI Grant Number 22220006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isa</surname><given-names>Tadashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26112008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isa</surname><given-names>Tadashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI Grant Number 26221003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isa</surname><given-names>Tadashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Research Program for Brain Sciences 100160600067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isa</surname><given-names>Tadashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The subcortical visual pathway through the midbrain superior colliculus is responsible for visually evoked Pavlovian conditioning and dopamine neuron responses with predicted value in monkeys, which remained after lesioning V1.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adaptive behaviour in a changing environment requires that we have to learn and update associations between unconditioned rewards and punishments, and the sensory stimuli that predict them. This form of associative learning is called classical or Pavlovian conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pavlov, 1927</xref>). The Pavlovian paradigm has been used widely to investigate the role of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons in associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schultz, 1998</xref>). Much evidence indicates that the activity of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) makes a key contribution in associative learning, in part, by encoding reward prediction errors. A reward prediction error is a scalar signal that signifies a current event is better or worse than predicted.</p><p>In a series of pioneering experiments Schultz and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schultz et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mirenowicz and Schultz, 1994</xref>) showed that DA responses to an unpredicted reward (unconditioned stimulus; UCS), gradually transferred to an unexpected predicting conditioned stimulus (CS). If a predicting CS was presented but subsequent reward delivery was withheld, DA neurons would pause briefly at the expected time of reward delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>). These bidirectional sensory responses of DA neurons to events that were better or worse than expected led to the formulation of the reward prediction error hypothesis of DA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Montague et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schultz, 1998</xref>). Subsequent experiments have confirmed that phasic DA responses are sensitive to reward magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tobler et al., 2005</xref>), reward probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fiorillo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakahara et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>) and reward delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kobayashi and Schultz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fiorillo et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that short latency phasic responses can be elicited in DA neurons by unexpected rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schultz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fiorillo, 2013</xref>) or conditioned stimuli that predict future reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eshel et al., 2015</xref>). A critical feature of these early experiments was that the latency of sensory (usually visually) elicited DA responses was typically 100 ms or less following stimulus onset. This raised the question of by which route(s) is the visual information for reward expectation relayed to DA neurons in the ventral midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Redgrave et al., 1999</xref>). In a series of investigations, a novel projection from the subcortical midbrain superior colliculus (SC) directly to the midbrain DA neurons was demonstrated in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Comoli et al., 2003</xref>), cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McHaffie et al., 2006</xref>) and monkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">May et al., 2009</xref>). The SC is an evolutionary archaic visual structure in the vertebrate brain that receives direct input from retinal ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perry et al., 1984</xref>), and is especially sensitive to unexpected luminance changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boehnke and Munoz, 2008</xref>). A later study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dommett et al., 2005</xref>) confirmed that the retino-tecto-nigral projections were involved in the short-latency phasic activation and release of DA in the basal ganglia following a transient light-flash. However, this investigation was conducted in anaesthetized rodents, and it remains to be determined whether the SC can play a critical role in the short-latency CS-elicited activation of DA neurons and conditioned responses in awake behaving non-human primates.</p><p>During the evolutionary expansion of the cerebral cortex, the relative importance of the geniculo-striate projection to primary visual cortex (V1) for visual perception increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Livingstone and Hubel, 1988</xref>). This development offered a further potential route via V1, by which visual information for reward expectation might be relayed to ventral midbrain DA neurons. Therefore, the specific purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the subcortical visual pathway via the SC can mediate the afferent visual CS signal in the Pavlovian conditioning paradigm and activate DA neurons at short-latency in primates. To do this, we used monkeys that had a unilateral lesion of cortical area, V1. This preparation in which primary cortical visual processing was disabled was used to isolate the contribution of the SC that remained intact on the V1 lesioned side. After V1 damage, visual awareness is impaired in the lesion-affected visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cowey and Stoerig, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoshida and Isa, 2015</xref>). However, from both human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Poppel et al., 1973</xref>) and animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cowey and Stoerig, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoshida and Isa, 2015</xref>) it is known that a transient visual stimulus presented in the lesion-affected visual field can trigger a range of behavioural responses, in the apparent absence of subjective awareness. This phenomenon has been called ‘blindsight’, where many of the residual visual competences are thought to be mediated by the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mohler and Wurtz, 1977</xref>). Consequently, we have made use of animals that were used previously to characterize the phenomenon of ‘blindsight’; they have abilities to make saccadic eye movements to a visual target presented in the lesion-affected visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoshida et al., 2008</xref>), despite their awareness to the visual target was impaired like human blindsight patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoshida and Isa, 2015</xref>). This animal model enabled us to test whether the intact subcortical visual circuitry in this preparation can support visual Pavlovian conditioning and short-latency activation of DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schultz, 1998</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of this study was, therefore, to test whether unilaterally V1-lesioned monkeys could associate reward-predicting visual cues with subsequent reward (Pavlovian conditioning), and whether visual CSs could activate midbrain DA neurons. To verify the role of subcortical visual processing, neural activity in the SC was suppressed with local injections of a pharmacological agent.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>V1 lesion</title><p>The right V1 of monkey K and U, and left V1 of monkey T was surgically removed by aspiration, 46, 44 and 6 months before the present experiments, respectively. The lesion area was confirmed by MR images and the range of the lesion-affected visual field was confirmed by increased threshold for detecting saccadic targets at the beginning of the present experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We presented targets at possible positions which covered the whole contralesional visual field (monkey K; 3 directions × 3 eccentricities, monkey U; 5 directions × 4 eccentricities, monkey U; 5 directions × 3 eccentricities) and luminance contrast sensitivity of all targets to induce saccadic eye movements clearly decreased in affected visual field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The visual deficits caused by these lesions was similar to the animals which were reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoshida et al., 2008</xref>). These results indicated that the V1 lesion affected most of the contralesional visual field, at least from 5° to 15° eccentricities. Visual input pathways from retina can be classified into two major pathways; one is cortical pathways via LGN and V1, the other is subcortical pathways via the SC. The monkeys with unilateral V1 lesion were used to investigate abilities of the subcortical visual pathways through the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mohler and Wurtz, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takaura et al., 2011</xref>).

Before collicular inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) the DA responses to the task-related stimuli were similar to those observed in previous experiments (see above – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). After the injection of muscimol, when the relevant SC was inactivated, the robust response evoked by the FP was largely unaffected (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref> (left-hand panels), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> left and 4D left, Wilcoxon test, not significantly different). After the muscimol injection the response of the recorded neuron to presentation of the LR-CS was retained for a short while (central panels <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, after a few trials the drug action became apparent, and the CS-evoked response was almost completely abolished (central panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). It is also significant that in these early trials, when the reward delivery was still predicted by visual input from the SC, reward presentation failed to evoke a phasic DA response. However, as the colliculus became fully inhibited, the now unpredicted presentation of the reward evoked a robust phasic response, which in this case was clearly dependent on the magnitude and timing of reward predicted by the CS. This pattern of response was consistent in all recorded neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Also, for most of the recorded neurons, reward responses emerged as the inactivation progressed (right panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C and D</xref>). In SR trials, firing rate to CS was unaltered by the injection. During the SC inactivation, DA responses evoked by the CS were not significantly different between LR and SR trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these results confirm that, in the absence of V1, visual signals signifying CS onset, with the capacity to elicit a short latency phasic response in presumed DA neurons, are most likely to be relayed via the direct retino-tecto-nigral projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Comoli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dommett et al., 2005</xref>), although an indirect contribution, possibly involving the pedunculopontine nucleus cannot be ruled out at present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harting, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Redgrave et al., 1987</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kobayashi and Okada, 2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we investigated whether subcortical visual systems, in particular the midbrain superior colliculus (SC), can support behavioural Pavlovian conditioning, while at the same time evoke short latency phasic responses in ventral midbrain DA neurons. This was achieved by using monkeys with unilateral damage to the V1 that had been used previously to investigate the phenomenon of ‘blindsight’. The purpose of using this preparation was to isolate the contribution of the SC that remained intact on the V1 disabled side. The main findings of the present study were, first, that after several days of training, presentation of a CS was equally capable of eliciting a robust conditioned response when it was presented either to the V1 lesion-affected visual field, or to the field served both by an intact visual cortex and the SC. This result demonstrated the capacity of residual subcortical visual pathways to elicit Pavlovian conditioned responses. Secondly, when identical CSs that predicted different amounts of primary reward (juice) were presented at different locations, either within the intact or lesion-affected visual fields, differential conditioned responses were elicited. This suggests that the subcortical neural mechanisms responsible for mediating the conditioned responses can discriminate CSs on the basis of spatial location. Thirdly, a critical involvement of the SC was established by showing that anticipatory conditioned responding reflecting reward expectation was disrupted when the critical locus representing the LR-CS within the spatial retinotopic map in the SC was locally inactivated with muscimol. Fourthly, parallel electrophysiological recording from putative DA neurons revealed that visual CSs presented to the lesion-affected visual field elicited patterns of phasic responses that have been widely reported by others. Specifically, the initial task-relevant fixation point evoked robust DA responses that were independent of subsequent CS value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsumoto and Takada, 2013</xref>); the temporally unpredicted CSs evoked phasic DA responses that were dependent on the predictive value of the CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tobler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fiorillo, 2013</xref>); while the predicted reward deliveries evoked only muted responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schultz, 1998</xref>). Finally, phasic DA responses evoked by CS were almost completely abolished when the CS representation in the colliculus was pharmacologically blocked. Thus, the SC was critically involved in the short-latency activation of DA neurons by visual CSs presented to the V1 lesion-affected visual field. Together these results show that visual cues presented to the lesion-affected field in monkeys with a unilateral V1 lesion can support behavioral Pavlovian conditioning, and elicit DA responses that reflect the reward predicted by the CS via an afferent projection route involving the midbrain SC.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Possible input pathways for reward prediction</title><p>Many studies have indicated that midbrain DA neurons causally contribute to reinforcement learning. For example, when reward expectation signals from DA neurons were impaired by D1 receptor blocker or when NMDA receptors were knocked out in DA receptor expressing neurons in various brain areas, conditioned response was impaired in many kinds of behavioral learning tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Di Ciano et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flagel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parker et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Puig and Miller, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berridge and Robinson, 1998</xref>).

This view immediately provokes the question of what early afferent visual processing could allow the DA neurons to respond in this fashion to conditioned visual stimuli (the sensory modality that is most frequently used)? Following the onset of a visual CS response latencies in V1 are typically in the range 40–60 ms, while in the inferotemporal cortex where objects/events are identified they are slower in the range 80–100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thorpe and Fabre-Thorpe, 2001</xref>). Moreover, since there are no obvious direct connections to the ventral midbrain, the results of cortical visual processing are likely to be relayed via additional time consuming indirect routes. On the other hand, response latencies in the retino-recipient midbrain SC are significantly less (40–50 ms) and there is a direct tectonigral projection to substantia nigra pars compacta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Comoli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McHaffie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">May et al., 2009</xref>). It is probable, therefore, that the earliest sensory component of the phasic DA response (70–150 ms) is mediated via subcortical visual processing involving the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Comoli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dommett et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Two versions of the two-visual system hypothesis as an explanation for the bimodal characteristic of short latency phasic DA responses to visual CSs have been presented (Joshua et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schultz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Redgrave et al., 2017</xref>). The first is that the initial component of the phasic DA response is a non-selective salience signal that represents a temporal salient-event prediction error (Joshua et al 2009, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schultz, 2016</xref>). The second phasic component is value-coded and takes longer to compute because the unexpected event needs to be identified before its value is known. Stimulus identification frequently requires stimulus detection, foveation and cortical analysis of geometric form, colour, texture, and apparent motion, in various permutations and combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nomoto et al., 2010</xref>). However, in the case of simple stimuli (for example, luminance change at different spatial locations) it is suggested that the non-selective salience and value components can merge to a near unimodal response that, in some cases, can be separated by sophisticated mathematical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fiorillo et al., 2013</xref>). This version suggests that for both subcortical salience and cortical stimulus identification the early sensory responses have to be relayed through an unspecified ‘value-decoder’ that communicates with DA neurons, thereby enabling them to report reward prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schultz, 2016</xref>).</p><p>What is the likely location of the hypothesized ‘value decoder’? Uchida and colleagues recently identified all the brain regions which project to DA neurons in rodents. They report afferent connections from the striatum, amygdala, subthalamic nucleus, pedunculopontine nucleus, rostromedial reticular nucleus, and GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</xref>). Consequently, there are many possible locations that receive input from primary visual structures, compute stimulus value and communicate this to DA neurons in the ventral midbrain. These indirect routes of communication can offer a perfectly reasonable explanation for the value coding of the second delayed component of the early phasic DA response.</p><p>However, it is important to note that the earliest component (70–150 ms) of phasic DA response is not always best described as a value insensitive salience signal. Both the present results (where cortical visual processing is impaired), and earlier studies of Schultz and his colleagues involving intact monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tobler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fiorillo, 2013</xref>) report that when CSs can be discriminated on the basis of luminance change at different locations (a subcortical collicular visual competence – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boehnke and Munoz, 2008</xref>), the phasic DA response latencies are frequently around 100 ms (pre-gaze shift), unimodal and clearly code the predictive value of the CS. So how is it possible for unimodal phasic DA responses (for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tobler et al., 2005</xref>) to code value at such short latencies? Visual response latencies in intermediary structures identified above are too long (typically &gt;100 ms) to account for value coding of a unimodal phasic DA response that peaks at about 100 ms. A second, rather simpler version of two-visual system hypothesis can explain value-coding of both components of the early phasic DA response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Redgrave et al., 2017</xref>). The proposal is that the predictive value of a visual CS may already be encoded in the early sensory response of both the cortical and subcortical early visual systems. For example, there are many papers that demonstrate that an association with, or an expectation of reward can dramatically influence the magnitude of the initial sensory response in early sensory areas throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mogami and Tanaka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Serences and Saproo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Metzger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leathers and Olson, 2012</xref>), including the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ikeda and Hikosaka, 2003</xref>). The most parsimonious explanation of how the earliest responses of DA neurons can be value-coded is, therefore, that they receive input from the SC that has been already value-coded through a classically conditioned process of sensory pre-tuning of the CS value in early sensory structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ikeda and Hikosaka, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Thus, in our study and those of others, stimuli are conditioned by Pavlovian association with different levels/probabilities of reward, prior to the recording of DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fiorillo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tobler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>). The likely effect of this process would be to tune the initial sensory responses in early visual structures to reflect the reward predicted by the CS. According to this suggestion, if the object/event prediction error detected in early visual structures has been value-coded by prior Pavlovian association, the event prediction error would also be a reward prediction error. In the case of the SC, if a value-coded signal evoked by a CS was relayed to the DA neurons via the tectonigral projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Comoli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dommett et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McHaffie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">May et al., 2009</xref>), it would explain how DA neurons can signal reward prediction errors with latencies in the range 70–150 ms (present study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fiorillo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tobler et al., 2005</xref>). On the other hand, in the case of complex CSs that are presented at the same location, or randomly at different locations, the SC would certainly detect the luminance change associated with CS onset, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boehnke and Munoz, 2008</xref>). However, because subcortical sensory processing cannot perform complex CS discriminations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boehnke and Munoz, 2008</xref>), this onset response will not be value-coded, which might explain why, with complex CSs, the initial sensory component of the DA phasic response is a non-selective salient-event prediction error. A possible explanation of the second value-coded component of the phasic DA response could be that the cortical processing responsible for object/event identification is equally subject to Pavlovian pre-tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mogami and Tanaka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Serences and Saproo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weil et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>It is well known that there are two kinds of DA responses; one is sensitive to the value of future events, and the other is sensitive to their salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lerner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Menegas et al., 2017</xref>). In the context of the present study, we are unable to tell whether our DA responses reflected value or salience, because we used only reward associated CSs. To confirm which kinds of DA responses are elicited thorogh the subcortical visual processing, we have to conduct another experiments using aversive stimuli. However, at least, we could demonstrate that DA neurons could differentiate either reward value or salience with the visual information mediated by the SC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Three adult Japanese monkeys (Macaca fuscata; all female, body weight 5–7 kg, monkey K, U and T) were used in this study.

The opercular surface of the striate cortex and medial area in the Calcarine Sulcus was removed, while the ventrolateral part of the opercular surface, which encodes foveal vision (visual field for eccentricity 0 to 1.0°) remained intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Visually guided saccadic eye movement task</title><p>Prior to the surgery, animals were trained on a visually guided saccadic eye movement task. Their ability to respond to visual stimuli was assessed both before and after the V1 lesion. A monitor (Diamondcrysta WIDE RDT272WX (BK), MITSUBISHI) was positioned 34.5 cm in front of the monkeys’ face. A real-time experimental control system (Tempo for Windows, Reflective Computing; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://reflectivecomputing.com/">http://reflectivecomputing.com/</ext-link>) was used for stimulus presentation and data collection. In this task, fixation point (FP) initially appeared at the center of monitor screen. Monkeys were required to maintain fixation in a window centered on the FP (size, 2.5° radius) for 1.6–2.0 s. A second target visual stimulus (0.6°) was then presented randomly at one of five possible locations in the hemi-visual field for two monkeys (monkey U and T) and one of three possible locations in visual hemifield for one monkey (monkey K) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). When the target appeared, the FP was extinguished and monkeys were required to make a saccade to the peripheral visual target. A window surrounding the target was a circle with a radius of half the distance between each target location (radius = eccentricity × sin (direction angle between neighboring target positions) ⁄ 2). This arrangement prevented the targets to overlap with each other. Target luminance Michelson contrast was 0.87–0.94 (13.4–31.3 Weber contrast) on a background of 1.0 cd ⁄ m<sup>2</sup>. Reward was delivered if monkeys made a correct saccade to the target within 1 s after target presentation and maintaining fixation within the target window (3.2° radius) for 600 ms. Eye movements were measured with a video-based eye tracker (EYE-TRAC 6; Applied Science Laboratories, sampling rate: 240 Hz). All statistical analysis in this study were performed on Matlab (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Post-lesion assessment of visually-guided saccades</title><p>Details of the methods for calculations to construct the deficit map in these animals have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoshida et al., 2008</xref>). Luminance contrast of the targets was varied randomly trial-by-trial (0.02 to 0.9 as expressed in Michelson contrast (Weber contrast 0.04–18.0)). For this test, saccades landing in an area within a circle with a radius of half the distance between each target location (radius = eccentricity × sin(direction angle between neighboring target positions/2); 15° for monkey U and T, and 22.5° for monkey K) were counted as correct responses. The sensitivity of luminance contrast was defined as that representing the percentage of correct responses corresponding to the sensitivity value d’ = 2 (threshold for luminance contrast) and deficit maps of individual monkeys were constructed with these values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In general, the visual field disrupted by the lesion site extended from eccentricities about 5–20° in the monkeys used in this study. The luminance contrast and CS size were retained from previous studies that investigated visual responses of V1 neurons to stimuli presented in the natural blind spot. Our previous study also precluded the possibility of stray-light affecting the results in the present experimental environment by demonstrating the absence of a saccadic response to visual stimuli presented in the natural blind spot. The present Pavlovian conditioning experiments were initiated 46, 44 and 6 months after the V1 lesions in monkey K, U and T, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Pavlovian conditioning task</title><p>The task sequence of the Pavlovian conditioning paradigm used in the present study is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>. Conditioned stimuli (CS) (2.2° red square, luminance contrast: Michelson contrast 0.87 (Weber contrast 13.4) against the background of 1.0 cd ⁄ m<sup>2</sup>) were presented in either the upper (eccentricity: 10°, direction: 45° relative to the horizontal axis from the FP) or lower quadrant (eccentricity: 10°, direction: −45° relative to the horizontal axis from the central FP) of the lesion-affected or intact visual hemifield. Experiments involving CS presentation to either the lesion-affected or intact visual hemifield were conducted on separate days. At the beginning of each trial, a fixation point (FP) appeared at the center of monitor. After a 0.7 to 1.2 s fixation period, a CS predicting a large reward (LR-CS) or a CS predicting a small reward (SR-CS) was presented for 1.0 or 1.7 s. The two CSs were pseudo-randomly alternated within a daily session. Throughout the task, monkeys were required to maintain their gaze on the central FP to assure that CS presentation was either to the lesion-affected, or intact visual hemi-field. If fixation was broken, the trial was terminated immediately. The conditioned response (CR) in this task was the anticipatory licking elicited by the CS presentation that occurred prior to the juice delivery. The CR was measured by detecting electric contact between the monkey and the reward tube or by a photo-detector in experiments involving electrophysiological recording. A lick was recorded when the monkeys’ tongue was observed to approach the reward spout. To quantify the conditioned response elicited by the visual CS, the number of licking responses detected during the cue presentation (0 to 1.3 s) was counted in 0.1 s time bins in 14–16 sessions for each hemifield of each monkey. The frequency of licking (licking rate) was compared to a baseline frequency during the 1 s period (−1 to 0 s) before the CS onset (one-tailed paired t test, significant level at p&lt;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Recording from DA neurons</title><p>A principal aim of the study was to record from single DA neurons while the monkeys were engaged in the Pavlovian conditioning task. This was achieved using epoxylite-coated tungsten microelectrode (impedance: 9–10 MΩ at 1 kHz, FHC). Voltage recording were bandpass-filtered between 0.1 (or 0.3) and 10 kHz. Standard criteria were used for identification of putative DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ungless et al., 2004</xref>). First, the location of SNc and the VTA were estimated from MR images taken in advance. After having isolated a single neuron in the appropriate region, we tested whether the presentation of an unpredicted reward would cause a response. Two criteria to confirm the likelihood that we were recording from a DA neuron; (1) it had a low baseline activity between 1.0–10.0 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schultz and Romo, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>); and (2) the neuron had a spike width, which was clearly longer than those of nearby neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) that had rates of baseline firing in excess of 40 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ungless et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsumoto and Takada, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Muscimol injections</title><p>To determine the role of the residual subcortical visual circuit in eliciting conditioned responses in the Pavlovian task and CS-evoked responses in DA neurons we conducted experiments in which the SC on the V1 lesion-affected side was inactivated.

In our experiments we used additional single unit electrophysiology to locate the response field of the SC neurons responsive to the LR-CS. At these sites muscimol (0.5 μg in 0.5 μL) was pressure-injected (0.4 μL/min) using a 10 μL Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Company, Reno, Nevada, USA) mounted in a syringe pump. Conditioned response was measured both before and during inactivation of the SC.</p><p>In some experiments we recorded the activity of presumed DA neurons while the animals were performing the Pavlovian task.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Emergence of value coded dopamine signals via the superior colliculus in blindsight monkeys&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by David Van Essen (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Naoshige Uchida (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ethan Bromberg Martin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The mechanisms underlying the generation of dopamine responses remain to be clarified. This study examined the role of the superior colliculus (SC) in the generations of conditioned responses (CRs) (licking) as well as of the dopamine response evoked by conditioned stimuli (CS) in monkeys with V1 lesions (a model of blindsight). The authors first show that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) a reward-predictive CS elicited a similar level of CRs (licking) regardless of whether the stimulus was presented in the affected or unaffected visual field. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) Furthermore, CSs predicting a larger amount of reward (LR) elicited stronger licking behavior compared to that predicting small reward (SR). The authors then recorded the activity of putative dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), and showed that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) dopamine neurons exhibited phasic responses to the reward predictive CS presented in the affected visual field, which depended on the size of predicted reward. Finally, the authors demonstrate that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) inactivation of SC greatly reduced the dopamine responses to reward predictive CSs but not those to the presentation of a fixation point or reward.</p><p>All the reviewers thought that this study addresses an important question, and results are generally convincing. However, they found a number of interpretational issues, and had different levels of enthusiasm with regard to the depths of the study and the generality of the results due to the use of blindsight model monkeys. Nevertheless, all agreed that the data contain important information. The following essential points, however, need to be addressed by revising the text and by analyzing the existing data for this work to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential points:</p><p>1) Justification of blindsight should be done more carefully. That is, the effects of V1 lesions on behavior need to be explained in a greater detail. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, the authors show some data measuring the visual sensitivity. The authors report the procedures in Materials and methods, and do not include these materials in the main text. It would be helpful if the authors summarize these results in the Results section in some depths and justify blindsights based on the data (as well as previous studies). Furthermore, please summarize the phenotypes of blind-sight model monkeys studied previously in Introduction, so that the readers can understand the nature of the monkey model of blindsight.</p><p>2) It is unclear whether and what effects V1 lesions have had on dopamine responses. Have the authors recorded the activity of dopamine neurons while presenting the CSs in the unaffected visual field? If so, it would be very helpful to compare the dopamine responses to CSs presented in the affected and unaffected visual field. How do the responses compare when stimuli are presented to the two hemispheres?</p><p>3) The results demonstrated the necessity of the SC in conditioned responses and dopamine responses, but did not prove that its involvement was via direct retino-tecto-nigral projection to dopamine neurons.

Not only is the demonstration of intact DA signals despite V1 lesion already valuable on its own, but the authors also went the extra mile to test the causal contribution of the SC in this process. This study is also valuable due to its relevance to the short-latency response component of DA neurons, which many studies tend to gloss over. The possible implication for reward processing in the absence of phenomenal awareness is also intriguing – I wonder if it would be possible to do the behavioral experiment in blindsighted humans?</p><p>Overall, the motivation, experiments, and conclusions seem generally solid. I do have a few concerns about the interpretations that I suggest dialing back slightly, and a few suggestions about the analysis and presentation.</p><p>1) &quot;These results indicate that the retino-tecto-nigral projections can relay reward-predicting visual information to DA neurons and integrity of the SC is necessary for visually-elicited classically conditioned responses after V1 lesion.&quot; &quot;Specifically, our results show that visual input to DA neurons from the SC can signal value coded sensory events.&quot;</p><p>These and related statements in the paper seem a bit too strong.</p><p>The authors showed a clear necessity for the SC, but did not prove that its involvement was via direct retino-tecto-nigral projection to DA neurons. It could be an indirect effect. The authors argue against an indirect effect in the Discussion, but as they note, this is not conclusive proof.</p><p>Also, this paper proves that SC activity is necessary to construct a value signal in this task, but does not prove that SC activity itself signaled value or sent that signal to DA neurons. For instance, the SC's role in contributing to DA signals could be to code the stimulus location, which is the value-relevant feature in this task. A different area would then read out that location information and use it to figure out the stimulus value.</p><p>At least some of the SC's contribution in this task seems likely to occur in this manner. The SC is well known to be important for visual attention. Suppose SC activity is required for the brain to properly process a visual stimulus. Inactivating the SC would interfere with licking behavior and value signals in DA neurons, but that could reflect a more general deficit, not value coding by the SC.</p><p>Finally, let's suppose that the SC does directly transmit value coded signals to DA neurons. I feel that the way the authors explain this concept may mislead some readers. The authors describe it in terms of the retino-tecto-nigral pathway, and with an emphasis on Pavlovian training. This makes it sound like the value signals emerge via slow, long-term plasticity at synapses in this pathway (retina-SC or SC-DA):</p><p>&quot;There are many papers that demonstrate that an association with, or an expectation of reward can dramatically influence the magnitude of the initial sensory response in primary sensory areas throughout the brain (Mogami and Tanaka, 2006; Serences and Saproo, 2010; Metzger et al., 2006; Leathers and Olson, 2012), including the SC (Ikeda et al., 2003). […] The magnitude of such responses would then reflect the value of the predicted reward.&quot;</p><p>However, in my view value-related signals in the SC are more likely to emerge due to short-term changes in SC response gain caused by top-down modulatory inputs from other areas (e.g. spatial attention based on reward value). This seems more compatible with the Ikeda study cited here, since the rewarded location changed rapidly during that experiment, which the SC can adapt to in &lt; 3 trials (Isoda and Hikosaka, Journal of Neurophysiology 2008). If so, then despite the authors' apparent emphasis on bottom-up retino-tecto-nigral transmission, the value signals are actually injected into this pathway by other (possibly cortical) brain areas that send a top-down modulatory signal to the SC to change its response gains at different parts of its visual map.</p><p>P.S. I suggest not using the term &quot;sensory pre-conditioning&quot;, since it refers to a specific kind of training without reinforcement (Brogden, 1939), which isn't what the authors want to say here.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows the responses to CS/outcome for LR, which look beautiful. But it is also important to show the responses to CS/outcome for SR, even though only the LR CS was presented in the inactivated part of the visual field. This is because the key point is whether discrimination between the two CSs is impaired, not just the response to any single CS. Indeed, this distinction was important in the analysis of behavior: while inactivation abolished one animal's licking to the LR CS, for the other animal it induced equal licking for both CSs. Also, if the authors do see a change in DA responses to the SR CS/outcome despite it being outside the inactivated field, that would be interesting!</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Emergence of value coded dopamine signals via the superior colliculus in V1 lesioned monkeys&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by David Van Essen (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential points:</p><p>1) The authors still emphasize subjective awareness but this is not very well documented or backed up by data. It is also noted that the lesions might have been made a long time ago (~10 years?). Given these problems, we would like the authors to further address these points. Do the monkeys recover any (conscious) visual abilities (It wouldn't need to be high acuity vision to complete this task)? Was the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> about contrast sensitivity recorded recently, or is it adapted from the 2008 paper? In addition to discussing possible recovery, the authors need to be much clearer (throughout the entire paper) about the limitations of this study in the absence of psychophysical tests.</p><p>2) The same problem, regarding phenomenal awareness, is also important for the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref> (right, reward response). This data demonstrate that the SC is necessary for visual reward prediction, but it appears impossible to know whether the muscimol inactivation of SC caused loss of phenomenal awareness, or whether the muscimol inactivation was done in the absence of phenomenal awareness and thus constitutes a neural mechanism for unconscious reward processing. The authors suggest the latter (end of subsection “Possible input pathways for reward prediction”), but it does not seem to be an appropriate conclusion (or suggestion) because the authors did not measure conscious awareness.</p><p>3) Although the authors acknowledge that their paradigm cannot discriminate between salience and value, the title of the paper still reads as value-coding. Because the cues probably had very similar physical properties, and hence similar physical salience, this problem can be dealt with by more careful wording throughout. It appears to be confusing if the authors just add a disclaimer paragraph to the Discussion, and ignoring the disclaimer everywhere else. We suggest that the authors remove &quot;value-coded&quot; and then use more careful wording and make the manuscript consistent throughout the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24459.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential points:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Justification of blindsight should be done more carefully.</italic></p><p>The purpose of our investigation was to test whether evolutionary archaic subcortical visual circuitry can support Pavlovian conditioning and can activate ventral midbrain dopamine neurons.

Because we did not record activity in the SC and assessment of the effect of muscimol was performed at the end of each experiment. Furthermore, it is not clear what the animal would learn with the progressive onset of inhibition by muscimol in the SC. In our experimental paradigm the CS consistently predicts an upcoming reward….this does not change throughout the experimental session. What does change is that one monkey failed completely to respond behaviourally to the CS while the other monkey was no longer able to discriminate the location of CS presentation. In the case of the dopamine neurons – both the individual and population averaged data show that when both the V1 and the SC were disabled there was no phasic response to CS onset. With both cortical and subcortical visual systems out of action this would be expected. Further evidence supporting this interpretation was the return of the phasic dopamine response to reward presentation, again in both individual and population data. In intact preparations, the response to reward is suppressed if a CS predicts it. The fact that in our experiments the response to reward returned after muscimol inactivation of the SC is indicative that the CS was not detected.

Again this point has been addressed in the amended Discussion (subsection “Possible input pathways for reward prediction”).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] This is a valuable study of the pathways that control midbrain DA responses. Not only is the demonstration of intact DA signals despite V1 lesion already valuable on its own, but the authors also went the extra mile to test the causal contribution of the SC in this process. This study is also valuable due to its relevance to the short-latency response component of DA neurons, which many studies tend to gloss over. The possible implication for reward processing in the absence of phenomenal awareness is also intriguing – I wonder if it would be possible to do the behavioral experiment in blindsighted humans?</italic></p><p>If possible, we would like to do this.</p><p><italic>Overall, the motivation, experiments, and conclusions seem generally solid. I do have a few concerns about the interpretations that I suggest dialing back slightly, and a few suggestions about the analysis and presentation.</italic></p><p><italic>1) &quot;These results indicate that the retino-tecto-nigral projections can relay reward-predicting visual information to DA neurons and integrity of the SC is necessary for visually-elicited classically conditioned responses after V1 lesion.&quot; &quot;Specifically, our results show that visual input to DA neurons from the SC can signal value coded sensory events.&quot;</italic></p><p><italic>These and related statements in the paper seem a bit too strong.</italic></p><p>We have responded to this comment with significant alterations to the Discussion section – i.e. we now present two interpretations of how sensory input from the SC could evoke value-coded responses in DA neurons.</p><p><italic>The authors showed a clear necessity for the SC, but did not prove that its involvement was via direct retino-tecto-nigral projection to DA neurons. It could be an indirect effect. The authors argue against an indirect effect in the Discussion, but as they note, this is not conclusive proof.</italic></p><p>We take this point and have amended the text accordingly (Abstract; Introduction, fourth and last paragraphs; subsection “Recording from DA neurons”).</p><p><italic>Also, this paper proves that SC activity is necessary to construct a value signal in this task, but does not prove that SC activity itself signaled value or sent that signal to DA neurons. For instance, the SC's role in contributing to DA signals could be to code the stimulus location, which is the value-relevant feature in this task. A different area would then read out that location information and use it to figure out the stimulus value.</italic></p><p>This interpretation is now included in the discussion (subsection “Possible input pathways for reward prediction”) as one of the possibilities for explaining value coding of DA responses.</p><p><italic>At least some of the SC's contribution in this task seems likely to occur in this manner. The SC is well known to be important for visual attention.</italic></p><p>Indeed it is, and that the direction of attention is powerfully influenced by stimulus value – gaze shifts are made to the most valuable stimuli, which suggests that when this occurs value must be known before, not after the gaze shift.</p><p><italic>Suppose SC activity is required for the brain to properly process a visual stimulus. Inactivating the SC would interfere with licking behavior and value signals in DA neurons, but that could reflect a more general deficit, not value coding by the SC.</italic></p><p>This point is asking questions about exactly how the SC contributes to triggering conditioned responses and phasic DA responses. This is a very important issue and is part of our future programme of work in this area.</p><p><italic>Finally, let's suppose that the SC does directly transmit value coded signals to DA neurons. I feel that the way the authors explain this concept may mislead some readers. The authors describe it in terms of the retino-tecto-nigral pathway, and with an emphasis on Pavlovian training. This makes it sound like the value signals emerge via slow, long-term plasticity at synapses in this pathway (retina-SC or SC-DA):</italic></p><p><italic>&quot;There are many papers that demonstrate that an association with, or an expectation of reward can dramatically influence the magnitude of the initial sensory response in primary sensory areas throughout the brain (Mogami and Tanaka, 2006; Serences and Saproo, 2010; Metzger et al., 2006; Leathers and Olson, 2012), including the SC (Ikeda et al., 2003). […] The magnitude of such responses would then reflect the value of the predicted reward.&quot;</italic></p><p>This is exactly the process we envisage as an explanation of how extensive Pavlovian pre-tuning according to value can influence the magnitude of initial sensory processing in primary sensory structures all over the brain….there are many references, mainly from the attentional literature, indicating that some form of long-term plasticity in primary sensory structures occurs when an arbitrary stimulus is associated with reward or punishment.</p><p>Quote from our paper: &quot;There are many papers that demonstrate that an association with, or an expectation of reward can dramatically influence the magnitude of the initial sensory response in primary sensory areas throughout the brain (Mogami and Tanaka, 2006; Serences and Saproo, 2010; Metzger et al., 2006; Leathers and Olson, 2012), including the SC (Ikeda et al., 2003). […] After training it is likely that CSs presented at different locations within the visual field would elicit differential responses in tectonigral neurons. The magnitude of such responses would then reflect the value of the predicted reward.&quot;</p><p><italic>However, in my view value-related signals in the SC are more likely to emerge due to short-term changes in SC response gain caused by top-down modulatory inputs from other areas (e.g. spatial attention based on reward value). This seems more compatible with the Ikeda study cited here, since the rewarded location changed rapidly during that experiment, which the SC can adapt to in &lt; 3 trials (Isoda and Hikosaka, Journal of Neurophysiology 2008).</italic></p><p>This is certainly true for the Ikeda study….there it is very clear that top-down specification of whether the monkey is in a rewarded vs. non-rewarded trial influences the magnitude of the initial sensory response in the SC. However, we are proposing a different process whereby prior Pavlovian association with reward is quite sufficient to modify the initial sensory response in early sensory areas including the SC – to reiterate, there is abundant evidence in the attention literature indicating Pavlovian sensory pre-tuning happens.</p><p><italic>If so, then despite the authors' apparent emphasis on bottom-up retino-tecto-nigral transmission, the value signals are actually injected into this pathway by other (possibly cortical) brain areas that send a top-down modulatory signal to the SC to change its response gains at different parts of its visual map.</italic></p><p>Given the short latency of the value-coded latency in the DA neurons and the longer latencies of cortical sensory processing or potential value coding of sensory information from the SC, we think this suggestion is unlikely. Indeed, the new data we have included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref> shows that the earliest time points that value differentiation occurred was not different between responses to CSs in intact and in lesion-affected visual fields.</p><p><italic>P.S. I suggest not using the term &quot;sensory pre-conditioning&quot;, since it refers to a specific kind of training without reinforcement (Brogden, 1939), which isn't what the authors want to say here.</italic></p><p>We removed the sentences including the term.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows the responses to CS/outcome for LR, which look beautiful. But it is also important to show the responses to CS/outcome for SR, even though only the LR CS was presented in the inactivated part of the visual field. This is because the key point is whether discrimination between the two CSs is impaired, not just the response to any single CS. Indeed, this distinction was important in the analysis of behavior: while inactivation abolished one animal's licking to the LR CS, for the other animal it induced equal licking for both CSs. Also, if the authors do see a change in DA responses to the SR CS/outcome despite it being outside the inactivated field, that would be interesting!</italic></p><p>We have calculated the averaged response to SR-CS and firing rate in each DA neuron before and after the injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, presumably because of the contrast effect with the LR-CS, responses to SR-CS were small, and the magnitude of responses was not different before and after the muscimol injection.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Essential points:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors still emphasize subjective awareness but this is not very well documented or backed up by data. It is also noted that the lesions might have been made a long time ago (~10 years?).</italic></p><p>We added the time from surgery of the V1 lesion to the experiments in this study. They were conducted 46 months (monkey K), 44 months (monkey U), and 6 months (monkey T) before the experiments (start of subsection “V1 lesion”; subsection “Subjects”).</p><p><italic>Given these problems, we would like the authors to further address these points. Do the monkeys recover any (conscious) visual abilities (It wouldn't need to be high acuity vision to complete this task)? Was the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> about contrast sensitivity recorded recently, or is it adapted from the 2008 paper? In addition to discussing possible recovery, the authors need to be much clearer (throughout the entire paper) about the limitations of this study in the absence of psychophysical tests.</italic></p><p>We assessed their visual ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) at the starting point of the present experiments. We added this information to the revised manuscript (subsection “V1 lesion”). All the monkeys in this study were different from monkeys in Yoshida et al. in 2008, and we referred only the method part of the paper in 2008. We made this point clearer in the revised manuscript. In our previous paper (Yoshida and Isa, Sci Rep 2015), we assessed visual awareness of the V1 lesioned monkeys using signal detection theory, however, we did not test it on the monkeys in this study and it is not the main issue of this paper. Therefore, we removed the whole descriptions on the visual awareness from this paper (the last paragraph in Discussion).</p><p><italic>2) The same problem, regarding phenomenal awareness, is also important for the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref> (right, reward response). This data demonstrate that the SC is necessary for visual reward prediction, but it appears impossible to know whether the muscimol inactivation of SC caused loss of phenomenal awareness, or whether the muscimol inactivation was done in the absence of phenomenal awareness and thus constitutes a neural mechanism for unconscious reward processing. The authors suggest the latter (end of subsection “Possible input pathways for reward prediction”), but it does not seem to be an appropriate conclusion (or suggestion) because the authors did not measure conscious awareness.</italic></p><p>It is true that we did not assess the visual awareness after inactivation of the SC. As described above, we removed the description on the visual awareness from this paper.</p><p><italic>3) Although the authors acknowledge that their paradigm cannot discriminate between salience and value, the title of the paper still reads as value-coding. Because the cues probably had very similar physical properties, and hence similar physical salience, this problem can be dealt with by more careful wording throughout. It appears to be confusing if the authors just add a disclaimer paragraph to the Discussion, and ignoring the disclaimer everywhere else. We suggest that the authors remove &quot;value-coded&quot; and then use more careful wording and make the manuscript consistent throughout the manuscript.</italic></p><p>We changed the word ‘value-coded signal’ to ‘visually-evoked reward expectation signal’ in the title, and to similar words in other parts of the text. (But if the words are reference from the previous literature, and were not directly relevant to the present experimental results, we kept them.)</p><p>In addition, we made small changes to the text to make the manuscript concise and correct typos.</p></body></sub-article></article>
