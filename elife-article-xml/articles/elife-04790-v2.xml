Unfavorable TBI outcomes result from primary mechanical injuries to the brain and ensuing secondary non-mechanical injuries that are not limited to the brain. Our genome-wide association study of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> revealed that the probability of death following TBI is associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in tissue barrier function and glucose homeostasis. We found that TBI causes intestinal and blood–brain barrier dysfunction and that intestinal barrier dysfunction is highly correlated with the probability of death. Furthermore, we found that ingestion of glucose after a primary injury increases the probability of death through a secondary injury mechanism that exacerbates intestinal barrier dysfunction.

Primary injury to the brain triggers secondary injuries that further damage the brain and other organs, generating many of the detrimental consequences of TBI. However, despite decades of study, the exact nature of these secondary injuries and their origin are poorly understood. A better understanding of secondary injuries should help to develop novel therapies to improve TBI outcomes in affected individuals.</p><p>To obtain this information, in 2013 researchers devised a method to inflict TBI in the common fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, an organism that is readily amenable to detailed genetic and molecular studies. This investigation demonstrated that flies subjected to TBI display many of the same symptoms observed in humans after a brain injury, including temporary loss of mobility and damage to the brain that becomes worse over time. In addition, many of the flies die within 24 hr after brain injury.</p><p>Now Katzenberger et al. use this experimental system to investigate the secondary injuries responsible for these deaths. First, genetic variants were identified that confer increased or decreased susceptibility to death after brain injury. Several of the identified genes affect the structural integrity of the intestinal barrier that isolates the contents of the gut—including nutrients and bacteria—from the circulatory system. Katzenberger et al. subsequently found that the breakdown of this barrier after brain injury permits bacteria and glucose to leak out of the intestine. Treating flies with antibiotics did not increase survival, whereas reducing glucose levels in the circulatory system after brain injury did. Thus, Katzenberger et al<italic>.</italic> conclude that high levels of glucose in the circulatory system, a condition known as hyperglycemia, is a key culprit in death following TBI.</p><p>Notably, these results parallel findings in humans, where hyperglycemia is highly predictive of death following TBI. Similarly, individuals with diabetes have a significantly increased risk of death after TBI. These results suggest that the secondary injuries leading to death are the same in flies and humans and that further studies in flies are likely to provide additional new information that will help us understand the complex consequences of TBI. Important challenges remain, including understanding precisely how the brain and intestine communicate, how injury to the brain leads to disruption of the intestinal barrier, and why elevated glucose levels increase mortality after brain injury. Answers to these questions could help pave the way to new therapies for TBI.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04790.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04790.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>innate immune response</kwd><kwd>blood–brain barrier</kwd><kwd>glucose homeostasis</kwd><kwd>hexosamine biosynthesis pathway</kwd><kwd>grainyhead</kwd><kwd>septate junction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG033620</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ganetzky</surname><given-names>Barry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007015</institution-id><institution>University of Wisconsin-Madison</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Robert Draper Technology Innovation Funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wassarman</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Use of a newly developed experimental model in fruit flies reveals that death following traumatic brain injury is largely due to a mechanism by which brain damage triggers disruption of the intestinal barrier, leading to elevated levels of glucose in the circulatory system with deleterious consequences.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death for people under the age of 44 in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Harrison-Felix et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coronado et al., 2011</xref>). Death following TBI is not only due to primary injuries, that is, mechanical injuries that occur at the moment of impact to the brain, but also to secondary injuries, that is, non-mechanical injuries that evolve over time in response to primary injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Masel and DeWitt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blennow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Prins et al., 2013</xref>). Because secondary injuries are non-mechanical and are delayed relative to primary injuries they may be sensitive to therapeutic interventions. For example, secondary injuries to the intestine can rapidly follow primary injuries to the brain, and interventions that block intestinal injuries may prevent bacterial translocation and subsequent sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Feighery et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bansal et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2010</xref>). However, present understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie secondary injuries is not yet sufficient to develop therapeutic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Menon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We have used a <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> model to investigate the mechanisms underlying secondary injuries that cause death following traumatic injury. Our fly model uses the high-impact trauma (HIT) device, consisting of a metal spring with a stationary end attached to a board and a free end positioned over a polyurethane pad, to inflict traumatic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Katzenberger et al., 2013</xref>). A plastic vial containing unanesthetized flies is connected to the free end. When the spring is deflected and released, the vial rapidly strikes the pad, and a mechanical force is delivered to the flies as they impact the vial wall. A high-speed movie shows that a strike from the HIT device causes flies to hit the vial wall multiple times with their head and body, probably inflicting traumatic injury to multiple organs, including the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balsiger et al., 2014</xref>). Closed-head TBI may result from impacts to the head or body that cause the fly brain to ricochet and deform against the head capsule, similar to what happens to humans in falls and car crashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davceva et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, flies treated with the HIT device display phenotypes consistent with brain injury, including temporary incapacitation followed by ataxia, gradual recovery of mobility, neurodegeneration over time, and death within 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Katzenberger et al., 2013</xref>). However, as in polytraumatic injuries in humans (e.g., blast injuries), damage to organs other than the brain may contribute to morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Scott et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we provisionally use the term traumatic injury to refer to the primary injury. One goal of this study is to identify the injured body part or parts that cause death within 24 hr.</p><p>We quantify death following traumatic injury by determining the percentage of flies that die within 24 hr of the primary injury, which we define as the mortality index at 24 hr (MI<sub>24</sub>). Previously, we found that genotype and age at the time of traumatic injury affect the MI<sub>24</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Katzenberger et al., 2013</xref>). Younger flies have a lower MI<sub>24</sub> than older flies, suggesting that aging-related processes promote death following traumatic injury. In addition, genotype can affect the MI<sub>24</sub> many fold, indicating the existence of genes that suppress or enhance the secondary injury mechanisms that cause death following traumatic injury. We also found that the innate immune response is activated shortly after primary injuries. In flies, the Toll and Immune deficiency (Imd) innate immune response pathways are responsible for defense against pathogens such as bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>). Both pathways upregulate the transcription of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, which encode small, secreted peptides that contribute to the elimination of pathogens. The innate immune response pathways are also activated in response to various types of stress, including oxidative stress and tissue damage. Here, we further investigate the roles of aging, genotype, and the innate immune response in mortality following traumatic injury.</p><p>We performed a genome-wide association (GWA) study that implicates specific genes in affecting the probability of death following traumatic injury in young flies. Several of the genes have functions related to septate junctions, which are similar to tight junctions in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Furuse and Tsukita, 2006</xref>). Septate junctions and tight junctions serve as barriers in the intestine, brain, and other tissues that prevent pathogen invasion and restrict the paracellular transport of materials. These junctions are constructed of transmembrane proteins such as Claudins, which interact between neighboring cells, and intracellular proteins such as PDZ (<underline>P</underline>SD-95, <underline>D</underline>iscs-large, <underline>Z</underline>O-1) domain proteins, which interact with the cytoplasmic tail of transmembrane proteins. Mutation of the septate junction-associated, PDZ domain-containing protein Big Bang (BBG) permits bacteria from the intestinal lumen to cross the intestinal epithelial barrier and activate the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bonnay et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, aging-related death in flies is highly correlated with intestinal barrier dysfunction and activation of the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rera et al., 2012</xref>). In light of these links among tissue barrier dysfunction, the innate immune response, and aging-related death, we investigated the role of tissue barrier dysfunction in death following traumatic injury. Our findings indicate that traumatic injury to the brain is a major cause of death in our model and that mortality from brain injury is dependent on genetic and environmental effects on intestinal barrier permeability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The probability of death following traumatic injury is a quantitative trait</title><p>To investigate the role of genotype in determining the MI<sub>24</sub>, we analyzed the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), a collection of wild-type, fully sequenced, isogenic fly lines (called RAL lines) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mackay et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows the MI<sub>24</sub> data for 179 RAL lines that were treated with the standard injury protocol. 60 young flies (0–7 day old) were placed in a vial and subjected to four strikes from the HIT device with 5 min between strikes. Following a 10 min recovery period after the last strike, flies were transferred to a new vial containing molasses food and were incubated at 25°C. The number of dead flies was counted after 24 hr. To control for death not due to injuries during this time, a vial of flies not subjected to injury was equivalently processed. Every experiment consisted of at least three independent trials, and the MI<sub>24</sub> represents the average percent death for flies with injuries minus the average percent death for flies without injuries. We found that the MI<sub>24</sub> had a continuous distribution among the RAL lines, over a wide range from 6.7 ± 0.8 to 57.5 ± 1.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We found that progeny from crosses between RAL892 and RAL lines with a low MI<sub>24</sub> (RAL352, RAL907, and RAL774) had an intermediate MI<sub>24</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, progeny from crosses between RAL892 and RAL lines with a high MI<sub>24</sub> (RAL707, RAL73, RAL799, and RAL161) maintained a high MI<sub>24</sub>. Variation in the MI<sub>24</sub> could be due to many genes or environmental factors. However, the fly lines were cultured under the same conditions (temperature, humidity, diet, light/dark cycle, and density), which limited the contribution of environmental factors. Thus, the continuous distribution over a wide range of the MI<sub>24</sub> among wild-type fly lines and the intermediate MI<sub>24</sub> of progeny from crosses between fly lines with significantly different MI<sub>24</sub>s suggest that the probability of death following traumatic injury is a quantitative trait affected by many genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Falconer and Mackay, 1996</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>GWA analysis identifies genes associated with the probability of death following traumatic injury</title><p>To identify genes that affect the MI<sub>24</sub>, we carried out GWA analysis using the MI<sub>24</sub> data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and ∼2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the RAL lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mackay et al., 2012</xref>). This analysis revealed that 216 unique SNPs located in or near 98 genes were associated with the MI<sub>24</sub> at a discovery significance threshold of p &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). However, despite the small p-values, some of the associations may be false positives because the minor allele frequency cut-off of the DGRP Freeze 1 algorithm was 4 lines, allowing the p-value to be driven by a few extreme lines. Reanalysis using the DGRP Freeze 2 algorithm that has a minor allele frequency cut-off of 10 lines revealed significant associations of SNPs in only 10 of the 98 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). The discrepancy between the Freeze 1 and 2 analyses is illustrated by SNPs in <italic>grainyhead</italic> (<italic>grh</italic>), which were significantly associated with the MI<sub>24</sub> in the Freeze 1 analysis but were not identified in the Freeze 2 analysis because they occurred in fewer than 10 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). At the time that we obtained the MI<sub>24</sub> data for the RAL lines, the Freeze 2 algorithm had not been developed, so we moved forward based on the Freeze 1 data, initially focusing on <italic>grh</italic> because it contained the SNP that was most significantly associated with the MI<sub>24</sub> (p = 1.15 × 10<sup>−10</sup>) as well as three other significant SNPs. The four SNPs in <italic>grh</italic> were located in a 523 bp region of intron 10 suggesting that they have similar effects on the regulation of <italic>grh</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">St Pierre et al., 2014</xref>).

These observations are consistent with the idea that at least a fraction of the flies subjected to the HIT device suffer a brain injury that temporarily disturbs normal neuronal function resulting in temporary paralysis. These observations also raise the question of whether this presumptive brain injury contributes to the observed mortality of treated flies. To address this question, we determined the correlation between temporary incapacitation and the MI<sub>24</sub> following traumatic injury. Individual flies were subjected to a single strike from the HIT device and were scored as incapacitated if they were motionless immediately after injury. As previously observed, incapacitated flies did not die immediately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Katzenberger et al., 2013</xref>). Of the 600 flies examined, 64 (10.7%) were incapacitated, and all, except one, recovered mobility within 5 min.

Initial or primary damage from impact forces results in brain dysfunction manifested by a variety of symptoms, including loss of consciousness, seizure, and other behavioral and cognitive impairments. Subsequently, additional non-mechanical secondary injuries can arise over time in response to the primary injuries resulting in further pathological consequences, which in the most severe cases includes death. The biological pathways linking primary and secondary injuries and the proximate cause of death following TBI are poorly understood at present. We have recently developed a traumatic injury model in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that replicates many of the key features of TBI in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Katzenberger et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we investigate the link between primary and secondary injuries in this model and determine which pathophysiological manifestations correlated with death 24 hr after injury. Our results suggest that subjecting flies to collision impact by the HIT device results in primary TBI that triggers secondary injuries, including damage to the intestinal barrier. The resulting increased intestinal permeability is highly correlated with mortality within 24 hr after injury and is very likely to be one of the main causative factors of death.</p><p>Because TBI in humans is diagnosed based on symptoms rather than by any precise medical test, and because flies subjected to mechanical impact injury by our HIT device do not exclusively contact the vial wall with their head, it is difficult to prove rigorously that we have caused a TBI-like injury in flies. Nonetheless, our results are consistent with the supposition that at least some fraction of the flies subjected to the HIT device have suffered an injury analogous with TBI in humans. They exhibit diagnostic features associated with human TBI, notably temporary loss of motor activity with flies lying incapacitated on their back or side, with no evidence of external mechanical damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Motor activity recovers gradually over a 5-min period, although ataxia persists for a longer period. In addition to these immediate impairments, over a more extended period, the injured flies also manifest a shortened lifespan, behavioral deficits, and onset of neurodegeneration in the central brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Katzenberger et al., 2013</xref>). These phenotypes are all indicative of brain dysfunction, which is the defining characteristic of TBI. Indeed, screens in <italic>Drosophila</italic> for reversible, conditional loss of motor activity, resulted in the isolation of mutants with defects in neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, which were further enriched for neurodegenerative phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Siddiqi and Benzer, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Littleton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Palladino et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fergestad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gnerer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babcock et al., 2015</xref>). Activation of the innate immune response in the brain following treatment by the HIT device is a further indication of injury to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Katzenberger et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, because flies become paralyzed immediately after mechanical injury, this must be a primary injury response. The high-speed movie shows that flies subjected to the HIT device could sustain primary injuries to the brain through multiple mechanisms: acceleration-deceleration forces on the brain due to contact of the head with the vial, coup contrecoup forces on the brain due to rebounding of the spring, or sheer forces on the brain due to unrestricted head movements that accompany contact of the body with the vial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balsiger et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, although we cannot rule out other more complicated interpretations, as a working hypothesis, we believe our data indicate that some percentage of flies subjected to mechanical impact by the HIT device suffer a brain injury that shares significant features with TBI in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Death following TBI in flies is associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction</title><p>In this study, we focused on investigating the underlying causes of mortality within 24 hr after subjecting flies to TBI. Since flies that die within this period do not do so immediately after the primary injury, there must be some secondary effect that amplifies the initial injury to cause death. Unexpectedly, our results point to intestinal barrier dysfunction as a physiological consequence following TBI that is a major factor in subsequent mortality. Four lines of evidence support this conclusion. (1) GWA analysis for variation in the MI<sub>24</sub> uncovered genes linked to the function of septate junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), including <italic>grh</italic>, which encodes a transcription factor required for epithelial barrier formation, and <italic>bbg</italic> and <italic>scrib</italic>, which encode PDZ domain-containing, septate junction-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bilder and Perrimon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Narasimha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bonnay et al., 2013</xref>). (2) There was a very high correlation between the MI<sub>24</sub> and the onset of Smurfing, a reporter of increased intestinal permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). (3) There was a strong correlation between the MI<sub>24</sub> and intestinal leakage of glucose that was ingested after a primary injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figures 4B,C, 7</xref>). (4) There was a significant correlation between activation of the innate immune response by leakage of bacteria from the intestine and the MI<sub>24</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1 fig6s2 fig6s3 fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplements 1–4</xref>).</p><p>Our results also provide evidence that intestinal barrier dysfunction is secondary to brain injury inflicted by the HIT device. In particular, leakage of glucose from the intestine, which is delayed relative to the time of injury by the HIT device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and the increased probability of intestinal permeability by ingestion of food after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) both indicate that intestinal permeability is a secondary response to the initial mechanical injury. Moreover, we found that direct injury to the brain via a crushing injury, is sufficient to trigger intestinal barrier dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This conclusion is supported by the observation that flies immediately incapacitated following injury by the HIT device, which are the ones most likely to have suffered a brain injury, had a significantly higher probability of death, which is associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction, than non-incapacitated flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Physiological events associated with death following traumatic injury in flies are shared with TBI in mammals. Gastrointestinal dysfunction, including increased intestinal permeability, is frequently observed in TBI patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Krakau et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, increased intestinal permeability occurs in rodent TBI models in which injury is inflicted exclusively to the brain, demonstrating that increased intestinal permeability can result from direct mechanical injury to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Feighery et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bansal et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2010</xref>). While increased intestinal permeability is linked to death in critically ill patients and correlates with the severity of injury in trauma patients, it has not yet been linked to death in TBI patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Doig et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Faries et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reintam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tude Melo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Piton et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, patients with severe TBI have significantly higher blood glucose levels than patients with moderate or mild TBI, and hyperglycemia is highly predictive of death following TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rovlias and Kotsou, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Salim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tude Melo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Harun Harun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Prisco et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexiou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Elkon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>).

However, thus far, modulating blood glucose levels by intensive insulin treatment in humans has had no effect on the probability of death within 6 months of a primary injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bilotta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, additional research is still need to understand the mechanistic relationship between blood glucose levels and the probability of death following TBI. Because key features appear to be conserved between flies and mammals, further studies using the fly TBI model should help provide important new information.</p><p>Taken together, these data support the conclusion that primary TBI triggers secondary intestinal barrier dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

(2012)</xref> found that, regardless of chronological age, a few days prior to death, <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> flies show increased intestinal permeability and increased activation of the innate immune response. They also found that <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> flies had reduced insulin signaling, which we observed with <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> flies cultured on molasses food, but, paradoxically, not with other fly lines or under other conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In addition, we previously found that the probability of death following TBI increases with age in flies, and others have found that the probability of death within one or 6 months of a primary injury increases with age in TBI patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Susman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hukkelhoven et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dhandapani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Katzenberger et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that as flies and humans age, events such as breakdown of the intestinal epithelial barrier progressively become more severe until they are sufficient to cause death. Thus, as has been suggested for neuropathologies in human TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Smith et al., 2013</xref>), TBI may cause death in young flies by triggering secondary injury mechanisms that parallel the defects that otherwise occur as part of the normal aging process. Older flies would then be more susceptible to death following TBI than younger flies because some critical physiological mechanism such as breakdown of the intestinal epithelial barrier would already be compromised to the point where it would require less of a subsequent insult to push the impairment beyond the threshold for lethality.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The fly TBI model has provided new insights into the mechanisms underlying death following TBI</title><p>Our results demonstrate that the probability of death following TBI is a quantitative trait likely to be affected by many genes. This discovery was possible because we were able to examine many genetically diverse wild-type fly lines under conditions where factors known to affect the probability of death following TBI, that is, the force, number, and timing of primary injuries, age at the time of the primary injury, and environmental conditions, were kept constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, through GWA analysis, we were able to identify 216 SNPs in 98 genes that are significantly associated with the probability of death following TBI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Presumably, these SNPs create a physiological state that alters the severity of primary and/or secondary injuries. For example, SNPs in genes that affect the function of septate junctions (<italic>grh</italic>, <italic>bbg</italic>, and <italic>scrib</italic>) or glucose homeostasis (<italic>sxc</italic>, <italic>pgant2</italic>, <italic>miR-14</italic>, and <italic>CG7882</italic>) may generate intestinal epithelial barriers that are sensitive to disruption by cellular and molecular mechanisms triggered by TBI. Genotype is likely to play an equally important role in humans since variation in several genes has already been shown to be associated with the probability of death of severe TBI patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dardiotis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Garringer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Failla et al., 2015</xref>). These data suggest that SNPs in orthologs of genes such as <italic>grh</italic> will correlate with the probability of death of TBI patients and could be used for genetic susceptibility testing to identify individuals at high risk of death following TBI.</p><p>Nevertheless, it remains to be determined whether any of the 98 genes identified by our GWA study directly affect the probability of death following TBI. We attempted to determine this for <italic>grh</italic> by examining the MI<sub>24</sub> of existing <italic>grh</italic> mutant fly lines. We found that the MI<sub>24</sub> ranged from 18.9 ± 2.8 to 31.6 ± 0.9 for 0–7 day old flies that were heterozygous for different <italic>grh</italic> mutant alleles, two lethal P-element alleles and three lethal EMS alleles. However, determining whether and how these <italic>grh</italic> mutations affect the MI<sub>24</sub> requires comparison with isogenic flies that are wild-type for <italic>grh</italic>, which unfortunately do not exist. Moreover, we do not yet know how the identified SNPs affect <italic>grh</italic> expression or function. For example, if the SNPs increase <italic>grh</italic> expression or alter only a subset of <italic>grh</italic> functions then <italic>grh</italic> loss-of-function mutations would not be expected to have the same effect on the MI<sub>24</sub>. Use of the CRISPR technology in future experiments will help resolve these issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gratz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our studies have also led to the identification of additional physiological events evoked by TBI, including BBB dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), leakage of bacteria from the intestinal lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4A, 5</xref>), and activation of the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1 fig6s2 fig6s3 fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplements 1–4</xref>). Although occurrence of these events is not correlated with the probability of death following TBI, we hypothesize that they are not benign. One likely possibility is that they are associated with unfavorable long-term TBI outcomes in flies and humans that survive for an extended period after injury. For example, since activation of the innate immune response in the brain causes neurodegeneration in flies and is a common feature of human neurodegenerative diseases, it may be an important factor for neurodegeneration in the fly TBI model and for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a form of neurodegeneration, in TBI patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arroyo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chinchore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Petersen et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baugh et al., 2014</xref>). In support of this idea, the β-lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone has neuroprotective effects in a rat TBI model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wei et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Goodrich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cui et al., 2014</xref>). It will be interesting to determine if reducing the level of activation of the innate immune response by feeding flies antibiotics reduces the severity of neurodegeneration following TBI.</p><p>Finally, we found that the amount of sugar ingested immediately after a primary injury greatly affects the probability of death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). There is considerable evidence that diet after a primary injury influences the outcomes of TBI patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Greco and Prins, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Scrimgeour and Condlin, 2014</xref>). For example, zinc supplementation reduces the probability of death of severe TBI patients, and the amount of nutrition in the first 5 days after a primary injury affects the probability of death of severe TBI patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Young et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Härtl et al., 2008</xref>). Our results in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, suggest that limiting sugar intake immediately after TBI in humans may be worth investigating as a therapeutic option to reduce the probability of death. Moreover, evolutionary conservation of the intestinal response to TBI between flies and humans suggests that elucidation of the underlying genotype- and age-dependent mechanisms in flies will have clinical relevance.</p><p>In summary, these studies have shown that key phenotypic manifestations of TBI and the underlying physiological mechanisms are shared between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans. By exploiting the many experimental advantages offered by a <italic>Drosophila</italic> TBI model, it should be possible to obtain novel information to gain further insight into the biology of TBI and ultimately derive new therapeutic strategies to limit its deleterious outcomes in humans.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly lines and culturing</title><p>Flies were maintained on molasses food at 25°C unless otherwise stated.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 4 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers praised the creative use of <italic>Drosophila</italic> in studying an important problem and they found the manuscript to be interesting and agreed that it has made valuable research progress. They would be keen to see this manuscript published if a central concern is addressed. Furthermore, there were several technical concerns raised that we have listed below that we hope you can address.</p><p>Critical issues:</p><p>1) The issue that troubled each reviewer was that they are not at all convinced that the techniques employed for causing the injury results in localized trauma to the brain. Therefore the whole premise that it is brain injury that is causal in this process is not convincing when the entire animal is subjected to trauma; BBB, injury to other body parts, all could be affected. Also, the order of events, well established in the case of mammalian TBI studies is not clear here. The reviewers will like to see some validation that the brain injury is the primary cause. An alternate method that generates the trait is essential to support the final claim. And, if such an alternative method is unable to elicit the stated responses, then perhaps the authors can revise their model.</p><p>2) The observed effects in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, if confirmed are interesting enough for the reviewers and likely for the readers of <italic>eLife</italic> as well. Although a fly model of TBI will be nice, it is premature to emphasize this aspect to the extent that has been done in the manuscript.</p><p>3) The association with <italic>grh</italic> is interesting and the reviewers think that the paper will be even more interesting if this correlation holds up. We do agree that it is technically challenging to compare mutants with isogenic lines. One approach that could prove effective would be to use an inducible driver system (e.g. Gene-Switch) in combination with adult-specific RNAi of <italic>grh</italic>.</p><p>This will make the paper better, but the reviewers agreed that detailed mechanistic studies are outside the scope of this manuscript and would not like to hold up this publication if this is difficult to achieve in a short time-frame.</p><p>Technical issues:</p><p>1) Hemolymph extraction method. Decapitation and centrifugation as a method of hemolymph extraction is likely to introduce contaminants from the fly's internal tissues into the “hemolymph” samples. Of particular concern is contamination by bacteria and nutrients from the gut. This greatly impacts the author’s claim that increases in both bacterial counts and glucose levels are specific to the hemolymph. Two suggestions: the authors could use the protocol detailed here, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jove.com/video/2722/insulin-injection-hemolymph-extraction-to-measure-insulin-sensitivity">http://www.jove.com/video/2722/insulin-injection-hemolymph-extraction-to-measure-insulin-sensitivity</ext-link>, or make careful use of a capillary needle, to extract hemolymph without disrupting the gut. Glucose homeostasis can change very rapidly, and glucose release from other damaged tissues, or a reduction in glucose uptake as a result of whole-fly trauma, cannot be ruled out. This latter part can be addressed by careful rewriting, but an alternative to the centrifugation method is essential at least as a control.</p><p>2) Contamination from the fly's surface bacteria. The authors state that traumatic injury results in a less mobile animal, at least for a time following injury and may well spend longer than usual in contact with bacteria. The flies should be surface sterilized with ethanol wash prior to measuring bacterial load differences. Also, treatment with antibiotic and colony growth does not ensure that bacteria that do not grow well on regular plates are not present. The authors should avail themselves of proper published axenic assays.</p><p>3) It is possible that instead of the sugar being toxic, the 'water diet' is protective. This could be discussed as an alternative.</p><p>4) An issue with fly GWAS analysis is that 2.5 million SNPs are tested, yet sites with P-values below 10^-5 are considered as significant associations. Bonferroni correction for multiple tests would be on the order of 10^-8. An FDR would make more sense, but it would almost certainly be lower than 10^-7. Thus, many of the “associations” described likely do not survive a reasonable correction for multiple tests. Furthermore, since the panel is small, and there is no attempt to replicate the association at the <italic>grh</italic> gene (using either other quantitative genetics or some functional assay), it is not unlikely the association is simply wrong. The authors should add this word of caution to their analysis.</p><p>5) The authors may wish to modify several speculative comments in the manuscript, for example, in the Abstract: “Our results indicate that natural variation in the probability of death following TBI is largely due to genetic differences that affect intestinal barrier dysfunction.” While a genetic component to TBI-related death is very likely, the heritability is not calculated it is not possible to estimate the fraction of the phenotypic variation due to genetic factors. In addition, no evidence is provided that the best GWAS candidate (<italic>grh</italic>) directly impacts the intestinal barrier.</p><p>6) It is surprising that there is very little analysis of brain structure. Comparing brain structural integrity in injured flies, and especially after ingestion of water or glucose post injury, will test whether reduced glucose intake after TBI may help preserve brain integrity.</p><p>7) In the data on the effect of sugars show that the effective concentrations of the individual components in molasses are higher than they are in molasses. This begs the question how the effects in molasses can be explained (synergistic effects or other alternatives)?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Death following traumatic brain injury in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor), a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors, and also by the original external reviewers of the manuscript. As you know, the most important concern expressed by all reviewers was whether the injuries can be caused in a brain specific way in order to test the central thesis of the manuscript. With the additional “forceps squeezing” method included, the revised version is potentially much improved. Unfortunately, the data on this central point are not definitive.</p><p>The picture of a single fly that has had its head squeezed while being fed blue dye is shown. This fly is now a “Smurf”. However, we are left guessing with regards to many basic questions about this phenomenon/experiment: How many flies were tested? What fraction of flies ‘Smurfed’ after the head squeezing? All of them? How many flies died? These are very basic questions and, hopefully, this information is at hand without the need for further work. But such statistics are essential and should support the central thesis in a way comparable to that obtained from the HIT experiments for this paper to be accepted.</p><p>Please address the following two issues by Reviewer 2, by rewriting the corresponding sections acknowledging the potential drawbacks a bit more descriptively and clearly in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p>1) One of my other concerns from the previous review was about how the GWAS was carried out. The response to reviews has me even more concerned. The authors previously used the DGRP1 analysis pipeline from the Mackay lab, finding 98 genes with associations, including SNPs at <italic>grh</italic>: one of the candidate genes that led them down the path of considering intestinal barrier problems as a cause of death in their TBI model, and a gene discussed at length in the manuscript. In the response, but critically not in the manuscript, they acknowledge that a re-analysis of the GWAS with the DGRP2 analysis pipeline (which accounts for relatedness, along with a couple of other changes that should make associations more robust) finds only 10 of the previous 98 genes with associations. The set of 10 does not include <italic>grh</italic>. There simply must be a detailed discussion in the paper of the differences between the results with the two pipelines. Since the previous list of 98 genes included several (<italic>grh</italic>, <italic>bbg</italic>, and <italic>scrib, and sxc</italic>, <italic>pgant2</italic>, <italic>miR-14</italic>, and <italic>CG7882</italic>) with a priori interesting functional roles, it is also critical to specifically state whether these genes were replicated in the new pipeline. I appreciate that the GWAS was basically used as a guide to the kinds of pathways that are involved in the trait, but if few of the genes are replicated between pipelines that is a problem for the paper and for the argument.</p><p>2) I still don't understand what the problem is with doing a <italic>grh</italic> RNAi. You can purchase the background stock that the TRiP RNAi constructs where injected into, so controlling genetic background is facile.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04790.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The issue that troubled each reviewer was that they are not at all convinced that the techniques employed for causing the injury results in localized trauma to the brain.

An alternate method that generates the trait is essential to support the final claim. And, if such an alternative method is unable to elicit the stated responses, then perhaps the authors can revise their model</italic>.</p><p>We fully appreciate this concern and have made considerable revisions to the manuscript to address it. We believe that our new data support the conclusion that flies subjected to mechanical impact by the HIT device suffer a primary brain injury that triggers secondary intestinal barrier dysfunction, which is major factor in subsequent mortality. In addition, our new data provide additional evidence that the physiological consequences of HIT device treatment of flies are similar to those of TBI in humans. First, we have included new data indicating that injury exclusively to the fly brain is sufficient to increase intestinal permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Specifically, we found that compression of the head using forceps causes Smurfing (a reporter of intestinal permeability) within 24 hours. Communication between the injured brain and the intestine is conserved in mammals. Several groups have shown using rodent TBI models that direct injury to the brain causes increased intestinal permeability. Thus, these data indicate that TBI induced by the HIT device could cause secondary injures to the intestine that increase barrier permeability and that this finding is relevant to mammals. Second, our new data on incapacitated flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>) indicate that flies subjected to the HIT device receive TBI and die from these injuries. Incapacitation in flies is similar to the symptoms of a concussion in humans. It is also similar to temporary paralysis observed in bang-sensitive <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants following mild mechanical shock that disrupts normal electrical activity in the brain. These observations are consistent with the idea that at least a fraction of the flies subjected to the HIT device suffer a brain injury that temporarily disturbs normal neuronal function resulting in temporary paralysis. Furthermore, we found that incapacitated flies had a significantly higher probability of death following the primary injury than non-incapacitated flies, indicating that the injuries to the brain that cause incapacitation also contribute significantly to mortality within 24 hours. Third, we have included new data that indicate that intestinal dysfunction is a secondary injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B and C</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows that the HIT device-induced increase in glucose level in the hemolymph does not occur until 1-2 hours after the primary injury from the HIT device, suggesting that increased intestinal permeability is not a direct consequence of mechanical damage from the HIT device but rather a secondary consequence of molecular and cellular events evoked by the mechanical damage. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, which analyzes hemolymph glucose levels in flies fed water rather than molasses food after the primary injury, shows that the increase in glucose levels is due to food ingested <italic>after</italic> the primary injury, further supporting the conclusion that intestinal dysfunction is a secondary injury. These data, taken together with data in the original manuscript, support the conclusion that primary TBI triggers secondary intestinal barrier dysfunction. Consequent leakage of sugars across the impaired intestinal barrier causes further impairment of this barrier and ultimately death through an unknown proximal event.</p><p>Because TBI in humans is diagnosed based on symptoms rather than by any precise medical test, and because flies subjected to mechanical impact injury by our HIT device do not exclusively contact the vial wall with their head, it is difficult to prove rigorously that we have caused a TBI-like injury in flies. Nonetheless, our results are consistent with the supposition that at least some fraction of the flies subjected to the HIT device have suffered an injury analogous with TBI in humans. In addition, the fact that primary injuries inflicted by the HIT device are not limited to the brain can be viewed as an advantage of the system because polytrauma (traumatic injury to multiple body parts) often accompanies TBI and is thought to modulate TBI phenotypes. In the revised Discussion section, we have added two sections at the beginning that lay out all of the evidence that brain injury is causal for mortality following treatment with the HIT device. We have also made revisions to the Results section that address how individual pieces of data impact the claim that the primary injuries to the brain cause death in the fly model.</p><p><italic>2) The observed effects in</italic> Drosophila<italic>, if confirmed are interesting enough for the reviewers and likely for the readers of</italic> eLife <italic>as well. Although a fly model of TBI will be nice, it is premature to emphasize this aspect to the extent that has been done in the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>This is an excellent point that we have addressed by making it clear that injury from the HIT device may affect fly body parts other than the brain. Beginning in the Introduction section, we make it clear that flies treated with the HIT device are likely to receive injury to multiple body parts and, thus, a goal of the study was to identify the injured body part or parts that cause death within 24 hours. Consequently, throughout the Results section we now refer to the primary injury from the HIT device as “traumatic injury” rather than TBI. However, in the Discussion we provide a careful justification for why brain injury (TBI) is emphasized in the Abstract and Title. This justification is partially based on the new data described in response to the first critical issue but also to data in the original submission as well as data in our previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Katzenberger et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The association with</italic> grh <italic>is interesting and the reviewers think that the paper will be even more interesting if this correlation holds up. We do agree that it is technically challenging to compare mutants with isogenic lines. One approach that could prove effective would be to use an inducible driver system (e.g. Gene-Switch) in combination with adult-specific RNAi of</italic> grh.</p><p><italic>This will make the paper better, but the reviewers agreed that detailed mechanistic studies are outside the scope of this manuscript and would not like to hold up this publication if this is difficult to achieve in a short time-frame</italic>.</p><p>We completely agree with the editors and reviewers on this point and we are indeed engaged in pursuing these studies. Unfortunately, they are difficult experiments that require a considerable amount of time to create the proper constructs and generate the necessary strains, which will take much longer to complete. We very much appreciate that the editors and reviewers recognize this and have made allowances for it.</p><p>Technical issues:</p><p><italic>1) Hemolymph extraction method. Decapitation and centrifugation as a method of hemolymph extraction is likely to introduce contaminants from the fly's internal tissues into the</italic> “<italic>hemolymph</italic>” <italic>samples. Of particular concern is contamination by bacteria and nutrients from the gut. This greatly impacts the author’s claim that increases in both bacterial counts and glucose levels are specific to the hemolymph. Two suggestions: the authors could use the protocol detailed here,</italic> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jove.com/video/2722/insulin-injection-hemolymph-extraction-to-measure-insulin-sensitivity">http://www.jove.com/video/2722/insulin-injection-hemolymph-extraction-to-measure-insulin-sensitivity</ext-link><italic>, or make careful use of a capillary needle, to extract hemolymph without disrupting the gut. Glucose homeostasis can change very rapidly, and glucose release from other damaged tissues, or a reduction in glucose uptake as a result of whole-fly trauma, cannot be ruled out. This latter part can be addressed by careful rewriting, but an alternative to the centrifugation method is essential at least as a control</italic>.</p><p>Although we understand these concerns, we feel that the controls we have performed provide strong evidence for the adequacy of our method. In both the bacteria and glucose experiments, we have controls that address contamination from the gut. There were no bacteria in the hemolymph of untreated flies, indicating that the gut did not contaminate the hemolymph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The concentration of glucose in the hemolymph of untreated flies was very similar to the concentration determined using other methods for hemolymph extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tennesen et al., 2014</xref>). Lastly, if contamination did occur, it would have occurred equally under control and experimental conditions, and our conclusions are based on differences between control and experimental conditions.</p><p><italic>2) Contamination from the fly's surface bacteria. The authors state that traumatic injury results in a less mobile animal, at least for a time following injury and may well spend longer than usual in contact with bacteria. The flies should be surface sterilized with ethanol wash prior to measuring bacterial load differences. Also, treatment with antibiotic and colony growth does not ensure that bacteria that do not grow well on regular plates are not present. The authors should avail themselves of proper published axenic assays</italic>.</p><p>Again, although we understand this concern, we feel it is unlikely to be an issue here because bacterial load, as assayed either by plating or by PCR of 16S rDNA, was below detection, so bacteria on the surface of flies is not an issue. Furthermore, we have used a primer set for PCR detection of 16S rDNA that is described “Universal PCR primers for bacteria”, and detects most bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Weisburg et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) It is possible that instead of the sugar being toxic, the 'water diet' is protective. This could be discussed as an alternative</italic>.</p><p>At present we cannot distinguish between these possibilities so we have added the following sentence to the Results: “However, the present data do not rule out the possibility that water provides protection against death following traumatic injury.”</p><p><italic>4) An issue with fly GWAS analysis is that 2.5 million SNPs are tested, yet sites with P-values below 10^-5 are considered as significant associations. Bonferroni correction for multiple tests would be on the order of 10^-8. An FDR would make more sense, but it would almost certainly be lower than 10^-7. Thus, many of the</italic> “<italic>associations</italic>” <italic>described likely do not survive a reasonable correction for multiple tests. Furthermore, since the panel is small, and there is no attempt to replicate the association at the</italic> grh <italic>gene (using either other quantitative genetics or some functional assay), it is not unlikely the association is simply wrong. The authors should add this word of caution to their analysis</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for providing this cautionary note. We have tried to acknowledge it by adding the following sentence to the Results section: “However, despite the small <italic>P</italic>-values, some of the associations may be false positives because the minor allele frequency cut-off of the DGRP Freeze 1 algorithm was 4 lines, allowing the <italic>P</italic>-value to be driven by a few extreme lines”.</p><p><italic>5) The authors may wish to modify several speculative comments in the manuscript, for example, in the Abstract:</italic> “<italic>Our results indicate that natural variation in the probability of death following TBI is largely due to genetic differences that affect intestinal barrier dysfunction.</italic>” <italic>While a genetic component to TBI-related death is very likely, the heritability is not calculated it is not possible to estimate the fraction of the phenotypic variation due to genetic factors. In addition, no evidence is provided that the best GWAS candidate (</italic>grh<italic>) directly impacts the intestinal barrier</italic>.</p><p>We have modified the Abstract to say: “Our results indicate that natural variation in the probability of death following TBI is due in part to genetic differences that affect intestinal barrier dysfunction”.</p><p><italic>6) It is surprising that there is very little analysis of brain structure. Comparing brain structural integrity in injured flies, and especially after ingestion of water or glucose post injury, will test whether reduced glucose intake after TBI may help preserve brain integrity</italic>.</p><p>In our earlier publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Katzenberger et al., 2013</xref>), we performed brain histology and found that prior to the onset of neurodegeneration at a later age, we do not see any overt damage to the brain injured flies. Furthermore, we do not expect to see major structural defects vs. functional defects from disturbances in brain activity. We think that electrophysiological assays are likely to be more informative but are beyond the scope of the present investigation.</p><p><italic>7) In the data on the effect of sugars show that the effective concentrations of the individual components in molasses are higher than they are in molasses. This begs the question how the effects in molasses can be explained (synergistic effects or other alternatives)</italic>?</p><p>The unknown variable in this assay is the amount of food that the flies ingest. It is possible that the effective concentration of individual sugars is higher than in molasses because flies ingest a smaller volume of the individual sugars. Regardless, the point made by the reviewer is valid, so we have added the following sentence to the Results section: “The effective concentrations of the individual sugars are higher than they are in molasses suggesting that sugars in combination have a synergistic effect on the MI<sub>24</sub> or that another component of molasses food is important.”</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below</italic>.<italic>]</italic></p><p><italic>As you know, the most important concern expressed by all reviewers was whether the injuries can be caused in a brain specific way in order to test the central thesis of the manuscript.

These data support the conclusion that brain injury can cause Smurfing and death. These results are reported in the subsection “Traumatic injury causes intestinal barrier dysfunction” of the manuscript as follows: “We found that brain injury caused by compressing the head of 0-7 day old <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> flies from eye-to-eye using forceps was sufficient to cause Smurfing within 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

The set of 10 does not include</italic> grh<italic>. There simply must be a detailed discussion in the paper of the differences between the results with the two pipelines. Since the previous list of 98 genes included several (</italic>grh<italic>,</italic> bbg<italic>, and</italic> scrib<italic>, and</italic> sxc<italic>,</italic> pgant2<italic>,</italic> miR-14<italic>, and</italic> CG7882<italic>) with a priori interesting functional roles, it is also critical to specifically state whether these genes were replicated in the new pipeline. I appreciate that the GWAS was basically used as a guide to the kinds of pathways that are involved in the trait, but if few of the genes are replicated between pipelines that is a problem for the paper and for the argument.</italic></p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, in the paper, we have expanded upon the discussion of the difference between the results obtained with the DGRP Freeze 1 and 2 algorithms. The Discussion in the manuscript now reads: “This analysis revealed that 216 unique SNPs located in or near 98 genes were associated with the MI<sub>24</sub> at a discovery significance threshold of <italic>P</italic>&lt;10<sup>-5</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). […] the SNP that was most significantly associated with the MI<sub>24</sub> (<italic>P</italic>=1.15X10<sup>-10</sup>) as well as three other significant SNPs.”</p><p><italic>2) I still don't understand what the problem is with doing a</italic> grh <italic>RNAi. You can purchase the background stock that the TRiP RNAi constructs where injected into, so controlling genetic background is facile.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it important to address the causal relationship between the identified genes and the MI<sub>24</sub> and that RNAi is a good approach to achieve this goal. However, we feel that these studies are not necessary to support the conclusions in the paper. Additionally, the proposed experiment is more involved than portrayed because the genetic background of driver lines is also an issue, multiple <italic>grh</italic> RNAi lines as well as negative and positive control lines will need to be tested, it is unclear which driver line to use because we do not know where or when <italic>grh</italic> function might be required to affect intestinal permeability, and we do not know whether the <italic>grh</italic> variants in the RAL lines are loss-of-function or gain-of-function. Thus, we think that it would be best to include genetic analyses of <italic>grh</italic> and other genes identified by GWAS in a future manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
