circuits, but the molecular components that link these pathways are poorly understood. Here we show that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Degenerin/Epithelial Sodium Channel (DEG/ENaC) protein, UNC-8, is transcriptionally controlled to function as a trigger in an activity-dependent mechanism that removes synapses in remodeling GABAergic neurons. UNC-8 cation channel activity promotes disassembly of presynaptic domains in DD type GABA neurons, but not in VD class GABA neurons where <italic>unc-8</italic> expression is blocked by the COUP/TF transcription factor, UNC-55. We propose that the depolarizing effect of UNC-8-dependent sodium import elevates intracellular calcium in a positive feedback loop involving the voltage-gated calcium channel UNC-2 and the calcium-activated phosphatase TAX-6/calcineurin to initiate a caspase-dependent mechanism that disassembles the presynaptic apparatus. Thus, UNC-8 serves as a link between genetic and activity-dependent pathways that function together to promote the elimination of GABA synapses in remodeling neurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14599.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14599.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14599.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain contains billions of nerve cells, or neurons, that communicate with one another through connections called synapses. As the brain develops, these circuits are extensively modified as new synapses are created and others are removed. Neurological disorders may emerge if these processes are not regulated correctly. Identifying the biological pathways that control the addition and removal of synapses could therefore provide new insights into how to treat human brain diseases.</p><p>To communicate across a synapse, the signaling neuron releases chemicals called neurotransmitters that alter the activity of the receiving neuron. Some neurotransmitters, such as GABA, inhibit the activity of the receiving neuron. The activity of a neuron – and hence how often it releases neurotransmitters – depends on different ions moving into and out of the neuron through proteins called ion channels that are embedded in the cell membrane. For example, the movement of calcium ions into the neuron can trigger the release of neurotransmitters.</p><p>The roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is often used as a model organism to study how the brain develops. During development, the worm nervous system eliminates synapses that release GABA and reassembles them at new locations. However, the nervous system does not eliminate these synapses at random. Miller-Fleming, Petersen et al. now show that a <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein called UNC-8 is responsible for this effect. UNC-8 forms part of an ion channel that allows sodium ions to enter the neuron and is selectively produced in GABA neurons that are destined for remodeling.</p><p>Miller-Fleming, Petersen et al. found that inside GABA-releasing neurons, calcium ions stimulate an enzyme called calcineurin that may in turn activate UNC-8. Sodium ions then enter the neuron through UNC-8 channels. This boosts the activity of the calcium ion channels, which further increases how many calcium ions enter the cell. Ultimately, the amount of calcium inside the neuron becomes high enough to activate an additional pathway that eliminates the synapse. This downstream pathway involves components of a cell-killing (or “apoptotic”) mechanism that is repurposed in this case to remove the GABA release apparatus at the synapse.</p><p>Other proteins are likely to help UNC-8 sense the activity of neurons and destroy synapses in response. Further work is required to investigate these additional components and to determine how they work with UNC-8 to remove synapses in the nervous system during development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14599.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14599.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>synaptic remodeling</kwd><kwd>calcium signaling</kwd><kwd>cation channel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F31NS084732</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller-Fleming</surname><given-names>Tyne W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F31NS063669</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petersen</surname><given-names>Sarah C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01NS081259</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>David M</given-names><suffix>III</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The protein UNC-8 is a neuronal activity sensor that triggers the elimination of synapses during development of the nervous system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural circuits are reorganized during development to produce a mature, functional nervous system. Circuit refinement involves both the elimination of specific synapses and the strengthening of others. These developmental changes in brain architecture are temporally coordinated with critical periods in which neuronal wiring can be shaped by activity. The establishment of binocular vision in the mammalian brain, for example, depends on visual input during a distinct developmental period in which the circuit is uniquely sensitive to neural activity. GABA signaling regulates the onset and duration of this critical period of plasticity in the visual circuit, but the molecular mechanisms that drive synaptic remodeling in this pathway are poorly defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deidda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hensch, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Calcium influx by voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) triggers neurotransmitter secretion in active neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Catterall et al., 2008</xref>). Elevated intracellular calcium can also regulate synaptic strength by controlling gene expression and protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flavell and Greenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baumgärtel and Mansuy, 2012</xref>). For example, the calcium-sensitive phosphatase, calcineurin, antagonizes long term potentiation (LTP) through dephosphorylation of an AMPA receptor subunit that results in its endocytosis from the postsynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baumgärtel and Mansuy, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Winder et al., 1998</xref>). Recent work has shown that functional synaptic components can also be removed by the canonical apoptotic protease, caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ertürk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the cell death pathway component CED-3/caspase-3 and its upstream regulator CED-4/Apaf1 promote synaptic disassembly by activating the F-actin severing protein gelsolin; the calcium sensitivity of this pathway points to a potential role for neuronal activity in synaptic remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pinan-Lucarre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Degenerin/Epithelial Sodium Channels (DEG/ENaCs) are voltage-insensitive, trimeric cation channels. The term degenerin arises from the finding that constitutively active forms of DEG/ENaC channels induce neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bianchi and Driscoll, 2002</xref>). ENaCs are expressed in mammalian epithelial tissues, where they promote sodium reabsorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wemmie et al., 2002</xref>). Emerging evidence indicates that DEG/ENaCs may also influence neuronal plasticity and synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wemmie et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kreple et al., 2014</xref>). For example, the acid-sensing DEG/ENaC protein, ASIC1a, is expressed in distinct brain regions where it promotes learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wemmie et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zha et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ziemann et al., 2009</xref>). Models to explain this role of DEG/ENaCs in synaptic plasticity have posited that depolarizing DEG/ENaC-dependent cation transport activity could enhance the activation of voltage-sensitive postsynaptic ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wemmie et al., 2006</xref>). DEG/ENaCs can also function in the presynaptic compartment to elevate neurotransmitter secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho and Askwith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Voglis and Tavernarakis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Younger et al., 2013</xref>). In this case, the depolarizing activity of a presynaptic ENaC channel is proposed to enhance neurotransmitter release by elevating calcium import at local VGCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Younger et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we describe a DEG/ENaC protein that likely exerts a similar effect on intracellular calcium, but with the strikingly different downstream outcome of presynaptic destruction.</p><p>In the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a simple, well-defined GABAergic circuit is remodeled during development in a mechanism that is accelerated by neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">White et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hallam and Jin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thompson-Peer et al., 2012</xref>). Dorsal D (DD) motor neurons initially form synapses with ventral muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which are later eliminated and relocated to dorsal muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Ventral D (VD) motor neurons generate ventral synapses and express the transcriptional repressor protein UNC-55, which prevents these cells from remodeling; thus both DD and VD synapses are remodeled in <italic>unc-55</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walthall and Plunkett, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou and Walthall, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2005</xref>). Several lines of evidence indicate that UNC-55 blocks the native DD remodeling program: (1) Ectopic expression of UNC-55 in DD neurons prevents synaptic remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2005</xref>); (2) Ventral VD synapses are initially established and then removed in <italic>unc-55</italic> mutants in a sequence that parallels the DD remodeling program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petersen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meng et al., 2015</xref>); (3) VD neurons form ectopic but functional synapses with dorsal muscles in <italic>unc-55</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thompson-Peer et al., 2012</xref>); (4) The transcription factor genes <italic>irx-1</italic> and <italic>hbl-1,</italic> which UNC-55 negatively-regulates, normally function in DD neurons to promote remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petersen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thompson-Peer et al., 2012</xref>). We exploited the anti-remodeling role of UNC-55 in a screen designed to detect key components of the DD remodeling program as RNAi hits that prevent the ectopic remodeling phenotype of <italic>unc-55</italic> mutants. This approach revealed a molecularly diverse array of genes that drive removal of GABA synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petersen et al., 2011</xref>). Here we demonstrate that one of these UNC-55 targets, the DEG/ENaC protein UNC-8, functions to dismantle the presynaptic apparatus in remodeling GABA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). The necessary roles of UNC-2/VGCC and TAX-6/Calcineurin in this synapse elimination mechanism argue that intracellular calcium is involved. Our results indicate that UNC-8 promotes synapse removal downstream of TAX-6 and thus could be potentially activated by TAX-6/Calcineurin. In turn, we suggest that the depolarizing activity of UNC-8 DEG/ENaC could enhance UNC-2/VGCC function. The net positive feedback loop involving UNC-2/VGCC, TAX-6/Calcineurin and UNC-8/DEG/ENaC could elevate presynaptic calcium above a critical threshold to activate a downstream caspase-dependent pathway leading to destabilization of the presynaptic apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meng et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we propose a model in which UNC-8 triggers a synaptic removal mechanism that is regulated by the intersection of a genetic program that controls UNC-8 expression and a calcium-signaling pathway that promotes neurotransmission as well as synapse elimination.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14599.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>GABAergic neuron synaptic remodeling is transcriptionally controlled and depends on UNC-8.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dorsal D (DD) GABAergic motor neurons (dark blue) synapse with ventral muscles during embryonic development.

In an <italic>unc-55</italic> mutant, however, <italic>punc-8::GFP</italic> expression was clearly visible in both DD and VD neurons. As an additional test of this model, we fused GFP to the UNC-8 C-terminus in a fosmid reporter gene that spans the <italic>unc-8</italic> locus to include large flanking regions. The resultant UNC-8::GFP fusion protein is functional in vivo and is expressed in DD neurons in the wild type and also in VD neurons in an <italic>unc-55</italic> mutant. In this case, we also detected strong UNC-8::GFP expression in adjacent ventral cord DA and DB cholinergic neurons as predicted by the selective degeneration of these cells in a mutant that encodes a constitutively active UNC-8 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). These results suggest that the fosmid reporter likely includes gene regulatory regions that direct expression of the native UNC-8 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

DD remodeling is initiated toward the end of the first larval stage (L1) and involves the relocation of ventral presynaptic components to the dorsal side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hallam and Jin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petersen et al., 2011</xref>).

Robust, iPSCs were detected for wild-type and <italic>unc-8</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K,L</xref>).

Despite the presence of both presynaptic domains with abundant synaptic vesicles and clusters of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, residual GABAergic synapses in <italic>unc-55; unc-8</italic> animals are not functional. Taken together, these results indicate that UNC-8 is required for the efficient removal of the ventral presynaptic apparatus, but that the presynaptic defect of <italic>unc-55; unc-8</italic> animals could be due to an additional UNC-8-independent pathway, potentially involving the previously described homeodomain transcription factor <italic>irx-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petersen et al., 2011</xref>), acting in parallel to promote the disassembly of the ventral synaptic architecture of remodeling GABAergic neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>UNC-8 channel activity is required for synapse removal</title><p>We have shown that UNC-8 protein preferentially gates sodium when expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore considered the hypothesis that UNC-8 channel function is required for synaptic elimination. This idea is consistent with our finding that the <italic>unc-8</italic> mutant disrupts DD and VD synapse removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). As a specific test of this hypothesis, we treated <italic>unc-55</italic> mutant animals with Benzamil, which has previously been shown to inhibit DEG/ENaC channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kleyman and Cragoe, 1988</xref>). In this experiment, <italic>unc-55</italic> mutant animals were grown on media containing 3 mM Benzamil (see Materials and methods). Ventral SNB-1::GFP puncta were scored in adult animals. As expected, <italic>unc-55</italic> animals from control plates show few ventral SNB-1::GFP puncta in GABA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). In contrast, treatment of <italic>unc-55</italic> animals with Benzamil results in a significantly larger number of residual SNB-1::GFP puncta on the ventral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). However, Benzamil treatment of <italic>unc-55;unc-8</italic> animals does not induce any additional enhancement of ventral SNB-1::GFP puncta. This result argues that Benzamil antagonizes synaptic removal by specifically inhibiting UNC-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To confirm that Benzamil inhibits UNC-8 channel activity, we expressed the constitutively active UNC-8(G387E) protein in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes for electrophysiological analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We have previously established that the UNC-8(G387E) protein shows robust sodium transport activity in an extracellular solution that is depleted of calcium and other divalent cations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Under these conditions, Benzamil strongly inhibits UNC-8(G387E) sodium transport with a K<sub>i</sub> ~ 119 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). In the presence of extracellular calcium, Benzamil acts as a more potent inhibitor (K<sub>i</sub> = 47 μM) suggesting that calcium ions enhance Benzamil binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). A similar effect of extracellular divalent cations on inhibitor potency was previously observed for the DEG/ENaC inhibitor Amiloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Treatment with Amiloride also antagonizes the removal of ventral SNB-1::GFP puncta in <italic>unc-55</italic> mutant neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), but does not alter ventral SNB-1::GFP puncta in either <italic>unc-8</italic> or <italic>unc-55;unc-8</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Because synaptic removal is activated during a discrete developmental period, a specific signal is likely required to trigger this pathway. Based on our finding that calcium signaling and UNC-8 function together to promote GABA synapse elimination and previous work that detected roles for calcium in caspase activation and gelsolin function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pinan-Lucarre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), we considered the possibility that these components function in a common pathway and that calcium activates the overall mechanism.

(1) GABA neuron depolarization activates the voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC), UNC-2, to allow calcium entry (black circles bottom panel). (2) Intracellular calcium activates the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin (CaN/TAX-6). (3) CaN phosphatase may activate UNC-8, which results in the movement of sodium ions (white circles) into the presynaptic GABA neuron, further depolarizing the presynaptic membrane and activating VGCCs. This positive feedback loop is predicted to further elevate intracellular calcium. (4) Our results show that UNC-8 drives the removal of presynaptic components and functions in a common genetic pathway with calcium signaling and with the apoptotic protein CED-4. Therefore, we hypothesize that selective expression of UNC-8 in remodeling GABA neurons effectively boosts the level of intracellular calcium to activate a CED-4-dependent pathway for removal of the presynaptic apparatus.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14599.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14599.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-14599-fig8-v2"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Developing nervous systems are dynamically remodeled during genetically defined intervals in which circuit architecture is particularly sensitive to neural activity. These 'critical periods' have been widely observed, but the underlying mechanisms that account for the dual roles of transcriptional pathways and synaptic activity in circuit refinement are incompletely defined. In this study, we show that a member of the conserved DEG/ENaC family of cation channel proteins, UNC-8, is transcriptionally controlled to mediate an activity-dependent pathway that promotes the removal of GABAergic synapses in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The UNC-8/DEG/ENaC protein promotes synapse elimination in an activity-dependent pathway</title><p>Previous work has detected roles for DEG/ENaC proteins in synaptic function and neural plasticity. For example, members of the ASIC (acid-sensing ion channels) class of the DEG/ENaC family proteins are activated by low pH and have been implicated in learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wemmie et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zha et al., 2006</xref>). In one possible mechanism to explain this role, acidification of the synaptic cleft that accompanies the neurotransmitter release is thought to trigger ASIC-mediated sodium influx. The resultant membrane depolarization is proposed to enhance postsynaptic signaling by activating local voltage gated ion channels and NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wemmie et al., 2013</xref>). Presynaptic roles are also possible as suggested by studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that detected an ASIC-like channel that promotes neurotransmitter secretion in a learning and memory paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Voglis and Tavernarakis, 2008</xref>). Our finding that a reconstituted UNC-8 channel is in fact inhibited by low pH, however, suggests that UNC-8 is unlikely to function as an ASIC-like protein in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). This observation is important because non-ASIC members of the DEG/ENaC family are also expressed in the brain, but their roles in synaptic function are largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giraldez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamamura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Waldmann, 1995</xref>). A recent study established that the DEG/ENaC protein, pickpocket, exerts a homeostatic function that maintains neurotransmitter release at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction. In this mechanism, sodium influx arising from elevated pickpocket transcription and membrane insertion is proposed to result in local depolarization that activates a nearby voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) and consequent neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Younger et al., 2013</xref>). This model is consistent with the finding that the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 VGCC channel subunit cacophony is required for synaptic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Müller and Davis, 2012</xref>). Our results are suggestive of a similar presynaptic role for UNC-8 of enhancing intracellular calcium influx with the important difference that UNC-8 ultimately eliminates neurotransmitter secretion by triggering destruction of the presynaptic apparatus. In addition, our findings provide a plausible explanation for the radically different outcomes of pickpocket and UNC-8 channel function.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that UNC-8 promotes the removal of presynaptic domains in remodeling GABAergic neurons. This UNC-8 function requires its intrinsic cation channel activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) which likely involves sodium influx since electrophysiological studies of a reconstituted UNC-8 channel in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes indicate that UNC-8 preferentially transports sodium and is impermeant to calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Because our evidence points to punctate UNC-8 localization within the ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), it is reasonable to predict that UNC-8-dependent sodium import would activate nearby VGCC channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wemmie et al., 2013</xref>). This idea is consistent with the observation that VGCC function is required for ASIC-induced elevation of intracellular calcium in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zha et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, our results show that synaptic removal in remodeling <italic>C. elegans</italic> GABA neurons is disrupted by genetic ablation of the Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channel subunit, UNC-2. As a key component of the presynaptic apparatus, UNC-2 mediates calcium influx to drive neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richmond et al., 2001</xref>). We suggest that the UNC-2-dependent rise in cytoplasmic calcium in active GABA neurons is enhanced by UNC-8 cation channel function. Moreover, because our genetic results indicate that <italic>unc-2</italic> and <italic>unc-8</italic> function in a common pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), the elevation of intracellular calcium arising from this interaction could be required for efficient removal of the presynaptic apparatus in remodeling GABA neurons (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Calcium signaling and a caspase-dependent mechanism drive GABA neuron synapse elimination</title><p>The idea of a downstream role for calcium in synaptic remodeling is underscored by our finding that the calcineurin homolog, TAX-6, also functions in the <italic>unc-8</italic>-dependent mechanism of synapse elimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The serine-threonine phosphatase activity of calcineurin/CaN is calcium and calmodulin-dependent and has been shown to regulate neural plasticity. For example, calcineurin/CaN antagonizes LTP in a mechanism that dephosphorylates the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor to promote its removal from the postsynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Winder et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gorski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 1998</xref>). TAX-6/Calcineurin could exert a parallel role in the removal of the presynaptic apparatus in GABA neurons by activating the UNC-8 channel. Our finding that the DEG/ENaC inhibitor, Benzamil, potently blocks the accelerated remodeling phenotype of a constitutively active TAX-6 protein is consistent with this idea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The resultant positive feedback loop involving UNC-2, TAX-6/Calcineurin and UNC-8 should further elevate intracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In an analogous mechanism, phosphorylation by CaMKII activates ASIC1a and the resultant VGCC-dependent elevation of intracellular calcium in turn promotes CaMKII activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zha et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zha and Zha, 2013</xref>). In this model, UNC-8 would act as a synaptic amplifier to drive a self-reinforcing signaling pathway that elevates intracellular calcium.</p><p>The key role of calcium signaling in this model is consistent with previous work showing that removal of the GABA presynaptic apparatus requires components of the canonical apoptotic pathway including the caspase-3 homolog CED-3 and its upstream activator CED-4/Apaf1.

The localization of apoptotic components to the presynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meng et al., 2015</xref>) may ensure that a local rise in calcium near the synapse is sufficient to activate this mechanism, but also protects the neuron from apoptotic death.

Stage VI defolliculated oocytes from <italic>Xenopus Laevis</italic> were purchased from Ecocyte Bioscience US LLC (Austin, Texas). Oocytes were injected with 10 ng/oocyte of cRNA and incubated in OR2 solution (82.5 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 g/liter polyvinyl pyrolidone, and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) and 2 mM Na-pyruvate) plus 500 µM amiloride (to prevent channel hyperactivation-dependent cell death) at 20°C for 2–3 d before recordings. Currents were measured using a two-electrode voltage-clamp amplifier (GeneClamp 500B; Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA) at room temperature. Electrodes (0.2–0.5 MΩ) were filled with 3 M KCl, and oocytes were perfused with a physiological NaCl solution (100 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) and divalent cation free plus EGTA NaCl solution (110 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2). pH was adjusted at the indicated values using NaOH. The oocyte membrane was clamped at −30 mV and stepped from −160 to +100 mV. Benzamil was added to the solutions from a stock of 10 mM. A saturating concentration of benzamil (1mM) was added at the end of each experiment to confirm that endogenous/leak currents were similar in amplitude to non-injected oocytes within each oocyte batch. Oocytes that had larger endogenous/leak currents were not further analyzed. We used the pCLAMP suite of programs (Axon Instruments) for data acquisition and analysis.

Freeze substitution was performed on frozen samples in a Reichert AFS machine (Leica, Oberkochen, Germany) with 0.1% tannic acid and 2% OsO<sub>4</sub> in anhydrous acetone. The temperature was kept at −90°C for 107 hr, increased at 5°C/hr to −20°C, and kept at -20°C for 14 hr. The temperature was then increased by 10°C/h to 20°C. Fixed specimens were embedded in Epon resin after infiltration in 50% Epon/acetone for 4 hr, 90% Epon/acetone for 18 hr, and 100% Epon for 5 hr. Embedded samples were incubated for 48 hr at 65°C. All specimens were prepared in the same fixation procedure and labeled with anonymous tags so that the examiner was blinded for genotype. Ultra thin (40 nm) serial sections were cut using an Ultracut 6 (Leica) and collected on formvar- covered, carbon-coated copper grids (EMS, FCF2010-Cu). Grids were counterstained in 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 4 min, followed by Reynolds lead citrate for 2 min. Images were obtained on a Jeol JEM-1220 (Tokyo, Japan) transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Micrographs were collected using a Gatan digital camera (Pleasanton, CA) at a magnification of 100k. Images were quantified using NIH ImageJ software. Dorsal and ventral cords were distinguished by size and morphology. GABAergic synapses were identified by previously established criteria, including position in the cord as well as the morphology of the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jin et al., 1999</xref>). GABAergic synapses are larger than their cholinergic motor neuron counterparts, and the active zones in these synapses form a direct, perpendicular angle with muscle arms. On the other hand, the presynaptic density in cholinergic synapses orient at an acute angle to the muscle, generally 30–45° and are often dyadic. Some images were collected at 30 k to aid in identifying synaptic identity based on terminal position in the cord. Two colleagues with expertise in EM reconstruction of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ventral nerve cord independently reviewed synapse images from each strain to verify identification. Each profile represents an image taken of a 40 nm section. A synapse was defined as a set of serial sections containing a presynaptic density and flanking sections from both sides without presynaptic densities. Synaptic vesicles were identified as spherical, light gray structures with an average diameter of ~30 nm. At least two animals were analyzed for each genotype. Numbers of profiles analyzed for each genotype were: wild type = 502, <italic>unc-8</italic> = 322, <italic>unc-55</italic> = 246, <italic>unc-55; unc-8</italic> = 304 for ventral GABAergic synapse evaluation; wild type = 502, <italic>unc-8</italic> = 322, <italic>unc-55</italic> = 246, <italic>unc-55; unc-8</italic> = 304 for ventral cholinergic synapse evaluation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank MQ Dong for MQD5, M Francis for IZ1607, O Hobert for <italic>otEx2876</italic>, Y Jin for <italic>juIs137,</italic> E Jorgensen for <italic>oxIs351</italic>, J Kaplan for <italic>nuIs279</italic>, K Shen for <italic>wyIs202</italic>, M Zhen for <italic>hpIs3</italic>, M Zhen and M Kittelman for advice on scoring GABA synapses by electron microscopy and members of the Miller Lab for discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kang Shen as the Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>This manuscript addresses the molecular mechanisms that govern a poorly understood, but critical biological process, synapse remodeling. UNC-55 is a transcription factor that prevents the VD class GABAergic motor neurons to adopt the fate of another subclass of GABAergic motor neuron (DD), which undergoes post-embryonic synapse remodeling. Previously, the corresponding author's group performed micro-array experiments to compare the transcriptional profiles of GABAergic motor neurons in the presence and absence of UNC-55, identified a dozen of UNC-55-regulated transcripts (Petersen, JNS, 2011). This manuscript explores the functional involvement of and potential mechanisms through one of these targets, the UNC-8 ENaC sodium channel affect remodeling.</p><p>In this paper, the authors used several presynaptic fluorescent markers to quantify the remodeling phenotype of GABAergic motor neurons in wild-type and <italic>unc-55</italic> mutants, and to access the effect of removing UNC-8/ENaC, and its putative pathway components (UNC-2/VGCC, TAX-6/calcineurin, CED-4/Apaf). They confirmed that removing these components, either individually, or in combination with removing UNC-8, led to a similar degree and partial restoration of the ventral presynaptic structures in <italic>unc-55</italic> background. They performed EM analyses to confirm the anatomic presence of these structures, and, by electrophysiology analyses, that these structures (in <italic>unc-55; unc-8</italic>) appeared to lack the ability to release synaptic vesicles. Because a previous study from the group (Petersen, 2011) revealed that IRX-1, a TF, is an UNC-55-target that functions similarly to UNC-8 to promote the remodeling of GABAergic neurons, author probed the genetic relationship between <italic>unc-8</italic> and <italic>irx-1</italic>. They found that removing both in <italic>unc-55</italic> background led to an increased effect on promoting the remodeling. Hence, placing UNC-8 and IRX-1 in two parallel pathways negatively regulated by UNC-55.</p><p>Both reviewers found the manuscript contains a lot of data, and two semi-related studies that address two UNC-55-dependent mechanisms that regulate synaptic remodeling. Both reviewers are impressed with the comprehensive EM and electrophysiological analyses. They found that the manuscript is appropriate for publication after the authors address the following questions. As you will see, many of the comments are about writing and the strength of the conclusions. Some comments need to be addressed experimentally.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Most importantly, both reviewers raised concerns about the interpretation of &quot;synapse elimination&quot; phenotypes in the <italic>unc-8</italic> mutants. One reviewer wrote: &quot;In several places, the manuscript made strong statements along the line that 'UNC-8 drives presynaptic structure removal'. I feel that authors may want to soften these statements and may need additional data to enforce such statement, for following reasons: a) the rescuing effect of removing UNC-8, UNC-2, TAX-6 and CED-4 is not only partial, and appears to reflect morphological, but not functional rescue of <italic>unc-55</italic>'s GABAergic neuron defects. Compared to the effect of removing IRX-1 (Peterson 2011; and this study), the role UNC-8 pathway is less prominent. B) if UNC-2 is to be stated as 'required for remodeling', it would be useful to analyze the remodeling phenotype in <italic>unc-2</italic> single mutants (as shown for <italic>unc-8</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).&quot;.</p><p>Another reviewer wrote: &quot;My main concern of this study is the interpretation of synapse removal.

Of particular note, we have sought to clarify the impression that our results are limited to the ectopic synaptic removal mechanism that occurs in <italic>unc-55</italic> mutants. In fact, our goal is to understand the native synaptic remodeling mechanism (in DD neurons). We have exploited the <italic>unc-55</italic> remodeling phenotype to facilitate experimental analysis and because ample evidence supports the conclusion that the endogenous DD neuron remodeling pathway is activated in <italic>unc-55</italic> mutant VD neurons. For example, multiple components of the DD remodeling mechanism including genes either reported in previous papers (<italic>irx-1, oig-1, hbl-1, ced-4</italic>) or in this work (<italic>unc-8, tax-6/cnb-1</italic>) also promote synaptic removal in <italic>unc-55</italic> mutant VD neurons. Moreover, both DD and VD remodeling programs are activity-dependent. We have emphasized these points in additional text now included in the Introduction and Discussion.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Most importantly, both reviewers raised concerns about the interpretation of &quot;synapse elimination&quot; phenotypes in the unc-8 mutants.

We have modified the text to acknowledge this point and to more carefully describe our interpretation of these findings. In particular, we have re-worded statements to the effect that “<italic>unc-8</italic> is required for synaptic removal” to say “<italic>unc-8</italic> promotes synaptic removal.” This alternative description reflects our finding that <italic>unc-8</italic> functions in parallel to other pathways that also promote synaptic removal. In fact, other known components of the remodeling mechanism are also not absolutely required. For example, the apoptotic pathway that removes DD synapses in young larvae is complemented by an additional unknown mechanism that eventually dismantles these connections by the adult stage (Meng et al. 2015). Together, these findings indicate that the synaptic remodeling mechanism is complex and likely involves multiple pathways. We have included the results of an additional experiment that validates the role of <italic>unc-8</italic> in synaptic removal. We interpret our genetic results to indicate that wild-type <italic>unc-8</italic> is required for the removal of a significant fraction of presynaptic domains in remodeling GABAergic neurons. To test the hypothesis that <italic>unc-8</italic> function is also sufficient to drive synapse removal, we have used a transgenic strategy to over-express <italic>unc-8</italic> in ventral cord GABAergic neurons. In this experiment, we observed that ventral synapses are substantially reduced in VD neurons that express ectopic <italic>unc-8</italic>, whereas neighboring VD neurons that do not express <italic>unc-8</italic> retain the wild-type complement of ventral presynaptic domains. This result supports the model that UNC-8 drives presynaptic removal.

Our genetic results have shown that <italic>unc-2</italic> promotes synaptic removal in the <italic>unc-55</italic> remodeling program. To directly test the proposal that <italic>unc-2</italic> is also involved in DD remodeling, we used the DD::mCherry::RAB-3 marker to monitor the DD presynaptic domain in <italic>unc-2</italic> mutants. The results of this experiment were inconclusive, however. Although the removal of DD presynaptic domains was delayed in an <italic>unc-2</italic> mutant in comparison to wild type, we also noted that <italic>unc-2</italic> mutants develop more slowly as well. In the future, we could potentially obviate this problem by using cell-specific RNAi to target <italic>unc-2</italic> specifically in GABA neurons.</p><p><italic>Another reviewer wrote: &quot;My main concern of this study is the interpretation of synapse removal.

We have now quantified the number of synapses in wild-type and <italic>unc-8</italic> animals prior to the 18-hour time point.

The higher number of puncta observed in <italic>unc-8</italic> animals at later time points is consistent with the proposal that removal of ventral DD synapses is delayed in <italic>unc-8</italic> mutants in comparison to wild type.

We performed time-course analysis in both <italic>unc-55</italic> and <italic>unc-55; unc-8</italic> animals (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). At early time points (12, 18, 25, and 36 hours post lay) <italic>unc-55</italic> and <italic>unc-55; unc-8</italic> animals show similar numbers of ventral synapses. At later stages (&gt; 48 hour post lay), as previously reported in Petersen et al. (2011), the number of ventral GABA synapses declines in <italic>unc-55</italic> mutants. In contrast, the number of ventral synapses in the <italic>unc-55; unc-8</italic> animals remains steady (through 96 hours post lay) and does not decline. These results are consistent with the idea that the residual ventral synapses that we detected by fluorescence and electron microscopy in <italic>unc-55; unc-8</italic> adults are likely to correspond to GABA synapses that are not properly removed as opposed to new synapses which might otherwise appear in this experimental approach as a spike in ventral puncta during later development of <italic>unc-55; unc-8</italic> animals. Additionally, it is unlikely that the GABA synapses we see by EM in the ventral nerve cords of <italic>unc-55; unc-8</italic> animals are due to ectopic protein trafficking, as they include organized presynaptic structures with active zones, synaptic vesicles, dense core vesicles, and juxtaposed postsynaptic muscle arms.</p><p><italic>“In addition, do these presynaptic puncta have postsynaptic UNC-49::GFP?

We have performed experiments to test whether the ventral presynaptic puncta in <italic>unc-55; unc-8</italic> GABA neurons co-localize with postsynaptic UNC-49::GFP. These results (described below) are not included in the revised version of this paper, however, because we have also removed electrophysiological data indicating that residual ventral synapses in <italic>unc-55; unc-8</italic> animals are not functional and will publish these findings in a separate paper separate manuscript featuring the parallel roles of <italic>unc-8</italic> and <italic>irx-1</italic> during synaptic remodeling. We captured images of wild-type, <italic>unc-8</italic>, and <italic>unc-55; unc-8</italic> animals co-expressing a presynaptic GABA marker (<italic>punc-25::mCherry::RAB-3</italic>) and a postsynaptic GABA receptor marker (<italic>punc-49::UNC-49::GFP</italic>) and analyzed these images for co-localization using ImageJ software. Although, co-localization of mCherry::RAB-3 and UNC-49::GFP in <italic>unc-55; unc-</italic>8 animals (r<sup>2</sup>= 0.53) is decreased in comparison to wild-type and <italic>unc-8</italic> animals (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.80 and 0.77, respectively), we attribute this difference to the observation that there is less punc-25::mCherry::RAB-3 ventral puncta in <italic>unc-55; unc-8</italic> animals compared to wild type. This observation suggests that these synapses have not lost their postsynaptic partners.</p><p>Reviewers are correct to note that GABA synaptic function is not restored in <italic>unc-55; unc-8</italic> animals. We agree that these apparently non-functional presynaptic GABAergic domains are not physiologically competent. However, the existence of these presynaptic structures in an <italic>unc-55; unc-8</italic> mutant <italic>whether functional or not</italic> provides clear evidence that wild-type UNC-8 promotes the removal of presynaptic components including proteins that are required for neurotransmitter release (e.g., RAB-3, SNB-1/V-SNARE, UNC-57/endophilin, SYD-2/Liprin). The non-functionality of the presynaptic regions that are <italic>not</italic> removed in <italic>unc-8</italic> mutants suggests that an additional parallel pathway, which is still active in an <italic>unc-8</italic> mutant, must account for this deficit. At the recommendation of the reviewers (see below) who felt that our analysis of a second parallel acting remodeling pathway detracted from the main point of this work (i.e., UNC-8 promotes synaptic remodeling) these data have been removed from the paper and will be featured in a separate manuscript that documents the parallel roles of the <italic>unc-8</italic> and <italic>irx-1</italic>-dependent remodeling pathways.</p><p><italic>2) Presynaptic Marker analyses: Authors accessed the phenotype and genetic interactions between unc-55 and unc-8 (and some other suppressors) used several presynaptic markers to conclude that their interaction reflects the change of the entire presynaptic structure, instead of specific effect on individual protein/marker expression or subcellular localization.

It would be useful for readers to clarify these points in Discussion.</italic></p><p>Thank you for this comment. We apologize for the confusion and have sought to clarify this point by noting that we used two different paradigms to monitor synapse removal (e.g., the native DD remodeling program and ectopic remodeling in <italic>unc-55</italic> mutant VD neurons). The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were collected using a DD-specific promoter to monitor the removal defect specifically in DD neurons. We have sought to clarify this point by labeling all the experiments where we used the DD-specific marker as “<italic>DD::SNB-1::GFP</italic> or <italic>DD::GFP::RAB-3</italic>” rather than using the less descriptive nomenclature “<italic>pflp-13::.</italic>.”. Additionally, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> we have labeled the DD and VD markers as “GABA::SNB-1::GFP”, etc. rather than with the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene names “<italic>punc-25/pttr-39</italic>”.
