They bind and release microtubules via a compact microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) at the end of a coiled-coil stalk. We address how cytoplasmic and axonemal dynein MTBDs bind microtubules at near atomic resolution. We decorated microtubules with MTBDs of cytoplasmic dynein-1 and axonemal dynein DNAH7 and determined their cryo-EM structures using helical Relion. The majority of the MTBD is rigid upon binding, with the transition to the high-affinity state controlled by the movement of a single helix at the MTBD interface. DNAH7 contains an 18-residue insertion, found in many axonemal dyneins, that contacts the adjacent protofilament. Unexpectedly, we observe that DNAH7, but not dynein-1, induces large distortions in the microtubule cross-sectional curvature. This raises the possibility that dynein coordination in axonemes is mediated via conformational changes in the microtubule.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microtuble</kwd><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>cryoEM</kwd><kwd>Relion</kwd><kwd>axoneme</kwd><kwd>cilia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT210711</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carter</surname><given-names>Andrew P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UP_A025_1011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheres</surname><given-names>Sjors HW</given-names></name><name><surname>Carter</surname><given-names>Andrew P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Relion was used to solve structures of microtubules decorated with dynein microtubule-binding domains revealing that an axonemal dynein distorts the microtubule cross-sectional curvature.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The dynein family is a group of minus-end directed microtubule motors. The two cytoplasmic dyneins (dynein-1 and dynein-2) are involved in long-range movement of cellular cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>). Multiple inner and outer arm axonemal dyneins power the beating motion in cilia and flagella by sliding adjacent doublet microtubules past each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Satir et al., 2014</xref>). All dynein family members share a common architecture, based around a heavy chain that contains a cargo-binding tail region and a force-generating motor domain. The motor consists of a ring of six connected AAA+ subdomains (AAA1-6) with the nucleotide cycle of the first, AAA1, powering movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmidt and Carter, 2016</xref>). Dyneins bind to microtubules via a small microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) consisting of six short helices (H1-H6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The MTBD is connected to the AAA +ring by an antiparallel coiled-coil stalk, containing helices CC1 and CC2. It binds to the microtubule at the tubulin intradimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carter et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47145.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM Structure of the cytoplasmic dynein-1 microtubule-binding domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Crystal structure of the cytoplasmic dynein-1 MTBD in the low-affinity β +registry (PDB 3ERR) coloured by helix.

Motion correction and CTF determination were performed as standard. Autopicking was optimised to pick all microtubules. 2D and 3D classification was used to remove bad particles. In 2D classification, bad classes included those with incorrect features (e.g. the carbon edge, class 2), low decoration on the side of the microtubule (class 4) or identifiable non-13 protofilament architecture (classes 6 and 9). The latter can be distinguished on account of the unique lack of protofilament twist in 13-protofilament microtubules (that is, protofilaments run exactly parallel to the microtubule long axis). This means that the repeating patterns in the classes should run parallel (class 7, expanded), whereas particles with protofilament twist will have converging or diverging patterns along the microtubule (class 6, expanded). This method is then supplemented with 3D classification to remove microtubule architectures with small protofilament skews that may not show up in short 2D segments, as well as particles with poor contrast or high-resolution detail. Refinement of the good class from 3D classification followed by 3D refinement with local symmetry resulted in a 4.1 Å map (FSC<sub>0.143</sub> cut-off, gold standard).

The stalk transmits these conformational changes due to its ability to pack into two stable registries (α and β+), representing a half-heptad shift of CC1 relative to CC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gibbons et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>).

The relative movement of CC1 towards the ring (stalk in α registry) pulls on the MTBD to create a high-affinity state. The structure of this state was visualised in a landmark 9.7 Å cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the MTBD bound to microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Redwine et al., 2012</xref>). A pseudoatomic model was fit into the cryo-EM map using molecular dynamic simulations, and showed large conformational changes throughout the MTBD upon binding. The authors concluded that specific interactions between the microtubule and H1, H3, and H6 of the MTBD are required to induce and maintain this high-affinity conformation.</p><p>A high degree of conservation in the MTBD between the different dynein family members suggests that this mechanism of microtubule binding is conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Höök and Vallee, 2006</xref>). However, many axonemal dyneins have an insertion between H2 and H3 called the flap, the function of which is unclear. An NMR structure of the <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> flagellar dynein-c MTBD showed that the flap consists of two flexible beta-strands extending from the MTBD core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kato et al., 2014</xref>).

We determined the structure of mouse cytoplasmic dynein-1 MTBD on microtubules to an overall resolution of 4.1 Å. We observe a number of structural differences to the 9.7 Å structure. This leads to an updated model for the transition from a low- to high-affinity state, based only around movement of H1 to avoid steric clashes with the microtubule surface. Furthermore, we determine the structure of microtubules decorated with the MTBD of the human inner-arm dynein DNAH7 to 4.5 Å resolution. We show that its flap contacts an adjacent protofilament from the rest of the MTBD, and show that this interaction dramatically distorts the microtubule cross-sectional shape.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structural determination of cytoplasmic dynein-1 MTBD decorating microtubules</title><p>To fix the stalk in the high microtubule affinity α registry, we used a chimeric fusion construct (SRS-DYNC1H1<sub>3260-3427</sub>) in which the mouse cytoplasmic dynein-1 MTBD and 12 heptads of stalk are fused to a seryl-tRNA synthetase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carter et al., 2008</xref>).

As such, these microtubules cannot be subjected to conventional helical symmetry averaging. Previously, EM structures of microtubules with a seam have used iterative 2D cross-correlation to synthetic projections followed by 3D refinements in order to locate the position of the seam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sindelar and Downing, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang and Nogales, 2015</xref>). We propose an alternative image processing approach that is integrated into the helical Relion pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">He and Scheres, 2017</xref>). 3D refinement follows the standard regime for a C1 helix, however 13-fold local, non-point-group symmetry is applied to the reconstruction following each iteration. The application of local symmetry depends on a user-specified mask and symmetry operators that superimpose equivalent tubulin dimers on top of each other. The application of local symmetry increases the signal in the reference during refinement, and prevents progressive deterioration in the definition of the seam from poorly aligned particles. The same local symmetry is also applied to increase the signal in the final reconstruction. Relion has the advantage of requiring minimal user input, and is capable of sorting sample heterogeneity with 2D and 3D classification.</p><p>We initially used 2D classification to remove microtubules that were poorly decorated or possess identifiable non-13 protofilament architectures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Particles from good 2D classes were used for 3D classification, which resulted in a single good class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Manual inspection confirmed that this class contained only 13-protofilament microtubules.</p><p>The seam is well defined in the resulting asymmetric reconstruction, with α-tubulins making lateral contact with β-tubulins. This is displayed most clearly when viewing the extended luminal S9-S10 loop in α-tubulin and the additional rise between MTBDs across the seam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E/F</xref>). Application of local symmetry resulted in a map with an overall resolution of 4.1 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C/D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The resolution of the tubulin density ranges from 3.6 Å to 4.4 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The tubulin model refined into our density closely matched a previous high-resolution EM model of taxol-stabilised microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kellogg et al., 2017</xref>).

We see a much smaller movement in CC1 and H1, and as a result H3 and H4 stay much higher above the microtubule surface. The experimental setup used in this study is slightly different to the previous structure. We imaged a longer 12-heptad stalk-SRS construct on 13 protofilament microtubules, compared to a 3-heptad construct on 14-protofilament microtubules. To confirm that the structure we observed is representative of full-length dynein bound to microtubules, we imaged a human cytoplasmic dynein-1 motor domain construct (DYNC1H1<sub>1230-4646</sub>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Steinman et al., 2017</xref>) bound to microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Lower microtubule occupancy was observed for DYNC1H1<sub>1230-4646</sub> compared to SRS-DYNC1H1<sub>3260-3427</sub>, which is likely a result of steric clashes between adjacent motor domains around the microtubule. Microtubules with high occupancy were selected following 2D classification. The lower occupancy meant that the MTBD density was at a much lower resolution than the microtubule, and therefore the map was lowpass filtered to 8 Å for interpretation. The resulting map fits well with our new model, but H1, H2, H3 and H4 from the 9.7 Å model are all at least partially outside the density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C–F</xref>).

A model of the DNAH7 MTBD was refined into the density using a homology model to the low-affinity NMR structure (PDB 2RR7, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kato et al., 2014</xref>) as a starting point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Comparing the final microtubule-bound model to the original low-affinity structure, we observe the same conformational changes as for SRS-DYNC1H1<sub>3260-3427</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Namely, the majority of the MTBD remains unchanged, but H1 and CC1 move up into a raised position over the intradimer interface. Furthermore, aligning our cytoplasmic dynein-1 model to the DNAH7 model shows that they adopt almost identical conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>The biggest difference between the cytoplasmic dynein-1 and DNAH7 models lies in the flap. At lower threshold levels an elongated density emerges from the DNAH7 MTBD and contacts the adjacent protofilament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). There are two contacts between the flap and this protofilament, corresponding to H10 of β-tubulin and loop H6/7 of α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F/G</xref>). As such, DNAH7 contacts four tubulin subunits at once when it binds to the microtubule. On account of its appearance only at lower threshold levels, we conclude that the flap has a degree of flexibility.</p><p>Another difference between the two structures is the orientation of the MTBD on the microtubule. Aligning the tubulin of the DNAH7 and cytoplasmic dynein-1 models reveals that the DNAH7 MTBD is tilted relative to cytoplasmic dynein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This can be described by a 7° rotation around the microtubule contact site at the base of H6. DNAH7 is tilted in the same direction as the flap, suggesting that its interaction with the adjacent protofilament pulls on the entire MTBD.</p><p>Lowpass filtering and thresholding the map to a lower level revealed the presence of an additional link between the DNAH7 MTDB and the adjacent protofilament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Due to its proximity to the C-terminus of β-tubulin, we suspect that this density is attributed to the β-tubulin ‘E-hook’. This is a normally unstructured ~20 residue chain of mostly glutamate residues that strongly contributes to the electronegative surface of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nogales et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Redeker et al., 1992</xref>). We note that the same link is not observed in our cytoplasmic dynein-1 density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>) at any threshold. Examination of the surface charges of our two models reveals a large positively charged patch on the top of the DNAH7 MTBD that is absent in cytoplasmic dynein-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J/K</xref>). Modelling of the β-tubulin E-hook show that it is capable of reaching this patch. As such, we conclude that on top of a core microtubule interaction shared with cytoplasmic dynein, DNAH7 is bolstered by two links to the adjacent protofilament.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DNAH7 binding to microtubules induces changes in microtubule cross section</title><p>During the process of solving the DNAH7 MTBD structure, we noticed that the microtubule was distorted compared to our other reconstructions.

This shows a linear relationship between decoration level and local curvature, with the lowest curvature (flattest) sub-classes having the highest decoration.

In our DNAH7 MTBD sub-classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), we do not see any evidence of docked MTBDs without flap binding, suggesting that the flap contact is an integral feature of the DNAH7 microtubule interaction. Furthermore, the movement of the MTBD towards the adjacent protofilament suggests that there is tension created by the flap. We propose that this tension results in the relative movement between protofilaments that generates a local flattening.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Using Relion to solve high-resolution structures of decorated pseudosymmetric microtubules</title><p>The workflow we present for solving microtubule structures in Relion is straightforward and does not require expert knowledge. To test the general applicability for decorated microtubules, we re-processed EMPIAR dataset 10030, which comprises EB3-decorated microtubules. This data set was previously refined to 3.5 Å resolution using an iterative seam-finding protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang and Nogales, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang and Nogales, 2015</xref>). Following the Relion pipeline with the same data resulted in an asymmetric map with lower levels of density on the protofilaments either side of the seam, suggesting that not all particles were aligned correctly with respect to the seam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D/E</xref>). However, after symmetrization the map extends to 3.5 Å resolution and is essentially identical in appearance to the published structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). We conclude that Relion can be used to reconstruct pseudosymmetric microtubules and their decorating partners to high resolution.</p><p>We note that many of the previously introduced methods for microtubule reconstruction explicitly determine, and enforce, a single seam orientation for each microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sindelar and Downing, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang and Nogales, 2015</xref>). In Relion, the in-plane rotation, translations, and out-of-plane rocking (tilt) angle can be restrained to similar values in neighbouring segments from each microtubule through the use of Gaussian priors. However, such a prior has not been implemented for the first Euler angle, that is the rotation around the helical axis. Therefore, each segment is aligned independently from its neighbours in the same microtubule, and mistakes in alignment of the seam can be made on a per-segment basis. Therefore, at least in its current implementation, Relion appears to require a larger decorating density (such as the dynein MTBD) to fully align the seam.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A revised high-affinity state of the dynein MTBD</title><p>Our new 4.1 Å reconstruction of the cytoplasmic dynein-1 MTBD allows us to identify the structural transitions that occur upon dynein binding to microtubules. The MTBD interface made up of H2, H3, H4 and H6 shows only minor changes upon microtubule binding, suggesting it is in a binding-primed conformation regardless of nucleotide state. This interface can initiate contact with the microtubule, but a stable microtubule-bound state cannot be achieved when dynein is in a low-affinity state due to a steric clash between H1 and β-tubulin. When the motor switches to a high microtubule affinity nucleotide state, H1 moves up and the MTBD can be further stabilised on the microtubule by interactions between H1 and β-tubulin. Conversely, when ATP binds to the motor, changes in the stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>) push H1 down and release the MTBD from the microtubule.</p><p>Combining our current work with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kato et al., 2014</xref>), we now have structures of two distantly related dynein MTBDs both on and off the microtubule. In both the cytoplasmic dynein-1 and DNAH7 MTBDs, the predominant change is the position of H1, suggesting this is a conserved mechanism for controlling dynein binding to microtubules. However, the addition of an extended flap between H2 and H3 in DNAH7 results in important differences to cytoplasmic dynein. The flap extends the contact area with the microtubule to include four tubulin subunits, supplementing the core interaction observed in cytoplasmic dynein-1. We propose that this interaction drives large distortions in lattice curvature. We assign a second link to the adjacent protofilament to the acidic C-terminal tail of beta-tubulin binding to a pocket of positively charged residues on the top surface of the DNAH7 MTBD. The angle the stalk of DNAH7 makes relative to the microtubule is tilted in an off-axis direction compared to cytoplasmic dynein-1. It is interesting to note that many inner arm dyneins generate torque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vale and Toyoshima, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kagami and Kamiya R, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kikushima and Kamiya, 2008</xref>) and we speculate that the tilt may be one mechanism that could contribute to this.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>DNAH7-induced distortions of the microtubule</title><p>Some members of the kinesin family of microtubule motors are known to induce changes in the microtubule lattice. These include a longitudinal extension by kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peet et al., 2018</xref>) and the peeling back of single protofilaments by kinesin-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>). Both these effects are related to the longitudinal axis however, and no effects on cross-sectional curvature have been observed to date. In contrast, some microtubule-associated proteins are sensitive to the lateral curvature of the microtubule. Doublecortin (DCX) and EB3 both bind in the cleft between two adjacent protofilaments and contact four tubulin subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moores et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang and Nogales, 2015</xref>). These lateral interactions promote formation of 13-protofilament microtubules during polymerization. This promotes a rounder, more regular lattice. Therefore, DNAH7 is unusual in directly distorting the cross-sectional curvature of mature microtubules.</p><p>A number of other axonemal dyneins possess an MTBD flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B/C</xref>). In <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, the γ outer arm dynein and the a, b, c, d and e inner arm dyneins all possess an 18/19-residue loop between H2 and H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Cryo-electron tomography has mapped the position of each dynein MTBD in the axoneme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bui et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nicastro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Song et al., 2018</xref>). Microtubules in the axoneme form a doublet structure, consisting of a 13-protofilament A-tubule and a connected 10-protofilament B-tubule. The tail of axonemal dyneins dock onto the A-tubule, positioning the MTBDs to bind to an adjacent doublet B-tubule. Strikingly, the flap containing dyneins are spread along the length of the axonemal repeat but only contact two pairs of protofilaments on one side of the B-tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As such, there is one side of the B-tubule on which flap-containing dyneins act at a high local concentration. This is in contrast to our DNAH7 decorated microtubule structure, in which near-saturation binding around the entire microtubule may confound local effects of individual DNAH7 MTBD binding. The effect of dynein binding to microtubules in the axoneme may therefore result in even greater distortions than those we observed. Conversely, as our study was performed on in vitro polymerized microtubules we cannot rule out that DNAH7 binding has a different effect on axonemal doublets, where for example inner proteins may increase the microtubule stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ichikawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ichikawa et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47145.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Distribution of dyneins in the axoneme.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic view of the positions the dynein heavy chain tails dock on the A-tubule of the microtubule doublet (green) in the 96 nm axonemal repeat, based on previous structural data on <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and Sea urchin sperm flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bui et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin and Nicastro, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nicastro et al., 2006</xref>). Heavy chains are named according to the <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> nomenclature, and the human orthologues are linked.

Most models suggest that localised activation and inhibition of axonemal dyneins is needed to create the imbalance in forces across the axoneme that result in an overall bend. These models rely on communication between axonemal dyneins such that they are active or inactive at the right time. We speculate that the flap could play a role in communication. We observed higher decoration at lower lateral curvature in our classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D/E</xref>), suggesting that the DNAH7 MTBD could act as a curvature sensor in the axoneme. We note that the inner proteins maintain the local curvature of the inner arm dynein binding site at ~25°, which would favour DNAH7 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carter et al., 2008</xref>). The cross-section of microtubules is thought to flatten during bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Memet et al., 2018</xref>), in which case dynein binding would cyclically change during the axonemal beat. Alternatively, the flap-induced distortion of the microtubule could induce cooperative binding of adjacent dyneins, potentially helping a waveform spread through the cilium. Higher resolution structures of axonemal dyneins in the context of a ciliary beat will be required to test these hypotheses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein preparations</title><p>6xHis 12-heptad SRS fusion proteins were expressed in SoluBL21 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells (Invitrogen) from a pet42a vector.

Manual picking and 2D classification was performed to generate references for autopicking. Start and end coordinates of 30 microtubules from five micrographs were extracted into 82 Å segments (box size 512), resulting in ~650 particles which were classified into five classes. These were used as references for autopicking on all the micrographs, using the following parameters: mask diameter 497 Å, in-plane angular sampling 1°, lowpass references 20 Å, picking threshold 0.04, minimum inter-particle distance 79 Å, maximum stddev noise 1.4, shrink factor 0.5, helical picking, tube diameter 400 Å, helical rise 82 Å, number of asymmetrical units 1, maximum curvature 0.4. Particles were extracted (4x binned) and entered for 2D classification into 100 classes. Classes were rejected if they were obviously not microtubules (carbon, ice etc), if they appeared blurred or poorly aligned, if they had low levels of decoration and if they showed signs of non-13-PF architectures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

This was converted into a mask with <italic>relion_mask_create. relion_local_symmetry</italic> requires a STAR file containing the translational and rotational operators needed to move the original mask onto each successive protofilament. The psi angle, rotating around the microtubule long axis, is given as multiples of −27.69° (360°/13). The centre of rotation is the centre of the microtubule lumen, so the only translation needed is the rise between adjacent protofilaments. For a three-start helix, there is a rise of 1.5 dimers through 360°. The refined helical rise between dimers in the same protofilament as measured by Relion was 82.29 Å. As such, the _rlnOriginZ parameter increases by multiples of 9.495 Å (82.293 * 1.5/13). Local symmetry was applied during refinement with the additional argument --local_symmetry. Following completion of refinement, local symmetry was applied to both unfiltered half maps.

Local symmetry operators were found for the resulting map with the search command in <italic>relion_localsym</italic> (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion/index.php?title=Local_symmetry">https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion/index.php?title=Local_symmetry</ext-link>). The seam was less well defined in the DNAH7 structure, presumably due to local curvature being a stronger feature than seam position in some particles during refinement. As a result, three seam-adjacent profilaments were not included for symmetrisation.</p><p>For DNAH7 MTBD sub-classification, signal subtraction was performed on the refined DNAH7 structure. Using the refined DNAH7 model to make a mask, everything but one MTBD and the two tubulin dimers it contacts was subtracted from the raw particles. This was performed for two protofilament pairs (6/7 and 8/9). These particles were subjected to masked 3D classification without alignments (15 classes, T = 100, 25 iterations, limit resolution E-step to 15 Å). For classes A and B, another 3D classification (eight classes, T = 20, 25 iterations, 0.9° local angular searches) was performed with the original unsubtracted particles.</p><p>The EB3 dataset was downloaded from EMPIAR (ID 10030) and processed as for the dynein MTBD with modifications. 3D classification was skipped since the microtubules in this dataset almost exclusively have 13 protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang and Nogales, 2015</xref>). EB3 does not bind across the seam, which means that applying regular 13-fold symmetry was not appropriate. A separate mask was created for the tubulin and EB3 densities. The tubulin mask and EB3 masks were applied with 13- and 12-fold symmetry, respectively.</p><p>Local resolution estimation was performed in <italic>relion_postprocess</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Model building</title><p>For cytoplasmic dynein 1 a low-affinity crystal structure (PDB 3ERR) was used as the starting model for refinement. For human DNAH7, a sequence alignment to <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> flagellar dynein c was used to generate a homology model to the low-affinity NMR structure (PDB 2RR7) in Modeller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sali and Blundell, 1993</xref>). The homology model was used as an initial model. The models were fit in their respective maps using Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). A tubulin dimer was also docked in to the density using PDB 5SYF (for SRS<sup>+</sup>-DNAH7<sub>2758-2896</sub> the tubulin dimer being contacted by the flap was added as well). Coot Real Space refine zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>) was used to manually fit the model to the density, followed by whole model refinement using Refmac5 in the CCP-EM suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brown et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burnley et al., 2017</xref>). These two steps were performed iteratively until the model to map measures were maximised. For model to map FSC curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), phenix.mtriage was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). All model visualisations were performed in Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moores et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of microtubule distortion</title><p>Protofilament angles were measured by docking a tubulin dimer pdb model (5SYF) into two adjacent protofilaments of the relevant reconstruction in Chimera. The relative rotation was measured with the ‘measure rotation’ command. Ellipticity was measured with the Matlab fit_ellipse script deposited in the Mathworks file exchange (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3215-fit_ellipse">https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3215-fit_ellipse</ext-link><underline>)</underline>. x,y coordinates for each protofilament were obtained from maximum intensity projections of each class, binarised with the same threshold in FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). The centre of mass of each protofilament was used as the coordinate. Decoration level was determined by the volume of the zoned MTBD density in chimera at set thresholds.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by the MRC-LMB EM facility.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal his identity: Richard J McKenney (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>From the Reviewing Editor:</p><p>All three reviewers have easily reached a consensus on your work. We would like to accept it for publication after just minor changes are made. While a few experiments were mentioned in our reviews, we do not feel that any of them are required for publication. We ask only that you address all comments that can be addressed in the text. In particular toning down statements related to (1) the universality of the mechanism of microtubule binding because the axonemal dynein was linked to a cytoplasmic dynein stalk, and (2) the deformations of the microtubule because these experiments were not done on axonemal microtubules. All other suggestions or questions that can be dealt with in the text should also be addressed. I have included the full reviews from each reviewer below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Cytoplasmic dynein-1 traffics organelles and other cargos in the cytoplasm, while axonemal dyneins generate movement of flagella. Lacey et al. report the near-atomic resolution structures of the microtubule binding domain (MTBD) of cytoplasmic dynein-1 and an axonemal dynein, DNAH7. They solved both structures using new cryo-electron microscopy analysis methods implemented in Relion. These methods should be simpler for other labs to use compared to previous methods for solving helical structures. There are two main finding from this work. First, an updated model of cytoplasmic dynein-1's MTBD is presented. A previous structure obtained by combining lower resolution cryo-EM and molecular dynamics showed multiple rearrangements in the MTBD upon contact with the microtubule. Of these, only the movement of helix 1 is seen in the new high-resolution structure. Importantly, Lacey et al. report the helix 1 movement in both a construct containing a short region of anti-parallel coiled coil linked to the MTBD and in the context of a construct comprising the entire motor domain of cytoplasmic dynein-1. Second, they present the first high-resolution structure of an axonemal dynein MTBD bound to microtubules. This structure showed a similar overall mechanism of microtubule binding, a movement of helix 1, when compared to cytoplasmic dynein-1. An extension, or &quot;flap&quot;, that had been observed in a solution structure of another axonemal dynein was also observed and found to interact with the neighboring microtubule protofilament. In what is arguably the most interesting finding in this paper, the authors observe distortions in the microtubule when the DNAH7 MTBD is bound to microtubules and discuss how this might relate to flagellar beating.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) DNAH7 has low microtubule binding affinity with its own coiled-coil stalk, but high microtubule binding affinity when linked to the coiled-coil stalk of cytoplasmic dynein-1. There are at least two possible explanations for this. First, the dynein-1 stalk is better at stabilizing the high affinity state of the MTBD without a qualitative change in the MTBD's native conformations. Second, there could be more significant changes induced by the dynein-1 stalk compared to a native DNAH7 stalk, leading to artificially similar structures. Absent additional data, the authors should tone down the statement about universal conservation of the mechanism of microtubule binding.</p><p>2) For Figure 2B and D, I found it confusing that H1 wasn't represented in the stick model. It could be shown behind H3 in the darker pink color. The statement in the legend &quot;as visible in the model&quot; could be misinterpreted as meaning that other elements were not seen in the structures.</p><p>3) For Figure 3D, it would help the reader if each α and β tubulin density were colored in the two tones of green and labeled α and β.</p><p>4) In Figure 5A, why are the labels for DNA9, 11, and 17 in orange?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Lacey and his colleagues analyzed 3D structure of cytoplasmic and axonemal dynein microtubule-binding domains (MTBDs) binding to the microtubule, using cryo-EM technique. They carefully analyzed complex structure of MT-MTBD at unprecedented high resolution and updated the previous knowledge. They also proved that their new high resolution structure corresponds to the native dynein binding to MT.</p><p>They examined alternative binding of axonemal dynein, compared to cytoplasmic dynein, which proved that MTBD of axonemal dynein has contact to four tubulins (cytoplasmic dynein has only two contacts) and overall angle of binding is ~7degrees rotated. Moreover, they found a clue of flexible C-terminal of β-tubulin reoriented and fixed upon binding of axonemal dynein.</p><p>Another interesting finding is that binding of axonemal dynein MTBD induces distortion of MT lattice structure, making it rather elliptic instead of cylindrical.</p><p>Overall the new facts they provided by their high resolution cryo-EM study are landmark to characterize this important motor protein and will activate further research in this field. The results are presented beautifully in the graphical figures and methods are explained clearly. Considering the wealth of their findings, this manuscript deserves publication in any high journal and this reviewer enthusiastically recommends it for <italic>eLife</italic> after revising of the manuscript under the following viewpoints.</p><p>Title: Flap binding to the adjacent PF is an excellent discovery in this work. This reviewer would like to have it in the title, while the current title mentions only its influence on the MT lattice structure. Maybe &quot;Axonemal dynein MTBD binds to 4 tubulins and distort MT structures&quot; or &quot;High resolution cryo-EM structure of axonemal dynein and MT revealed molecular mechanism of MTBD binding and its influence on MT lattice&quot; will be suitable.</p><p>Subsection “Structural determination of cytoplasmic dynein-1 MTBD decorating microtubules”: This reviewer could not understand this sentence and cited figure panels. What &quot;extension&quot; does it mean? Does it mean that the tubulin core stretches? Or does it indicate any extended structure (like S9-S10 loop mentioned in Figure 1—figure supplement 1E) (if so, please indicate it in the Figure 1—figure supplement 2A)? Or is it phase extension to improve resolution – in this case it should read &quot;from 4.4A to 3.6A resolution&quot;? Please clarify this.</p><p>CTF panels such as Figure 1D should be improved. The letters in the footnote are too small and are hard to read.</p><p>Dynein c generates torque during in vitro motility assay, according to Oiwa's work, while another dynein (probably dynein f) is now to drive MT straightly. How is it interpreted to be linked with the unique interface between DNAH7 and tubulin?</p><p>Does 3D classification (of axonemal dynein and its MTBD, especially) show any sign of structural heterogeneity, for example detached flap from the adjacent PF?</p><p>Their finding may suggest that the energy landscape is more stable with elliptic MT upon binding of axonemal dyneins. Elliptic shape of B-tubule was reported in Maheshwari et al., (2015) Structure and Ichikawa et al., (2017). Is the orientation of MT flattening caused by dynein-binding consistent with the flattening of B-tubule?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Lacey et al., reports high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the microtubule binding domains from cytoplasmic and axonemal dynein motors bound to microtubules. In order to accomplish this, the authors have developed novel image processing routines to aid in solving the structures of proteins bound to the microtubule lattice, providing a new tool for the structural biology community. While the structures of these dynein MTBDs have been examined previously, this is the first study to elucidate their structures bound to microtubules. The authors find substantial differences in the structural movements of the cytoplasmic dynein MTBD from that reported previously in Redwine et al., a study that relied on much lower resolution cryo structures and molecular dynamics simulations. Thus, this study provides an updated model for how the dynein MTBD binds MTs during the motor's mechanochemical cycle.</p><p>Maybe more interestingly, the authors find that an insert in the axonemal MTBD makes a distinct contact with the neighboring protofilament in the MT, and also observe a likely interaction between the B-tubulin C-terminal tail and an acidic patch on the dynein MTBD. They go on to show that the binding of this MTBD distorts the MT lattice, possibly thorough this alternative binding interface via the MTBD flap insert. They show that the axonemal MTBD prefers to bind to MTs at regions of low protofilament curvature, possibly providing an explanation for how axonemal dyneins sense curvature during flagellar beating. The final observation is very interesting; that the axonemal dyneins containing the flap insert are all closely spaced within the axonemal repeat structure, and thus all of them make contact with only a small subset of protofilaments on the B2 doublet.</p><p>Overall, I think this is an outstanding paper, of very high interest in both biological insight and technological advance. I am not qualified to review the details of their cryo-EM algorithms, so I will take the author's word for the quality of the new technique. I find the biological insights to be stimulating, and think they open up very interesting new questions about the role of distinct axonemal dynein classes in flagellar movement.</p><p>The only concern I have is that the MT distortion is observed on reconstituted MTs made from brain tubulin, an unnatural lattice for the axonemal MTBD. Since the natural lattice for this domain is the B1 doublet, how can we be sure the distortion observed is not an artifact of using single MTs? The authors should probably mention this caveat. Additionally, the authors make a fairly convincing argument that the flap binding to a neighboring protofilament is what may cause the lattice distortion. A formal test of this hypothesis would make the manuscript stronger. Mutation or deletion of the flap region could be done to examine if this restores the MT lattice to its original shape.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47145.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Essential revisions:</p><p>1) DNAH7 has low microtubule binding affinity with its own coiled-coil stalk, but high microtubule binding affinity when linked to the coiled-coil stalk of cytoplasmic dynein-1.

In <italic>Chlamydomonas,</italic> dynein a, c, d, e and g all rotate microtubules in vitro. This is thought to fine-tune the ciliary beat into a specific defined waveform.</p><p>It was recently shown that the direction in which the linker swings relative to the microtubule controls dynein’s trajectory (Can et al., 2019). For example, an engineered dynein in which the linker swing is ~10° off-axis results in helical motility with a pitch angle of ~10°. It is possible that the ~7° tilt of the DNAH7 MTBD on the microtubule could orient the linker swing off-axis and lead to torque generation. However, it is also possible that other mechanisms are responsible, such as the presence of a proline residue in CC1 which may create a bend in the stalk (Hirose, 2012). We briefly add a note reflecting this to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does 3D classification (of axonemal dynein and its MTBD, especially) show any sign of structural heterogeneity, for example detached flap from the adjacent PF?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we performed 3D sub-classification on the DNAH7 MTBD to look for heterogeneity. To do this, we used signal subtraction to remove everything except the MTBD and the two tubulin dimers it contacts. To investigate variability in different regions of the structure, we did this once for the most curved pair of protofilaments and once for the least curved pair. We then performed 3D classification without alignments on each of the two regions.</p><p>The flap was always visible in decorated classes, and generally appeared to form the same conformation. However, we were able to measure the local curvature and decoration intensity in each of our classes. When plotting these two variables against each other, we see a strong correlation between high decoration and low curvature angles. We have included these results as a new Figure 5, with accompanying text in subsection “DNAH7 binding to microtubules induces changes in microtubule cross section”. We feel that these results provide further evidence for the link between DNAH7 binding and microtubule flattening, and thus strengthen the arguments made in the manuscript. The pre-existing Figure 5 is now Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Their finding may suggest that the energy landscape is more stable with elliptic MT upon binding of axonemal dyneins. Elliptic shape of B-tubule was reported in Maheshwari et al., (2015) Structure and Ichikawa et al., (2017). Is the orientation of MT flattening caused by dynein-binding consistent with the flattening of B-tubule?</p></disp-quote><p>Our results suggest that DNAH7 prefers binding to local curvatures flatter than those seen in 13-protofilament microtubules (i.e. &lt;27.7°). In the isolated axonemal doublet structure reported by (Ichikawa et al., 2017), the local curvature at the DNAH7 binding site (B-tubule protofilaments 9/10) is ~25°. This would be consistent with the B-tubule being optimized for binding however, it would be interesting to see how this curvature manifests in the context of the axoneme with its full array of binding partners and as it bends.</p><p>We now make note of this in the Discussion section, saying “We note that the inner proteins maintain the local curvature of the inner arm dynein binding site at ~25°, which would favour DNAH7 binding (Ichikawa et al., 2017).”</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Overall, I think this is an outstanding paper, of very high interest in both biological insight and technological advance. I am not qualified to review the details of their cryo-EM algorithms, so I will take the author's word for the quality of the new technique. I find the biological insights to be stimulating, and think they open up very interesting new questions about the role of distinct axonemal dynein classes in flagellar movement.</p><p>The only concern I have is that the MT distortion is observed on reconstituted MTs made from brain tubulin, an unnatural lattice for the axonemal MTBD. Since the natural lattice for this domain is the B1 doublet, how can we be sure the distortion observed is not an artifact of using single MTs? The authors should probably mention this caveat. Additionally, the authors make a fairly convincing argument that the flap binding to a neighboring protofilament is what may cause the lattice distortion. A formal test of this hypothesis would make the manuscript stronger. Mutation or deletion of the flap region could be done to examine if this restores the MT lattice to its original shape.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comments that the differences between the microtubule doublet and in vitro polymerized microtubules means that the in vivo effect of DNAH7 is potentially different to what is observed in our structure. To reflect this, we have added the sentence to our Discussion section:</p><p>“Conversely, as our study was performed on in vitro polymerized microtubules, we cannot rule out that DNAH7 binding has a different effect on axonemal doublets, where for example inner proteins may increase the microtubule stiffness (Ichikawa et al., 2017, 2019).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
