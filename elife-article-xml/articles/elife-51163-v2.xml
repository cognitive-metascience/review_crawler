family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. The prototypic CRLs in yeast, called SCF enzymes, employ a single E2 enzyme, Cdc34, to build poly-ubiquitin chains required for degradation. In contrast, six different human E2 and E3 enzyme activities, including Cdc34 orthologs UBE2R1 and UBE2R2, appear to mediate SCF-catalyzed substrate polyubiquitylation in vitro. The combinatorial interplay of these enzymes raises questions about genetic buffering of SCFs in human cells and challenges the dogma that E3s alone determine substrate specificity. To enable the quantitative comparisons of SCF-dependent ubiquitylation reactions with physiological enzyme concentrations, mass spectrometry was employed to estimate E2 and E3 levels in cells. In combination with UBE2R1/2, the E2 UBE2D3 and the E3 ARIH1 both promoted SCF-mediated polyubiquitylation in a substrate-specific fashion. Unexpectedly, UBE2R2 alone had negligible ubiquitylation activity at physiological concentrations and the ablation of UBE2R1/2 had no effect on the stability of SCF substrates in cells. A genome-wide CRISPR screen revealed that an additional E2 enzyme, UBE2G1, buffers against the loss of UBE2R1/2. UBE2G1 had robust in vitro chain extension activity with SCF, and UBE2G1 knockdown in cells lacking UBE2R1/2 resulted in stabilization of the SCF substrates p27 and CYCLIN E as well as the CUL2-RING ligase substrate HIF1α. The results demonstrate the human SCF enzyme system is diversified by association with multiple catalytic enzyme partners.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are the molecules that perform most of the tasks that keep cells alive, but often they need to be removed. If human cells lose control over protein degradation it can result in diseases such as cancer or neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p>The enzymes responsible for tagging proteins for destruction are called ubiquitin ligases. Drugs that hijack ubiquitin ligases to tag disease-causing proteins have been successfully used to treat a cancer called multiple myeloma. Encouragingly, human cells have over 600 ubiquitin ligases and most have not yet been tested as therapeutic targets. A clear understanding of how these enzymes work in human cells could therefore lead to new therapies for conditions such as cancer.</p><p>To tag a protein for degradation, ubiquitin ligases transfer a small protein (ubiquitin) from a ubiquitin-carrying enzyme to the target protein. In yeast, this process is relatively simple, since in many cases there is a one-to-one relationship between each ubiquitin ligase and its ubiquitin-carrying enzyme partner. In human cells, on the other hand, the process seems to be more complex. The biggest family of ubiquitin ligases in humans is the cullin-RING ligase family, and the number of partner ubiquitin-carrying enzymes for this family remains unknown, as are the effects of different interactions between members of the family and different ubiquitin-carrying enzymes.</p><p>Now, Hill et al. have used biochemical assays to measure the activities of four ubiquitin-carrying enzymes that partner with cullin-RING ligases. They found that while certain proteins can be tagged for degradation by different combinations of the cullin-RING ligases and the ubiquitin-carrying enzymes, others display preferences for specific ubiquitin-modifying enzymes partnering up. The experiments also revealed that one of the ubiquitin-carrying enzymes tested was active at high concentrations, but could not tag proteins when assayed at concentrations closer to those found in the cell. Finally, Hill et al. genetically removed two of the ubiquitin-carrying enzymes and showed that, unlike in yeast, a third ubiquitin-carrying enzyme could compensate for their loss, a redundancy that makes the system robust.</p><p>These results show that the human cullin-RING ligases can interact with multiple ubiquitin-carrying enzyme partners. Controlled protein degradation affects every major activity in human cells, and a good understanding of the mechanisms that regulate this process can help researchers better understand many biological processes. Additionally, these findings are relevant to the development of therapies trying to use ubiquitin ligases to remove faulty proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), ubiquitin ligases (E3s) bind to protein substrates to direct poly-ubiquitin chain formation and degradation by the 26S proteasome. There are at least 600 E3s in the mammalian proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009</xref>), and alterations of the expression levels in several E3s or their substrates have been clinically and biochemically linked to cancer and other diseases in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Skaar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2014b</xref>). E3 enzymes recruit both the protein substrate as well as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) thioesterified to the protein modifier ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kleiger and Mayor, 2014</xref>). E3s promote the covalent modification of a lysine residue on the E3-bound substrate, in most cases by direct transfer of the ubiquitin moiety from E2 to substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berndsen and Wolberger, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Metzger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vittal et al., 2015</xref>). A chain of at least four ubiquitins is typically required for recognition by the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thrower, 2000</xref>). Despite much progress, the different roles of E2s and E3s in cells remain enigmatic due to a lack of kinetics, a lack of knowledge of potentially relevant concentrations, and an understanding of how different E2-E3 combinations may regulate substrate polyubiquitylation.</p><p>Some E2s can link ubiquitin directly to substrate in a priming step, whereas other E2s are dedicated to subsequent cycles of poly-ubiquitin chain extension. Yet other E2s are competent at both priming and chain extension. However, these properties may change dramatically as a function of E2 levels, in particular at the high E2 concentrations typically used in in vitro reconstituted ubiquitylation reactions. Although E2s are clearly harnessed by E3s to transfer ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pickart and Rose, 1985</xref>), the potential combinatorial complexity is overwhelming because many E3s appear to collaborate with multiple E2s to promote substrate ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Christensen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rodrigo-Brenni and Morgan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wickliffe et al., 2011</xref>). Defining the roles of particular enzymes and enzyme combinations remains an as yet unmet challenge in understanding how the UPS controls cellular function.</p><p>The Skp1-cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligases are a case study for the combinatorial interplay of E2s during substrate ubiquitylation. SCFs are modular multi-subunit complexes that all contain a common cullin 1 (CUL1) core subunit and a ‘really interesting new gene’ (RING) domain RBX1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harper and Tan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lydeard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zimmerman et al., 2010</xref>). CUL1 acts as a scaffold that tethers substrate binding subunits to the E2-binding subunit: the C-terminal segment of CUL1 binds to the RING subunit, which in turn recruits the ubiquitin-charged E2, while the N-terminal segment of CUL1 binds to adaptors called F-box proteins that recruit substrates. SCFs are the archetypal member of the Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), which collectively account for at least 200 of the known E3s in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lydeard et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The original elucidation of Skp1-cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase function by genetic and biochemical studies in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> suggested that Cdc34 is the only E2 enzyme needed for SCF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feldman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schwob et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Skowyra et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Verma et al., 1997</xref>). In human cells, an understanding of the relationship between E2s and SCF function has been confounded by the large repertoire of ubiquitin-modifying enzymes associated with SCF complexes. While the yeast E2s Ubc4/5 do not support SCF activity in vitro, several human SCF ubiquitylation reactions have been reconstituted with the corresponding human E2 orthologs UBE2D1/2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sakata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2000</xref>). A ‘hand-off’ model has been proposed where UBE2D3 transfers the first ubiquitin to an SCF-bound substrate, followed by poly-ubiquitin chain elongation catalyzed by the human CDC34 ortholog UBE2R1 or its highly related isoform UBE2R2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). More recently, the E3 enzyme ARIH1 was shown to function with multiple CRLs in a manner similar to UBE2D3 in both humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scott et al., 2016</xref>) as well as in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dove et al., 2017</xref>). Despite the apparent requirement for UBE2D1/2/3 or ARIH1 to initiate a poly-ubiquitin chain on human substrates, UBE2R1/2 are capable of both priming and poly-ubiquitin chain extension on milli-second time scales in in vitro ubiquitylation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kleiger et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pierce et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saha and Deshaies, 2008</xref>). The relative importance of these various mechanisms in human SCF-mediated poly-ubiquitin chain formation on substrates has yet to be addressed.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the role of the different chain initiating and elongating enzymes implicated in human SCF function. We use single reaction monitoring mass spectrometry to estimate physiological E2 and E3 concentrations in cells, quench flow-based rapid kinetics to analyze the contributions of different enzymes to in vitro reconstituted reactions, and genetic analysis to uncover functional redundancies between different SCF-associated factors. These results uncover three main principles. First, some substrates and/or substrate receptors appear selective for a particular ubiquitin-modifying enzyme even when assayed at physiological concentrations, whereas others are more promiscuously ubiquitylated by different ubiquitin-modifying enzymes. Second, the rates of ubiquitylation can depend dramatically on enzyme concentrations. In particular, UBE2R2 activity is robust when levels are sufficient to saturate the SCF-substrate complex, but virtually undetectable when assayed at physiological levels. Finally, unlike in yeast, human SCF activity appears to be highly buffered such that the loss of any single SCF-associated E2 or E3 is compensated for by redundant factors. We uncover a redundant role for the E2 enzyme UBE2G1 that explains why loss of both UBE2R1 and UBE2R2 can be tolerated by cells. Collectively these results illuminate how the SCF regulatory system has been diversified through evolution and how this diversification has been exploited to allow differential substrate ubiquitylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intracellular concentrations of SCF-associated enzymes</title><p>We sought to resolve how multiple ubiquitin priming and poly-ubiquitin elongating enzymes collaborate with human SCF ubiquitin ligases by measuring the individual rates of poly-ubiquitin chain priming and elongation using pre-steady state kinetic measurements with different combinations of SCF-associated enzymes. To accomplish this goal, we employed two well-characterized and biologically important SCF complexes based on the βTRCP substrate receptor (SCF<sup>βTRCP</sup>) and the FBW7 substrate receptor (SCF<sup>FBW7</sup>; for more details, please see Appendix 1).</p><p>A critical parameter for measurement of the kinetics of in vitro reconstituted reactions is the concentrations for both ubiquitin chain initiator and elongator E2s and E3s needed to saturate the E3–substrate complex and thereby promote maximal rates of ubiquitin transfer to the substrate.

Taken together, these results demonstrated that ARIH1 rapidly initiates a poly-ubiquitin chain on SCF-bound substrates and is capable of modest chain extension prior to product dissociation, even at ARIH1 levels that reflected intracellular concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>UBE2D3-catalyzed SCF reactions exhibit pronounced specificity for substrate and/or the SCF substrate receptor</title><p>The rates of chain initiation and elongation were measured next for UBE2D3.

However, when 10 μM UBE2D3 was assayed with β-Catenin peptide and SCF<sup>βTRCP</sup>, the rate of chain initiation (5 sec<sup>−1</sup>) was far more rapid than with Cyclin E peptide and SCF<sup>FBW7</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Reduction of the concentration of UBE2D3 by approximately 3-fold to physiological levels had a negligible effect on the rate of chain initiation.

Thus, in contrast with ARIH1, UBE2D3 activity is sensitive to either the identity of the substrate and/or the SCF substrate receptor.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Physiological levels of UBE2R1/2 are too low to achieve substrate priming</title><p>When saturating levels (10 μM) of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2R2 was assayed with both SCF<sup>FBW7</sup> and Cyclin E peptide or with SCF<sup>βTRCP</sup> with β-Catenin peptide, the rates of chain initiation were highly similar (0.1 sec<sup>−1</sup>–0.2 sec<sup>−1</sup>, respectively) and comparable to the rates generated by ARIH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Consistent with prior results, the rate of the second ubiquitin transfer was far more rapid for both substrates and SCF complexes (40 sec<sup>−1</sup> and 30 sec<sup>−1</sup> to mono-ubiquitylated Cyclin E and β-Catenin peptides, respectively). The rates of the third ubiquitin transfers to SCF-bound substrates were also rapid, resulting in very long poly-ubiquitin chains on products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), a hallmark of UBE2R1/2-catalyzed ubiquitylation reactions.</p><p>While reactions containing saturating UBE2R2 for SCF added impressively long poly-ubiquitin chains onto substrate, reduction of the UBE2R2 levels by 20-fold to mimic cellular conditions resulted in the near elimination of any product for both Cyclin E and β-Catenin peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Indeed, product levels were so low that we were unable to estimate the rate of poly-ubiquitin chain initiation for either substrate. This result strongly suggested that UBE2R1/2 are incapable of mediating substrate ubiquitylation in vivo without the assistance of other SCF-associated enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Initiation and elongation enzyme mixtures improve reaction kinetics</title><p>We then compared the rates of chain initiation and elongation for reactions containing initiator E2 or E3 in combination with UBE2R2. Ubiquitylation reactions containing both saturating ARIH1 (2.5 μM) and UBE2R2 (10 μM) for SCF<sup>FBW7</sup> were performed in the presence of Cyclin E peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6a,b</xref>).

Reduction of both ARIH1 (0.36 μM) and UBE2R2 (0.5 μM) to more physiological levels did not affect the rate of chain initiation, but the rate of chain elongation was greatly reduced when compared to the reaction containing saturating UBE2R2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Similar trends in the rates as well as the effects on poly-ubiquitin chain lengths were observed for β-Catenin peptide and SCF<sup>βTRCP</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). Nevertheless, the rates of chain elongation for ARIH1 in the presence of UBE2R2 were significantly faster than for reactions containing ARIH1 alone, resulting in substrates modified with poly-ubiquitin chains that were substantially longer than those formed by ARIH1 in the absence of UBE2R2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). These results suggested that while ARIH1 can provide the initiator ubiquitin for subsequent elongation by UBE2R1/2, it also acts as a competitor for the elongation cycles in in vitro ubiquitylated reactions.</p><p>The rates of chain initiation and elongation were then determined for analogous reactions containing both 10 μM UBE2D3 and UBE2R2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplements 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">9</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). While the rates of ubiquitin chain initiation were comparable to those from reactions containing UBE2D3 alone, the rates of the second ubiquitin transfer to substrate were suppressed compared to reactions containing UBE2R2 alone, in particular for reactions with β-Catenin peptide and SCF<sup>βTRCP</sup> (0.9 sec<sup>−1</sup> versus 30 sec<sup>−1</sup>, respectively). Reduction of the levels of both UBE2D3 (3.7 μM) and UBE2R2 (0.5 μM) further slowed the rates of chain elongation; however, long poly-ubiquitin chains were still observed on substrates, especially β-Catenin peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These results suggested that, like ARIH1, UBE2D3 also acts as a competitor for chain elongation by UBE2R1/2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Physiological concentrations appear optimized for substrate ubiquitylation</title><p>Considering that the average estimated physiological concentrations for ARIH1, UBE2D3, and UBE2R1/2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) were all quite close to the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values of these enzymes for SCF (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), we reasoned that relatively subtle changes in ARIH1, UBE2D3, and UBE2R1/2 levels may result in substantial differences in both the fraction of substrate converted into ubiquitylated product as well as the lengths of the poly-ubiquitin chains. To test for this, single encounter ubiquitylation reactions were assembled with SCF<sup>FBW7</sup>, Cyclin E peptide, and where ARIH1, UBE2D3, and UBE2R2 levels were assayed either up to four times higher or lower than their estimated physiological concentrations.</p><p>Very little product was observed for any of the reactions when the enzyme levels were assayed at either one-fourth or one-half the estimated cellular concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Substantial mono-ubiquitylation of Cyclin E peptide occurred for both ARIH1 and UBE2D3 when assayed at the estimated physiological concentrations, and introduction of UBE2R2 to these reactions also resulted in the formation of poly-ubiquitin chains onto product containing four or more ubiquitins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Increasing ARIH1 levels to either twice or four times the estimated cellular concentration resulted in both increased conversion of substrate to product containing at least one ubiquitin, as well as substantial poly-ubiquitin chains on product (up to five ubiquitins in the latter case). Increasing UBE2D3 levels also resulted in greater product formation, although to a lesser extent than for ARIH1. The UBE2D3 product was also primarily mono-ubiquitylated. Increasing the UBE2R2 concentration also led to some product formation, all containing very long poly-ubiquitin chains. Finally, combining either ARIH1 or UBE2D3 with UBE2R2 and assaying at levels two or four times greater than the estimated physiological levels resulted in greater amounts of product containing much longer poly-ubiquitin chains. Thus, subtle changes in the concentrations of ARIH1, UBE2D3, and UBE2R2 led to significant changes in both the amount of substrate converted to product as well as the lengths of the poly-ubiquitin chains on the product.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Altered ARIH1, UBE2D3, and/or UBE2R2 levels result in substantial differences in both the fraction of substrate converted to product as well as the average number of ubiquitins in poly-ubiquitin chains.</title><p>Single-encounter ubiquitylation reactions were initiated with either ARIH1, UBE2D3, or UBE2R2 alone or relevant combinations at estimated cellular levels (middle panel).

Maximal chain elongation on substrate was observed only when ARIH1 or UBE2D3 were assayed in the presence of UBE2G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c,d</xref>). Finally, the pre-steady state kinetics of UBE2G1-catalyzed ubiquitin transfer to the Cyclin E peptide yielded rates of ubiquitin transfer of 1 ± 0.1 sec<sup>−1</sup> under conditions where UBE2G1 levels were sufficient to saturate SCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1d</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).

Thus, while UBE2R2 is far more efficient during catalysis of ubiquitin transfer to substrate on SCF, UBE2G1 activity is nevertheless sufficient to poly-ubiquitylate substrates that have been primed by either UBE2D1/2/3 or ARIH1. Collectively, these results demonstrated that UBE2G1 can act as a dedicated elongation E2 for SCF complexes, and thereby buffer cells against the loss of UBE2R1 and UBE2R2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our studies using in vitro enzyme kinetics and genetic approaches have uncovered new complexities in the mechanism of poly-ubiquitin chain initiation and elongation by human SCF ubiquitin ligases. First, comparison of the ARIH1- or UBE2D3-catalyzed ubiquitin chain initiation demonstrates that the rates are not substantially affected by enzyme concentrations that range from physiological to saturating levels. Second, while the rates of ubiquitin chain initiation by UBE2R2 when saturating for SCF are comparable to those of ARIH1 and UBE2D3, at physiological levels UBE2R2 clearly cannot support ubiquitin chain initiation or ubiquitylated product formation. Third, the rate of chain initiation by UBE2D3 for β-Catenin peptide and SCF<sup>βTRCP</sup> is some 50-fold faster than for reactions containing SCF<sup>FBW7</sup> and Cyclin E peptide, indicating that UBE2D3 has a strong preference for some substrates and/or substrate receptors. Finally, UBE2R1/2 function is genetically buffered by UBE2G1, such that loss of UBE2R1/2 does not cause overt proliferation defects in cell line models, whereas the simultaneous loss of all three E2s leads to inviability. Consistently, UBE2G1 supports chain elongation activity against primed mono-ubiquitylated substrates in vitro.</p><p>Our results suggest that human SCF-catalyzed substrate ubiquitylation has evolved additional regulatory layers compared to the simpler yeast SCF system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Cdc34 appears both necessary and sufficient for SCF function since Ubc4/5 (the UBE2D1/2/3 orthologs) have no in vitro activity with reconstituted yeast SCF and cannot compensate for the loss of <italic>CDC34</italic> in cells. While it is surprising that Cdc34 homologs UBE2R1 and UBE2R2 appear to be dispensable in human cell lines, this difference may in part be explained by the respective concentrations of Cdc34 and UBE2R1/2 in yeast versus human cells. The concentration of Cdc34 in the yeast nucleus has been estimated at approximately 10 μM and 2- to 3-fold lower in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kleiger et al., 2009a</xref>). Based on the kinetic results here, these levels would be sufficient for robust chain initiation and elongation. In contrast, UBE2R1/2 protein levels in several human cell lines are at least an order of magnitude lower than in yeast, and well-below the low micromolar value of the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> of UBE2R2 for SCF bound to an unmodified substrate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). On the other hand, the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> of UBE2R2 for SCF bound to a mono-ubiquitylated substrate is approximately 0.3 μM, similar to the physiological concentration of UBE2R1/2 in tissue culture cells, thus explaining why UBE2R1/2 is still able to promote chain elongation on primed substrate in vitro.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>SCF-catalyzed substrate ubiquitylation is extensively buffered at the initiation and elongation steps in human cells compared to the simper yeast SCF system.</title><p>UB, ubiquitin.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51163-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>A possible exception to this interpretation may be our observation that a fraction of UBE2R1 is concentrated into foci in which protein levels may be higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>), and thus potentially capable of initiating localized ubiquitylation reactions with CRL ligases. Multiple E3s contain sequence motifs that may drive the formation of membraneless organelles such as nuclear speckles and Cajal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hughes et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, the CUL3 substrate receptor SPOP forms such structures in cells in the presence of its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bouchard et al., 2018</xref>). Additional experiments are necessary to determine whether SCF or other CRLs and their substrates are co-located within UBE2R1 foci, and whether UBE2R2 or UBE2G1 also form foci.</p><p>Our genome-wide genetic screen suggests that CRL function is more buffered in human cells compared to yeast. Aside from UBE2G1, at least at the level of resolution of our screen, we detected no other significant genetic interactions with loss of UBE2R1/2, including ARIH1 and UBE2D3. This result implies that the elongation activity of ARIH1 and UBE2D3 are insufficient to compensate for the combined loss of UBE2R1/2 and UBE2G1. In contrast, conditional alleles of CDC34 exhibit many dozens of well-documented synthetic lethal interactions in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oughtred et al., 2019</xref>). We note that while the <italic>UBE2R1/2</italic> double mutant is viable in two different transformed cell lines, UBE2R1/2 function may still be essential or at least important in other cell lines. For instance, the reduction of UBE2R1 protein levels in U2OS cells resulted in partial stabilization of IKBα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2010</xref>) and UBE2R1/2 function may still be required in an organismal context, an issue that remains to be addressed.</p><p>Why did SCF-catalyzed substrate ubiquitylation evolve separate chain initiating versus elongating enzymes, and why are multiple initiators and elongating E2s necessary? One likely reason is that this separation of function affords additional opportunities to diversify the control of SCF ligase activity. For instance, since ARIH1 is active only in the presence of neddylated CRL complexes, and SCF complexes tend to be activated only when bound to substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Emberley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Enchev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fischer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pierce et al., 2013</xref>), ARIH1 activity is held in check unless it is in the presence of activated SCFs. At least in vitro, saturating levels of UBE2R1/2 have substantial activity with un-neddylated SCF, such that the ARIH1-catalyzed hand-off mechanism may prevent unwanted auto-ubiquitylation of E3s not bound to substrate. A further layer of control appears to lie at the poly-ubiquitin chain initiation step, based on E2 specificity for particular substrates and/or substrate receptors. Thus, while UBE2D3 was less efficient than ARIH1 at chain initiation onto Cyclin E peptide substrate, the rate of the first ubiquitin transfer to β-Catenin peptide (5 sec<sup>−1</sup>) was 50-fold greater than with Cyclin E peptide, and 25-fold faster than ARIH1 for the same reaction. This effect may be explained by the affinity of the E2-E3 interaction and competition between different initiating enzymes. For instance, we observed that the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> of UBE2D3 for SCF<sup>FBW7</sup> is significantly higher than for SCF<sup>βTRCP</sup>. Similarly, ARIH1 but not UBE2D3 supports in vitro ubiquitylation of CRY1 bound to SCF<sup>FbxL3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scott et al., 2016</xref>). The use of multiple E2s and initiating enzymes evidently allows more elaborate specificity across the SCF substrate repertoire.</p><p>The slower ubiquitin transfer rate of UBE2G1 compared to UBE2R1/2, and the weak elongation activity of ARIH1 and UBE2D3 may have biological relevance. For instance, delayed substrate ubiquitylation and degradation is important during mitotic exit in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rape et al., 2006</xref>) and in addition the proteasome is capable of recognizing substrates modified by different chain lengths and/or on different lysine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). Whether such effects are important for UBE2G1-mediated degradation of particular CRL substrates remains to be determined.</p><p>Finally, the combinatorial plasticity of SCF chain initiation and elongation reactions may have important practical considerations in drug discovery. Recently, bivalent small molecule ligands (variously referred to as PROTACS, IMiDs, or SNIPERs) have been developed to target non-cognate substrates to E3 enzymes, and thereby eliminate proteins that contribute to tumorigenesis and other disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paiva and Crews, 2019</xref>). This promising E3-based therapeutic approach, termed event-driven pharmacology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lai and Crews, 2017</xref>), will be enabled by a more precise understanding of E3 catalytic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scudellari, 2019</xref>). To date, bivalent or ‘molecular glue’ type ligands have been developed for several CRL complexes including scaffolds that direct neo-substrates to the CUL4<sup>CRBN</sup>, CUL4<sup>DCAF15</sup>, CUL2<sup>VHL</sup> and CUL3<sup>KEAP1</sup> enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paiva and Crews, 2019</xref>). It seems likely that particular combinations of chain initiating and elongating enzymes will preferentially modify neo-substrates in a context-specific fashion. For example, UBE2G1 has recently been shown to mediate chain elongation of neomorphic substrates that are bridged to CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> by thalidomide analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Patil et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sievers et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Many other details remain to be elucidated regarding how SCF and other CRLs function with a suite of ubiquitin-modifying enzymes. Do different combinations of ARIH1 or UBE2D3 with UBE2R1/2 or UBE2G1 produce different products that alter the kinetics of substrate degradation? What is the structural basis that underpins initiation versus elongation activities? How do the localized dynamics of E2, ARIH1 and SCF interactions in vivo relate to function? Are there yet additional E2s or E3s that can also function with CRLs under different circumstances? Answers to these questions will further our understanding of this important and fascinating enzyme system.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>HEK293T Flp-In T-Rex (293T-FiTx) HEK293T/17, HeLa, and MRC5 cells were all grown in DMEM (4.5 g/L glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mM L-Glutamine, 100 units/mL Penicillin, 100 μg/mL Streptomycin, and 10 μg/mL Ciprofloxacin in a standard tissue culture incubator with 5% carbon dioxide.

Cell cultures were harvested at day 0 (immediately post-blasticidin treatment) and day 14 for each screen.

Each sample was analyzed using RANKS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertomeu et al., 2018</xref>) with default parameters and using the non-targeting sgRNA control set that is contained in the EKO library. To control for the effects of genotype-independent fitness defects, we averaged the RANKS scores from the two control screens and subtracted these scores from those of each knockout screen. The resulting differential RANKS scores represent the genotype-specific fitness effects of the culminative gene indels in the pooled library. P-values and FDR values were estimated using a custom-generated control distribution modeling the effects of subtracting scores. RANKS scores for different replicates of a given genetic background were then averaged together. We note that <italic>UBE2G1</italic> scored as the 108<sup>th</sup> highest ranked synthetic lethal gene deletion (RANKS score = −1.9) in one of the two <italic>UBE2R2</italic> single knockout backgrounds.

It is therefore likely that <italic>UBE2R1</italic> was fully or partially deleted in a subset of cells in the <italic>UBE2R2</italic> population generated with this sgRNA, explaining why a weak genetic interaction with <italic>UBE2G1</italic> was observed.

ubiquitin-chain extending activities of ARIH1, UBE2D3, UBE2R2 and UBE2G1</title><p>For comparing the ubiquitin-conjugating activities of ARIH1, UBE2D3, UBE2R2 and UBE2G1, human SCF ligases based on the βTRCP substrate receptor (SCF<sup>βTRCP</sup>) and the FBW7 substrate receptor (SCF<sup>FBW7</sup>) were chosen for two major reasons. First, both the substrate and substrate receptors of these enzymes are of critical biological importance. For instance, the βTRCP substrate β-CATENIN functions in WNT signaling, and the impairment of this pathway has been linked to various forms of cancer as well as diabetes. Another βTRCP substrate, IKBα, is a master regulator of inflammation signaling in humans. Furthermore, βTRCP is an oncogene whose over-expression has been observed in multiple cancers. While FBW7 is itself a tumor suppressor, its substrate CYCLIN E is an oncogene, with multiple cancers displaying <italic>CYCLIN E</italic> gene amplification. Thus, a detailed mechanistic understanding for how these SCF complexes function is of clear biological and medical relevance.</p><p>Second, when performing kinetics by quench flow, one must consider the ability to mass produce recombinant proteins. For instance, consider that a single shot in the Kintek RQF-3, the instrument used for this study, consumes approximately 50 μL of liquid volume. Since the final SCF concentration is 0.5 μM in the pre-steady state reactions, it is apparent that crystallographic quantities of proteins are required for the multiple time-points and multiple comparisons that were made between the enzymes, as well as the duplicate technical replicates.

The following summarizes the main conclusions of the manuscript and how the above enzyme activities pertain to each conclusion: (1) The rates of poly-ubiquitin chain extension are faster for UBE2R2 in comparison with UBE2G1, in particular for ubiquitin transfer to a mono-ubiquitylated substrate. This conclusion is valid since each enzyme is 100% active. (2) UBE2D3 displays specificity for the substrate and/or the substrate receptor protein. This conclusion is valid since the same fraction of active enzyme was compared in both cases (i.e., only the substrate receptor and substrate peptide differ between experiments). (3) The rates of ubiquitin chain initiation in ARIH1- or UBE2D3-catalyzed reactions are not substantially affected by enzyme concentrations that range from physiological to saturating levels. This conclusion is valid because the same fractions of active E2 or E3 enzymes are compared in both cases. (4) Although the rates of ubiquitin chain initiation by saturating levels of UBE2R2 are comparable to those of ARIH1 and UBE2D3, UBE2R2 cannot support ubiquitin chain initiation or ubiquitylated product formation when present at physiological levels. Here, the comparison of the activities of UBE2R2, UBE2D3 and ARIH1 does require further clarification based on the activity of each recombinant enzyme. With regard to ubiquitin pre-loading of ARIH1, even though 65% of the UBE2L3 enzyme is charged, the kinetics were performed with a 4-fold excess of UBE2L3 compared with ARIH1 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), and the reactions performed to estimate the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value were also carried out with at least a 4-fold excess.

Consistent with increased lability of these thioester conjugates, mass spectral results showed that UBE2D3~ubiquitin and UBE2L3~ubiquitin react with DTT (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app2fig2sdata1">Appendix 2—figure 2—source data 1</xref> for a detailed summary of the species present in the E2 loading reactions and their abundances). This reactivity is clearly specific for UBE2D3 and UBE2L3, since ubiquitin~DTT was not observed in loading reactions with UBE2G1 or UBE2R2. It is therefore likely that thioester lability leads to partial loss of UBE2L3~ubiquitin and UBE2D3~ubiquitin bonds and causes underestimation of the active E2 fraction in these reactions.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Zhen-Qiang Pan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript &quot;Robust cullin-RING ligase function is established by a multiplicity of poly-ubiquitylation pathways&quot; submitted by Spencer Hill and coworkers describes an extensive study on the functional and kinetic characterization of different E2 and E3 enzymes associated with Skp1-cullin-F-box (SCF) ligases from the cullin-RING (CRL) protein family. Such ligases are modular multi-subunit complexes that catalyze the assembly of poly-ubiquitin chains on a variety of physiologically relevant substrates.</p><p>In the first part of the manuscript, the authors determined the kinetic parameters of ARIH1, UBE2D3 and UBE2R2 in collaboration with two different SCF ligases towards two different model substrates. In the second part of the manuscript, the authors studied the role of UBE2R1/2 at cellular level, showing that co-depletion of both proteins did not affect the steady state levels of three natural SCF substrates. A genome-wide CRISPR fitness screen was used by the authors to identify UBE2G1 as an additional E2 enzyme that can compensate the lack of UBE2R1/2.</p><p>The main innovation of the work is the identification and characterization of E2 UBE2G1 in E3 SCF function in vivo and in vitro. While several recent studies have identified/implicated the role of UBE2G1 in E3 CRL4 function, this work has distinguished from these publications in that it has examined the role of UBE2G1 in a broad context with all relevant partners including E2 UBE2R1/2. By providing compelling and convincing evidence at both genetic and biochemical levels, this work has helped building/advancing knowledge on UBE2G1, which emerges as an E2 enzyme of potentially exciting and important biological functions. In addition, the authors have observed unexpected substrate specificity displayed by E2 UBE2D3 in priming the mono-ubiquitination reaction. Reviewers have therefore agreed that this work contains innovative components at significant levels.</p><p>Previous studies have established the concept of staged ubiquitination (initiation/elongation) by human SCF, as well as the role of E2 UBE2D3/E3 ARIH1 in initiation and E2 UBE2R1/2 in elongation. Despite such previous knowledge, the results of this comprehensive analysis have produced significant insights because it has combined all the above known components as well as the novel addition of E2 UBE2G1. It should be added that the reaction rates analysis at millisecond scale employed in this work is elegant and timely, thereby enabling the authors to provide a more complete picture concerning SCF ubiquitination with multiple components. Therefore, this piece of work is not only a welcomed addition to the ubiquitin field, but also of general significance by informing readers of the complexity, hence the implication of multiple layers of cellular regulation, associated with ubiquitination by E3 CRL.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors used in vitro enzyme kinetics to study the mechanism of poly-ubiquitin chain initiation and elongation by human SCF ligases. They aimed to determine the kinetic constants (Km and Kcat) and the rates of substrate ubiquitylation for comparative purposes. Although such approach seems to be valid, in practice the all the E2/E3 enzymes should to be present at the same concentration of active enzyme. It is common that recombinant proteins display different relative stabilities and the percentage of active protein can vary substantially. It is suggested that the authors titrate the fraction of the active enzymes, or at least empirically demonstrate that the relevant enzymes used in the experiments display similar concentrations of active protein.</p><p>2) The biological impact of UBE2G1 in cellular ubiquitination. UBE2G2 appears to be an ortholog of yeast Ubc7 that is involved in the ERAD pathway. Little is known about UBE2G1 until recent studies (including the current work) have linked this E2 to E3 CRL function. One informative experiment to add is the determination of the impact of triple knockouts (UBE2G1/UBE2R1/UBE2R2), in comparison to double/single knockouts, on the cellular production of K48-ubiquitin chains (compared with K63 chains) by Western analysis. (Like UBE2R1/2, UBE2G1 is a K48-specific E2.) If UBE2G1/UBE2R1/UBE2R2 work with CRL in general, which is responsible for 20% of proteasomal degradation, triple knockouts are expected to cause sizable reduction of cellular K48 ubiquitin chains.</p><p>3) There are a few technical issues. First is the low number of replicates performed in the experiments and the lack of statistical analyses. All the in vitro ubiquitination reactions were performed with only two identical technical replicates. According to the authors, this yielded errors that were routinely between 10 and 20% of the estimated kinetic parameters (subsection “Biological versus technical replication”). The authors should provide statistical data to support this conclusion.</p><p>Figure 6 has two problems. The immunoblot data should be quantified. In addition, the technical quality of the IκBα assay is of concern. First, numerous previous studies have looked at IκBα degradation in response to TNFα. The half-life of this inhibitor in response to TNFα is about 5 min. It is thus unclear why the first time point is 20 min (Figure 6B) or 30 min (Figure 6D) after exposure to TNFα. Secondly, a bulk of IκBα should be converted to slow-migrating, phosphorylated forms in response to TNFα. Judging from the Western data (Figure 6B), only a small fraction of IκBα was converted to slow-migrating forms. It is thus possible that the cells used for this work may not respond to TNFα optimally. To better visualize the phosphorylated IκBα, the authors can use commercial phospho-specific antibodies. It should be added that using siRNA, Wu et al., 2010) have observed defects on IκBα degradation by Cdc34 inactivation.</p><p>Issues with Figure 8. First, the ubiquitination data on UBE2G1 shown in this figure is done with mono-ubiquitinated substrates. Thus, while it is suggested that UBE2G1 functions like UBE2R1/2 to extend ubiquitin chains (Figure 8D), it is actually unclear whether UBE2G1 can work with UBE2D3, ARIH1, or both, on un-modified substrates. Second, the immunoblot data should be quantified. In this reviewer's opinion, the most compelling evidence for a role of UBE2G1 in the SCF function is the results of the viability assay shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 2C. On the other hand, the immunoblot data (shown in Figure 8A-B) is relatively weak. In Figure 8A with triple knockouts, only G1-1 shows sizable accumulation of p27; the effects of others and combinations have smaller effects. The stabilization effect on NRF2 with triple knockouts is even less impressive (Figure 8B). The authors should have interpreted the results based on quantification.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51163.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors used in vitro enzyme kinetics to study the mechanism of poly-ubiquitin chain initiation and elongation by human SCF ligases.

Indeed, we are acutely aware of the importance of demonstrating that recombinant enzymes are active, as our numerous years of experience with recombinant E2s such as UBE2R1/2 and UBE2D3 have shown that storage conditions and freeze-thaw cycles can significantly impact enzyme activities. In particular, the Kleiger lab has invested heavily in determining conditions that maximize E2 and E3 activities (Hill et al., 2018).</p><p>To address the reviewer's concerns, we first demonstrated the overall structural integrity of our enzymes by size exclusion chromatography. The chromatograms for UBE2R2, UBE2D3, UBCH7, UBE2G1, and ARIH1 are all monodisperse (please see Appendix 2—figure 1 in the revised manuscript). Critically, peaks are not observed at retention times corresponding to the void volume that would be indicative of protein aggregation.</p><p>Next, we measured the concentrations of active enzyme by following an approach first pioneered by the Haas laboratory (Ronchi and Haas, 2012). Specifically, these authors estimated the percentage of E2 that was thioesterified to ubiquitin in the presence of E1 enzyme. Using our previously validated protocol (Pierce et al., 2009), mass spectrometry was used to estimate the intact masses of all species in an E1-dependent charging reaction including E2~ubiquitin thioester and apo E2. Encouragingly, we found that both UBE2R2 and UBE2G1 are fully loaded with ubiquitin, indicating that 100% of the protein in those preparations are active. We also found that 65% of UBE2L3 is charged, and 52% of UBE2D3 is charged in this assay. The details of these findings are now reported in Appendix 2 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We then address how these findings affect our overall main conclusions, namely:</p><p>1) The rates of poly-ubiquitin chain extension are faster for UBE2R2 in comparison with UBE2G1, in particular for ubiquitin transfer to a mono-ubiquitylated substrate. The conclusion remains valid since each enzyme is 100% active.</p><p>2) UBE2D3 displays specificity for the substrate and/or the substrate receptor protein. The conclusion remains valid since we are comparing the same fraction of active enzyme in both cases, i.e., it is the substrate receptor and peptide that differ not the E2 enzyme itself.</p><p>3) The rates of ubiquitin chain initiation in ARIH1- or UBE2D3-catalyzed reactions are not substantially affected by enzyme concentrations that range from physiological to saturating levels. The conclusion also remains valid because we compare the same fraction of active E2 or E3 enzyme in both cases.</p><p>4) While the rates of ubiquitin chain initiation by UBE2R2 when saturating for SCF are comparable to those of ARIH1 and UBE2D3, UBE2R2 clearly cannot support ubiquitin chain initiation or ubiquitylated product formation when present at physiological levels. The comparison of the activities of UBE2R2, UBE2D3 and ARIH1 does require further clarification based on the activity of each recombinant enzyme.</p><p>With regard to ARIH1 activity, even though 65% of the UBE2L3 enzyme is charged, the kinetics are performed with at least 4-fold excess of UBE2L3 compared with ARIH1 (for saturating conditions), and the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> measurements are also done with at least a 4-fold excess as well (the reaction containing the highest concentration of ARIH1). Thus, the amount of charged UBE2L3 in the reaction likely exceeds the amount of ARIH1. We acknowledge that it would be ideal to show the percentage of ubiquitin-loaded ARIH1. However, this measurement is highly complex, since ARIH1 accepts ubiquitin only in the presence of neddylated SCF, and previous studies have shown that activated ARIH1 rapidly transfers ubiquitin both to itself (for an example of this, please see Figures S5S and S5T in (Scott et al., 2016)) as well as to neddylated CUL1. While we acknowledge this shortcoming, please note that the kinetic constants that we estimated for ARIH1 are comfortingly close to the same values first reported for ARIH1 in Cell three years ago (Scott et al., 2016).</p><p>Finally, our mass spec results demonstrated that 52% of UBE2D3 was charged with ubiquitin upon quenching in 5% acetic acid. However, this does not necessarily mean that only 52% of the UBE2D3 was active in our preparation. For instance, Ronchi and Haas note that E2~ubiquitin thioester bonds may be susceptible to hydrolysis, and our experience is that UBE2D3 is notoriously susceptible in this regard. Furthermore, our mass-spec results show that UBE2D3~UB and UBE2L3~UB react with DTT (please see Appendix 2—figure 2—source data 1 for a detailed account of the species present in the E2 loading reactions and their abundances). This is clearly specific for UBE2D3 and UBE2L3, since UB~DTT is not observed in loading reactions with UBE2G1 or UBE2R2. Thus, it is highly likely that these factors lead to partial disruption of UBE2L3~UB and UBE2D3~UB bonds, and thus cause underestimation of the active E2 fraction in these reactions.</p><p>Nevertheless, to conservatively account for apparent reduction in UBE2D3, we now state in Appendix 2 that UBE2D3 activity may not be 100% , and the rates for this reaction may thus be underestimated to some extent (also, please see Introduction section in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The biological impact of UBE2G1 in cellular ubiquitination.

Gold standard antibodies that recognize K48- and K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains were purchased (originally generated by Genentech, now produced and sold by Millipore) and used to immuno-precipitate poly-ubiquitin chains from lysates prepared from control cells (clones 1, G3 and D5) and <italic>UBE2R1/2</italic> double knockout 293T cells (clones B3, E4, and A10) treated with siRNAs targeting <italic>UBE2G1</italic> expression or a non-targeting control.

Despite this apparent negative result, we believe that these data are consistent with our findings and the literature. First, additional human E2s have been found to generate K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains (e.g., UBE2G2 and UBE2K (Deol et al., 2019)). Furthermore, numerous HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases, which modify their substrates with poly-ubiquitin chains, also generate K48-linked chains (e.g., HUWE1, WWP1, E6AP, UBR5, etc. (Deol et al., 2019)). Finally, more recent studies have found that at least some E2s can form branched poly-ubiquitin chains containing linkages that are Lys 48-specific (Meyer and Rape, 2014; Swatek et al., 2019). Thus, given the broad landscape of human enzymes that generate Lys 48 linked poly-ubiquitin chains, it is not terribly surprising that the elimination of UBE2R1/2 and the reduction of UBE2G1 does not overtly affect global K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chain levels. This interpretation is also limited by the qualitative nature of the assay, which might not be able to detect modest changes in K48-linked chain abundance. We decided not to include this negative result in the revised manuscript but certainly can add the results as a supplementary figure if necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are a few technical issues.

Increases in the p27 levels are apparent for two of the double knockout cell lines (i.e., clones B3 and E4). However, testing for the statistical significance of the overall increase in p27 in the double knockout group relative to the control group yielded a p-value of 0.13 (unpaired t-test; Prism 8) and so we make no claims for this substrate.</p><p>We note that previous studies have shown p27 stabilization upon UBE2R1 knockdown by siRNA (Butz et al., 2005; Pati et al., 1999; Williams et al., 2019), which is an apparent discrepancy with our data. However, we do observe statistically significant stabilization of p27 in a related experiment where control or double knockout cells were treated with transfection reagent and non-targeting siRNA (see Figure 7A,B in the revised manuscript and our comments below). The added stress of transfection and/or non-specific RNAi treatment may contribute to the stabilization of p27.

Judging from the Western data (Figure 6B), only a small fraction of IκBα was converted to slow-migrating forms. It is thus possible that the cells used for this work may not respond to TNFα optimally. To better visualize the phosphorylated IκBα, the authors can use commercial phospho-specific antibodies. It should be added that using siRNA, Wu et al., 2010, have observed defects on IκBα degradation by Cdc34 inactivation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise valid concerns for this substrate. To address the concerns, the TNFα-induced IκBα degradation assay was repeated in duplicate experiments using three control and three <italic>UBE2R1/2</italic> double knockout cell lines. Quantitative Western blots with fluorescent secondary antibodies are shown in the revised manuscript in Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 3B (also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Importantly, the first time-points are now taken at 10 min. Although depletion of IκBα protein was observed for all but two replicates, significant differences between the control and double knockout groups were not observed.</p><p>At the reviewers' suggestion, we also attempted to source a better anti- IκBα antibody. Anti- IκBα and anti-phospho IκBα antibodies were purchased from the same manufacturer (Santa Cruz) used in the Wu et al. study referred to by the reviewers. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>, the current lots for both antibodies are poor and do not appear to even recognize IKBα protein based on molecular weight (i.e., the species observed in both blots are far from the expected 39 kDa for IκBα or 42 kDa for phosphorylated IκBα).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51163-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We did purchase an antibody from Cell Signaling Technologies (CST4814) that is considerably better than the Abcam antibody that we used previously (see bottom blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Despite this improved signal, we see little difference between the control and knockout populations. We do observe that the IκBα is chased into a slower mobility presumed phospho-form in all treatments, as to be expected.</p><p>With respect to the reviewers' concern that previous studies have reported a half-life for IκBα that is substantially shorter than observed in our assay, and that this may indicate that our cell lines are not optimally responding to TNFα, we now estimate an IκBα half-live of approximately 20 minutes for the TNFα-treated control and double knockout cell populations. This value is close to that reported in other published studies for TNFα-induced IκBα degradation (Liu et al., 2018). Nevertheless, to address the possible discrepancy with the Wu et al. study, we now note that Wu et al. observed partial stabilization of IκBα upon knockdown of CDC34A by siRNA in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript (subsection “UBE2G1 mediates SCF substrate instability in vivo and exhibits potent chain elongation activity in vitro”). As a general caveat, we also explicitly state that different cell lines may show different sensitivities and phenotypes upon ablation of UBE2R1 and UBE2R2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issues with Figure 8. First, the ubiquitination data on UBE2G1 shown in this figure is done with mono-ubiquitinated substrates. Thus, while it is suggested that UBE2G1 functions like UBE2R1/2 to extend ubiquitin chains (Figure 8D), it is actually unclear whether UBE2G1 can work with UBE2D3, ARIH1, or both, on un-modified substrates. Second, the immunoblot data should be quantified. In this reviewer's opinion, the most compelling evidence for a role of UBE2G1 in the SCF function is the results of the viability assay shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 2C. On the other hand, the immunoblot data (shown in Figure 8A-B) is relatively weak. In Figure 8A with triple knockouts, only G1-1 shows sizable accumulation of p27; the effects of others and combinations have smaller effects. The stabilization effect on NRF2 with triple knockouts is even less impressive (Figure 8B). The authors should have interpreted the results based on quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers' raise reasonable issues about Figure 8 (new Figure 7 in the revised manuscript), which we address as follows. The first point was addressed by conducting hand-off reactions with UBE2D3 or ARIH1 in the presence of UBE2G1. Encouragingly, we see substantial production of long poly-ubiquitin chains only when reactions were performed in combination with UBE2D3 or ARIH1 and UBE2G1. This result is shown in Figure 7C,D in the revised manuscript.</p><p>To address the latter concerns, all of the Western blotting has been repeated (Figure 7A), again using three control and three <italic>UBE2R1/2</italic> double knockout cell lines that had been transfected with either control or <italic>UBE2G1</italic> targeting siRNAs. The transfection of all cell lines was performed in duplicate, and quantitation is now provided for HIF1α, CYCLIN E, and p27 protein levels (Figure 7B). The results show that CYCLIN E protein levels are significantly stabilized only when comparing control cell lines treated with non-targeting siRNA and double knockout cells treated with UBE2G1-targeting siRNA. Similarly, p27 protein levels were statistically increased in the same comparison (and as noted above, we also observed significant stabilization of p27 when comparing control and double knockout cell populations treated with non-targeting siRNA). The CUL2<sup>VHL</sup> substrate HIF1α followed the same pattern as p27 (and since these results were much stronger than the previous NRF2 results, we now report HIF1α stabilities to establish the generality of our findings to other CRL complexes). These quantitative results significantly substantiate our model that UBE2G1 functions in collaboration with UBE2R1/2.</p><p>We again thank the reviewers for requesting these major revisions and new experiments, as we believe the manuscript is much stronger as a consequence.</p></body></sub-article></article>
