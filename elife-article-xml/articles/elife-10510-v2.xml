maintaining cellular proteostasis. Here we show that USP14, a major deubiquitinating enzyme that regulates the UPS, is a substrate of Akt, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase critical in mediating intracellular signaling transducer for growth factors. We report that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of USP14 at Ser432, which normally blocks its catalytic site in the inactive conformation, activates its deubiquitinating activity in vitro and in cells. We also demonstrate that phosphorylation of USP14 is critical for Akt to regulate proteasome activity and consequently global protein degradation. Since Akt can be activated by a wide range of growth factors and is under negative control by phosphoinosotide phosphatase PTEN, we suggest that regulation of UPS by Akt-mediated phosphorylation of USP14 may provide a common mechanism for growth factors to control global proteostasis and for promoting tumorigenesis in PTEN-negative cancer cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10510.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10510.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10510.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are the workhorses of cells. These molecules provide structure, transmit messages and carry out many other essential tasks. When proteins have fulfilled their purpose, or become damaged, they must be removed through a garbage disposal-like molecular machine in cells called the proteasome. A breakdown in the proteasome may lead to diseases in humans such as cancers and neurodegeneration. Cells have a system that can identify and mark proteins for destruction, and another system that counteracts this process and spares proteins from destruction. Precise regulation of these two systems helps ensure a healthy balance in cells.</p> <p>One enzyme that can spare proteins from the proteasome is called USP14. Previously, this enzyme is known to be switched on when it connects with the protein disposal machinery to control which proteins get destroyed. But, many of the USP14 enzymes in cells are not associated with this proteasome machinery and it was unclear if and how these ‘free’ enzymes might be important for the cell.</p> <p>Now, Xu et al. report a new mechanism that can switch on USP14: another enzyme called Akt can switch on USP14 by adding a phosphate group to a specific site in USP14. Akt is an important signaling molecule that is activated in many tumor cells to promote the growth and multiplication of cells. Xu et al. discovered that by controlling USP14 activity, Akt can control the activity of the protein disposal machinery that in turn regulates the levels of many other proteins. These findings suggest that abnormal activity of USP14 in tumor cells with elevated Akt activity may contribute to cancer formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10510.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10510.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>USP14</kwd><kwd>Akt</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin-proteasome-system</kwd><kwd>global proteostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AG047231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Junying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01NS082257</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Junying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Junying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01GM095526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Finley</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003621</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Global Research Laboratory Program, GRL, NRF-2010-00341</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Junying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Akt can regulate the ubiquitin-proteasome system by mediating phosphorylation and activation of USP14, which may have implications in the control of global proteostasis by growth factors and in tumorigenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS), a major degradative mechanism in eukaryotic cells, is involved in the degradation of short-lived proteins as well as misfolded and damaged proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). The 26S proteasome specifically targets and degrades proteins conjugated to ubiquitin. Regulation of protein deubiquitination by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) is recognized as an important regulatory step in the UPS. Ubiquitin-specific protease-14 (USP14), a DUB reversibly associated with the proteasome, negatively regulates the activity of proteasomes by trimming ubiquitin chains on proteasome-bound substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borodovsky et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Koulich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Purified recombinant USP14 is largely inactive and can be highly activated when in association with proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Koulich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). However, a significant fraction of USP14 is present intracellularly in a proteasome-free state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Koulich et al., 2008</xref>), and it is not clear if and how proteasome-free USP14 might serve a significant physiological function.</p><p>Akt, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase and an important intracellular signaling transducer for growth factors such as insulin, is involved in regulating cell proliferation, metabolism, transcription, migration, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Manning and Cantley, 2007</xref>). The activity of Akt is regulated by PI(3,4,5)P3, a lipid product of the phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks). The intracellular levels of PI(3,4,5)P3 are negatively regulated by phosphatases such as SHIP1/2 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). The latter, a phosphoinoside phosphatase, is encoded by a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in human cancers at high frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cantley and Neel, 1999</xref>). Akt has been reported to mediate the phosphorylation of many substrates that in turn regulate cell proliferation, metabolism, transcription, migration, and apoptosis. However, very little is known about its role in the UPS, and furthermore no mechanistic link between Akt and UPS has been elucidated.</p><p>In this study, we report that USP14 is an Akt substrate and that this phosphorylation activates the DUB activity of USP14 both in vitro and in cells. We also demonstrate that phosphorylation of USP14 is critical for Akt to control UPS and consequentially global protein degradation via the UPS. Our study reveals a novel mechanistic connection between activated Akt and the UPS through regulating of USP14 phosphorylation, which can impact global proteostasis in PTEN-negative cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phosphorylation of USP14 on Ser432 by Akt</title><p>Two forms of USP14 have been determined crystallographically: the inactive free form and an adduct between Ub-aldehyde (Ubal) and USP14, which provides insight into the catalytically active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hu et al., 2005</xref>). The key difference between these two structures is in the position of the blocking loops, BL1 and BL2, which project over the catalytic cleft of USP14 and block the access of the C-terminal residues of ubiquitin in the inactive form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In Ubal-modified USP14, BL1 and BL2 are rearranged, thus exposing the cleft. In particular, Ser432, located within BL2, shifts its position over a distance of 3–5 Å between the two states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hu et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10510.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structural basis of ubiquitin-specific protease-14 (USP14) activation by phosphorylation of Ser432.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Detailed view of blocking loop 2 (BL2), which occludes the active site of USP14 (PDB access code 2AYN).

The amino acid sequences around Ser432 are highly evolutionarily conserved among USP14 orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and Ser432 is predicted to be an Akt substrate by Scansite (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scansite3.mit.edu/#home">http://scansite3.mit.edu/#home</ext-link>). We therefore tested the possibility that USP14 might be a substrate of activated Akt. We first examined the interaction between USP14 and Akt using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, when USP14 and Akt were overexpressed in HEK293T cells, their interaction was readily detectable. To test whether Akt could phosphorylate USP14, we overexpressed USP14 and an activated Akt (Myr-Akt) in HEK293T cells, and performed a quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We identified four phosphorylation sites on USP14 when it was expressed alone: Ser143, Ser230, Thr235, and Ser432 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Notably, the phosphorylation levels of two of the four sites, Ser143 and Ser432, were increased considerably in cells expressing activated Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>To examine whether USP14 is a direct substrate for Akt, we conducted an in vitro kinase assay using activated recombinant Akt and purified recombinant USP14 expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. We found that co-incubation of USP14 and Akt led to modification of USP14 as detected by a pan phospho-Ser antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that USP14 is a substrate for Akt.</p><p>To determine if Ser143 and Ser432 were indeed phosphorylated by Akt, we used this pan phospho-Ser antibody as above and found phosphorylation of wild type (WT) USP14, but not of S143A/S432A mutant USP14, after incubating with activated Akt in a kinase assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To differentiate the relative importance of Ser143 and Ser432 as phosphorylation sites by Akt, we overexpressed activated Akt (Myr-Akt) in HEK293T cells with WT, S143A, S432A, or double S143A/S432A (AA) mutants. We found that S143A mutant showed partially reduced phosphorylation as compared to that of WT, whereas phosphorylation of the USP14 S432A mutant was significantly decreased and that of AA double mutant was completely eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results suggested S432 as a major and S143 as a minor phosphorylation site of Akt.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10510.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ubiquitin-specific protease-14 (USP14) is phosphorylated at Ser432 by activated Akt.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In vitro phosphorylation of USP14 at S432 by Akt.

We found that the levels of these proteins increased significantly in MG132-treated KO-AA cells compared to that of control KO-AA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, Lane 5), suggesting that these proteins were indeed subject to an increased rate of proteasome degradation with expression of non-phosphorylatable USP14. Interestingly, the top hit on this list of 87 proteins that were differentially regulated upon the loss of USP14 is mTOR, a central established regulator of cellular metabolism and tumorigenesis. We confirmed the role of USP14 on the levels of mTOR by western blotting. We found that the levels of mTOR were reduced in H4 KO and H4 KO cells complemented with USP14 AA mutant, but restored upon the expression of USP14 DD mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that phosphorylation of USP14 may provide a mechanism for Akt to regulate global protein degradation through the proteasome, which in turn may control key cellular pathways involved in regulating metabolism and tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We report here a new mode of USP14 regulation involving its phosphorylation by the protein kinase Akt. The activity of USP14 is induced 800-fold by association with the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Remarkably, Akt-dependent phosphorylation of USP14 elevates the catalytic activity of proteasome-associated USP14 beyond this level. Thus, Akt not only activates USP14 by a different mechanism than the proteasome, but it can cooperate with the proteasome to achieve more aggressive removal of ubiquitin from proteasome-docked substrates. Akt activation of USP14 has marked effects on protein turnover in cells, highlighting the physiological significance of the activity state of USP14. USP14 and its ortholog from yeast (Ubp6) can suppress degradation through both deubiquitination and a noncatalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bashore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Hanna et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). The ability to rapidly adjust the rate of proteasomal degradation by responding to external signals, including growth factors, nutritional demands, and stress, is critical for maintaining cellular survival and preventing the toxicity associated with protein misfolding and accumulation of toxic aggregates. By regulating the rate of proteasomal degradation through phosphorylating USP14, Akt may exert controls over the entire proteome of short-lived proteins as well as cellular protein quality.</p><p>Since Akt is dramatically activated in PTEN-deficient cancer cells, the control of USP14 phosphorylation by Akt may provide a mechanism for cancer cells with PTEN loss, one of the most common cancer mutations, to control global intracellular proteostasis by regulating protein degradation through proteasomes. Furthermore, since Akt can be activated by a wide range of growth factors, such as insulin, EGF, IGF, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), through their respective receptors, regulation of USP14 by Akt-mediated phosphorylation may provide a general mechanism for growth factors to control global proteostasis during cell growth. Our results do not exclude the possibility that other kinases that are activatable by growth factors and activated in PTEN-deficient conditions can also mediate the phosphorylation of USP14.</p><p>The precise control of the UPS allows timely and selective degradation of surplus and/or aberrant proteins which is essential for normal cellular physiology. Dys-regulation of UPS may disrupt cellular proteostasis and lead to the inappropriate accumulation of target proteins to compromise cellular and tissue homeostasis. Since UPS is critically involved in the degradation of cellular short-lived proteins which frequently serve in mediating intracellular signaling process, the regulation of UPS by Akt-mediated phosphorylation of USP14 may provide a mechanism to control multiple signaling process, raising the possibility that control of short-lived proteins might serve as an active process that has impact on cellular signaling, rather than as a degradative process per se. In this regard, regulation of UPS by Akt has been proposed to contribute to type II diabetes mediated by inflammation. Stimulation of adipocytes by TNFα has been shown to lead to reduction of Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Medina et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, a reduction of Akt might promote UPS to lead to global proteomic changes to contribute to the pathological consequence in diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s5-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>All cell lines were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Xu et al. report that the protein kinase AKT phosphorylates the deubiquitinase USP14 at Ser432 and Ser143 in vitro and in overexpression experiments, and that the phosphorylation of Ser432 is accompanied by a large increase in USP14 catalytic activity. They also report that USP14 undergoes phosphorylation at Ser432 in cells, that this is decreased by serum deprivation, increased in response to stimulation with IGF1 and suppressed by MK2206, which prevents the phosphorylation and hence the activation of AKT by the protein kinases PDK1 and TORC2. They further show that USP14 is phosphorylated constitutively at Ser432 in PTEN null cells. Finally they report that the phosphorylation of USP14 suppresses the activity of the proteasome in cells.</p> <p>1) The data presented in the paper provide convincing evidence that the phosphorylation of USP14 at Ser432, and perhaps also Ser143, activates USP14 activity in vitro and in overexpression experiments in cells. However, data presented on endogenous USP14 and the endogenous kinase is limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H, I</xref>). These data need to be expanded and the quality of the data needs to be improved. First, an IP-western should also be performed to show that the band detected is USP14 and not a different protein of similar molecular weight. Second, the experiments should be performed using cells treated with MK2206 without and with IGF1-treatment and also with a different activator of AKT (e.g. EGF). Third, the concentration of MK2206 should be stated in the legend – in other Figures the range is 1-10µM; here it is important that a low dose (e.g. 1 µM) is used to avoid non-specific artefacts. Fourth, a second AKT inhibitor structurally unrelated to MK2206 (e.g. AZD5363) should be used. Fifth, suppression of phosphorylation by PI 3-kinase inhibitors (Wortmannin, GDC0941) should be presented. Sixth, the effect of a MEK inhibitor (to suppress activation of RSKs) should be presented.</p> <p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> reports that the endogenous USP14 is phosphorylated in PTEN KO cells in the absence of IGF1 stimulation. In addition to strengthening these data in the same way suggested for the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, it is critical to show that phosphorylation is suppressed by MK2206 to be able to conclude that phosphorylation is catalyzed by AKT. Moreover, AKT is not the only protein kinase that is activated downstream of PI 3-kinase. The protein kinases SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3, which are the most similar protein kinases in the human genome to AKT1, 2 and 3, have a similar substrate specificity to AKT and, like AKT, are activated by PDK1 and TORC2. They are therefore candidates to phosphorylate USP14, but their activation is not blocked by MK2206. Protein kinases of the RSK family are also activated by stimulation with growth factors and deactivated by serum starvation and they also have similar substrate specificities to AKT. The consensus sequence for phosphorylation by AKT, as well as SGKs and RSKs is not RxxS as stated in the paper, but RxRxxS and most of the known physiological substrates of these kinases are phosphorylated at this motif. All protein kinases of the AGC and CAMK subfamilies as well as other kinases phosphorylate RxxS sequences. So about 20% of all protein kinases phosphorylate this motif. Ser432 and Ser143 do not lie in RxRxxS sequences, which is a further reason to be cautious.</p> <p>3) The authors point out in the Introduction that USP14 can be activated in vitro by interaction with the proteasome. How does this relate to the observation that USP14 is activated by AKT? The phos-tag gels suggest that only a minor fraction of USP14 is phosphorylated. Is it only the proteasome bound fraction of USP14 that is phosphorylated or is it the unbound USP14 that is phosphorylated. Can USP14 activated by the proteasome be further activated by phosphorylation?</p> <p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: To be sure that it is HA-USP14 and not another DUB contaminating the IPs that is being measured, it is essential to perform a control experiment in which a catalytically inactive USP14 mutant is used instead of the wild type protein.</p> <p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, the effects of MK2206 on USP14 activity seem modest (compared with the effects on USP14 phosphorylation presented elsewhere).</p> <p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, the S432A mutant is still activated by AKT, suggesting that Ser143 phosphorylation may cause partial activation. An experiment with Ser143Ala and Ser143Glu mutants would be informative.</p> <p>7) Can USP14 activation be observed by stimulating with IGF1 in the absence of any overexpression of AKT, and if so, is it suppressed by MK2206 – this is a more critical experiment.</p> <p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>: Does IGF1 stimulation without AKT overexpression activate the UPS and, if so, is this blocked by MK2206?</p></body> </sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10510.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub> <body><p><italic>1) The data presented in the paper provide convincing evidence that the phosphorylation of USP14 at Ser432, and perhaps also Ser143, activates USP14 activity in vitro and in overexpression experiments in cells.

Indeed, we have immunoprecipitated USP14 and then western blotting for p-S432 ab to confirm that it is USP14 that is detected by this p-S432 ab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, 2G, 2H, 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1B, 1C, 1D, 1F</xref>).</p> <p><italic>Second, the experiments should be performed using cells treated with MK2206 without and with IGF1-treatment and also with a different activator of AKT (e.g. EGF).</italic> </p> <p>As requested, we performed the experiments using cells treated with or without MK2206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1B</xref>) and with IGF1-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>) and also with a different activator of AKT, EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5G</xref>).</p> <p><italic>Third, the concentration of MK2206 should be stated in the legend – in other Figures the range is 1-10µM; here it is important that a low dose (e.g. 1 µM) is used to avoid non-specific artefacts.</italic> </p> <p>Now the concentrations of MK2206 used are stated in the legends.</p> <p><italic>Fourth, a second AKT inhibitor structurally unrelated to MK2206 (e.g. AZD5363) should be used.</italic> </p> <p>As requested, we tested AZD5363 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1C, 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). p-GSK3β(S9), a known Akt substrate (Zhang et al., 2015), was detected by WB to indicate the inhibition of Akt.</p> <p><italic>Fifth, suppression of phosphorylation by PI 3-kinase inhibitors (Wortmannin, GDC0941) should be presented.</italic> </p> <p>As requested, PI3K inhibitors GDC0941 and Wortmannin were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p> <p><italic>Sixth, the effect of a MEK inhibitor (to suppress activation of RSKs) should be presented.</italic> </p> <p>As requested, inhibition of ERK1/2 by U0126 was tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p> <p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> reports that the endogenous USP14 is phosphorylated in PTEN KO cells in the absence of IGF1 stimulation. In addition to strengthening these data in the same way suggested for the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, it is critical to show that phosphorylation is suppressed by MK2206 to be able to conclude that phosphorylation is catalyzed by AKT.</italic> </p> <p>As requested, this experiment was performed to show that phosphorylation of USP14 in PTEN KO cells was indeed suppressed by MK2206 and AZD5363 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p> <p><italic>Moreover, AKT is not the only protein kinase that is activated downstream of PI 3-kinase. The protein kinases SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3, which are the most similar protein kinases in the human genome to AKT1, 2 and 3, have a similar substrate specificity to AKT and, like AKT, are activated by PDK1 and TORC2. They are therefore candidates to phosphorylate USP14, but their activation is not blocked by MK2206. Protein kinases of the RSK family are also activated by stimulation with growth factors and deactivated by serum starvation and they also have similar substrate specificities to AKT. The consensus sequence for phosphorylation by AKT, as well as SGKs and RSKs is not RxxS as stated in the paper, but RxRxxS and most of the known physiological substrates of these kinases are phosphorylated at this motif. All protein kinases of the AGC and CAMK subfamilies as well as other kinases phosphorylate RxxS sequences. So about 20% of all protein kinases phosphorylate this motif. Ser432 and Ser143 do not lie in RxRxxS sequences, which is a further reason to be cautious.</italic> </p> <p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. We have added a sentence to the end of second paragraph in Discussion: “Our results do not exclude the possibility that other kinases that are activatable by growth factors and activated in PTEN deficient conditions can also mediate the phosphorylation of USP14”.</p> <p><italic>3) The authors point out in the Introduction that USP14 can be activated in vitro by interaction with the proteasome. How does this relate to the observation that USP14 is activated by AKT?</italic> </p> <p>To address this question, we have conducted two experiments. 1) We analyzed the distribution of phosphorylated and total USP14 by glycerol gradient centrifugation (Koulich et al., 2008) and found that phosphorylated USP14 was largely present in fractions without proteasome while unphosphorylated USP14 was found in the same fractions with proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2F</xref>). 2) We determined the Ub-AMC hydrolysis activity of WT and S432E mutant USP14 protein in the presence of proteasome in vitro and found that the activity of S432E can be further stimulated by proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p> <p><italic>The phos-tag gels suggest that only a minor fraction of USP14 is phosphorylated. Is it only the proteasome bound fraction of USP14 that is phosphorylated or is it the unbound USP14 that is phosphorylated.</italic> </p> <p>To address this question from the reviewers, we performed glycerol density gradient centrifugation (Koulich et al., 2008) to determine the distribution of free and proteasome-associated phosphorylated USP14 in <italic>Pten<sup>-/-</sup></italic>MEFs (with high USP14 S432 phosphorylation) cells lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2F</xref>). The phos-USP14 is preferentially distributed in fractions without proteasome.</p> <p><italic>Can USP14 activated by the proteasome be further activated by phosphorylation?</italic> </p> <p>To address this question, we have analyzed the activity of S432E mutant and WT in the presence of proteasome and found that the activity of phospho-mimetic USP14 mutant can be further activated by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p> <p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: To be sure that it is HA-USP14 and not another DUB contaminating the IPs that is being measured, it is essential to perform a control experiment in which a catalytically inactive USP14 mutant is used instead of the wild type protein.</italic> </p> <p>To address this question, catalytically inactive USP14 mutant was used to validate Ub-AMC assay on imminoprecipitated HA-USP14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2A</xref>). At the same protein concentration, USP14-C114S showed significantly lower catalytic activity than that of WT.</p> <p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, the effects of MK2206 on USP14 activity seem modest (compared with the effects on USP14 phosphorylation presented elsewhere).</italic> </p> <p>The extents of USP14 activity in this in vitro Ub-AMC assay stimulated by Myr-Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), inhibited by MK2206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), or stimulated by IGF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) are similar, which may be due to the limitation of this assay.</p> <p><italic>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, the S432A mutant is still activated by AKT, suggesting that Ser143 phosphorylation may cause partial activation. An experiment with Ser143Ala and Ser143Glu mutants would be informative.</italic> </p> <p>To address this question, we analyzed the activity of S143A with active Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2B</xref>) and S143E alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2D</xref>). Our new data indicate that S143A can be activated as that of WT and S143E has no significant effect on Ub-AMC hydrolysis activity.</p> <p><italic>7) Can USP14 activation be observed by stimulating with IGF1 in the absence of any overexpression of AKT, and if so, is it suppressed by MK2206 – this is a more critical experiment.</italic> </p> <p>To address this question, we analyzed the activity of USP14 from HEK293T cells treated with IGF-1 in the presence or absence of MK2206 and show that USP14 activity is higher when it is isolated from IGF-1 stimulated cells and the activity is inhibitable by MK2206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p> <p><italic>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>: Does IGF1 stimulation without AKT overexpression activate the UPS and, if so, is this blocked by MK2206?</italic> </p> <p>To address this question, we performed new experiments to show that IGF-1 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) as well as EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) could affect the UPS, which was blocked by MK2206.</p></body> </sub-article></article>
