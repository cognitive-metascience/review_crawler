mosquito bites during prophylactic chloroquine treatment (chemoprophylaxis and sporozoites (CPS)). We established a new mouse model of CPS immunization to investigate the stage and strain-specificity of malaria immunity. Immunization with <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic> by mosquito bite under chloroquine cover does not generate pre-erythrocytic immunity, which is acquired only after immunization with high sporozoite doses. Instead, CPS immunization by bite elicits long-lived protection against blood-stage parasites. Blood-stage immunity is effective against a virulent, genetically distinct strain of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>. Importantly, if exposure to blood-stage parasitemia is extended, blood-stage parasites induce cross-stage immunity targeting pre-erythrocytic stages. We therefore show that CPS immunization can induce robust, long-lived heterologous blood-stage immunity, in addition to protection against pre-erythrocytic parasites following high dose sporozoite immunization. Cross-stage immunity elicited by blood-stage parasites may further enhance efficacy of this immunization regimen.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05165.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05165.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05165.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Malaria is a life-threatening infectious disease in humans that is caused by a single-celled parasite called <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. The parasite is carried between people by mosquitos; when an infected mosquito bites a human, the parasite is injected into the bloodstream with the mosquito's saliva. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> first infects liver cells but then re-enters the bloodstream, where it infects red blood cells leading to symptoms of disease. If another mosquito bites the infected individual at this so-called ‘blood-stage’, the parasite can be passed to this mosquito and the cycle of transmission continues.</p><p>Currently there are no vaccines available that can effectively protect against malaria. Although an experimental vaccine containing a weakened form of the parasite can protect against the liver-stage parasites, it fails to prevent the parasite from multiplying in the red blood cells. Therefore, the individuals remain susceptible to severe malaria.</p><p>Recently, researchers have developed a new strategy for immunization that provides exposure to both liver-stage and blood-stage parasites. Human volunteers taking an anti-malarial drug were deliberately exposed to mosquitos carrying the parasite on three separate occasions. Although the volunteers were infected with the parasite, the anti-malarial drug killed the parasites inside the red blood cells. After the end of the drug treatment, the volunteers were exposed to mosquitos carrying the parasite and they were still protected from infection. These results are promising, but it is not clear if the volunteers have acquired immunity to liver-stage or blood-stage parasites, or even both.</p><p>To answer this important question, Nahrendorf et al. developed a similar immunization strategy in mice. Just like the human volunteers, the mice were treated with an anti-malarial drug and exposed to mosquitos carrying <italic>Plasmodium</italic> on three separate occasions. Although the immunizations did not protect the mice against early infection in the liver, they did provide long-term protection against parasites multiplying in the red-blood cells.</p><p>The immunity generated by this immunization strategy also protected the mice against another strain of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, different to the one used in the immunizations. The experiments also show that prolonged exposure to the blood-stage parasites can even lead to immunity against the liver-stage parasites.</p><p>Nahrendorf et al.'s findings show that this immunization strategy can protect individuals against both the liver-stage and blood-stage parasites. The next challenges are to find out how the immunity generated by one stage of infection can protect against the other stages, and to discover which molecules on the parasite the immune system targets.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05165.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05165.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>protection</kwd><kwd>sporozoite</kwd><kwd>cross-stage</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spence</surname><given-names>Philip J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U117584248</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nahrendorf</surname><given-names>Wiebke</given-names></name><name><surname>Spence</surname><given-names>Philip J</given-names></name><name><surname>Tumwine</surname><given-names>Irene</given-names></name><name><surname>Lévy</surname><given-names>Prisca</given-names></name><name><surname>Jarra</surname><given-names>William</given-names></name><name><surname>Langhorne</surname><given-names>Jean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spence</surname><given-names>Philip J</given-names></name><name><surname>Lévy</surname><given-names>Prisca</given-names></name><name><surname>Langhorne</surname><given-names>Jean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel mouse model of immunization against <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic> involving infectious mosquito bites and drug-treatment elicits protection against blood-stage malaria parasites, and shows that protection is not necessarily life cycle stage-specific.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protective immunity against microorganisms is developed after repeated infection and recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mutapi et al., 2013</xref>). Vaccines are usually successful if they mimic these naturally acquired immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fox, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mielcarek et al., 2006</xref>). While protection against viruses and bacteria can be induced by vaccination with killed (inactivated) or live-attenuated pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delany et al., 2014</xref>), there is no licensed vaccine for human parasitic diseases like malaria that pose a major global health burden.</p><p>The apicomplexan malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is transmitted by bites of female anopheline mosquitoes. In the vertebrate host, sporozoites injected into the dermis migrate to the liver, where they establish a clinically silent infection of hepatocytes. Merozoites are then released from the liver and invade erythrocytes, leading to an exponential asexual replication cycle that is entirely responsible for the clinical signs and symptoms associated with malaria. Immunity against severe disease can be acquired following repeated infection, but sterile parasite clearance is rarely achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goncalves et al., 2014</xref>). Clinically immune adults in endemic areas still harbor parasites in their blood-stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okell et al., 2009</xref>). These asymptomatic carriers also develop gametocytes, the form transmissible to mosquitoes, thereby allowing the parasite to complete its life cycle.</p><p>To achieve malaria control and eventually eradication, transmission must be blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kappe et al., 2010</xref>). A vaccine that protects against pre-erythrocytic parasites, and thus outperforms naturally acquired immunity, would greatly facilitate this aim. Parasites that arrest during the liver stage, either because of irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nussenzweig et al., 1967</xref>) or targeted gene deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mueller et al., 2005</xref>), can provide immunity against challenge infection. Indeed, immunization of human volunteers with irradiated sporozoites can induce sterile protection in experimental settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clyde et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seder et al., 2013</xref>). However, in the absence of acquired immunity to the blood-stage parasite a pre-erythrocytic vaccine that is only partially effective, and therefore permits breakthrough erythrocytic infections, will provide no protection against severe malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bejon et al., 2011</xref>). The inclusion of a blood-stage component together with an effective pre-erythrocytic vaccine is therefore preferred to provide a multi-stage malaria vaccine that minimizes both transmission and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ellis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goodman and Draper, 2010</xref>).</p><p>A recently described experimental malaria immunization protocol using chemoprophylaxis and sporozoites (CPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roestenberg et al., 2009</xref>) ensures exposure to pre-erythrocytic and blood-stage parasites, and hence has the unique potential to induce protection against all <italic>Plasmodium</italic> life cycle stages in the vertebrate host. Three immunizations with bites of 10–15 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>-infected mosquitoes under chloroquine chemoprophylaxis are sufficient to elicit sterile protection against homologous challenge in human volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roestenberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijker et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2014</xref>). Although it is not possible to measure liver parasite burden in human volunteers directly, it appears that immunity exclusively targets pre-erythrocytic parasite life cycle stages, as there is no protection against direct blood challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijker et al., 2013</xref>). CPS immunization is thus substantially more effective than immunization with irradiated sporozoites, which requires 1000 mosquito bites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clyde et al., 1973</xref>) or five intravenous (<italic>iv</italic>) injections of more than 100,000 sporozoites for sterile protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seder et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore hypothesize that transient blood-stage parasitemia, before abrogation by chloroquine, may contribute to immunity following CPS immunization.</p><p>In this study, we have investigated the stage- and strain-specificity of protection in a novel mouse model of CPS immunization using <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic>. <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> establishes a chronic, non-lethal blood-stage infection, which has been used extensively to characterize the immune response to blood-stage parasites in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stephens et al., 2012</xref>). A recently optimized protocol for <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> mosquito transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spence et al., 2012</xref>) allows us now to also study pre-erythrocytic stages of this rodent parasite. Heterologous protection can readily be assessed since many genetically distinct <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> isolates displaying a variety of virulence phenotypes are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mackinnon and Read, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otto et al., 2014</xref>). We immunized C57BL/6 mice three times with bites of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>-infected mosquitoes under oral chloroquine chemoprophylaxis similar to human clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roestenberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijker et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2014</xref>). This approach is unique amongst all published animal models of CPS immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaudoin et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Golenser et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orjih et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belnoue et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friesen and Matuschewski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Inoue et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nganou-Makamdop et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doll et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peng et al., 2014</xref>), which have (without exception) used <italic>iv</italic> injection of high numbers of <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> or <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic> sporozoites for immunization. Furthermore, rather than evaluating effector mechanisms by challenging shortly after immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaudoin et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belnoue et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friesen and Matuschewski, 2011</xref>), we performed the challenge 100 days after the final immunization to test the generation and maintenance of long-term immunological memory.</p><p>CPS immunization with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> by mosquito bite does not generate pre-erythrocytic immunity, which is acquired only after immunization with high doses of sporozoites. Instead, immunization by bite elicits blood-stage immunity that is effective against the immunizing strain and also a more virulent, genetically distinct <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>. Moreover, extended exposure to blood-stage parasitemia elicits robust pre-erythrocytic immunity, comparable to protection afforded by high dose sporozoite immunization. Exposure to blood-stage parasites thus elicits heterologous blood-stage immunity and can contribute to the pre-erythrocytic efficacy of this immunization regimen. Therefore, these findings add significantly to advances from previous CPS immunization mouse models by evaluating the generation of immune memory after immunization with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> by mosquito bite<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39"/>. This is relevant for our understanding of acquired immunity in a malaria endemic setting, and can inform multi-stage malaria vaccine development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We investigated the stage- and strain-specificity of protection in a novel mouse model of CPS immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Consequently, one CPS immunization is sufficient to reduce blood-stage parasite burden within the first erythrocytic cycle, which indicates either pre-erythrocytic or blood-stage immunity.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05165.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Chloroquine permits transient blood-stage parasitemia during each immunization.</title><p>The number of parasitized erythrocytes (pE) per ml of whole blood was enumerated by quantitative RealTime PCR after each CPS immunization (i1, i2, i3) with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS-infected mosquito bites under chloroquine (CQ) cover.

Since the number of sporozoites establishing a liver-stage infection can further be influenced by inherent sporozoite infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khan and Vanderberg, 1991</xref>), our best estimate of immunizing sporozoite dose is the number of infected erythrocytes observed directly after egress from the liver. Assuming that 10,000 merozoites are released from one infected liver cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">White et al., 2014</xref>), we estimate approximately 400 infected hepatocytes (95% CI 137–1250) in human volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijker et al., 2013</xref>) compared to 5 in <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS immunized mice (95% CI 1–31).

It is well known that repeated exposure to blood-stage parasites, for example, in rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jarra and Brown, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Legorreta-Herrera et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elliott et al., 2005</xref>), in humans exposed to ultra-low doses of parasitized erythrocytes while receiving drug treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pombo et al., 2002</xref>), during malaria-therapy of neurosyphilis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins and Jeffery, 1999</xref>), and in people living in malaria-endemic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bull et al., 1998</xref>), induces blood-stage immunity. Our results also clearly show that during CPS immunization repeated transient blood-stage infection (less than 0.01% parasitemia for 48–72 hr) elicits long-lasting blood-stage immunity. Protection against challenge infection was only apparent after multiple erythrocytic replication cycles and patent blood-stage parasite densities, which could indicate that blood-stage protection was not observed in CPS immunized human volunteers after direct blood-challenge because drug treatment is required at low parasite densities as soon as patency is reached (typically between the third and fourth erythrocytic cycle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijker et al., 2013</xref>). Blood-stage parasites are however recognized in human volunteers, which was demonstrated by an earlier increase of IFNγ and monokines induced by IFNγ (MIG) concentrations in CPS immunized volunteers compared to infection controls after direct blood challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijker et al., 2013</xref>). It will be of value to investigate whether the observed blood-stage protection in this mouse model is also detected in CPS immunized primates, where a longer blood-stage infection than that allowed in human clinical trials is possible.</p><p>Despite the reduced peak parasitemia and faster clearance of blood-stage parasites during the acute phase of infection in CPS immunized mice, recrudescent parasitemia could still be observed in the chronic phase of infection after challenge, suggesting a parasite variant escapes the protective immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McLean et al., 1982</xref>). There are very few reports on protective efficacy of CPS immunization (or indeed any sporozoite-based vaccine) against direct blood-challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belnoue et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Inoue et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peng et al., 2014</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doll et al. (2014)</xref> reported that sustained, subpatent blood-stage infection after treatment with a commonly used dose of chloroquine can induce partial blood-stage protection. Low-grade transient blood-stage parasitemia, achieved by attenuation of blood-stage parasites using an antimalarial drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pombo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elliott et al., 2005</xref>), a DNA alkylating agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Good et al., 2013</xref>) or genetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ting et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aly et al., 2010</xref>) similarly provides protection against homologous and heterologous blood-stage challenge.</p><p>We could show that CPS-induced blood-stage immunity is effective against heterologous mosquito bite challenge with a more virulent and genetically distinct strain of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mackinnon and Read, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lamb and Langhorne, 2008</xref>). In agreement with the observed cross-species protection after CPS immunization with mefloquine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Inoue et al., 2012</xref>), and one study using chemically attenuated sporozoites for immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Purcell et al., 2008</xref>), heterologous protection is less effective than homologous immunity. Nevertheless, CPS immunization can elicit long-lived protection against both homologous and heterologous blood-stage parasites, which will be important to minimize disease severity in the case of breakthrough blood-stage infections. This is essential for the development of an effective multi-stage malaria vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ellis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bejon et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In stark contrast to the observed heterologous blood-stage protection after mosquito bite challenge infection, protection was almost completely abrogated following direct blood-challenge with virulent parasites obtained after continuous serial blood passage. This suggests that blood-stage parasites immediately after mosquito transmission express antigens not present on serially blood passaged parasites and that these antigens may be the target of protective immunity following CPS immunization. Serially blood passaged parasites can hence escape from CPS-induced blood-stage immunity. One group of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genes, whose expression is altered by mosquito transmission during blood-stage infection is the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> interspersed repeat gene family (<italic>pir</italic>); termed <italic>cir</italic> in <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lawton et al., 2012</xref>). Transcription of more than half of all <italic>cir</italic> genes is increased in blood-stage parasites after mosquito transmission compared with their transcription after serial blood passage. This diversification of <italic>cir</italic> transcription is associated with a more effective host immune response, which in turn attenuates parasite virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spence et al., 2013</xref>). The <italic>cir</italic> genes could also be candidate targets for cross-stage immunity, as <italic>P. berghei pir</italic> genes are also transcribed during the liver stages (personal communication BM Franke-Fayard and CJ Janse, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands). An investigation into shared PIR proteins between liver and blood-stage parasites may hence provide valuable information for multi-stage malaria vaccine development. Furthermore, the absence of blood-stage protection in previous CPS models may have been due to challenge with serially blood passaged rather then recently mosquito transmitted blood-stage parasites. It is therefore always essential to evaluate blood-stage immunity in the context of mosquito transmission.</p><p>As shared antigenic targets between liver- and blood-stage parasites have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tarun et al., 2008</xref>), the exciting possibility of cross-stage protection has been considered but only rarely assessed. Genetically modified <italic>fabb/f</italic>- sporozoites that arrest late in liver-stage development protect against <italic>iv</italic> challenge with 100 blood-stage parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, a blood-stage infection with serially blood passaged <italic>P. yoelii</italic>, drug-treated with chloroquine after 4–5 days, reduces liver parasite load upon <italic>iv</italic> challenge with 35,000 sporozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belnoue et al., 2008</xref>). In our model of CPS immunization by mosquito bite, it is likely that repeated transient blood-stage infection during immunization elicits the observed blood-stage protection, although we cannot yet exclude that responses acquired against pre-erythrocytic antigens, which are shared with blood-stage parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tarun et al., 2008</xref>), contribute as well. Because of the low number of infected hepatocytes after CPS immunization with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>-infected mosquito bites this seems however unlikely. Nevertheless, we demonstrate unequivocally that extended exposure to blood-stage parasites is an effective stimulator of pre-erythrocytic immunity. Exposure to blood-stage parasites during CPS immunization may thus significantly contribute to the observed pre-erythrocytic protection in human volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roestenberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijker et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2014</xref>). Indeed, cross-stage immunity could be responsible for the unprecedented efficacy of CPS immunization compared to immunization with irradiated sporozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clyde et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seder et al., 2013</xref>), which arrest early during liver-stage development and never establish a blood-stage infection. While extending exposure to replicating blood-stage parasites by delayed drug administration is not possible in humans, the incorporation of chemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Good et al., 2013</xref>) or genetically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ting et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aly et al., 2010</xref>) attenuated blood-stage parasites should be considered to further enhance the generation and maintenance of both pre-erythrocytic and blood-stage immunity. This makes CPS immunization a powerful tool for the development of an effective multi-stage malaria vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Inbred C57BL/6 mice, originally obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, USA), were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions at the MRC National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) for over 30 years.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Prabhat Jha (Senior editor) and 4 reviewers, one of whom is serving as a guest Reviewing editor.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Urszula Krzych (Reviewing editor) and Michael Good (peer reviewer). Two other reviewers remain anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The study reported here was considered interesting and reviewers pointed to the novel aspect of your study in that using CPS in the <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> represents a somewhat new murine model. The improvement to mosquito transmission of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> offers new insights that are distinct from those seen with the <italic>P. berghei</italic> and <italic>P. yoelii</italic> models. On the whole, the study was well performed, and for the most part, the paper is well written. What follows is a condensed version of suggestions and substantive concerns expressed by the reviewers:</p><p>1) The discordant results showing pre-erythrocytic stage protection in the CPS murine model system and CPS studies conducted in humans warrant a thorough discussion regarding these differences. As an example, immunizations of human subjects via mosquito bite with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> via under CPS coverage induces sterile pre-erythrocytic immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijker et al., 2013</xref>), which has not been observed in the mice without <italic>intravenous</italic> (<italic>iv</italic>) administration of very high doses of sporozoites. Is this related to the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> versus <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> sporozoite inoculum delivered by mosquito bite? Although the answer to the question as to why there is a difference between rodent and humans remains unanswered, omitting this discussion diminishes the importance of the study.</p><p>2) The aim of a blood-stage vaccine is to ultimately protect malaria-naïve individuals from clinical disease. The observation that that blood-stage exposure provided protection against pre-erythrocytic parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) raised several concerns:</p><p>a) Although noteworthy, extending blood-stage exposure to enhance CPS immunization efficacy does not appear to be a transferable strategy to humans (in the final part of the Discussion section). With a delayed drug administration to humans (as has been achieved here in mice, as refereed to in the Discussion) one would risk that humans would be displaying malaria symptoms. These issues need to be addressed and the limitations acknowledged.</p><p>b) Protection against pre-erythrocytic parasites afforded by blood stage infection without chemoprophylactic drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) argues against the relevance of the CPS immunization model which does not provide pre-erythrocytic immunity after immunization by mosquito bite and therefore questions the ultimate message of the manuscript. The authors may consider rewriting these aspects and broaden the Discussion.</p><p>c) While these cross-stage protection experiments are of great interest and significance to the malaria field, the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> have been considered as “stand alone” results. Perhaps this aspect of the study could be extended and additional experiments testing for immunologic mechanisms included. This addition would improve the quality of the manuscript.</p><p>3) CPS treatment gives rise to heterologous blood stage immunity. It is not clear from this study whether this is due to cross-stage immunity, or due to the low grade blood parasitemia that follows CPS and which would be in keeping with previous studies showing that exposure to very low density blood infections can induce heterologous blood stage immunity. While blood stage immunity has not been shown in human studies with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and CPS, it quite plausible that it does exist for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> as well but it is simply undetectable because of the need to treat volunteers soon after the appearance of blood stage parasites.

This suggests immunity is raised against variant antigens that are shared between the heterologous strains following mosquito bite delivery. Although the data show protection against these genetically distinct strains of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>, the potential for immune escape suggested by these results warrants further discussion.</p><p>5) A careful editing of the manuscript was suggested to avoid a possible confusion:</p><p>a) In the Introduction, the authors state that CPS provides both heterologous and pre-erythrocytic immunity but later state that CPS “abrogate” pre-erythrocytic immunity (in the end of the Results section).</p><p>b) A disunity in the message is that low dose CPS immunization by mosquito bite offers no pre-erythrocytic protection but some homologous or heterologous erythrocytic immunity; high dose sporozoite challenge <italic>iv</italic>. or no drug, “self-cured” mosquito bite or <italic>ip</italic> blood stage infection provide pre-erythrocytic immunity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05165.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The study reported here was considered interesting and reviewers pointed to the novel aspect of your study in that using CPS in the</italic> P. chabaudi <italic>represents a somewhat new murine model.

Although the answer to the question as to why there is a difference between rodent and humans remains unanswered, omitting this discussion diminishes the importance of the study</italic>.</p><p>We carried out CPS immunization of C57BL/6 mice using <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS-infected <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquito bites, similar to human volunteers exposed to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 or NF54 infected <italic>A. stephensi</italic> bites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roestenberg et al<italic>.</italic> 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijker et al<italic>.</italic> 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bijker et al<italic>.</italic> 2014</xref>). This means that the exact number of sporozoites inoculated, and subsequently the number of infected hepatocytes remains unknown. <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS-infected mosquitoes harbor a median number of 438 (range 43-956) sporozoites in their salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spence et al<italic>.</italic> 2012</xref>). These numbers are in the same order of magnitude as <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection rates observed in wild mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47a">Pringle 1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beier et al. 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51a">Sherwood et al. 1996</xref>), but 50 to 200 times lower than infection rates of experimentally infected <italic>A</italic>. <italic>stephensi</italic> used for human CPS immunizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijker et al<italic>.</italic> 2013</xref>).</p><p>However, injection of sporozoites during mosquito bite is a stochastic process and does not necessarily correlate with the salivary gland load of the mosquito (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beier et al<italic>.</italic> 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ponnudurai et al<italic>.</italic> 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Medica et al<italic>.</italic> 2005</xref>). Typically few sporozoites (estimated between 1 and 100) are injected during one infectious bite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beier et al<italic>.</italic> 1991</xref>). Based on the number of infected erythrocytes observed directly after release from the liver and assuming that 10,000 merozoites are released from a single infected liver cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">White et al<italic>.</italic> 2014</xref>), we estimate that approximately 5 hepatocytes (95% confidence interval (CI) 1-31) are infected with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS, whereas in human CPS approximately 400 hepatocytes are infected after the first immunization (95% CI 137-1250, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijker et al<italic>.</italic> 2013</xref>). This may also be influenced by the higher number of infectious mosquitoes (12 to 15, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roestenberg et al<italic>.</italic> 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijker et al<italic>.</italic> 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bijker et al<italic>.</italic> 2014</xref>) in humans compared to a typical <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> mosquito transmission (Median 9.15 bites, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spence et al<italic>.</italic> 2012</xref>) and possibly low infectivity of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> sporozoites in C57BL/6 mice, as described previously for <italic>P. berghei</italic> in BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khan et al<italic>.</italic> 1991</xref>). Therefore, we estimate that the number of infected hepatocytes after CPS immunization with mosquito bites in the <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> mouse model is approximately 100-fold lower than in human CPS.</p><p>We show that this differences in infected hepatocyte numbers by a factor of 100 can be significant for the development of pre-erythrocytic immunity: Three immunizations with 10,000 <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> sporozoites <italic>iv</italic> induces long lasting protection against mosquito bite challenge, while three immunizations with 100 <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> sporozoites fails to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>The greater number of infected hepatocytes may broaden protective pre-erythrocytic immune responses by including subdominant antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trieu et al<italic>.</italic> 2011</xref>). This may further be enhanced by the longer liver-stage development of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in human CPS (egress 6.8 days after mosquito bite, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roestenberg et al<italic>.</italic> 2012</xref>) compared to rodent malaria species (<italic>P. chabaudi</italic> egress after 52h, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stephens et al<italic>.</italic> 2012</xref>). A longer liver stage development may positively influence the generation of pre-erythrocytic immunity by allowing time for protective immune responses to develop.</p><p>Thus the lower number of infected hepatocytes after <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection by mosquito bite and the shorter liver-stage development may result in a less efficient induction of protective immunity compared to CPS immunization with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in humans.</p><p>These considerations have been added to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) The aim of a blood-stage vaccine is to ultimately protect malaria-naïve individuals from clinical disease. The observation that that blood-stage exposure provided protection against pre-erythrocytic parasites (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>) raised several concerns</italic>:</p><p><italic>a) Although noteworthy, extending blood-stage exposure to enhance CPS immunization efficacy does not appear to be a transferable strategy to humans (in the final part of the Discussion section). With a delayed drug administration to humans (as has been achieved here in mice, as refereed to in the Discussion) one would risk that humans would be displaying malaria symptoms. These issues need to be addressed and the limitations acknowledged</italic>.</p><p>That blood-stage parasites can convey pre-erythrocytic immunity is an exciting possibility for the induction of protective immunity to malaria and should be explored further, including in non-human primates and ultimately in humans (as mentioned in the Discussion). Of course we did not mean to suggest extending exposure to replicating blood-stage parasites in human volunteers beyond patency on thick blood film, which would be associated with major clinical risks. Instead it may be worth considering genetically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ting et al<italic>.</italic> 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aly et al<italic>.</italic> 2010</xref>) or chemically-attenuated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Good et al<italic>.</italic> 2013</xref>) blood-stage parasites, which would ensure prolonged exposure to infected erythrocytes, while posing minimal risks for the volunteer.</p><p>This ambiguity has now been rectified in the Abstract and in the Introduction. The Discussion was extended to incorporate these points.</p><p><italic>b) Protection against pre-erythrocytic parasites afforded by blood stage infection without chemoprophylactic drug treatment (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>) argues against the relevance of the CPS immunization model which does not provide pre-erythrocytic immunity after immunization by mosquito bite and therefore questions the ultimate message of the manuscript. The authors may consider rewriting these aspects and broaden the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>While CPS immunization using <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS infected mosquito bites does not induce protection against liver-stage parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), it was shown that sterile pre-erythrocytic protection can be acquired after CPS immunization of human volunteers with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijker et al. 2013</xref>). As discussed in comment #1 this is likely explained by longer liver-stage development and a 100-fold higher number of infected hepatocytes, which translate into exponentially more blood-stage parasites being released from the liver in human clinical trials. Here we demonstrate that exposure to a large amount of blood-stage parasites gives rise to robust pre-erythrocytic immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This suggests that pre-erythrocytic protection after CPS immunization of human volunteers may, at least in part, be mediated by exposure to blood-stage parasites during immunization under chloroquine cover. Cross-stage immunity could be responsible for the unprecedented efficacy of CPS immunization compared to immunization with irradiated sporozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clyde et al<italic>.</italic> 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seder et al<italic>.</italic> 2013</xref>), which arrest early during liver-stage development and never establish a blood-stage infection.</p><p>Moreover using our novel <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> mouse model of CPS immunization we show that in addition to pre-erythrocytic protection after immunization with large numbers of sporozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) partial blood-stage immunity can be acquired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which cannot be investigated in human volunteers. Therefore, given exposure to sufficient numbers of sporozoites and blood-stage parasites, CPS immunization can elicit powerful pre-erythrocytic as well as blood-stage immunity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). CPS immunization is therefore an invaluable tool to explore the generation of antimalarial immunity against multiple parasite life cycle stages, which can empower multi-stage malaria vaccine development.</p><p>The Discussion has been broadened to highlight these arguments.</p><p><italic>c) While these cross-stage protection experiments are of great interest and significance to the malaria field, the results shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>have been considered as “stand alone” results. Perhaps this aspect of the study could be extended and additional experiments testing for immunologic mechanisms included. This addition would improve the quality of the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>As pointed out in comment #2b our finding that exposure to blood-stage parasites can induce pre-erythrocytic immunity underpins the hypothesis that pre-erythrocytic immunity observed in humans after CPS immunization may be partly generated by exposure to blood-stage parasites during immunization. These results are therefore central for the scope of this paper.</p><p>We are pleased that the reviewers also believe, as we do, that “cross-stage protection experiments are of great interest and significance for the malaria field”. A detailed investigation of immunological mechanisms is of course necessary; however, an in depth study of cross-stage immunity using a panel of knock-out mice and/or deletion of specific subsets of cells would be beyond the scope of this publication. Since we use mosquito transmission and rest the mice after primary infection for 100 days, one experiment to evaluate immunological memory responses will last for 5 months. To uncover the immunological mechanism comprehensively would therefore take at least one, more likely two years. The authors hope the reviewers and editors understand the need to leave this exciting study into the mechanisms of cross-stage immunity for future investigation.</p><p><italic>3) CPS treatment gives rise to heterologous blood stage immunity. It is not clear from this study whether this is due to cross-stage immunity, or due to the low grade blood parasitemia that follows CPS and which would be in keeping with previous studies showing that exposure to very low density blood infections can induce heterologous blood stage immunity. While blood stage immunity has not been shown in human studies with </italic>P. falciparum <italic>and CPS, it quite plausible that it does exist for </italic>P. falciparum <italic>as well but it is simply undetectable because of the need to treat volunteers soon after the appearance of blood stage parasites. Please expand this point in your Discussion</italic>.</p><p>It is very likely that the observed homologous and heterologous blood-stage protection after CPS immunization with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS infected mosquito bites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figure 4 and 5</xref>) is due to transient blood-stage exposure during immunization, which persists for 3 to 4 days after each immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). CPS immunized human volunteers experience a similar pattern of transient blood-stage parasitemia during the immunization procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roestenberg et al<italic>.</italic> 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijker et al<italic>.</italic> 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bijker et al<italic>.</italic> 2014</xref>). Furthermore the small number of infected hepatocytes after <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS mosquito transmission (see comment #1) is unlikely to induce cross-protective responses directed against blood-stage parasites (given that they do not even induce stage-specific responses).</p><p>Low-level transient blood-stage exposure was shown previously in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elliott et al<italic>.</italic> 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ting et al<italic>.</italic> 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aly et al<italic>.</italic> 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Good et al<italic>.</italic> 2013</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pombo et al<italic>.</italic> 2002</xref>) to induce long-lived blood-stage immunity. Here we show that a significant protective effect of CPS-induced blood-stage immunity is apparent after 6 to 7 erythrocytic replication cycles following challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figure 4 and 5</xref>).</p><p>It is plausible that this would similarly be true in CPS immunized humans, but cannot be detected because of the need to treat as soon as thick blood film detectable blood parasitemia is reached (typically between the third and fourth erythrocytic replication cycle after challenge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijker et al<italic>.</italic> 2013</xref>).</p><p>One volunteer, classified as protected from mosquito bite challenge infection by the absence of a positive slide and no clinical symptoms, had 457 parasites per ml as determined by retrospective qRT PCR at 21 days post challenge just prior to presumptive drug treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijker et al<italic>.</italic> 2013</xref>). In addition to a profound reduction of liver-stage parasitemia and prolonged liver-stage development, blood-stage immunity may have contributed to this delay. Conversely this volunteer had over 1.3 million parasites in his blood stream (assuming 3l of blood), which may also mean that blood-stage immunity was not acquired.</p><p>Because of the difficulties to evaluate partial blood-stage protection in human volunteers, animal models like the here presented novel <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>-C57BL/6 mouse model are particularly valuable.</p><p>The Discussion relating to blood-stage immunity has been expanded.</p><p><italic>4) The CPS immunization protocol in mice protects against blood-stage infection (including heterologous strain) only when the challenge is delivered by mosquito bite (and not serial blood passage). This suggests immunity is raised against variant antigens that are shared between the heterologous strains following mosquito bite delivery. Although the data show protection against these genetically distinct strains of </italic>P. chabaudi, <italic>the potential for immune escape suggested by these results warrants further discussion</italic>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figure 4A and 5</xref> clearly show that CPS immunization with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> AS infected mosquito bites can protect against mosquito bite challenge with the AS and the more virulent CB strain and importantly also against direct blood challenge with recently mosquito transmitted blood-stage parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Conversely CPS-induced blood-stage immunity was almost overridden after direct blood challenge with 26-32 times serially blood-passaged parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This suggests that protective immune responses target antigens expressed by mosquito transmitted blood-stage parasites but not by serially blood passaged parasites. Serially blood passaged parasites can hence escape from protective blood-stage immunity elicited by CPS immunization with mosquito bites.</p><p>One group of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genes, whose expression is altered by mosquito transmission during blood-stage infection is the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> interspersed repeat gene family (<italic>pir</italic>); termed <italic>cir</italic> in <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lawton et al<italic>.</italic> 2012</xref>). While only very few <italic>cir</italic> genes are transcribed after serial blood-passage, transcription of more than half of all <italic>cir</italic> genes was increased after mosquito transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spence et al<italic>.</italic> 2013</xref>). Furthermore <italic>P. berghei pir</italic> genes are transcribed not only in blood-stage parasites but also in ookinetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otto et al<italic>.</italic> 2014</xref>) and liver-stages (personal communication B.M. Franke-Fayard and C.J. Janse, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands), making them potential candidates for the induction of cross-stage immune responses. An investigation into the shared PIR proteins expressed by liver- and blood-stage parasites may hence provide valuable information for multi-stage malaria vaccine development.</p><p>Since serially blood passaged parasites can i) escape the protective immune response, ii) would never be encountered in an endemic setting, iii) elicit different immune responses, iv) transcribe different genes and thus v) display enhanced virulence compared to mosquito transmitted blood-stage parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spence et al<italic>.</italic> 2013</xref>), we believe that it is essential to always evaluate blood-stage protection in the context of mosquito transmission.</p><p>The Discussion has been extended to highlight the potential for immune escape and the role of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> interspersed repeat gene family after challenge with serially blood passaged parasites.</p><p><italic>5) A careful editing of the manuscript was suggested to avoid a possible confusion</italic>:</p><p><italic>a) In the Introduction, the authors state that CPS provides both heterologous and pre-erythrocytic immunity, but later state that CPS “abrogate” pre-erythrocytic immunity (in the end of the Results section)</italic>.</p><p>Both references have been amended to avoid confusion.</p><p><italic>b) A disunity in the message is that low dose CPS immunization by mosquito bite offers no pre-erythrocytic protection but some homologous or heterologous erythrocytic immunity; high dose sporozoite challenge iv or no drug, “self-cured”mosquito bite or</italic> ip <italic>blood stage infection provide pre-erythrocytic immunity.</italic></p><p>We added <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> to clarify the effect of low and high antigen dose (the number of immunizing sporozoites and liver-stage parasites as well the amount of blood-stage parasites) for the acquired protection. What is perceived as a disunity of message reflects the complexity of immunity against the different life cycle stages of the malaria parasite (please see the Discussion). That immunity is not necessarily life cycle stage specific also needs to be taken into account.</p><p>Our findings are comprehensively discussed and summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
