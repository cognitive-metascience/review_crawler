key compound: dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Despite their large-scale implications, these interactions remain unquantified at the cellular-scale. Here we use secondary-ion mass spectrometry to provide the first visualization of DMSP at sub-cellular levels, tracking the fate of a stable sulfur isotope (<sup>34</sup>S) from its incorporation by microalgae as inorganic sulfate to its biosynthesis and exudation as DMSP, and finally its uptake and degradation by bacteria. Our results identify for the first time the storage locations of DMSP in microalgae, with high enrichments present in vacuoles, cytoplasm and chloroplasts. In addition, we quantify DMSP incorporation at the single-cell level, with DMSP-degrading bacteria containing seven times more <sup>34</sup>S than the control strain. This study provides an unprecedented methodology to label, retain, and image small diffusible molecules, which can be transposable to other symbiotic systems.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23008.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23008.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23008.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sulfur is an essential element for many organisms and environmental processes. Every year, organisms including microalgae produce more than one billion tons of a sulfur-containing compound called DMSP. Some of this DMSP is released into seawater, where it acts as a key nutrient for microscopic organisms and as a foraging cue to attract fish. DMSP is also the precursor of a gas that helps to form clouds.</p><p>Despite DMSP’s potential large-scale effects, it is still not clear what role it plays in the organisms that produce it, or how it is transferred from the microalgae that produce it to the bacteria that use it. It is thought that DMSP could potentially protect the cells from sudden changes in the amount of salt in the seawater (salinity) or from other damage, such as oxidative stress – a build-up of harmful chemicals inside cells.</p><p>In a controlled setting using artificial seawater, Raina et al. used high-resolution imaging and chemical analysis to track the journey of DMSP from microalgae to recipient bacteria. The results show that similar to land plants, algae store DMSP in the compartments that regulate cell pressure and photosynthesis. The presence of DMSP in these locations also supports its proposed role in protecting cells from changes in salinity or oxidative damage.</p><p>A future step will be to identify the genes involved in producing DMSP in microalgae. This knowledge could be used to create mutants that are either incapable of producing this molecule or that overproduce it. In combination with the high-resolution imaging techniques described here, this will allow researchers to fully understand the role that DMSP plays in these organisms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23008.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23008.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>phytoplankton-bacteria</kwd><kwd>NanoSIMS</kwd><kwd>ToF-SIMS</kwd><kwd>biogeochemical cycling</kwd><kwd>symbiosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>phytoplankton-bacteria interaction</kwd><kwd>sulfur cycle</kwd><kwd>DMSP</kwd><kwd>NanoSIMS</kwd><kwd>stable isotope labelling</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE160100636</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raina</surname><given-names>Jean-Baptiste</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ANNiMS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raina</surname><given-names>Jean-Baptiste</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AMMRF Centre for Microscopy, Characterisation and Analysis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raina</surname><given-names>Jean-Baptiste</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The intracellular location of a key sulfur compound, dimethylsulfoniopropionate, was identified in microalgae and its subsequent uptake by marine bacteria was quantified using a combination of secondary-ion mass-spectrometry techniques.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Interactions between marine phytoplankton and bacteria constitute an important ecological linkage in the oceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cole, 1982</xref>), controlling chemical cycling and energy transfer to higher trophic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azam and Malfatti, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Falkowski et al., 2008</xref>). The cycling of sulfur, an essential element for living organisms, depends on the metabolic interactions between these two Kingdoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sievert et al., 2007</xref>). A striking example is the production of the sulfur compound dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) by phytoplankton and its degradation by marine bacteria (and phytoplankton themselves) into the climate-active gas dimethylsulfide (DMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcolombri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayers and Gras, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Todd et al., 2007</xref>). The subsequent release of DMS into the atmosphere contributes 90% of biogenic sulfur emissions and initiates the formation and growth of aerosols, thereby enhancing cloud formation and sunlight scattering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayers and Gras, 1991</xref>). This highlights how chemical interactions occurring between marine microorganisms across micrometre-scales can ultimately have large-scale impacts on climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sievert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simó, 2001</xref>). However, direct measurements of these metabolic interactions, critical to the global sulfur cycling, have not previously been possible at the scale where they occur, the sub-cellular level.</p><p>In the surface ocean, the largest quantities of sulfur are present as dissolved sulfate, which constitutes the main sulfur source for phytoplankton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sievert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stefels, 2000</xref>). Most of the sulfur derived from sulfate uptake is converted by these organisms into sulfur-based amino acids, and a fraction is ultimately used to synthesise DMSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stefels, 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Globally, more than a billion tons of DMSP are produced every year, which has been estimated to represent up to 10% of the amount of carbon fixed by phytoplankton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simó et al., 2002</xref>). However, despite the central role played by DMSP in the marine sulfur cycle, a mechanistic understanding of the biochemistry at the heart of DMSP cycling is currently lacking. Previous studies in higher plants provided strong evidence that DMSP biosynthesis starts in the cytosol and ends in the chloroplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trossat et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">1998</xref>). However, DMSP biosynthesis occur through a different route in phytoplankton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stefels, 2000</xref>), and we still do not know: (1) where this compound is produced and stored in phytoplankton cells; (2) what are its functions; and (3) how efficiently it is transferred from phytoplankton producers to bacterial degraders.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23008.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DMSP biosynthetic pathway targeted in this study.</title><p>Sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) taken up from seawater by <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> is converted to sulfite (SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>), sulfur-based amino acids and finally DMSP.

To prevent direct uptake of <sup>34</sup>S-sulfate by bacteria, all <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cultures were rinsed thoroughly and re-inoculated into ASW containing sulfate in natural isotopic abundance (<sup>nat</sup>S-ASW) before addition of bacterial cells. Two different bacterial strains were added to the rinsed cultures and co-incubated for six hours: (i) <italic>Pseudovibrio</italic> sp. P12, a DMSP-degrading bacterium isolated from healthy corals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raina et al., 2016</xref>), selected because of its worldwide distribution in coastal waters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shieh et al., 2004</xref>) and its abundance in benthic invertebrate communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bondarev et al., 2013</xref>); and (ii) a control, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> W (ATCC 9637), a widely studied and fully sequenced strain, able to grow in seawater and not capable of degrading DMSP. To precisely localise bacterial cells, both strains were pre-grown in a medium enriched in the rare stable isotope <sup>15</sup>N (in amino-acids and ammonium form). The cellular incorporation of the stable isotope tracers (<sup>34</sup>S and <sup>15</sup>N) was identified by an increase in the sulfur (<sup>34</sup>S/<sup>32</sup>S) and/or nitrogen (<sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N) ratio above their natural abundance values (0.043 and 0.0037, respectively).</p><p><italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cell numbers doubled during the incubation period in the medium containing <sup>34</sup>S-labelled sulfate, reaching approximately 2.9 million cells ml<sup>−1</sup> after 18 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). LC-MS analyses carried out at the end of the experiment on extracted <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells confirmed that all cultures initially incubated with <sup>34</sup>S-sulfate were highly enriched in <sup>34</sup>S-DMSP, which represented up to 46% of the DMSP molecules present in samples analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). This result confirms that sulfur atoms used by dinoflagellates to synthesise DMSP can originate from the uptake of inorganic sulfate derived from seawater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stefels, 2000</xref>). In addition to <sup>34</sup>S-DMSP, unexpectedly high levels of <sup>32</sup>S-DMSP (ranging from 54% to 66% of total DMSP) were recorded in <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

To understand more precisely the functional role of DMSP, we used two SIMS approaches to infer its location within cells. To effectively prevent the loss of DMSP from the cells, the entire sampling procedure leading to SIMS analyses had to be water-free, with all steps performed under strict anhydrous conditions. For this, we used cryopreservation techniques followed by freeze substitution in an acrolein-ether mixture. This method has routinely been used to successfully preserve cellular ions and compounds in a variety of systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altus and Canny, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashford et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaiser et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marshall et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mostaert et al., 1996</xref>), with the acrolein stabilizing and preserving cellular proteins, nucleic and fatty acids through cross linking, while the low temperature, anhydrous conditions ensure preservation and retention of diffusible ions and water-soluble molecules (such as DMSP). The inclusion of acrolein ensures excellent cell structural preservation at a low temperature, which is required for high resolution NanoSIMS analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaiser et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marshall, 1980</xref>).</p><p>ToF-SIMS revealed that <sup>34</sup>S-DMSP was present and abundant in the preserved cells following resin embedding, with a ratio of <sup>34</sup>S-DMSP/<sup>32</sup>S-DMSP matching the bulk analyses carried out with LC-MS prior to embedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). NanoSIMS analysis revealed that <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> exposed to <sup>34</sup>S-labelled sulfate were nine times more enriched in <sup>34</sup>S than the cells in the control (<sup>34</sup>S/<sup>32</sup>S ratio in <sup>34</sup>S-ASW treatments: 0.391 ± 0.046, compared to <sup>nat</sup>S-ASW controls 0.044 ± 0.001 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>]). Furthermore, substantial spatial variability in <sup>34</sup>S enrichment was detected within <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells. Relatively low level of enrichments were detected in the nucleus (<sup>34</sup>S/<sup>32</sup>S: 0.087 ± 0.004) which might correspond to the presence of <sup>34</sup>S-labelled amino-acids in the histone-like proteins that condense <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> DNA into chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shoguchi et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

However, the largest <sup>34</sup>S enrichment was observed in small hotspots often observed near the <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cell periphery (<sup>34</sup>S/<sup>32</sup>S: 0.971 ± 0.059; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), reaching more than 22 times the natural abundance level. Based on their small size and their high <sup>34</sup>S enrichment, these hotpots are likely storage droplets containing sulfolipids, a group of sulfur compounds known to accumulate in <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garrett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yuyama et al., 2016</xref>).

We were not able to detect methionine or cysteine using LC-MS or ToF-SIMS, which suggest that the intracellular concentration of these sulfur based amino-acids was relatively low.

The <italic>in vivo</italic> half-life of •OH is 10<sup>−9</sup> seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sies, 1993</xref>), which implies that these highly reactive molecules can damage lipids, nucleic acids, amino-acids or carbohydrates present in their direct vicinity. To be an effective antioxidant, a molecule needs not only to be able to scavenge ROS, but also to be located close to their source. Although the capacity of DMSP to detoxify ROS is established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sunda et al., 2002</xref>), it has not been previously possible to ascertain its specific cellular function because its location is still unknown. If some DMSP is located in the cytoplasm, as suggested by our NanoSIMS data, it will be ideally localised to act as an osmolyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kiene et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, the presence of strong <sup>34</sup>S signals in and around chloroplasts, where ROS are formed, support its role as an antioxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sunda et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Following synthesis by phytoplankton, DMSP constitutes an important carbon and sulfur source for heterotrophic marine bacteria, which can either demethylate the compound and incorporate its sulfur into proteins or cleave it to produce DMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curson et al., 2011</xref>). At the termination of the experiment, total DMSP concentrations in <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells inoculated with the DMSP-degrading bacterium <italic>Pseudovibrio</italic> sp. P12 were 31% lower relative to those containing no bacteria or bacteria unable to degrade DMSP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). As <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> abundance did not differ between the treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), the lower DMSP concentrations recorded are likely a consequence of the presence of <italic>Pseudovibrio</italic> cells able to degrade this compound. We sequenced the genome of <italic>Pseudovibrio</italic> sp. P12, revealing that this bacterium harbours a complete DMSP cleavage pathway, including a DMSP acyl-CoA transferase (encoded by <italic>dddD</italic>), a DMSP transporter (<italic>dddT</italic>) and the downstream catabolic enzymes (<italic>dddB-C</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Todd et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raina et al., 2016</xref>). Further analyses using NMR revealed that this DMSP degradation pathway was functional, enabling this strain to convert high concentrations of DMSP into DMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raina et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, <italic>Pseudovibrio</italic> sp. P12 harbours homologues of genes involved in the demethylation pathway (<italic>dmdA-B-C-D</italic>), though these genes have a relatively low sequence identity (24%, 30%, 43% and 32%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raina et al., 2016</xref>) to the genes originally identified in <italic>Ruegeria pomeroyi</italic> DSS-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reisch et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Bacteria-sized <sup>15</sup>N hotspots localised outside <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells in NanoSIMS images were accurately identified as inoculated bacterial cells based on their unique nitrogen isotopic signatures (1151-fold increase on average over natural abundance, <italic>n</italic> = 79, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, within the <italic>Pseudovibrio</italic> treatment, the position of these <sup>15</sup>N hotspots correlated exactly with <sup>34</sup>S hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which were characterised by a 3.3-fold increase in the <sup>34</sup>S/<sup>32</sup>S ratio over natural abundance (<italic>n</italic> = 60, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). These observations confirmed that <italic>Pseudovibrio</italic> cells assimilated <sup>34</sup>S-labelled <italic>Symbiodinium</italic>-derived metabolites. A 34% increase was also recorded in the mean <sup>34</sup>S/<sup>32</sup>S ratio of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (0.058 ± 0.002; <italic>n</italic> = 19), which are unable to degrade DMSP (compared to controls: 0.0438, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>).

In contrast, the high <sup>34</sup>S enrichment recorded in <italic>Pseudovibrio</italic> cells, together with the significant decrease of particulate DMSP recorded in <italic>Pseudovibrio-</italic>inoculated treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>), are likely due to the incorporation and degradation of DMSP. A comparison of <sup>34</sup>S uptake between the two bacterial strains further highlights differences in their capacity to metabolise DMSP; <italic>Pseudovibrio</italic> incorporated seven times more sulfur than <italic>E. coli</italic> during the six-hours incubation (<italic>Pseudovibrio</italic>: specific uptake of 6.4 ± 0.3 ng S mg<sup>−1</sup> of dry weight, <italic>n</italic> = 60; <italic>E. coli</italic>: 0.9 ± 0.1 ng S mg<sup>−1</sup> of dry weight, <italic>n</italic> = 19). However, enzymatic cleavage of <sup>34</sup>S-DMSP into volatile <sup>34</sup>S-DMS, which diffuses out of <italic>Pseudovibrio</italic> cells and is therefore not captured by our NanoSIMS measurements, are likely to have caused an underestimation of the amount of sulfur cycled by this bacterium.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23008.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Representative NanoSIMS ion images of <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells exposed to <sup>34</sup>S- or <sup>nat</sup>S-artificial seawater (ASW) for 18 days and subsequently inoculated with two different bacterial strains for six hours.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Timeline of the experiment.

Here we used two SIMS approaches to directly visualise the accumulation and subsequent transfer of DMSP between marine microalgae and bacteria with unprecedented sub-cellular resolution. We applied a method that enables the preservation of water-soluble compounds, such as DMSP, in samples. This procedure, applicable to any system, may serve as a template to study the sub-cellular localization and identification of other small and highly diffusible molecules. In addition, similarly to other recent stable isotope approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stefels et al., 2009</xref>), our method may be used to quantify the production rate of DMSP at the single cell level. We confirmed that <sup>34</sup>S-DMSP was the main organic sulfur compound within the algal cells and we subsequently localised large quantities of the sulfur tracer <sup>34</sup>S in algal vacuole, cytoplasm and chloroplasts. This strongly indicates that the relative concentrations of DMSP are higher in these key cellular locations, providing corroborative evidence for its functional role in mitigating both osmotic and oxidative stresses. Taken together, we have demonstrated that it is possible to image and quantify DMSP in phytoplankton and their associated bacteria at the sub-cellular scale. These methods open the way to further studies resolving the role of DMSP in phytoplankton and its contribution to phytoplankton-bacteria interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Isolation of <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> and bacteria</title><p>Cells of <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> type C1 (confirmed by sequencing of the ITS1 gene) used in this study were isolated from air-brushed tissues of the coral <italic>Acropora tenuis</italic>, which had been collected from Magnetic Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia (latitude 19°10’S; longitude 146°50’E).

The authors main focus is on the biosynthesis of dimethylsulfonioproprionate (DMSP), a major organic sulfur compound produced in large amounts by many marine phytoplankton, especially dinoflagellates. The authors used cutting-edge methods such as NanoSIMS, ToF-SIMS, and LCMS to identify DMSP and to localize sulfur in the cells. They also carried out an experiment in which bacteria were added to <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S-labeled cultures to look at the assimilation of <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S derived from the <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> by the bacteria. Both DMSP degrading and non-degrading bacteria were used, and the bacteria were pre-labeled with 15N to allow them to be confidently localized with the NanoSIMS.</p><p>The study represents amazing application of technology. I do however feel that some of the interpretations about DMSP localization need to be tempered. Based on the information provided, I don't think they can rule out the significant contribution of other organic sulfur compounds in the signals they observed with the NanoSIMS. The ToF-SIMS provided some identification of <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S-DMSP in the cells but it wasn't clear to me whether they could exclude the occurrence of sulfur compounds, like cysteine and methionine, or a host of other possible organic sulfur compounds.</p><p>The authors assume that most of the cellular sulfur is DMSP. They cite an older study by Matrai and Keller that concluded that 50-90% of the cellular sulfur is DMSP. 50% might be reasonable, but 90% is probably not, given that there are many other organic sulfur compounds in living cells. I think the authors need to be more cautious in interpreting their data. This goes to my general criticism – that the authors are assuming most of the <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S associated with the cells is DMSP. It certainly seems that some of it is, and that is great. But they really haven't ruled out other sulfur compounds and the nanoSIMS doesn't distinguish what compounds the <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S is in. To support their argument that sulfur amino acids are not important, the authors say that &quot;for <italic>Symbiodinium</italic>, methionine and cysteine occur at a ratio of 1 per 1000 amino acid residues&quot; (Results and Discussion). They cite Markell and Trench (1993) for this information. This struck me as an extremely low sulfur amino acid content and it seems very unlikely given that sulfur amino acids are present in virtually all proteins, with cysteine being important in the active site of many enzymes, including DMSP lyase, which <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> produces. I looked at the Markell and Trench paper and I found that the authors have misrepresented the earlier work in the way they cited it. First, the data in Markell and Trench are for proteins in cellular exudates not necessarily the cells themselves; the present study is looking at the cells. Second, Markell and Trench report only Methionine data; cysteine was not reported, most likely because cysteine is difficult to quantify because of oxidation of the sulfhydryl group. Third, Markell and Trench looked at 5 different <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> strains and their Table 3 shows values for methionine per 1000 residues of 7, 7, 9, 17 and 1 in the 5 strains, respectively. So only one of the 5 strains had 1 methionine per 1000, with the others having about an order of magnitude more. And again, cysteine was not counted. So, there must be more sulfur in those cells besides DMSP. The data must be interpreted with this in mind. Overall, I am not convinced from the data presented that the authors have &quot;confirmed that <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S-DMSP was the main organic sulfur compound within the algal cells&quot; (Results and Discussion).</p><p>The title of the paper mentions rapid cycling of DMSP between microbes, but the results in this paper are not presented as rates. And I raise the point that some DMSP might have been released from cells as a result of the manipulations, so the rate at which transfer from the phytoplanker to the bacteria happens is still an open question.</p><p>It's not clear what the TOF-SIMS actually measures. I looked this up and I think I understand that it can give masses of fragments released by the ion beam and thus can provide some identification information. But I don't know enough about the specificity/selectivity/sensitivity of such an approach. They say that they observed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S-DMSP this way. Were other compounds looked for? More details are needed.</p><p>The full reference for the Markell and Trench (1993) paper I cited in my review is:</p><p>Markell, D. A. &amp; Trench, R. K. Macromolecules exuded by symbiotic dinoflagellates in culture: amino acid and sugar composition. J. Phycol. 29, 64-68 (1993).</p><p>I specifically referred to their Table 3 for Methionine data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is an exciting and technically ground breaking report that helps nanoSIMS deliver the scientific potential it purportedly has. Understanding why DMSP is made by phytoplankton is one of the major challenges left in the DMSP story and this paper is very timely in demonstrating that it can be tracked at an intracellular level between phytoplankton and bacteria.</p><p>I am less sure this work has revealed any great understanding about how DMSP is made and consumed by bacteria, and certainly not its rate of production or how it is cycled. It is exciting as a milestone paper that proves the technique can be used to demonstrate important aspects of DMSP dynamics and for the data showing subcellular location. It will open the door to further hypothesis driven work by the authors and others to interrogate the synthesis and molecular roles of this molecule at the sub-cellular level.</p><p>I'm not sure the title reflects the real impact of this work. Stating it &quot;…reveals rapid…&quot; is misleading as the incubation period for DMSP uptake by bacteria was 6 hr – is that really rapid; and is this really what is important about this work? I feel that the sub-cellular location of DMSP in phytoplankton and bacteria is the important aspect and the title should reflect this more closely.</p><p>The authors have used the word &quot;rate&quot; and &quot;cycling&quot; in a number of places. I do not believe there is any data that reports rates of DMSP synthesis. I see rate methods (subsection “Sulfur uptake”, last paragraph etc.) and data bacterial uptake rates (e.g. Results and Discussion, seventh paragraph) – so I feel you need to be more specific and specify bacterial rates. And the cycling observed was the presence of DMSP in <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> (and sub-cell locations) and presence of DMSP in bacteria. Is this really cycling, or just a transfer and/or degradation step within a cycle?</p><p>I found that there was lots of good discussion and speculation about what the data might mean, but actually relatively little presentation and interpretation of the data (e.g. Results and Discussion, fifth paragraph). The authors need to redress this balance. In particular, data relating to the enrichment of S in the organelles is crying out for more interpretation – as this is new and you have brilliant nanoSIMS images of subcellular localisation that I do not feel have been mined anywhere near enough. If this is not possible, it is important to make this limitation clear in the text, as this would be an important limitation of the methodology or your use of it.</p><p>A comment: there was no mention of Stefels 2009 (Limnol. Oceanogr.: Methods 7, 2009, 595-611) work reporting use of stable isotopes to measure DMSP synthesis rates. Could the authors evaluate their approach to that of Stefels D2O approach – maybe comment whether nanoSIMS can be used in a similar way – as these are both important advances in methodology; somewhere around the last paragraph of the Results and Discussion?</p><p>It was difficult to follow which images were being referred to, as the individual image files were not labelled. This might be an oddity of the <italic>eLife</italic> submission system, I accept.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23008.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Two reviewers have very carefully evaluated this paper and both came to similar conclusions that while the experiments are elegant, the results are over interpreted as rates.

They cite an older study by Matrai and Keller that concluded that 50-90% of the cellular sulfur is DMSP. 50% might be reasonable, but 90% is probably not, given that there are many other organic sulfur compounds in living cells. I think the authors need to be more cautious in interpreting their data. This goes to my general criticism – that the authors are assuming most of the <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S associated with the cells is DMSP. It certainly seems that some of it is, and that is great. But they really haven't ruled out other sulfur compounds and the nanoSIMS doesn't distinguish what compounds the <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S is in. To support their argument that sulfur amino acids are not important, the authors say that &quot;for Symbiodinium, methionine and cysteine occur at a ratio of 1 per 1000 amino acid residues&quot; (Results and Discussion). They cite Markell and Trench (1993) for this information. This struck me as an extremely low sulfur amino acid content and it seems very unlikely given that sulfur amino acids are present in virtually all proteins, with cysteine being important in the active site of many enzymes, including DMSP lyase, which Symbiodinium produces. I looked at the Markell and Trench paper and I found that the authors have misrepresented the earlier work in the way they cited it. First, the data in Markell and Trench are for proteins in cellular exudates not necessarily the cells themselves; the present study is looking at the cells. Second, Markell and Trench report only Methionine data; cysteine was not reported, most likely because cysteine is difficult to quantify because of oxidation of the sulfhydryl group. Third, Markell and Trench looked at 5 different Symbiodinium strains and their</italic> Table 3 <italic>shows values for methionine per 1000 residues of 7, 7, 9, 17 and 1 in the 5 strains, respectively. So only one of the 5 strains had 1 methionine per 1000, with the others having about an order of magnitude more. And again, cysteine was not counted. So, there must be more sulfur in those cells besides DMSP. The data must be interpreted with this in mind. Overall, I am not convinced from the data presented that the authors have &quot;confirmed that <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S-DMSP was the main organic sulfur compound within the algal cells&quot; (Results and Discussion).</italic> </p><p>The reviewer question our claim regarding the nature of the <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S signal detected in the cells via NanoSIMS, stating that: (1) “the authors are assuming most of the <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S associated with the cells is DMSP”; and (2) “to support their argument that sulfur amino acids are not important, the authors say that &quot;for <italic>Symbiodinium</italic>, methionine and cysteine occur at a ratio of 1 per 1000 amino acid residues&quot;”. However, these two points do not accurately depict what we have done:</p><p>1) We did not assume that most of the <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S is in DMSP form, we investigated the presence of <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S-DMSP, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S-Cysteine and <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S-Methionine using ToF-SIMS in the embedded <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells and could only detect <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S-DMSP. This does not rule out the potential of other sulfur containing molecules being present, such as sulfo-lipids (see Results and Discussion, fifth paragraph). However, the data in this paper provides strong evidence that the levels of sulfur-containing amino-acids in these cells were much lower than DMSP. We have added three new paragraphs in the ToF-SIMS Methods section to clarify our methodology (subsection “Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS)”).</p><p>2) We did not use Markell and Trench (1993) to support the claim that most <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S recorded in <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> is in DMSP form. We used this reference to explain the slight enrichment in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S recorded in <italic>E. coli</italic>, a bacterium that cannot degrade DMSP. Therefore, we were not talking about cell contents here but specifically exuded sulfur compounds (which is precisely what Markell and Trench measured). Below is the text taken directly from our original submission:</p><p>“This enrichment can be explained by: (i) the capacity of <italic>E. coli</italic> to uptake small quantities of DMSP through betaine transporters to use as an osmoprotectant (Cosquer et al., 1999);</p><p>(ii) the exudation of small quantities of other sulfur-containing substrates by Symbiodinium, including methionine and cysteine, which occur at a ratio of 1 per 1000 amino acid residues in these dinoflagellates (Markell and Trench, 1993)”.</p><p>However, reviewer 2 had some highly valid concerns regarding the Table 3 presented in Markell and Trench (1993). There were indeed five different strains of <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> tested and the amount of cysteine in these species was not reported. We therefore modified the sentence as followed: “(ii) the exudation of small quantities of other sulfur-containing substrates by <italic>Symbiodinium</italic>, such as methionine, which occur at a ratio of 8.2 ± 2.6 per 1000 amino acid residues in these dinoflagellates”.</p><p><italic>The title of the paper mentions rapid cycling of DMSP between microbes, but the results in this paper are not presented as rates. And I raise the point that some DMSP might have been released from cells as a result of the manipulations, so the rate at which transfer from the phytoplanker to the bacteria happens is still an open question.</italic> </p><p>We acknowledge this point and have changed the title of the manuscript accordingly. It now reads “Subcellular tracking reveals the location of dimethylsulfoniopropionate in microalgae and visualises its uptake by marine bacteria”. In addition, we have removed all the occurrence of the word “rate”.</p><p><italic>It's not clear what the TOF-SIMS actually measures. I looked this up and I think I understand that it can give masses of fragments released by the ion beam and thus can provide some identification information. But I don't know enough about the specificity/selectivity/sensitivity of such an approach. They say that they observed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S-DMSP this way. Were other compounds looked for? More details are needed.</italic> </p><p><italic>The full reference for the Markell and Trench (1993) paper I cited in my review is:</italic> </p><p><italic>Markell, D. A. &amp; Trench, R. K.

It is exciting as a milestone paper that proves the technique can be used to demonstrate important aspects of DMSP dynamics and for the data showing subcellular location. It will open the door to further hypothesis driven work by the authors and others to interrogate the synthesis and molecular roles of this molecule at the sub-cellular level.</italic> </p><p><italic>I'm not sure the title reflects the real impact of this work. Stating it &quot;…reveals rapid…&quot; is misleading as the incubation period for DMSP uptake by bacteria was 6 hr – is that really rapid; and is this really what is important about this work? I feel that the sub-cellular location of DMSP in phytoplankton and bacteria is the important aspect and the title should reflect this more closely.</italic> </p><p>Our title has been changed to: “Subcellular tracking reveals the location of dimethylsulfoniopropionate in microalgae and visualises its uptake by marine bacteria”. We hope that the new title provides a better reflection of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>The authors have used the word &quot;rate&quot; and &quot;cycling&quot; in a number of places. I do not believe there is any data that reports rates of DMSP synthesis. I see rate methods (subsection “Sulfur uptake”, last paragraph etc.) and data bacterial uptake rates (e.g. Results and Discussion, seventh paragraph) – so I feel you need to be more specific and specify bacterial rates. And the cycling observed was the presence of DMSP in Symbiodinium (and sub-cell locations) and presence of DMSP in bacteria. Is this really cycling, or just a transfer and/or degradation step within a cycle?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer and have removed all occurrences of the word “rate”.</p><p><italic>I found that there was lots of good discussion and speculation about what the data might mean, but actually relatively little presentation and interpretation of the data (e.g. Results and Discussion, fifth paragraph). The authors need to redress this balance. In particular, data relating to the enrichment of S in the organelles is crying out for more interpretation – as this is new and you have brilliant nanoSIMS images of subcellular localisation that I do not feel have been mined anywhere near enough. If this is not possible, it is important to make this limitation clear in the text, as this would be an important limitation of the methodology or your use of it.</italic> </p><p>We have now added a new panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, breaking down the enrichment levels between all the different cellular compartments that can be safely identified in <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Following the reviewer recommendation, we have also added more interpretation of the data:</p><p>“Relatively low level of enrichments were detected in the nucleus (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S/<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">32</xref></sup>S: 0.087 ± 0.004) which might correspond to the presence of <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>S-labelled amino-acids in the histone-like proteins that condensate <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> DNA into chromosomes (Garrett et al., 2003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). […] We were not able to detect methionine or cysteine using LC-MS or ToF-SIMS, which</p><p>suggest that the intracellular concentration of these sulfur based amino-acids was relatively low.”</p><p><italic>A comment: there was no mention of Stefels 2009 (Limnol. Oceanogr.: Methods 7, 2009, 595-611) work reporting use of stable isotopes to measure DMSP synthesis rates. Could the authors evaluate their approach to that of Stefels D2O approach – maybe comment whether nanoSIMS can be used in a similar way – as these are both important advances in methodology; somewhere around the last paragraph of the Results and Discussion?</italic> </p><p>This is a good point; we have now added a sentence referring to this study in the conclusion. It now reads: “In addition, similarly to other recent stable isotope approaches (Stefels, Dacey and Elzenga, 2009), our method may be used to quantify the production rate of DMSP at the single cell level”.</p><p><italic>It was difficult to follow which images were being referred to, as the individual image files were not labelled. This might be an oddity of the eLife submission system, I accept.</italic> </p><p>We are sorry for this issue, we will verify that all figures are labelled prior to re-submission.</p></body></sub-article></article>
