<italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, uses quorum sensing (QS) to balance proliferation and transmission potential in the mammal bloodstream. A signal transduction cascade regulates this process, a component of which is a divergent member of the DYRK family of protein kinases, TbDYRK. Phylogenetic and mutational analysis in combination with activity and phenotypic assays revealed that TbDYRK exhibits a pre-activated conformation and an atypical HxY activation loop motif, unlike DYRK kinases in other eukaryotes. Phosphoproteomic comparison of TbDYRK null mutants with wild-type parasites identified molecules that operate on both the inhibitory ‘slender retainer’ and activatory ‘stumpy inducer’ arms of the QS control pathway. One of these molecules, the RNA-regulator TbZC3H20, regulates parasite QS, this being dependent on the integrity of its TbDYRK phosphorylation site. This analysis reveals fundamental differences to conventional DYRK family regulation and links trypanosome environmental sensing, signal transduction and developmental gene expression in a coherent pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>parasite</kwd><kwd>Trypanosoma</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>DYRK</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>103740/Z14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matthews</surname><given-names>Keith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WM140045</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matthews</surname><given-names>Keith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>65470</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cayla</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A trypanosome DYRK kinase that exhibits fundamental differences to conventional DYRK family regulation links parasite quorum sensing, signal transduction and developmental gene expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic cells respond to their environment via signal transduction cascades whose general structure and features have been intensively studied in model eukaryotes. These enable the adaptation to a changing environment or response to external signals that regulate cellular differentiation and specialisation. Many of these signalling cascades have been dissected in detail, revealing broadly conserved networks that regulate molecular function and interactions in evolutionarily separated eukaryotic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manning et al., 2002a</xref>). Among the most common regulatory mechanisms is through the action of proteins kinases and phosphatases, whose activity controls the reversible phosphorylation of approximately 30% of the proteome of eukaryotes, involving proteins implicated in a wide range of functions, including cell growth and cell-cycle control, cytoskeleton organisation, extracellular signal transmission and cell differentiation. The structure of conventional signalling cascades, however, is not necessarily representative of the diversity of eukaryotic life, with the environmental signalling pathways and regulatory pathways outside commonly studied model eukaryotes being poorly understood.</p><p>A tractable model to explore the diversity of eukaryotic signalling networks are kinetoplastid parasites, which separated from the eukaryotic lineage at least 500 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keeling and Burki, 2019</xref>). These organisms encode around 190 protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones et al., 2014</xref>) and are exquisitely sensitive to their environment. This sensitivity to well-defined environmental stimuli allows the molecular dissection of signalling pathways that drive the differentiation events that characterise the complex life cycles of these organisms. An exemplar is <italic>Trypanosoma brucei,</italic> a kinetoplastid parasite responsible for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT), that is transmitted through the bite of the tsetse fly. One major environmentally signalled event for <italic>T. brucei</italic> involves their differentiation in the mammal host from a replicative ‘slender form’ to an arrested and transmission-adapted ‘stumpy form’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacGregor et al., 2012</xref>). This differentiation is triggered by a quorum-sensing (QS)-like mechanism where parasites respond to the accumulation of a stumpy-induction factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reuner et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vassella et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rojas et al., 2019</xref>). Once the signal is received, it is transduced via a non-linear hierarchical signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McDonald et al., 2018</xref>) comprising at least 30 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mony et al., 2014</xref>). This includes signal processing molecules, protein kinases and phosphatases and posttranscriptional gene expression regulators as well as additional proteins of unknown function.</p><p>One of the components involved in the differentiation process is a molecule related to the protein kinase Yak sub family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McDonald et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mony et al., 2014</xref>). Yak kinases belong to the dual-specificity yak-related kinases (DYRK) family included in the CMGC group, which is over represented in trypanosomatids compared to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parsons et al., 2005</xref>). The DYRK family is subdivided into five sub families, the homeodomain-interacting protein kinases (HIPKs), the pre-mRNA processing protein four kinases (PRP4s), the Yak kinases (present in lower eukaryotes only), the DYRK1 and the DYRK2 kinases (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aranda et al., 2011</xref>). In mammals, the DYRK1/2 sub families are characterised by the DYRK-homology (DH)-box upstream of a kinase core that contains the ATP-binding domain and the activation loop. The activity of DYRK kinases is dependent on auto-phosphorylation of the second tyrosine residue in the YxY motif present in the activation loop, and they phosphorylate substrates on serine and threonine residues. The full activity of mature DYRK proteins may also require other phosphorylation events outside the kinase core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>) or may depend on their interaction with other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>). Several mammal DYRKs have also been implicated in cell differentiation. For example, human DYRK1A/murine DYRK1B and human DYRK2 have been suggested to have a role in differentiation mediated by cell cycle arrest in G1/G0 and G2/M, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maddika and Chen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yabut et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zou et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe the essential role of several unconventional features in the activity of an atypical DYRK-family kinase identified in the parasite <italic>T. brucei</italic> and that plays a major role in the quorum-sensing stimulated development from slender to stumpy forms in the mammalian bloodstream. We also describe the identification of likely <italic>T. brucei</italic> DYRK (TbDYRK) substrates and reveal their involvement in both inhibitory and stimulatory arms of the developmental control pathway. This places TbDYRK at a pivotal position in the control of parasite developmental competence, connecting signal transduction to gene expression regulatory processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tb927.10.15020 encodes for a divergent kinase of the DYRK family</title><p>To initially analyse the gene Tb927.10.15020, we performed a phylogenetic analysis using the kinase core of all members of the CMGC kinase family from human, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and all identified members of the DYRK family from <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones et al., 2014</xref>). This identified a DYRK1 family kinase (Tb927.5.1650) and a previously characterised DYRK2 member (TbDYRK2; Tb927.11.3140; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2012</xref>]). The analysis revealed that Tb927.10.15020 is a divergent DYRK belonging to a paraphyletic group of DYRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Indeed, the two <italic>C. elegans</italic> kinases with which the trypanosome protein clusters, Ce_C36B7.1 and Ce_C36B7.2, have been identified as DYRK2 kinases in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kinase.com/">kinase.com</ext-link> database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kinase.com">http://kinase.com</ext-link>) and as DYRK3 in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wormbase.org/">wormbase.org</ext-link> database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wormbase.org">https://wormbase.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Manning, 2005</xref>). It is also notable that Tb927.10.15020 presents a potential divergent DH box (NEx<sub>(2)</sub>DDx<sub>(3)</sub>Y) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 1998</xref>) specific for DYRK1/2, a divergent NAPA-1 region (Lx<sub>(3)</sub>Ex<sub>(2)</sub>Ex<sub>(15)</sub>G), but no NAPA-2, both specific for DYRK2 and present in the previously analysed TbDYRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kinstrie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Multiple sequence alignment of the kinase core of Tb927.10.15020 with several well characterised members of the DYRK family from a number of model organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), also revealed the presence of three long inserts in the trypanosome kinase. The kinase is present in the genome of different trypanosomatid organisms and sequences of the first two inserts are relatively well conserved among these orthologues, while the sequence of the last insert in Tb927.10.15020 is poorly conserved outside the <italic>brucei</italic> group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These multiple sequence alignments also revealed the presence of a serine (S856) instead of the classical glycine in the highly conserved DFG motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), as well as the presence of a histidine (H866), where usually is found a phosphorylable residue, in the HxY motif of the activation loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Analysis of this unconventional activation loop in various species revealed the motif was absent in yeast DYRKs, whereas one of 11 human DYRKs present such a motif and one of six in <italic>Drosophila.</italic> In contrast, of the seven DYRKs identified in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> kinome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones et al., 2014</xref>), four present unconventional activation motifs, of which two include a histidine (Tb927.10.15020 and Tb927.5.1650), suggesting a particular mode of regulation in trypanosomes more developed than in other species. Given the association with the DYRK family, we henceforth refer to the protein encoded by Tb927.10.15020 as TbDYRK (previously termed ‘YAK’ in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mony et al., 2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McDonald et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic analysis of the CMGC protein kinase family.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Whelan And Goldman + Freq. model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Whelan and Goldman, 2001</xref>).

(2014)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McDonald et al. (2018)</xref>. A wild-type differentiation competent cell line and a previously validated TbDYRK knock-out (KO) cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McDonald et al., 2018</xref>) were assayed in vitro using the cell permeable cyclic AMP analogue, 8-pCPT-cAMP, that promotes the expression of some characteristics of stumpy forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laxman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">MacGregor and Matthews, 2012</xref>). As expected, the wild-type cells differentiated in response to treatment, causing a 60% growth inhibition at 96 hr compared to untreated cells, whereas the TbDYRK KO cells had reduced differentiation competence, with only 23% growth inhibition at the same timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). To gain further insight into the specific function of this kinase and the role of selected residues for its kinase activity, we also created two further cell lines ectopically expressing either a TY-YFP-tagged non-mutated version of the kinase (‘NM’) or a predicted ‘kinase dead’ mutant with lysine 592 converted to alanine (‘K592A’); in each case these were expressed in cells retaining the endogenous gene. Importantly, the ectopic copy of the gene was provided with an aldolase 3’UTR and can therefore present an expression and regulatory profile different to the endogenous gene. We then induced ectopic kinase expression using doxycycline and compared the response of each cell line to 8-pCPT-cAMP. Ectopic expression of the NM version of the kinase resulted in an increased differentiation response to 8-pCPT-cAMP compared to wild-type cells (86% growth inhibition at 96 hr), whereas ectopic expression of the K592A mutant considerably reduced differentiation (27% growth inhibition at 96 hr), despite the presence of the endogenous wild-type gene, presumably through a dominant-negative mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ectopic expression of the TbDYRK drives stumpy differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The top panel shows the in vitro phenotype analysis after expression of TbDYRK in different strains treated with doxycycline in the presence (grey) or absence (black) of 8-pCPT-cAMP (n = at least two experiments in three replicates, error bars = SEM).

Therefore, as an alternative to monitor the level of expressed kinase, we measured the total amount of TbDYRK mRNA by RT-qPCR, either detecting both the endogenous and the ectopic gene-derived mRNAs or, by specifically targeting the YFP component, only detecting the ectopic gene-derived mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, middle panel). Interestingly, when TbDYRK expression was examined in the NM kinase line, the total amount of TbDYRK transcript did not exceed the level in WT cells (74 ± 18.1% of expression), despite the ectopically expressed gene contributing 31 ± 6.9% of the total TbDYRK mRNA. These results suggest that the ectopic expression of the NM kinase leads to a reduction of the endogenous mRNA and that the total amount of mRNA may be regulated. With the expression of the K592A mutant, the total amount of mRNA was 129 ± 3.1% compared to WT cells, of which 60 ± 6.3% corresponded to the K592A-YFP fusion.</p><p>Next, we determined the activity of the NM and predicted kinase-dead mutant in vitro.

The first 200 amino acids of the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> caspase 9 (Casp9) was the best available substrate, and was used to perform kinetic analysis to determine the optimal conditions to assay TbDYRK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b and c</xref>). We then applied this methodology to measure the phosphotransferase activity of the NM and K592A mutants, also expressed in and purified from insect cells. The mean of the activity measured with the NM kinase was set at 100% and the results indicated that the mutant K592A exhibited reduced activity compared to NM (48.2 ± 8.0%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, lower panel), demonstrating that the predicted ‘kinase dead’ mutation reduced but did not completely eliminate activity.</p><p>To confirm the in vitro results suggesting that the ectopic expression of the active NM kinase leads the cells to arrest at a lower concentration and potentially drives the cells to stumpy-like differentiation earlier, we infected mice with the NM strain. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> demonstrates that the parasitaemia was reduced after induction of the expression of the non-mutated kinase by provision of doxycycline at 96 hr post-infection. Further, the cells presented a strong increase of PAD1 expression as assessed by IFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) (63.7 ± 11.0% versus 8.5 ± 2.1% at 144 hr post-infection, uninduced and induced, respectively) and arrested in G1/G0 earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). These results show that the ectopic expression of active TbDYRK drives the cells to differentiate to stumpy forms at a lower parasitaemia.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>N-terminal phosphosite-residues and the HxY motif of the activation loop are essential for TbDYRK activity</title><p>We next analysed the role of selected residues and domains of the TbDYRK molecule to explore their difference from conventional eukaryotic DYRKs. First, we and others have identified nine phospho-sites on the TbDYRK protein (asterisks on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McDonald et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Urbaniak et al., 2013</xref>). Eight of these are residues located in the N-terminal domain of the protein, and one, Y868, belongs to the atypical HxY motif of the activation loop. We assessed the role of three of the N-terminal residues for kinase function, that is T76, S77 and S472, by mutating them to alanine and ectopically expressing the mutants in cells retaining the endogenous gene copies. Thereafter, similar analyses to those previously were used, namely i) scoring cell growth upon ectopic expression of the mutants in the presence or absence of 8-pCPT-cAMP in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), ii) quantification of the mRNA level of each mutant and total TbDYRK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), and iii) quantification of the phosphotransferase activity of each protein expressed in insect cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The results obtained for the WT, KO and NM repeat those presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to provide comparison with the generated mutants; the remainder are a combination of at least three independent experiments in three replicates for each mutant. Expression of the T76A and S77A mutants did not change the response to 8-pCPT-cAMP of the cells compared to WT parasites although the S77A mutant grew more slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Both mutations render the kinase completely inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) and their mRNAs were well expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). For both mutations, mRNAs derived from the mutated ectopic copy represented the majority of the total TbDYRK mRNA in each cell line (72 ± 6.3, 72 ± 1.27%), although the combined mRNA level was not elevated over wild-type abundance, implying that expression of the mutants causes regulation of transcripts derived from the endogenous gene as seen earlier. The mutation of S472, by an alanine, also completely disrupted the kinase activity and, similar to the phenotype observed with the KO cell line, generated resistance to 8-pCPT-cAMP treatment, suggesting the inactive expressed kinase prevented the function of TbDYRK expressed from the endogenous locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This phenotype could be contributed to by the high level of expression of the tagged gene, with the combined endogenous and ectopically expressed TbDYRK mRNA reaching 164 ± 11.11% of TbDYRK in wild type cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Analysis of the unconventional features of TbDYRK with respect to their phenotype, expression and activity.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) In vitro phenotype analysis after expression of TbDYRK mutants treated with doxycycline in the presence (grey) or absence (black) of 8-pCPT-cAMP (n = at least 2 experiments in three replicates; error bars = SD).

Mutations of these residues disrupt the kinase activity with an activity level of 6.84 ± 4.34% (H866A), 10.54 ± 7.4% (Y868F) and 18.02 ± 9.25% (H866A_Y868F) compared to the non-mutated (NM) protein. Expression of mutant H866A led to a similar response as WT cells to 8-pCPT-cAMP. The TbDYRK Y868F mutant mRNA was expressed at a lower level than the NM mRNA (12.05 ± 0.73%), and the cells responded to 8-pCPT-cAMP similarly to WT cells. In contrast, expression of a mutant with both mutations (H866A_Y868F) led to a slight resistance to 8-pCPT-cAMP, with the mutant being highly expressed and comprising the majority of TbDYRK mRNA in the cell, with reduction in the contribution of the mRNA from the endogenous TbDYRK allele, suggesting a negative regulation.</p><p>Overall, these data show that mutation of any of the four putative phosphosite-residues, either in the N-terminal domain or the HxY motif in the activation loop, disrupt TbDYRK kinase activity. Despite the different mutations having the same apparent effect of creating kinase-dead mutants, a range of phenotypes (increased, decreased or unchanging responsiveness to 8-pCPT-cAMP) were observed when these were ectopically expressed in cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The three inserts inside the kinase core have a major role in the kinase function</title><p>As highlighted earlier, the conventional kinase core sequence of TbDYRK is interrupted by three inserts of 36, 22 and 119 amino-acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which are predicted to be positioned peripherally to the core enzyme structure and so amenable to functional analysis by deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). Each insert was, therefore, deleted and the expressed mutants assayed for their response to 8-pCPT-cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; ΔI, II or III). Activity assays demonstrated that each of the three inserts was essential for the phosphotransferase activity of the kinase. The ΔI mutant was highly expressed, and phenotypically, this expression rendered the cells relatively resistant to 8-pCPT-cAMP-induced arrest despite the presence of the endogenous TbDYRK allele. The ΔII mutant was expressed at a similar level as NM; however, despite this and the lack of activity of this mutant, a similar phenotype as the expression of NM was observed. Thus, there was a decrease of the parasite density in response to 8-pCPT-cAMP treatment that was greater than seen with WT cells. In contrast, the inactive ΔIII mutant generated a similar phenotype to WT cells in response to the 8-pCPT-cAMP, despite its effective expression although overall growth was slower.</p><p>To explore the phenotype of the ΔII mutant, which matched the ectopic expression of the NM kinase and yet lacked kinase activity we performed a viability assay of cells where the NM or the ΔII mutant were expressed in the presence or absence of 8-pCPT-cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This revealed that expression of the inactive ΔII mutant resulted in cell death after 8-pCPT-cAMP exposure, whereas those expressing the NM kinase were viable.

Based on the structural prediction, the N-terminal lobe appears to be well conserved with the presence of the classical beta sheet β1–5 and the αC helix. The C-terminal lobe is composed of the classical beta sheet β6/7 after the hinge region, the α-helix C/D/E/F/G/H and I, and also contains the MK1 insert specific of the CMGC family and the α-helix 7 and 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kannan and Neuwald, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kannan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manning et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a,b,d</xref>). From this analysis, we predicted that the presence of this serine in place of glycine leads to a pre-activation state of the kinase with a phenylalanine in position ‘DFS-in’, and the aspartic acid pointing towards the active site, as observed on the crystal structure of active p38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). In addition, and in support of the hypothesis of a pre-active conformation of TbDYRK, the model suggests a close conformation of the ATP binding pocket with the glutamine 607 at 3.5 Å from the lysine 592, in concordance with the 3.8 Å measured between the corresponding amino acid of the active structure of p38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>).

In addition, despite the strong expression of the S856A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, middle panel) and the maintenance of around 70% of its kinase activity in vitro, the same phenotype as WT cell was observed in response to 8-pCPT-cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, top panel).

For the other selected targets, we generated conditional knock-down of the corresponding coding genes by RNAi, and for two of them, the hypothetical Tb927.1.4280 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the bilobe region protein Tb927.11.15140 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), did not observe a significant effect on the slender to stumpy differentiation in vivo. However, knock-down of hypothetical protein Tb927.4.2750 increased the capacity of the cells to differentiate into stumpy-like cells as judged by their increased sensitivity to the 8-pCPT-cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), whereas NOT5 depletion accelerated the capacity to generate PAD1-positive cells in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results suggest that these two proteins are ‘slender retainers’ that need to be inactivated or degraded to allow the cells to efficiently differentiate into stumpy forms. In contrast, TbZC3H20 is a stumpy inducer, whose activity is required for differentiation. In combination, this reveals a role for TbDYRK on both the inhibitory and stimulatory arms of the stumpy formation pathway.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The TbDYRK substrate TbZC3H20 is implicated in the slender to stumpy differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Parasitaemia of the TbZC3H20 gene KO line (KO_ZC3H20) compared to the parental cell line (AnTat1.1_J1339), n = 3, error bars = SEM.

Growth of the TbZC3H20<sup>T283A/-</sup> cell line in vivo in comparison with parental phospho-competent TbZC3H20<sup>+/+</sup> cell lines demonstrated that the mutants were hypervirulent in mice, with the parasites retaining a slender morphology, contrasting with the wild-type parasites or the intermediate cell line containing one mutated allele and one WT allele (TbZC3H20<sup>T283A/+</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5c</xref>), which became stumpy from day 5 of infection (respectively <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5d</xref>).

This was potentially related to the multiple rounds of transfection and selection required to generate these lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s8">Figure 6—figure supplement 8</xref>) or the contribution of 5’UTR control signals to production of appropriate levels of TbZC3H20 protein.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The quorum-sensing signalling pathway of trypanosomes in their mammalian host provides a framework for evolutionary analysis of signalling in a group separated from the major eukaryotic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keeling and Burki, 2019</xref>). Here, we have analysed through sequence-guided functional analysis and phospho-substrate identification an atypical DYRK component representative of a widely conserved family of proteins centrally implicated in developmental control. This has revealed striking divergence from precedent for this kinase group, particularly an atypical activation mechanism involving unconventional DFS and HxY motifs. It has also defined the first regulatory cascade directly linking environmental sensing, signal transduction and posttranscriptional regulation in a kinetoplastid parasite.</p><p>In other organisms, from yeast to mammals, DYRK kinases have roles, among other cellular functions, in cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aranda et al., 2011</xref>), stress responses, neural development, myoblast development and embryogenesis, with perturbed DYRK family activity implicated in downs syndrome and some cancers. The involvement of TbDYRK in the control of the trypanosome development, therefore, highlights the evolutionarily conserved involvement of this kinase family in differentiation processes across the diversity of eukaryotic life. Despite this, TbDYRK possesses unique characteristics that suggest kinetoplastid specific features of this kinase distinct from other eukaryotes. Particularly, our analysis of TbDYRK has generated the following model for the activation/function of this molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). In this model, the kinase would be expressed in slender forms and auto-phosphorylated, possibly in trans, as previously suggested through the action of the divergent NAPA-1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2012</xref>), on the Y868 of the activation loop during translation, as is typical for this kinase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kinstrie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lochhead et al., 2005</xref>). This auto-phosphorylation at the activation loop, the lack of a second phosphorylable residue on the activation loop (with H in place of tyrosine) and the essential role of the serine the DFS motif (replacing the conventional DFG motif) which is predicted to increase rigidity, suggest this kinase is preserved in a pre-activation state. Indeed, the mutation of this serine to alanine (DFS &gt;DFA) maintained ~70% of kinase activity in vitro, unlike mutation to a glycine which significantly reduced kinase activity. In addition, the modelling of the kinase core shows that the DFS motif is in position ‘DFS-in’, supporting the probable pre-activation state of the kinase, that would require other mechanisms for activation. For example, the kinase could be activated by phosphorylation on at least three sites in the N-terminal domain (T76, S77, S472) in response to stumpy induction factor in vivo or in response to cell permeable 8-pCPT-cAMP in vitro. The functional analysis also revealed the presence of three inserts in the kinase core of the protein that are essential for kinase function. These may assist binding to partner proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kelly and Rahmani, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sitz et al., 2004</xref>), similar to human DYRK2, that also acts as an adaptor for the formation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase EDPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maddika and Chen, 2009</xref>). Indeed, the deletion of Insert II, which is cytocidal when cells are exposed to 8-pCPT-cAMP treatment might be caused by effects on the capacity for binding partner interaction.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of the activation mechanisms and function of the TbDYRK.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Phosphorylation of the pre-active kinase in response to the stumpy inducing signal results in activation of the kinase.

This feedback regulation could be mediated via the 3’UTR of the TbDYRK transcript since the ectopic gene, provided with an aldolase 3’UTR, was not subject to the same control. The regulatory effect was not fully correlated with the kinase activity of the expressed TbDYRK mutants but did correspond to the differentiation phenotype generated by the expression of the mutants and so may relate to the activity of other components in the pathway. The combination of kinase activity and/or protein-protein interactions of TbDYRK may control the activity of posttranscriptional regulators, which would then promote differentiation through regulated mRNA stability or translation of downstream targets, but also regulate the level of TbDYRK mRNA itself. Stringent regulation of TbDYRK levels would prevent the parasite irreversibly differentiating to stumpy forms prematurely and is reflected in the very low levels of TbDYRK mRNA and protein detectable in bloodstream forms.</p><p>Two complementary quantitative phosphoproteomic approaches to identify substrates of the kinase were performed. First, we compared the phosphoproteome of WT and KO cells and identified around 400 peptides significantly differentially regulated between the cell lines. Interestingly, we observed an enrichment of proteins implicated in chromatin reorganisation and transcriptional regulation, mRNA stability and translation. For example, the histone deacetylase HDAC3 (Tb927.2.2190) presented reduced phosphorylation in the KO cell line, and the mammal DYRK1B has been shown to phosphorylate HDAC5 and 9 to promote myocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al., 2005</xref>). A previous study, on the hierarchical organisation of components implicated in the signal transduction of the stumpy differentiation pathway, has identified potential substrates of the MEKK1 kinase, another protein implicated in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McDonald et al., 2018</xref>). Comparing the studies, 12 proteins were shared between the null mutants for each kinase that were less phosphorylated, including the RNA-binding protein, RBP31 (Tb927.4.4230), which has been implicated in decreased translation or mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lueong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Gaudenzi et al., 2005</xref>), kinetoplastid kinetochore KKT4 protein (Tb927.8.3680) that is essential for chromosomal segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyoshi and Gull, 2014</xref>) and NEK17 (Tb927.10.5950), another component of the QS signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mony et al., 2014</xref>). The latter protein exhibits reduced phosphorylation on threonine 195 in both analyses, suggesting that NEK17 phosphorylation requires both TbDYRK and MEKK1 either directly or through the action of another kinase.</p><p>Phosphorylation of parasite lysate substrates with the purified active kinase identified 29 proteins that were significantly phosphorylated by the active kinase compared to the inactive mutant. Observed differences between the phosphoproteomic analysis of the null mutant and the lysate analysis are likely due to the technical and biological reasons. Firstly, the use of isobaric tags for analysis of the null and wild type parasites is more sensitive. Secondly, direct and indirect phosphorylation events could contribute to the differences observed. DYRKs are known to act as priming kinases, such that their phosphorylation of substrates is required for further phosphorylation by other kinases, such as GSK3 or PLK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gwack et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishi and Lin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nishi et al., 2008</xref>). This could contribute to the reduction of phosphorylated proteins detected in the null mutant line that are not directly phosphorylated by TbDYRK. Finally, the direct substrate analysis was carried using procyclic form lysates in order to provide sufficient material for analysis, and so stage-specific differences in substrate proteins could contribute. Nonetheless, the comparison of both analyses revealed the presence of 45 common proteins exhibiting a change in phosphorylation regardless of the direction of change or the statistical value, with two proteins that had a statistical change in phosphorylation on the same peptides. The identified molecules showed an enrichment of RNA binding proteins, which is the predicted regulatory level of control for trypanosome development, given the emphasis in kinetoplastid parasites of posttranscriptional regulation. Interestingly, conventional DYRK3 members in other eukaryotes have been identified as regulators of stress granule integrity, with the activity of the kinase influencing the dissolution of these membraneless organelles in order to control the response of cells to stress through regulation of the action of mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wippich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rai et al., 2018</xref>). Trypanosome differentiation similarly requires the regulation of TOR activity and the control of development through the dynamic association of predicted RNA binding proteins with stress granules, and TbDYRK - with features of DYRK2 and DYRK3 families - may functionally connect these regulatory components of trypanosome cell cycle exit and stumpy formation.</p><p>Genetic validation of some of the identified proteins in the stumpy differentiation pathway, by knock-out or conditional knock-down, revealed that TbDYRK acts on both the inhibitory and stimulatory arms of the differentiation control pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Indeed, knock-down of the hypothetical protein Tb927.4.2750 rendered the cells more sensitive to 8-pCPT-cAMP and knock-down of NOT5 led to an increase in cell differentiation at a lower parasitaemia. These observations suggest that the phosphorylation of these proteins by TbDYRK would inactivate their function, allowing the cells to differentiate. This identifies these proteins as so called ‘slender retainers’ that are required for the cells to remain as proliferative bloodstream forms. Conversely, the knock-out of the zinc finger protein TbZC3H20 rendered cells unable to differentiate from slender to stumpy forms, indicating that its phosphorylation by TbDYRK would activate the protein to promote differentiation, a so-called ‘stumpy inducer’. Consistent with this, the deletion of TbZC3H20 rendered the cells unable to arrest in G1/G0 and this phenotype was reproduced when only the phosphosite differentially detected in TbDYRK null mutants was mutated. Although this supports a direct relationship between TbZC3H20 phosphorylation capacity and developmental competence, we found that re-expression of a WT copy of TbZC3H20, either by inducible ectopic expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s9">Figure 6—figure supplement 9</xref>) or in its endogenous context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7</xref>), only partially restored the WT phenotype. For inducible expression, we observed TbZC3H20 ectopic expression in both induced and uninduced samples; this has the potential to select for the loss of stumpy formation capacity because differentiation regulators can generate irreversible cell cycle arrest if inappropriately expressed in slender forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McDonald et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, the multiple rounds of transfection and selection associated with reintroduction of the wild type allele into cell lines where the endogenous gene copies are replaced with the phosphosite mutant can select for reduced pleomorphism. In consequence, our biochemical and gene replacement data support a direct association of TbZC3H20 T283 phosphorylation with TbDYRK activity, but experimental challenges prevent a definitive link being fully established.</p><p>In combination this study positions TbDYRK as a pivotal regulator of the trypanosome QS sensing pathway, acting on both differentiation activators and inhibitors through phosphorylation mediated control. Moreover, its effects on TbZC3H20 link the signal transduction cascade to post transcriptional regulation in the parasite, mRNAs regulated by this molecule being important in the parasite’s developmental events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ling et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Next, samples were treated with Lambda Phosphatase (~1 U/μg of proteins) for 1 hr at 30°C, followed by another heat inactivation step of 5 min at 95°C. The kinase assay was then performed in three replicates with the active kinase NM or the inactive one (H866A), purified from insect cells, as described in the kinase assay section. To remove any trace of SDS, samples were precipitated with ice cold acetone, with a ratio of acetone/sample of 90%/10% and incubated at −20 overnight. The next day, samples were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 4°C, the supernatant discarded, and washed again with 1 ml of ice-cold acetone and re-pelleted at four degrees. The following steps were performed at the proteomic facility of the University of Edinburgh. Dried pellets were resuspended in 8M urea and a protein assay performed (Bradford Biorad). One milligram of protein extract was digested (enough for two phosphopeptide enrichments). Protein denaturation and reduction was performed in 2M urea, 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT).

trypanosomes undergo a complex life cycle in the mammalian host and in the transmitting tsetse fly. Curiously, the parasite development appears to be characterized by successions or proliferative and cell cycle-arrested stages. The best characterized transition between proliferative and arrested forms occurs in the mammalian host, where dividing slender trypanosomes differentiate to stumpy forms. This arrest occurs in response to quorum sensing, most probably in order not to prematurely overwhelm the host by high parasite numbers. In this manuscript the authors detail the potential role of a very unusual DYRK kinase, which could be a key player in the regulation of the differentiation process, and that connects the regulation of gene expression with signal transduction. This is an exciting new aspect not only for trypanosome biology, but also for our understanding of the evolution of dual specificity kinases.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An atypical DYRK kinase connects quorum-sensing with posttranscriptional gene regulation in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Álvaro Acosta Serrano (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript characterises the role of an atypical DYRK kinase in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> proliferative slender to cell cycle-arrested stumpy differentiation. Biochemical analysts of the kinase, together with in vivo and in vitro experiments provide evidence that this enzyme holds the balance between parasite proliferation and differentiation. Key amino acid residues of the divergent DYRK kinase are identified, which are essential for slender to stumpy formation.

Biochemical analysts of the kinase, together with in vivo and in vitro experiments provide evidence that this enzyme holds the balance between parasite proliferation and differentiation. Key amino acid residues of the divergent DYRK kinase are identified, which are essential for slender to stumpy formation.

The ectopic copy is provided with an aldolase 3’UTR and so its expression can show distinct regulation to the endogenous copy. We have now made this more explicit in the revised manuscript. Unfortunately, however, we cannot detect TbDYRK protein either using antibody or using the epitope tag in any of our cell lines, we believe this being caused by the low levels of overall expression of the protein. Indeed, this is why we reverted to analysing mRNA levels by RT-qPCR as a mechanism to monitor relative expression of the transgenes. With respect to the expression of inactive mutants (or indeed some other mutants that retain activity) the retention of a differentiation response is because, in all cases, the ectopic genes were expressed in the context of the endogenous gene. This was detailed in the original manuscript. Given this, in fact the S472A mutant expression did not conform to expectation. Instead the mutant appears to interfere with the normal function of the endogenous wild type TbDYRK in a dominant negative response that perturbs differentiation, potentially through interference in the interaction of TbDYRK with binding partners. This was detailed in the original manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How was the relative proportion of DYRK and YFP mRNA calculated?

Are the native UTRs present on the gene, or is it suggested that this regulation is occurring by regulatory motifs within the coding sequence?</p></disp-quote><p>The mRNA regulation of TbDYRK is indeed intriguing and we discussed this in the manuscript. Apparently, the regulation correlates more with the differentiation response of the parasites rather than being correlated with the kinase activity of TbDYRK. Explicitly, when pCPTcAMP causes cells to arrest, mRNA levels are regulated, whereas if there is not arrest (even if the treated cells show slowed growth with respect to control cells) less regulation is seen, and overall mRNA levels increase. This suggests to us that the regulation of the endogenous levels of TbDYRK mRNA is mediated through other regulators in the pathway (as we discussed in the manuscript). This feedback regulation must be mediated via the 3’UTR of the TbDYRK transcript since the ectopic gene (with an aldolase 3’UTR) is not subject to the same control. We have now amended the manuscript to be explicit on this point. Exploration of the regulatory mechanism is an interesting and important area of study but is beyond the scope of what can be included in our study which already contains a detailed analysis of the activity and substrates of TbDYRK, in addition to its control of a key differentiation regulator by site-specific phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The ZC3H20T283A/- lines are shown to be no longer differentiation competent. However, it is unclear how and in which order these cell lines were generated. Specifically, has the differentiation competent ZC3H20T283A/+ line been generated before knocking out the second allele?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valuable point that addresses whether the loss of differentiation competence is directly linked to the phosphorylation potential of ZCH20. Since the ZC3H20 T283A/- was derived from the ZC3H20 T283A/+ line there does remain the possibility of cell line/transfection/selection mediated effects contributing to the loss of differentiation competence. We think this trivial explanation is unlikely since we have analysed independent cell lines, and all showed the same phenotype; this information is now included in the revised manuscript (Figure 6—figure supplement 6). Moreover, in other experiments in our laboratory ZC3H20 RNAi results in an inducible loss of stumpy formation, confirming its role in developmental capacity.</p><p>To attempt to address the referee query more fully however, we have carried out extensive further analysis.</p><p>Firstly, we performed a ‘rescue’ experiment using the ZC3H20 T283A/- line, via ectopic expression of wild type ZC3H20 (T283). Transfectants grew slowly and finally only a single cell line began to grow well and could be analysed. However, when its phenotype was examined in vivo the line remained virulent (i.e. it did not restore developmental competence) (Figure 6—figure supplement 9). When examined for the expression of the ectopic gene copy, we found leaky expression of the transgene when uninduced and in slender forms- a scenario that selects against developmental competence because expression of wild type ZC3H20 drives a rapid terminal growth arrest as stumpy forms. We believe the failure of most clones to grow through and the selection of this virulent leaky clone is supportive of the add-back ectopic copy restoring density dependent arrest.</p><p>Nonetheless, to explore the question yet further, using CRISPR we created a direct add-back replacement (rather than ectopic expression) of the wild type ZC3H20. Endogenous 3’UTR control signals were also used to attempt to maintain physiological levels of expression (5’UTR signals inevitably differ in the constructs). The resulting cell lines partially restored the wild type phenotype, with enhanced cell cycle arrest at high parasitaemia (Figure 6—figure supplement 7C), although PAD1 expression was not detected (Figure 6—figure supplement 7B). The outcome was supportive of functional rescue with respect at least to density dependent growth arrest but the multiple rounds of transfection and selection (4 rounds) needed to generate the lines potentially selects against full restoration of developmental competence, including PAD1 expression. The lineage of cell line generation is now summarised in Figure 6—figure supplement 8.</p><p>Overall, these multiple lines of evidence support our model that TbDYRK regulates ZC3H20 likely through the T283 phosphorylation site. However, the experimental challenges of multiple transfection of pleomorphic lines has prevented definitive demonstration of this despite extensive effort. In consequence we have adapted the text of the Results section and Discussion section to reflect this caution in the interpretation of this element of the results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
