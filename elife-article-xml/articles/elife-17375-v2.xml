immunity. The prevailing view is that MDSC-mediated immunosuppression is restricted to tissues where MDSC co-mingle with T cells. Here we show that splenic or, unexpectedly, blood-borne MDSC execute far-reaching immune suppression by reducing expression of the L-selectin lymph node (LN) homing receptor on naïve T and B cells. MDSC-induced L-selectin loss occurs through a contact-dependent, post-transcriptional mechanism that is independent of the major L-selectin sheddase, ADAM17, but results in significant elevation of circulating L-selectin in tumor-bearing mice. Even moderate deficits in L-selectin expression disrupt T cell trafficking to distant LN. Furthermore, T cells preconditioned by MDSC have diminished responses to subsequent antigen exposure, which in conjunction with reduced trafficking, severely restricts antigen-driven expansion in widely-dispersed LN. These results establish novel mechanisms for MDSC-mediated immunosuppression that have unanticipated implications for systemic cancer immunity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) have emerged as important immune regulators in cross-disciplinary fields including cancer biology, immunotherapy, chronic infection, and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cripps and Gorham, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gabrilovich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"

MDSC have been most extensively characterized in the context of cancer where they thwart antitumor adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gabrilovich et al., 2012</xref>). MDSC accumulate throughout cancer progression and are linked to poor clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Waight et al., 2013</xref>) as well as resistance to chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy in murine tumor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acharyya et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alizadeh et al., 2014</xref>). MDSC exert hallmark immunosuppressive activities via production of arginase, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase that locally block activation of tumor-specific T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gabrilovich et al., 2012</xref>). These immature myeloid cells further contribute to tumor immune evasion by expressing immunosuppressive molecules such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Youn et al., 2008</xref>) and by supporting the function of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2006</xref>) and M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sinha et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beury et al., 2014</xref>). Evidence that the MDSC-T cell suppressive axis is enacted by short-lived, contact-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sinha et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gabrilovich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ostrand-Rosenberg et al., 2012</xref>) supports the prevailing view that suppressive effector functions are mainly restricted to tissues where MDSC and T cells both localize.</p><p>The majority of studies have focused on MDSC-enriched tumors and splenic reservoirs as the major locale where MDSC execute suppression of local T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gabrilovich et al., 2012</xref>). MDSC are also abundant in the circulation of tumor-bearing mice and cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ostrand-Rosenberg and Sinha, 2009</xref>) although it is not known if MDSC in the blood compartment mediate immunosuppression in situ. In contrast, MDSC are rare in lymph nodes (LN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ostrand-Rosenberg and Sinha, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia et al., 2014</xref>), and thus, their suppressive roles at these critical sites of immune priming are largely overlooked. Our prior work demonstrating that MDSC partially downregulate expression of the L-selectin LN homing receptor on naïve T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Parker et al., 2014</xref>) suggested that MDSC might interfere with T cell function by preventing access to the LN microenvironment. L-selectin–mediated tethering and rolling within vessel walls is a prerequisite for trafficking of naïve T and B cells across gateway high endothelial venules (HEV) in LN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Girard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans et al., 2015</xref>). Efficient trafficking at HEV increases the probability that activating signals are delivered to specific-antigen restricted naïve T and B lymphocytes existing at a frequency of only ~1 in 10<sup>5</sup>–10<sup>6</sup> in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oshiba et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jenkins et al., 2010</xref>). In murine tumor models, MDSC are associated with partial reduction of L-selectin on naive T cells that can be restored upon MDSC depletion using gemcitabine-based chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanson et al., 2009</xref>). However, the biological implications of L-selectin down-modulation cannot be inferred solely from expression analysis since the high L-selectin density normally present on leukocytes (~50,000–100,000 molecules per cell) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kishimoto et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simon et al., 1992</xref>) could theoretically buffer against moderate fluctuations in expression during homing. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that MDSC are capable of systemic immunosuppression by investigating: (<italic>a</italic>) the spatiotemporally-regulated mechanisms underlying MDSC-driven L-selectin down-modulation in T cells, (<italic>b</italic>) whether L-selectin loss extends to B cells which are not validated MDSC targets in cancer, (<italic>c</italic>) if moderate L-selectin loss is sufficient to compromise lymphocyte trafficking and antigen-induced priming within the intranodal compartment.</p><p>Here we report that MDSC cause far-reaching immune suppression by downregulating L-selectin at discrete anatomical sites in murine tumor models. We determined that MDSC function through a contact-dependent mechanism independent of the major L-selectin sheddase, a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 17, to target L-selectin loss exclusively on naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells located in close proximity within the splenic compartment. Surprisingly, this mechanism also takes place on both T and B cells as they circulate together with MDSC within the intravascular space. Our studies further show that even modest MDSC-driven L-selectin down-modulation is sufficient to profoundly reduce homing and antigen-dependent activation of naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in LN which is attributed to decreases in the quality of L-selectin-dependent rolling interactions within HEV. Additionally, we identify a role for MDSC preconditioning of T cells in the spleen or blood that reduces responsiveness to antigen outside these organ sites. These findings support a model in which MDSC act at remote tissue compartments to exert wide-spread, systemic immune suppression in distant LN, thus having broad implications to cancer immunity and inflammatory disease processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spatiotemporal correlation between L-selectin loss and MDSC co-localization with naïve T cells in the splenic compartment</title><p>To gain insight into the anatomical location where L-selectin downregulation occurs in vivo we mapped MDSC expansion and L-selectin density on naïve T cell subsets in lymphoid organs where expression of this LN homing receptor is known to be under tight control. In this regard, during normal development T cell precursors leave the bone marrow and emigrate to the thymus where they differentiate into L-selectin<sup>+</sup> mature T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Takahama, 2006</xref>). After exiting the thymus, naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells use L-selectin to traffic directly into LN via gatekeeper HEV, or recirculate through the spleen which is devoid of HEV and does not require L-selectin for entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Girard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans et al., 2015</xref>). In order to maximize the potential for detecting MDSC functions in various lymphoid organs we opted to use the 4T1 mammary tumor model in which tumor-produced granulocyte-colony stimulating factor drives robust expansion of MDSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Waight et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">2013</xref>). We excluded non-lymphoid organs and tumor tissues from this analysis since naïve T cells do not recirculate at a high frequency at these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fisher et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We found the thymus was devoid of myeloid cells co-expressing the canonical murine MDSC markers CD11b and Gr-1 despite high systemic MDSC burdens in 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, L-selectin was not altered on thymic naïve CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>lo</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>lo</sup> T cells when compared to non-tumor bearing controls (NTB). MDSC were also rare in peripheral LN (pLN) of 4T1-bearing mice, including tumor-draining inguinal LN, which correlated with the absence of L-selectin modulation on naïve T cells at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). MDSC exclusion from LN is likely explained by their low L-selectin expression as compared to normal naïve T cells, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The uniformly high L-selectin density detected on intranodal T cells in both control and tumor-bearing mice is suggestive of a stringent requirement for a high L-selectin threshold for entry of blood-borne T cells across HEV.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17375.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>L-selectin downregulation on naïve T cells is restricted to specific anatomical compartments associated with MDSC accumulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow cytometric analysis demonstrating CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> MDSC accumulation (% CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes, <italic>top</italic>) and L-selectin expression on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>lo</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>lo</sup> naïve T cells (<italic>below</italic>) in the indicated lymphoid organs (thymus, peripheral lymph node (pLN), inguinal (Ing) LN, tumor-draining Ing LN, spleen, and blood) of non-tumor bearing (NTB) mice or 4T1-bearing mice (tumor volume 1150 ± 150 mm<sup>3</sup>).

Splenic CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> cells from 4T1-bearing mice were confirmed to exhibit prototypical MDSC suppressor function defined by potent inhibition of CD3/CD28-driven proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (from non-tumor bearing mice) in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Conversely, control CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells from non-tumor bearing mice were not immunosuppressive. Data showing an overall decrease in naïve T cells in LN, together with an increase in spleens of 4T1-bearing mice without changes in the apoptotic index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), support the notion that suboptimal L-selectin expression reduces T cell access to LN and causes compensatory redistribution to the spleen.</p><p>We further determined that L-selectin loss on splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells correlated temporally with the extent of MDSC expansion which varied among different murine tumor types. Thus, while MDSC expansion early during tumor progression (i.e., 7 days post-4T1 implantation) coincided with significant L-selectin downregulation on naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, even greater L-selectin loss occurred at later time-points with higher 4T1 tumor burdens at subcutaneous sites or the mammary fat pad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>). Compared to the 4T1 system, MDSC expansion was delayed in C57BL/6 mice implanted with AT-3 mammary tumor cells derived from genetically-engineered MMTV-PyMT/B6 transgenic mice (MTAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Waight et al., 2013</xref>), corresponding with moderate but significant L-selectin downregulation on naïve T cell subsets at ≥21 days post-tumor implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). L-selectin downregulation also occurred on splenic T cells in other tumor models including B16 melanoma and CT26 colorectal tumor, but only in rare individual mice with abundant MDSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), consistent with observations that these tumors do not typically induce MDSC expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Youn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fisher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ito et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Clues about the spatial regulation of L-selectin emerged from immunohistological staining of the spleen that revealed dense focal accumulations of Gr-1<sup>+</sup> cells congregating with CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells in the marginal zone that were sharply segregated from intrafollicular B220<sup>+</sup> B cells in 4T1-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Additional insight into the MDSC mechanism of action came from profiling of splenic B cells that showed that while these cells express relatively low L-selectin compared to T cells as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gauguet et al., 2004</xref>), there was no change in L-selectin density on splenic B cells of tumor-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

We surprisingly found that the extent of L-selectin downregulation on adoptively-transferred CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was indistinguishable whether tumor-bearing recipient mice underwent sham surgery or splenectomy. These results suggested that L-selectin down-modulation on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can occur in the intravascular space and does not require structural scaffolds provided by organized tissue compartments.</p><p>Additional studies examined L-selectin regulation on endogenous circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and B220<sup>+</sup> B cells in the context of splenectomy. Like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we found that L-selectin was strongly downregulated on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of tumor-bearing mice regardless of whether there was an intact splenic microenvironment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the case of B220<sup>+</sup> B cells, the varying levels of baseline L-selectin detected in lymphoid organs of tumor-free mice was expected since L-selectin is known to fluctuate after B cells exit the bone marrow and recirculate through the blood and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morrison et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, we did not detect L-selectin loss in the bone marrow and splenic compartments despite increased MDSC burden in sham or splenectomized tumor-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In sharp contrast, L-selectin was nearly completely downregulated on blood-borne B220<sup>+</sup> B cells in both sham and splenectomized tumor-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These observations allowed us to pinpoint the blood compartment as the preferential site of L-selectin modulation for B cells in tumor-bearing mice. Similar results were obtained for L-selectin downregulation on circulating T and B lymphocytes if the timing sequence was reversed by allowing tumor-induced MDSC to accrue prior to splenectomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The conclusion that blood is a prominent site of L-selectin loss was further supported by the strong L-selectin downregulation observed only 2 hr after adoptive transfer of naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and B220<sup>+</sup> B cells into the MDSC-rich vascular compartment of 4T1-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Labeled cells detected in the blood at this short time-point mainly represent transferred populations retained in the vascular compartment since 2 hr is not sufficient for lymphocytes to recirculate from blood, through tissues, and back to the blood (e.g., transit times for T cells through lymph nodes, spleen, and peripheral tissues are ~8–12, 5, and 24 hr, respectively, and ~24 hr for B cells at these tissue sites) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ford, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Issekutz et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Girard et al., 2012</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17375.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>L-selectin downregulation on B cells occurs exclusively in the peripheral blood.</title><p>Splenectomy or sham surgery was performed 10 days prior to 4T1 tumor inoculation and tissues were evaluated for MDSC expansion and L-selectin expression 22 days after tumor implantation (tumor volume ~1000 mm<sup>3</sup>).

However, since gemcitabine has a wide spectrum of activities that also influence other immune cells (e.g., CD4<sup>+</sup> Treg and Th17 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bracci et al., 2014</xref>), we took several alternative approaches to further explore MDSC contributions to reducing L-selectin in vivo. Partial MDSC depletion (~50%) by administration of anti-Gr-1 antibody at three day intervals after 4T1 implantation had no impact on tumor growth but significantly rescued L-selectin on circulating naïve T and B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Complementary studies showed that L-selectin loss was reversible in an environment devoid of MDSC. In this regard, when CD11b<sup>+</sup> MDSC were depleted from L-selectin<sup>lo</sup> splenic populations from 4T1-bearing mice we observed complete L-selectin recovery on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells within four days after culture or post-adoptive transfer into non-tumor bearing recipient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Finally, MDSC from tumor-bearing mice (&gt;95% CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup>) but not CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells from non-tumor bearing controls were shown to cause moderate but significant L-selectin loss during co-culture with splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

We considered that these results might be explained by T cell preconditioning (i.e., before antigen exposure) by MDSC within tumor-bearing mice. Thus, we set up parallel in vitro culture systems to model the high splenic MDSC concentrations that T cells would encounter in tumor-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These studies revealed that transient co-culture of MDSC with naïve OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> or DO11.10 CD4<sup>+</sup> TcR-transgenic cells (i.e., 16 hr ‘preconditioning’ phase), followed by removal of MDSC, markedly suppressed T cell proliferation during subsequent challenge with cognate peptide antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the impact of L-selectin deficits on antigen-responsiveness in an in vivo model that depends on L-selectin-dependent trafficking for access to Ag.

We used tumor-free recipients to interrogate the causal relationship between L-selectin loss and impaired adaptive immunity which would otherwise be difficult to assess in tumor-bearing mice because of the additional immunosuppressive mechanisms operative in LN (e.g., tolerogenic DC, Treg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Munn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2010</xref>).

These OT-I cells were largely differentiated effectors based on interferon-γ production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).

MDSC in the splenic marginal zone also precondition CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells which leads to suppressed responsiveness to antigen outside the splenic environment.

A rate-limiting step for immune surveillance involves trafficking at HEV which ensures that DC present cognate antigens to a sufficiently diverse repertoire of naïve T cells in order to drive expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cell pools and B cell antibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Girard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans et al., 2015</xref>). Here we provide evidence that tumor-induced MDSC act from remote sites through two independent mechanisms to suppress systemic adaptive immunity in widely dispersed LN. The major findings of the current study establish that MDSC located in anatomically discrete sub-compartments of the spleen and, unexpectedly in the blood, downregulate expression of the L-selectin LN homing receptor in murine CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> naïve T cell subsets and on blood-borne murine B cells. In the case of naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, even moderate L-selectin loss severely limits trafficking across HEV, causing a profound reduction in antigen-driven expansion within the LN stroma. Thus, MDSC-induced L-selectin down-modulation could significantly impair immune surveillance during the early phases of tumor escape as well as compromise immunotherapy regimens dependent on immune cell access to LN. Additionally, our results reveal that T cells can be preconditioned by MDSC in the spleen or blood, resulting in diminished responsiveness to subsequent challenge with cognate antigen. Collectively, these findings lead us to propose that LN are important sites of MDSC suppression which could not be predicted from routine profiling of immune constituents since MDSC are largely excluded from this lymphoid compartment.</p><p>Results of the current study expand our understanding of the biological role of splenic and circulating MDSC in repressing immune function in a setting of tumor progression. The spleen is already considered a major reservoir for peripheral MDSC with direct immunosuppressive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gabrilovich et al., 2012</xref>), while the blood is not known to be an active site of MDSC function in situ. In line with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ugel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>), we found discrete compartmentalization of MDSC within the splenic marginal zone of tumor-bearing mice. This localization was linked to specific downregulation of L-selectin on T cells but not B cells, consistent with MDSC exclusion from B cell follicles. Whether this restricted spatial distribution of MDSC is a byproduct of their profuse systemic accumulation or reflects preferential trafficking and/or retention is an open question. We initially predicted that splenic MDSC act directly on naïve T cells only within the splenic stroma, which is then reflected in the blood as L-selectin<sup>int/lo</sup> T cells exit the spleen. However, subsequent analysis of splenectomized tumor-bearing mice revealed that the blood is a major site for MDSC-targeted L-selectin downregulation for both T and B cells. Evidence that L-selectin down-modulation is restricted to specific organs as well as sub-anatomical compartments supports a scenario in which MDSC-to-target cell contact is a prerequisite for L-selectin down-modulation, as validated by MDSC-lymphocyte co-cultures in the present study. There is precedent from other systems that biological consequences occur as a result of cell-to-cell interactions within the blood, suggesting that MDSC could also be expected to have contact-dependent intravascular activities. In this regard, leukocyte-leukocyte interactions along vessel walls contribute to recruitment at inflammatory sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grailer et al., 2009</xref>) while stable aggregates comprised of circulating tumor cells and other cell types (e.g., leukocytes, platelets, stromal cells) function as ‘traveling niches’ to facilitate metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krebs et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the high circulating MDSC concentration in tumor-bearing mice shown in the current report and in cancer patients (e.g., human MDSC comprise up to 45% of PBMC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Trellakis et al., 2013</xref>) makes serial contact with target lymphocytes plausible either in free-flowing blood, within multicellular aggregates, or in marginated pools within capillaries, sinusoids or intravascular niches in the lung where naïve lymphocytes are transiently retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galkina et al., 2005</xref>). Regardless of whether the loss occurs in spleen or blood, L-selectin status is a critical determinant of homing potential since lymphocytes emigrating from each of these sites have nearly immediate access to LN HEV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The extent of the homing defect in HEV is remarkable considering the modest change in overall L-selectin surface density observed for T cells in the AT-3 tumor model. During leukocyte rolling it is estimated that ~5 microvillous tips are in simultaneous contact with endothelial surfaces, with L-selectin concentration exceeding 90,000 molecules per μm<sup>2</sup> at a single microvillous tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shao and Hochmuth, 1999</xref>). Our results suggest that relatively subtle decreases in L-selectin density within these multivalent focal patches increase rolling speed, thus destabilizing adhesion within HEV. These data are reminiscent of similar observations for diminished rolling quality due to intermediate L-selectin downregulation in genetically engineered L-selectin<sup>+/−</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gauguet et al., 2004</xref>). Our intravital data demonstrate that L-selectin modulation by MDSC is of primary importance during adhesion on the lumenal surface of HEV prior to extravasation. These findings do not, however, exclude the possibility that MDSC-mediated L-selectin loss also has downstream consequences in light of in vitro studies implicating extended roles for L-selectin in controlling the polarity of monocytes necessary for transendothelial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rzeniewicz et al., 2015</xref>) as well as antigen-driven acquisition of cytolytic function by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The current results establish an unprecedented correlation between MDSC expansion, L-selectin loss by T and B lymphocytes, and a &gt;2 fold increase in circulating sL-selectin in tumor-bearing mice. Emerging clinical studies have reported that serum sL-selectin levels are also increased in patients with solid tumors (i.e., bladder and thyroid cancer), although links to MDSC were not explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choudhary et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kobawala et al., 2016</xref>). Lymphocytes are the primary source of the circulating sL-selectin pool under normal conditions, as demonstrated in studies showing that serum sL-selectin concentrations are reduced ~70% in lymphocyte-deficient <italic>Rag2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tu et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, increased serum sL-selectin in tumor-bearing mice likely reflects MDSC-induced cleavage from lymphocyte surface membranes although MDSC could be an additional source of sL-selectin. Accordingly, two independent but complementary mechanisms are proposed to reduce LN trafficking in cancer: (1) MDSC-directed downregulation of lymphocyte L-selectin which we showed negatively impacts homing in HEV, and (2) elevated circulating sL-selectin which, at the concentrations detected in tumor-bearing mice (1 µg/mL in tumor-bearing mice compared to ~0.4 µg/mL in tumor-free controls), reportedly functions as a competitive antagonist of L-selectin-directed lymphocyte homing in vivo. In this regard, elevation of circulating sL-selectin levels in L-selectin<sup>−/−</sup> mice to ~0.9 and 1.5 μg/mL by serum infusion reduces lymphocyte trafficking to LN HEV by ~40% and 65%, respectively, while concentrations of ~0.6 μg/mL are not inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tu et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, MDSC-induced L-selectin downregulation does not depend on the main L-selectin sheddase, ADAM17, acting either in a <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> orientation. In this regard, evidence that MDSC-induced L-selectin loss occurs in ADAM17-deficient lymphocytes indicates that MDSC do not activate lymphocyte-intrinsic ADAM17 to cleave L-selectin in <italic>cis</italic>. Nor does ADAM17 present on the surface of MDSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Parker et al., 2014</xref>) act in <italic>trans</italic> to target L-selectin on juxtaposed lymphocyte membranes since downregulation occurs in the presence of ADAM17-specific inhibitors and in cells expressing a mutated ADAM17 cleavage site (i.e., L(E)-selectin). The mechanism underlying MDSC-induced L-selectin modulation closely parallels in vitro observations for an ADAM17 and ADAM10-independent ecto-protease during constitutive or inducible L-selectin shedding (i.e., triggered by antibody cross-linking of L-selectin and TcR) that is unaffected by mutation of the ADAM17 cleavage site, ADAM17/ADAM10 inhibitors, or ADAM17-deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stoddart et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jasuja and Mier, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walcheck et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2006</xref>). Of note, tumor-induced MDSC are enriched for multiple ecto-proteases including ADAM28, ADAM9, collagenase-3 (MMP13), stromelysin (MMP3), macrophage elastase, and leukocyte elastase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aliper et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, at least one of these proteins, recombinant stromelysin (MMP3), can function in <italic>trans</italic> to cleave lymphocyte L-selectin in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Preece et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that one of the wide array of MDSC ecto-proteases with different structural substrate requirements from ADAM17 contribute to lymphocyte L-selectin downregulation in cancer.</p><p>Our results have broad translational implications for cancer immunotherapy including vaccines that aim to stimulate antitumor antibody production. While B cells reportedly support MDSC development during cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bodogai et al., 2015</xref>), to our knowledge this is the first demonstration that B cells are targets of tumor-induced MDSC. These findings complement studies in autoimmunity showing that MDSC derived from mice with collagen-induced arthritis directly suppress B cell proliferation and antibody production in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crook et al., 2015</xref>). The nearly complete loss of L-selectin detected on circulating B cells in response to MDSC in our study strongly suggests that B cell homing at HEV would be effectively blocked, especially given the well-established sensitivity of B cells to perturbations in L-selectin density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gauguet et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, antibody responses would be expected to be severely diminished as a result of MDSC-induced suboptimal trafficking of both naïve B cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> precursors of the follicular helper T cells required for T-dependent antibody production in LN. Collectively, our findings could provide an explanation for observations that patients diagnosed with premalignant advanced colonic adenomas who have elevated circulating MDSC failed to produce antibodies in response to vaccination with the MUC-1 tumor-associated antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kimura et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Emerging data also highlight the importance of LN trafficking for durable responses to T cell-based ACT cancer immunotherapy. Presently, there is strong interest in developing ex vivo activation protocols that maintain expression of LN homing receptors on T cell immunotherapeutics. This is founded on recent preclinical studies demonstrating that adoptive transfer of activated L-selectin<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup> stem cell memory T cells (T<sub>SCM</sub>) has greater antitumor efficacy than terminally differentiated L-selectin<sup>lo</sup>CCR7<sup>lo</sup> cytolytic effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gattinoni et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2011</xref>). The superior efficacy of T<sub>SCM</sub> is attributed to the requirement for adoptively-transferred cells to undergo L-selectin-dependent trafficking via HEV to access intranodal growth and survival factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gattinoni et al., 2005</xref>). Of related interest are preclinical data showing that the efficacy of ACT therapy is limited by MDSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alizadeh et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings suggest that an unexpected outcome of clinical ACT immunotherapy in patients with high MDSC burdens is that a high proportion of transferred T cells will undergo two major MDSC-mediated events that impair T cell responses in LN: (1) reduced LN homing due to rapid L-selectin loss within 24 hr, and (2) immune suppression stemming from T cell preconditioning prior to direct tumor-antigen exposure. These mechanisms would necessitate the transfer of excessive numbers of ex vivo-expanded T cells to achieve therapeutic efficacy.</p><p>In summary, here we uncovered combinatorial mechanisms of systemic immune suppression whereby tumor-induced MDSC localized outside LN shape the magnitude of adaptive immune responses in the intranodal compartment. Findings that L-selectin loss is not indelibly imprinted on T cells suggest that neoadjuvant treatments that target MDSC could offer promise for immune-based cancer therapies that depend on T and B cell trafficking to lymph nodes. Additionally, these results expand general concepts about the immunobiology underlying the suppressive mechanisms of MDSC that could be operative during chronic infections and inflammatory disorders such as autoimmunity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Female, age-matched BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice (8–12 weeks) were from the National Cancer Institute (Fredrick, MD), Charles River (Wilmington, MA), or Taconic (Hudson, NY).

The authors use appropriate mouse tumor models to show that MDSCs are not only present at the tumor site but also systemically, especially in the spleen and the peripheral blood.

They provide a very good support for this by showing that in the OVA system, OVA-specific responses are compromised in the presence of MDSCs. The authors show in vitro, that co-culture of T cells with MDSCs leads to the L-selectin low phenotype, which is reversible within 24-48 hours of MDSC depletion.</p><p>While all the presented data are based on well executed experiments and support important conclusions, the manuscript leaves the reader wondering what is the mechanism by which the MDSCs do this. Elucidating the full mechanism could take a long time preventing the current data from being published in a timely fashion. If the authors have the way and reagents, mice, etc., to do only one more experiment, and do it in a reasonable amount of time, it would very much raise the importance of this manuscript. A very simple experiment that could start the discussion on the mechanism of action, could be an experiment to find out if this MDSC action requires cell to cell contact or only the soluble factors produced by MDSC. They already show that this activity is cross-species but that does not suggest (nor do they imply) a soluble factor. If this additional work cannot be performed for reasons that the authors can explain in the rebuttal, then some of their expectations could be described in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the accompanying manuscript, Ku et al. show that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), induced by tumor growth in mouse models, results in decreased L-selectin surface levels on naïve lymphocytes. The authors provide evidence that L-selectin downregulation occurs only in T cells but not B cells, correlating with colocalization of MDSC and T cells in spleen. Yet, MDSC-triggered decrease in L-selectin surface levels are also observed in splenectomized mice, which hints to MDSC preconditioning in blood. Finally, the authors link reduced L-selectin levels to decreased homing to HEV-containing lymphoid tissue and impaired adaptive immune responses.</p><p>The observation of MDSC-triggered reversible reduction of surface L-selectin levels on naïve T cells is interesting and confirms data published by the same authors (Hanson et al., 2009; Parker et al., 2014). Yet, other data are not always clearly supporting the author's conclusions, and the focus on MDSC-triggered L-selectin decrease as major player in controlling adaptive immune responses appears not well bolstered. Also, the manuscript does not contain sufficient novel mechanistic insight on how MDSC control L-selectin levels on T cells.</p><p>The model the authors propose is that close spatial proximity between MDSCs and T cells in spleen promote decreased L-selectin levels on T but not B cells. Yet, the authors have not attempted to show close spatial organization in splenectomized mice (e.g., in liver sinusoids or lung capillaries), although both blood-borne T and B cells now show decreased L-selectin levels. This sheds doubts on the author's claim of close association as requirement for MDSC-dependent L-selectin decrease.</p><p>Along the same line, the molecular mechanism of MDSC-triggered loss of surface L-selectin remains unaddressed. It remains unclear whether this reflects transcriptional downregulation through cytokines, shedding (which should be detectable by soluble L-selectin in the supernatant) or other mechanisms. Given that the effect of MDSCs on surface L-selectin has been described before, there appears to be a lack of substantial new insights into this phenomenon.</p><p>The authors focus narrowly on L-selectin surface levels as reason for decreased T cell homing but do not address whether chemokine receptor signaling and integrin function may be impaired. This appears not unlikely since MDSC have multiple effects on T cells, as seen by their impaired activation. While the authors have checked CCR7 and LFA-1 surface levels in the supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, there is some concern on the CCR7 plot. Why would there be a CCR7high population? Furthermore, the presence of CCR7 and LFA-1 receptors on the cell surface does not automatically mean they are functional. This may explain the drastically reduced sticking fraction despite fairly good rolling. Along the same line, does the MDSC-induced L-selectin loss lead to a shift in the absolute numbers of T cells in spleen versus lymph nodes or do these cells also induce apoptosis in T cells?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Tumor-induced MDSC act via remote control to inhibit L-selectin-dependent adaptive immunity in lymph nodes&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Epub 2009 Jun 24).</italic></p><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for requesting further investigation into the mechanisms underlying MDSC-induced L-selectin loss. This was a common issue raised by all three referees so we have jointly addressed all of the comments related to mechanism below. It is worthwhile noting, however, that up to this point, while a <italic>trans</italic>-acting MDSC-intrinsic ADAM17 mechanism has been strongly implicated in reducing L-selectin on juxtaposed T cells based on ADAM17 surface expression by this myeloid population (Hanson et al., J Immunol 2009; Oh et al., Breast Cancer Res 15:R79, 2013; Parker et al., Cancer Res 2014), this hypothesis has never been formally investigated. Conversely, there has been substantial evidence that ADAM17, which is the major known L-selectin sheddase, acts in <italic>cis</italic> to cleave L-selectin and other substrates (i.e., ectoenzyme and substrate located on the same cell membrane). We have clarified these points in our revised report (subsection “MDSC cause L-selectin loss through a contact-mediated mechanism independent of ADAM17”, second paragraph; Discussion, fifth paragraph). These observations prompted our systematic investigation of the mechanisms underlying MDSC-induced L-selectin loss including the role of ADAM17 in this process both in vitro and in vivo. Our new findings (described in detail below) are consistent with a sheddase-dependent mechanism but definitively rule out ADAM17 in either a <italic>trans</italic> or <italic>cis</italic> orientation in reducing lymphocyte L-selectin density. These new mechanistic results are described in the last two paragraphs of the aforementioned subsection and in the fourth and fifth paragraphs of the Discussion and we have dedicated one-and-a-half <italic>new</italic> main figures to these important findings (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Collectively, we believe these data provide key insight into the mechanisms by which MDSC impede immune surveillance in cancer.</p><p>The principal findings of our new mechanistic studies are summarized below:</p><p>A) We established that MDSC-induced L-selectin downregulation does not involve transcriptional repression, as evidenced by the failure to alter L-selectin mRNA that was determined by quantitative RT-PCR in naïve T cell populations of tumor-bearing mice with a high MDSC burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; subsection “MDSC cause L-selectin loss through a contact-mediated mechanism independent of ADAM17”, second paragraph).</p><p>B) Instead, MDSC-induced L-selectin loss in tumor-bearing mice is accompanied by a profound (2.5-fold) and significant increase in the concentration of circulating L-selectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These findings are in line with a sheddase mechanism operative in vivo that downregulates L-selectin on the surface of target naïve T and B lymphocytes. As discussed in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion, these data are also suggestive of yet another mechanism that leads to immune subversion since soluble L-selectin at the concentrations detected in the serum of tumor-bearing mice is known to act as a competitive antagonist of L-selectin function in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>C) We showed that a purified population (≥95% CD11b<sup>+</sup> Gr-1<sup>+</sup>) of tumor-induced MDSC derived from 4T1-bearing mice could act directly on lymphocytes in vitro to reduce their membrane L-selectin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; subsection “MDSC cause L-selectin loss through a contact-mediated mechanism independent of ADAM17”, first paragraph). This mechanism was further shown to be contact-dependent in cell-impermeable transwell assays.</p><p>D) As mentioned in our overview above, reports that MDSC express surface ADAM17 (Hanson et al., J Immunol 2009; Oh et al., Breast Cancer Res 15:R79, 2013; Parker et al., Cancer Res 2014) have implicated an MDSC-intrinsic ADAM17 <italic>trans</italic>-acting mechanism for cleavage of L-selectin from the surface of juxtaposed lymphocytes, as proposed in recent reviews (e.g., Gabrilovich et al., Nature Rev Immunol, 2012; Botta et al., Front. Oncol., 2014; Kumar et al., Trends in Immunology 2016). Notably, ADAM17 is the major known L-selectin ectosheddase although it reportedly targets substrates including L-selectin in <italic>cis</italic> as discussed in the second paragraph of the subsection “MDSC cause L-selectin loss through a contact-mediated mechanism independent of ADAM17”. These observations prompted our systematic investigation of the role of ADAM17 in MDSC-induced L-selectin modulation. This investigation involved new collaborations with Drs. Bruce Walcheck and Douglas A. Steeber who are experts in ADAM17-directed L-selectin shedding. For these studies we performed a head-to-head comparison between the well-established phorbol ester (PMA)-induced ADAM17-mediated pathway for L-selectin downregulation versus MDSC-induced L-selectin loss.</p><p>Our studies revealed a sharp demarcation in the ADAM17 requirements for PMA- versus MDSC-directed L-selectin modulation (described in subsection “MDSC cause L-selectin loss through a contact-mediated mechanism independent of ADAM17”, last paragraph; Discussion, fifth paragraph). Thus, in agreement with the obligate role of ADAM17 reported for PMA-induced L-selectin shedding, we found that PMA-induced loss in membrane-associated L-selectin was abrogated (1) by a specific pharmacological inhibitor of ADAM17 (PF-5480090) and by a dual ADAM17/10 inhibitor (INCB7839) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>); (2) in cells from transgenic L(E)-selectin mice expressing a mutated ADAM cleavage site due to substitution of the L-selectin membrane-proximal extracellular domain with the shorter E-selectin homologous domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>); and (3) in ADAM17-deficient lymphocytes cultured either alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) or co-mixed with wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together these findings confirm reports of a strict requirement for <italic>cis</italic>-acting ADAM17 for PMA-induced L-selectin down-modulation. In contrast, MDSC-induced L-selectin downregulation in vitro was unaffected by inhibitors of ADAM17 and ADAM17/10; L(E)-selectin mutation; and lymphocyte-intrinsic ADAM17 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Further, while elevated constitutive L-selectin expression in mutant L(E)-selectin lymphocytes or on ADAM17<sup>-/-</sup> T cells was indicative of an ADAM17 mechanism operative in vivo, this pathway was dispensable for MDSC-induced L-selectin downregulation in mutant L(E)-selectin-expressing T and B cells or in ADAM17<sup>-/-</sup> cells following their adoptive transfer into MDSC<sup>hi</sup> 4T1-bearing SCID mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These results established that the MDSC mechanism of action surprisingly does not depend on ADAM17 acting in either a <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> orientation. Thus, MDSC do not stimulate lymphocyte-intrinsic ADAM17 to cleave L-selectin in <italic>cis</italic>. Nor do MDSC use their own ADAM17 in <italic>trans</italic> to target L-selectin for loss on juxtaposed lymphocyte membranes in vitro or in vivo, suggesting the involvement of a different L-selectin sheddase. The novelty of these findings and relationship to other potential mechanisms are discussed in our revised manuscript in the aforementioned paragraph.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> are somewhat confirmatory of the prior publication, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is an add-on without much rationale or justification, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> confirm largely known impact of L-selectin on T cell trafficking.

In fact sarcoma models generate T cell immunity that controls tumors in the initial phase. Thus, the impact of the work is unclear.</italic></p><p>A) We thank the reviewer for these comments and have adopted the suggestion to condense some information (detailed below) so more attention could be paid to our new mechanistic studies. Additionally, we would respectfully like to take this opportunity to clarify the novelty of our principal findings in order to explicitly address the points raised by this reviewer. The manuscript has been revised throughout to clarify these unique aspects of our findings as denoted below.</p><p>As advised by the reviewer, we extensively revised our manuscript to condense information regarding the correlation between MDSC expansion and L-selectin downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in original submission). These data (now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>;) demonstrate a temporal relationship between tumor growth and MDSC-induced L-selectin loss, thus supporting the relevance of our findings to small developing tumors which was an important point raised by this reviewer. Specifically, these data document that the extent of L-selectin downmodulation differs between various tumor systems and is closely correlated with MDSC burden.</p><p>We showed that MDSC located in anatomically discrete sub-compartments of the spleen (i.e., marginal zone) downregulate L-selectin expression in murine CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> naïve T cell subsets, but not on B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> in original submission; now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). A cell-type specific function for MDSC has not previously been documented for splenic MDSC nor has the site for MDSC-induced L-selectin loss been previously investigated (Discussion, second paragraph).</p><p>Our data document that MDSC unexpectedly operate in the blood of splenectomized mice to induce L-selectin downregulation in both T and B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> of original submission; now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Notably the blood is not a known site of MDSC function in situ nor have B cells previously been shown to be MDSC targets in cancer (Discussion, second and sixth paragraphs).</p><p>We condensed our write-up for data involving targeting of L-selectin on human lymphocytes in xenogeneic adoptive transfer experiments (original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results (discussed in subsection “L-selectin downregulation occurs on both T and B cells in the blood compartment”, last paragraph) validate that human cells can be targeted for L-selectin loss which has important translational implications (see Discussion, first, sixth and seventh paragraphs). These experiments also establish that the mechanisms involved are not species-restricted. Notably, results for human PBL were considered a strength of our study by reviewer #2.</p><p>We fully agree with the referee that inhibition of lymph node trafficking is highly predictable under conditions of strong L-selectin loss (i.e., 4T1 model); however the expectations are less intuitive for moderate L-selectin down-modulation as encountered early during MDSC expansion. This important point has been clarified in the revised manuscript (subsection “L-selectin loss reduces murine CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell trafficking across LN HEV”, first paragraph; Discussion, third paragraph). Therefore, to address this physiologically relevant question, we used a stringent model of MDSC-induced moderate L-selectin loss (AT-3 tumor system) to identify severe limitations in naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell trafficking in lymph nodes via gateway high endothelial venules (HEV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> of the original submission; now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), which in turn causes a profound decrease in antigen-driven T cell expansion within the lymph node stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> of the original submission;now revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Of note, prior reports have not investigated the impact of MDSC-induced L-selectin loss (either strong or moderate) on lymphocyte trafficking efficiency. The extent of the biological consequences of moderate L-selectin loss documented in our study was unexpected given L-selectin’s normally high density on leukocytes (&gt;50,000 molecules per cell) which could theoretically have buffered against moderate fluctuations in expression during homing. Collectively, we believe these results, together with the new mechanistic information detailed above, provide substantial new insight in the immunobiology underlying this understudied suppressive activity of MDSC.</p><p>B) As to the second key point raised by the reviewer, we fully agree with the importance of assessing L-selectin regulation in GEMM. To this end, we have performed complementary studies assessing L-selectin expression in genetically-engineered MMTV-PyMT/B6 transgenic mice (MTAG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; subsection “L-selectin downregulation occurs on both T and B cells in the blood compartment”, last paragraph). These new data demonstrate that moderate L-selectin loss is evident on naïve T and B cell subsets in vivo in MTAG mice with expanded circulating MDSC populations and an overall large tumor burden. In contrast, L-selectin is unchanged in MTAG mice with smaller overall tumor burdens without MDSC expansion. We consider these data to be an important contribution to our study since they provide strong support for conclusions derived from implantable models indicating that the extent of L-selectin loss correlates with MDSC expansion, thereby suggesting that MDSC levels must exceed a threshold. Moreover, they provide a rationale for using a model with moderate L-selectin loss (i.e., the AT-3 mammary model) to interrogate the impact of L-selectin loss on T cell homing or T cell priming in lymph nodes. We have revised the manuscript to more clearly indicate that moderate L-selectin loss would be expected to be highly relevant during the early phases of tumor escape from immune surveillance as well as for immunotherapy regimens where high MDSC burdens could subvert therapy by preventing immune cell access to lymph nodes (Discussion, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>This is a very well performed study to better understand the effect of MDSCs on T and B cells, known to be suppressed in the presence of MDSCs.</italic> in vivo <italic>data show the presence of MDSC in the local tumor microenvironment and the negative correlation with anti-tumor immunity.

As stated above in our response to reviewer #1, we also fully agree with the importance of providing additional mechanistic insight into this underexplored immunosuppressive activity of MDSC. Therefore, we have performed a rigorous analysis into the underlying mechanisms which is described in our revised manuscript. In order to avoid duplication of our response since the question of mechanism was raised by all 3 reviewers, we have briefly summarized our main findings below and refer the reviewer to our more detailed response for reviewer #1/comment #1 which provides specific details about these experiments that are included in new figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-E</xref>). Briefly, our main findings regarding mechanism include:</p><p>A) Based on the advice provided by reviewer #2, we performed the recommended experiment to determine if MDSC action requires cell-to-cell contact. Data shown for in vitro co-cultures in transwells clearly demonstrate that direct contact between MDSC and target lymphocytes is required for the MDSC mechanism of action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; subsection “MDSC cause L-selectin loss through a contact-mediated mechanism independent of ADAM17”, first paragraph; Discussion, second paragraph).</p><p>B) Additionally we established that MDSC-induced L-selectin down-modulation in target T or B cells: (i) does not involve transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; subsection “MDSC cause L-selectin loss through a contact-mediated mechanism independent of ADAM17”, second paragraph); (ii) is accompanied by a substantial increase in circulating soluble L-selectin which is suggestive of a sheddase mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; in the aforementioned paragraph); and (iii) is not mediated by the conventional ADAM17 zinc-dependent metalloproteinase mechanism either in vitro or in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-E</xref>; subsection “MDSC cause L-selectin loss through a contact-mediated mechanism independent of ADAM17”, last paragraph). The latter finding was particularly surprising given that ADAM17 is the principal L-selectin sheddase identified thus far in vivo. The novel aspects of these findings and relationship to other potential mechanisms are discussed in our revised manuscript (Discussion, fourth and fifth paragraphs). Collectively, we believe these findings substantially advance current understanding of the mechanisms underlying barriers to lymphocyte access to lymph nodes that are controlled by tumor-induced MDSC.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] The observation of MDSC-triggered reversible reduction of surface L-selectin levels on naïve T cells is interesting and confirms data published by the same authors (Hanson et al., 2009; Parker et al., 2014). Yet, other data are not always clearly supporting the author's conclusions, and the focus on MDSC-triggered L-selectin decrease as major player in controlling adaptive immune responses appears not well bolstered. Also, the manuscript does not contain sufficient novel mechanistic insight on how MDSC control L-selectin levels on T cells.</italic></p><p><italic>The model the authors propose is that close spatial proximity between MDSCs and T cells in spleen promote decreased L-selectin levels on T but not B cells. Yet, the authors have not attempted to show close spatial organization in splenectomized mice (e.g., in liver sinusoids or lung capillaries), although both blood-borne T and B cells now show decreased L-selectin levels. This sheds doubts on the author's claim of close association as requirement for MDSC-dependent L-selectin decrease.</italic></p><p>To address this important question, we obtained new data to establish that close physical contact is a prerequisite for MDSC-dependent L-selectin loss on naïve T or B cells. Specifically, we showed that the ability of MDSC to cause L-selectin downregulation during co-culture with T cells is abrogated if effector and target cells are physically separated by cell-impermeable transwell-inserts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; subsection “MDSC cause L-selectin loss through a contact-mediated mechanism independent of ADAM17”, first paragraph). These findings are in line with a requirement for physical interactions between MDSC and target lymphocytes in the spleen and blood to cause L-selectin downregulation. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of a report showing that naïve T cells are retained within vascular niches in lung tissue (Galkina et al. (J Clin Invest 115:3473, 2005), suggesting that this could be a site of stable interactions between MDSC and target lymphocytes (Discussion, second paragraph). Additionally, we performed pilot feasibility studies to determine whether MDSC/T cells could be detected within lung vessels by immunohistochemical staining but were unsuccessful. In view of the extensive experimentation needed to rigorously determine if MDSC attack L-selectin within vascular niches rather than in free-flowing blood, we believe that this question is beyond the scope of the current study, particularly in light of the large body of mechanistic data now included in our report.</p><p><italic>Along the same line, the molecular mechanism of MDSC-triggered loss of surface L-selectin remains unaddressed. It remains unclear whether this reflects transcriptional downregulation through cytokines, shedding (which should be detectable by soluble L-selectin in the supernatant) or other mechanisms. Given that the effect of MDSCs on surface L-selectin has been described before, there appears to be a lack of substantial new insights into this phenomenon.</italic></p><p>We completely agree with this reviewer’s comments about the importance of providing substantial new insights into the mechanism of action of MDSC in triggering L-selectin loss. The question of mechanism was raised by all 3 reviewers and we have performed a rigorous series of studies to gain clarity on this issue. To avoid redundancy in our response to the 3 reviewers, below we have briefly outlined our main findings and we refer the reviewer to our response to reviewer #1/comment #1 for a more detailed explanation of our mechanistic studies. These new data are included in several new panels in our revised figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>A) We performed the important experiments recommended by reviewer #3 in which we analyzed L-selectin expression by quantitative RT-PCR in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> splenic T cells recovered from MDSC<sup>hi</sup> 4T1 tumor-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These data indicate that L-selectin downregulation induced by MDSC in vivo is not due to transcriptional repression in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (subsection “MDSC cause L-selectin loss through a contact-mediated mechanism independent of ADAM17”, second paragraph).</p><p>B) We are grateful for the suggestion to perform the analysis of soluble (s)L-selectin by ELISA. We found that MDSC-induced L-selectin loss is accompanied by a profound (2.5-fold) increase in circulating sL-selectin concentrations when values were compared to non-tumor bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; subsection “MDSC cause L-selectin loss through a contact-mediated mechanism independent of ADAM17”, second paragraph). These data are suggestive of a sheddase-dependent mechanism operative in vivo by which MDSC trigger L-selectin loss from the surface of naïve T and B cells. Additionally these findings suggest that a second mechanism impedes naïve lymphocyte trafficking to lymph nodes in tumor-bearing mice since sL-selectin concentrations in the range we identified in the serum of tumor-bearing mice (~1 µg/ml) are known to competitively antagonize L-selectin function in vitro and in vivo. The implications of these findings are discussed in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>C) We performed a head-to-head comparison between the conventional PMA-induced ADAM17 pathway and MDSC responses to determine if similar mechanism are used to direct L-selectin loss on target lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; subsection “MDSC cause L-selectin loss through a contact-mediated mechanism independent of ADAM17”, last paragraph). These studies used a series of complementary approaches including ADAM17/ADAM10-specific pharmacological inhibitors, lymphocytes expressing mutant L(E)-selectin that lack the ADAM-cleavage site (provided by Dr. Doug Steeber), and ADAM17-deficienct lymphocytes (provided by Dr. Bruce Walcheck). The results described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-E</xref> surprisingly revealed that MDSC-induced L-selectin downregulation in T and B cells does not depend on ADAM17 acting in either a <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> orientation. Thus, these findings exclude the possibility that MDSC provide extrinsic signals to activate <italic>cis</italic>-acting ADAM17 in lymphocytes. Nor do MDSC use their own ADAM17 in <italic>trans</italic> to target L-selectin for loss on juxtaposed lymphocyte membranes in vitro or in vivo. These findings point to another L-selectin sheddase and are fully discussed in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion. Collectively, we believe that these new findings substantially expand the impact of our findings by identifying an unexpected mechanism underlying MDSC regulation of L-selectin expression in naïve lymphocyte populations.</p><p><italic>The authors focus narrowly on L-selectin surface levels as reason for decreased T cell homing but do not address whether chemokine receptor signaling and integrin function may be impaired. This appears not unlikely since MDSC have multiple effects on T cells, as seen by their impaired activation. While the authors have checked CCR7 and LFA-1 surface levels in the supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, there is some concern on the CCR7 plot. Why would there be a CCR7high population? Furthermore, the presence of CCR7 and LFA-1 receptors on the cell surface does not automatically mean they are functional. This may explain the drastically reduced sticking fraction despite fairly good rolling. Along the same line, does the MDSC-induced L-selectin loss lead to a shift in the absolute numbers of T cells in spleen versus lymph nodes or do these cells also induce apoptosis in T cells?</italic></p><p>The reviewer raised a number of important points which we have addressed as follows:</p><p>A) We agree that the CCR7 staining shown in our original submission was sub-par and we have repeated these experiments with a more optimized staining protocol. These new data show that neither CCR7 nor LFA-1 expression is altered on T cells isolated from AT-3 bearing mice, despite profound downregulation of L-selectin surface expression (subsection “L-selectin loss reduces murine CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell trafficking across LN HEV”, second paragraph;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>B) We have addressed the excellent point raised by the reviewer by expanding our analysis to include the function of other relevant trafficking molecules on purified CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from tumor-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). The results from in vitro assays for CCL21/CCR7-driven chemotaxis in transwell assays and PMA-induced LFA-1-dependent homotypic lymphocyte aggregation assays (subsection “L-selectin loss reduces murine CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell trafficking across LN HEV”, second paragraph) indicate that the function of these trafficking molecules is not compromised in cancer. Thus, L-selectin loss appears to be the primary explanation for our observations of poor trafficking in lymph node high endothelial venules.</p><p>C) We addressed the final question by performing the recommended quantification of T cell numbers in lymph nodes and spleen of non-tumor bearing control mice and 4T1-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results show that the absolute numbers of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is diminished selectively in the lymph nodes while we see a compensatory increase in the spleen of tumor-bearing mice. We did not observe any change in the apoptotic fraction of T cells at either of these tissue sites. These findings are in line with our hypothesis that MDSC-induced L-selectin loss contributes to poor overall trafficking of T cells to lymph nodes, thereby compromising immune surveillance in tumor-bearing mice (subsection “Spatiotemporal correlation between L-selectin loss and MDSC co-localization with naïve T cells in the splenic compartment”, third paragraph).</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance. Please include the Figure in your recent response as new supplemental data (e.g. a figure supplement) and describe the result in the main text. Please also modify the Discussion as you have suggested with respect to the second point in your response. New experiments are not required.</italic></p><p>1) We included a new Figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and described the result in the main text (subsection “L-selectin downregulation occurs on both T and B cells in the blood compartment”, third paragraph) that shows that near-complete L-selectin loss on T and B cells occurs within 2 hours after adoptive transfer into the MDSC-rich vascular compartment of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. As discussed in the revised manuscript, these data further support our conclusion that the blood is a prominent site for MDSC-induced L-selectin loss since the lymphocytes analyzed 2 hours after transfer are those that remained in the blood for the duration of the experiment; i.e., this time period is not sufficient for blood-borne naïve lymphocytes to recirculate through tissues and return back to the blood.</p><p>2) We revised the Discussion to more fully describe various scenarios whereby physical interactions between MDSC and naïve T and B cells within the intravascular space could be expected to culminate in profound L-selectin loss (second paragraph).</p><p>3) We modified the Discussion to more explicitly describe the experiments cited (fourth paragraph) showing that soluble L-selectin at the concentration range we detected in tumor-bearing mice (~1 µg/mL) can function as a competitive antagonist of L-selectin-dependent lymphocyte trafficking to LN HEV in vivo (Tu et al., J Immunol 2002).</p></body></sub-article></article>
