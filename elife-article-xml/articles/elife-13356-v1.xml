Here, we show that external sodium ions stabilize the TRPV1 channel in a closed state, such that removing the external ion leads to channel activation. In studying the underlying mechanism, we find that the temperature sensors in TRPV1 activate in two steps to favor opening, and that the binding of sodium to an extracellular site exerts allosteric control over temperature-sensor activation and opening of the pore. The binding of a tarantula toxin to the external pore also exerts control over temperature-sensor activation, whereas binding of vanilloids influences temperature-sensitivity by largely affecting the open/closed equilibrium. Our results reveal a fundamental role of the external pore in the allosteric control of TRPV1 channel gating and provide essential constraints for understanding how these channels can be tuned by diverse stimuli.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13356.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13356.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13356.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Humans and other mammals sense elevated heat and other painful stimuli via a sensory ion channel protein called TRPV1. Ion channels create pores in the outer membrane of cells and act as gates that open and close to regulate the flow of ions into and out of cells. This flow of ions generates electrical signals that sensory neurons use to communicate information about the environment to the brain. The TRPV1 channel is opened by heat, but also by venom toxins, acid and the active ingredient in hot chilli peppers.</p><p>The fluid that surrounds animal cells often contains high levels of sodium ions, and these ions flow through TRPV1 channels when they are open. Also, when sodium ions are removed from the fluid surrounding a cell, TRPV1 channels will spontaneously open. It is not known why this happens, but it suggests that sodium ions help to regulate the activity of the TRPV1 channel, and despite having been extensively studied, it remains unclear how this channel senses temperature and responds to other harmful stimuli.</p><p>Jara-Oseguera et al. have now investigated the role of sodium ions in activating TRPV1 in cells grown in the laboratory. The experiments involved a technique that records the movement of ions through TRPV1 channels in the cell surface membrane while exposing the cell to various stimuli that open or close the channels. The results showed that TRPV1 contains an important site on its outer surface that binds sodium ions and fine-tunes the channel’s properties. This enables the channel to be activated by potentially damaging temperatures. Further analysis revealed that TRPV1 undergoes at least two distinct physical changes in response to heat and that the binding of sodium ions to the channel’s outer structure regulates one of these changes.</p><p>Jara-Oseguera et al. went on to discover that the binding of a tarantula toxin to the outer surface of TRPV1 renders the channel insensitive to changes in temperature. These findings suggest that structural changes to the external part of this channel protein are closely associated with its ability to sense temperature, possibly because this region of the protein is directly responsible for detecting changes in temperature.</p><p>These findings shed light on how this channel detects and responds to dangerously high temperatures, as well to other harmful stimuli. An aim for future studies is to pinpoint the specific regions of the protein that form the sodium-binding sites and to test the hypothesis that temperature sensors are located on the outer surface of the protein.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13356.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13356.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>temperature sensing</kwd><kwd>sodium ion binding site</kwd><kwd>gating</kwd><kwd>DkTx</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS002945</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swartz</surname><given-names>Kenton J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Allosteric gating in a transient receptor potential channel is modulated by external sodium ions and a tarantula toxin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels belong to a large and diverse superfamily of tetrameric cation channels that contain six transmembrane helices per subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hellmich and Gaudet, 2014</xref>), similar to voltage-activated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2007</xref>), ryanodine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yan et al., 2015</xref>) and IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fan et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Several TRP channels are exquisitely temperature-dependent, enabling them to serve as biological thermosensors throughout the animal kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vay et al., 2012</xref>). The vanilloid-sensitive TRPV1 channel is a weakly voltage-dependent and cation-selective channel that is expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons, where it acts as a sensor for noxious stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caterina and Julius, 2001</xref>) including heat, extracellular acidic pH, vanilloid compounds (e.g capsaicin), and venom toxins (e.g. double-knot toxin or DkTx) (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hilton et al., 2015</xref>] for review). The sensitivity of TRPV1 to diverse modulators is fascinating because many stimuli are capable of influencing the responses of TRPV1 to other signals. For example, protons can sensitize the channel to activation by heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jordt et al., 2000</xref>) and capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jordt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ryu et al., 2003</xref>), and both capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Voets et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matta and Ahern, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gregorio-Teruel et al., 2014</xref>) and protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee and Zheng, 2015</xref>) can sensitize the channel to activation by voltage. Conceptually, these observations can be explained by allosteric models wherein distinct stimulus-sensing domains are coupled to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Latorre et al., 2007</xref>), and to an internal gate within the pore that opens and closes the ion permeation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salazar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13356.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Substitution of extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> with NMDG<sup>+</sup> increases TRPV1-mediated currents.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Side view in ribbon representation of the transmembrane domains of two opposing TRPV1 subunits (as indicated by the black arrow, extracellular face on the top, intracellular face on the bottom) in the apo state (refined TRPV1 structural model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2016</xref>]).

However, we currently do not understand the structural basis by which the binding of protons, capsaicin or DkTx promotes opening of the internal pore. Moreover, there is no consensus about the site and mechanism of temperature sensitivity. Mutations throughout TRPV1 alter the temperature sensitivity of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Feng, 2014</xref>), and distinct models have been proposed to explain temperature sensitivity in these channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Voets, 2012</xref>). For example, in the conventional allosteric model, a specialized temperature-sensitive transition is coupled to a temperature- and voltage-insensitive opening transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brauchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matta and Ahern, 2007</xref>). In contrast, others have suggested that temperature sensitivity arises from a weakly voltage-sensitive opening transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Voets et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, one recent study on voltage-activated potassium (Kv) channels suggests that the opening transition in these related channels can be made steeply temperature-dependent when the coupling between the voltage-sensing and pore domains is weakened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). It has also been suggested that TRP channels may not contain localized temperature-sensors, but that their steep temperature-dependence results from changes in solvation of hydrophobic residues throughout the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clapham and Miller, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recent landmark near-atomic resolution structures of the TRPV1 channel confirm the presence of an internal gate related to that present in Kv channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">del Camino and Yellen, 2001</xref>). In addition, the external pore and selectivity filter change conformation in the combined presence of DkTx and the vanilloid resiniferatoxin (RTx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 2013</xref>). Given our limited understanding of the temperature-sensitivity of TRPV1, it is unclear whether these structures provide insight into the mechanisms of heat activation. However, the structural rearrangements within the external pore are intriguing because mutations in this region have been reported to alter activation of the channel by protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jordt et al., 2000</xref>) and heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grandl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, external Na<sup>+</sup> ions have been reported to inhibit the TRPV1 channel at room temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohta et al., 2008</xref>), raising the possibility that an external cation binding site may regulate these channels. In the present study, we demonstrate the presence of a critical external Na<sup>+</sup> ion-binding site that must be occupied for the channel to remain closed at room temperature, and to be available for opening by noxious heat. Our results also show that multiple steeply temperature-dependent transitions are allosterically coupled to an opening transition, and that binding of Na<sup>+</sup> or DkTx to the external pore strongly influences the activity of the temperature-sensor and opening of the pore.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate the influence of external Na<sup>+</sup> on TRPV1 channels, we obtained whole-cell patch clamp recordings of cells expressing rat TRPV1 using internal and external solutions containing Na<sup>+</sup> (130 mM) as the sole charge carrier, and then exchanged the external Na<sup>+</sup> solution with one containing N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG<sup>+</sup>; 130 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Subsequent application of a saturating concentration of capsaicin further increased the outward currents independently of whether external Na<sup>+</sup> or NMDG<sup>+</sup> was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At moderate TRPV1 expression levels, where outward Na<sup>+</sup> currents could be accurately measured, the inward currents with external NMDG<sup>+</sup> were negligible even in the presence of capsaicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that TRPV1 has a relatively low permeability to large cations. Although large outward currents induced by exchanging external ions were observed in all cells in which capsaicin evoked measurable currents, this manipulation also produced a variable and irreversible rundown of the channel that increased with time in Na<sup>+</sup>-free solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This result indicates that NMDG<sup>+</sup> does not activate the channel in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>, but rather removal of external Na<sup>+</sup> leads to channel activation. Removal of internal Na<sup>+</sup> in recordings using inside-out patches produced no channel activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel), whereas removing external Na<sup>+</sup> using outside-out patches led to robust activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel), demonstrating that the inhibitory influence of Na<sup>+</sup> is limited to the external side of the TRPV1 channel. We also measured the concentration-dependence for external Na<sup>+</sup> inhibition over a range of voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and found that inhibition was only weakly voltage-dependent, with an extrapolated apparent affinity (K<sub>1/2</sub>) at 0 mV of 2 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results suggest that external Na<sup>+</sup> stabilizes a closed state of the TRPV1 channel by binding to a site on the extracellular side of the protein.

Moreover, activation of the channel by pH 6 could be completely overcome by raising the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration to 300 mM. These results are consistent with the expectation that protonation of acidic residues forming the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site would lower the affinity of the metal ion, suggesting that the inhibitory Na<sup>+</sup> binding site is intimately involved in the regulation of the TRPV1 channel by acid. However, acidic solutions further stimulated channel activation in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating that protons also activate TRPV1 channels through a Na<sup>+</sup>-independent mechanism.

The double-knot tarantula toxin (DkTx) is an interesting candidate as it activates the TRPV1 channel with high avidity by binding to the periphery of outer pore of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohlen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2016</xref>). We recently solved the solution structure of DkTx and performed a detailed analysis of its interactions with the TRPV1 channel, which suggested that the toxin activates TRPV1 by disrupting a cluster of hydrophobic residues at the extracellular half of the S5 and S6 segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, removal of external Na<sup>+</sup> before application of the toxin activates TRPV1 to a similar extent when compared with a saturating concentration of DkTx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>), and removal of external Na<sup>+</sup> did not produce further activation of DkTx-bound channels. In contrast, application of a saturating concentration of capsaicin produced further activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The lack of additivity for the activation of TRPV1 by DkTx and the removal of external Na<sup>+</sup> contrasts with our results with acidic extracellular pH in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and suggests that DkTx and external Na<sup>+</sup> modulate the TRPV1 through convergent mechanisms.</p><p>The unambiguous identification of the Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site would require a high resolution structure of TRPV1. However, a glutamate at position 600 near the top of S5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) has been previously associated with the inhibition of TRPV1 by external Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohta et al., 2008</xref>), and has also been shown to be involved in the proton-dependent potentiation of TRPV1 responses to heat and capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jordt et al., 2000</xref>). To confirm a key role of this residue in modulation of TRPV1 by external Na<sup>+</sup>, we investigated the effect of removing external Na<sup>+</sup> on E600Q mutant channels, and found that the removal of external Na<sup>+</sup> no longer produced constitutive activation even though the mutant remained responsive to capsaicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Consistent with DkTx and external Na<sup>+</sup> having convergent mechanisms for modulating TRPV1, E600Q channels were not responsive to a concentration of DkTx that is saturating in WT channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results demonstrate an important role for E600 in mediating channel inhibition by external Na<sup>+</sup> and activation by DkTx, and suggest that this residue may be a part of the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site.</p><p>Another interesting region within the outer pore of TRPV1 is the pore turret (Δ604–626, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), a stretch of 22 residues that was removed in the construct of TRPV1 recently used for structure determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 2013</xref>) and that is located near to E600 and to the binding site for DkTx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We therefore explored whether the deletion of the pore turret retains modulation by external Na<sup>+</sup>. Initially, we found that the removal of external Na<sup>+</sup> produced robust channel activation at depolarized potentials in channels lacking the pore turret (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), and that the addition of 10 µM capsaicin in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup> further activated the channels, similar to WT TRPV1. Interestingly, the removal of the pore turret increased the apparent affinity of the channel for Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating that the pore turret does not form the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site, but influences the cation-binding site through an allosteric mechanism. However, we also made the surprising discovery that the removal of external Na<sup>+</sup> in the presence of 10 µM capsaicin resulted in enhanced channel activation at positive voltages relative to 10 µM capsaicin in the presence of 130 mM external Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), in stark contrast with WT channels where I-V relations under these two conditions superimpose at depolarized potentials due to maximal channel activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Increasing the concentration of capsaicin from 10 to 40 µM did not further activate Δ604–626 TRPV1 channels in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), indicating that 10 µM is a saturating concentration and that capsaicin is a partial agonist for this construct. This reveals that the pore turret is mechanistically associated with the modulation of the channel not only by stimuli acting on the extracellular pore (e.g. external Na<sup>+</sup>), but also by capsaicin that binds near the intracellular part of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we were interested in determining whether external Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions activate the TRPV1 channel directly, as was suggested in two previous studies that analyzed the effect of substituting external Na<sup>+</sup> with Mg<sup>2+</sup> without considering the inhibitory effects of external Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). We tested the ability of 130 mM external MgCl<sub>2</sub> to activate the TRPV1 channel in the presence of 130 mM external NaCl (and 260 mM intracellular NaCl), as we did previously in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> to determine whether NMDG<sup>+</sup> was an activator of TRPV1. Contrary to what we observed for NMDG<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions produced robust activation of the TRPV1 channel in the presence of 130 mM external Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that Mg<sup>2+</sup> can activate the TRPV1 channel directly.</p><p>Collectively, our results thus far highlight a central role of the outer pore in the allosteric control of TRPV1 channel gating. Furthermore, they suggest that the binding of DkTx, protons and external Na<sup>+</sup> to the extracellular pore of TRPV1 modulate channel function through at least partially overlapping mechanisms. We next set out to determine whether the external Na<sup>+</sup> site has an influence in the mechanism of temperature-sensitivity of the TRPV1 channel, as protons have been shown to potentiate responses of the channel to heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jordt et al., 2000</xref>), and the outer pore has been associated with temperature-sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Myers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grandl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>External Na<sup>+</sup> is required for activation of TRPV1 by heat</title><p>TRPV1 is widely agreed to be activated by noxious heat above 35°C in the absence of other stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2010</xref>), but whether the channel responds to lower temperatures has not been carefully examined because the open probability (P<sub>o</sub>) in this temperature range is very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oseguera et al., 2007</xref>). If TRPV1 remains sensitive to changes in temperature below 35°C, it is possible that the spontaneous activation that we observed upon removing external Na<sup>+</sup> at room temperature might be caused by an alteration in the temperature-dependence for channel activation. We therefore began by investigating TRPV1 channel activity over a broad temperature range in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup> using cells with widely varying expression levels of the channel. We measured macroscopic current-temperature (I-T) relations between ~8°C and 45°C using slow temperature ramps and observed steep temperature-dependent activation over the entire range of temperatures explored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Although these I-T relations largely reflect temperature-dependent changes in P<sub>o</sub>, the rate of ion conduction through open channels is also weakly temperature-dependent and thus will contribute to the slope of I-T relations. To directly evaluate temperature-dependent changes in P<sub>o</sub>, we estimated the temperature-dependence of ion conduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>) and then calculated P<sub>o</sub>-T relations from the macroscopic I-T relations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>, see Materials and methods). To qualitatively compare the slopes of P<sub>o</sub>-T relations between cells and conditions, we fit a single exponential function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>, see Materials and methods) to the data over defined temperature ranges to obtain apparent enthalpy (ΔH<sub>app</sub>) values (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). At temperatures &gt; 35°C, we observed steep temperature-dependence to P<sub>o</sub> at positive membrane voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>), which became even steeper at negative membrane voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B and E</xref>), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Voets et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2010</xref>). At temperatures between 8 and 25°C, a range in which the temperature-sensitivity of TRPV1 has not been previously investigated, we also observed steep temperature-dependence to P<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). However, the entire P<sub>o</sub>-T relationship could not be described by a single temperature-dependent transition due to the presence of an apparent plateau near 22°C, raising the possibility that multiple temperature-dependent transitions are involved in the gating mechanism of TRPV1.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13356.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Temperature-dependent gating of TRPV1 in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative whole-cell current family in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup> elicited by a train of pulses from -90 to +90 mV while increasing temperature (temperature vs time plot is shown on the right panel) using the temperature-controlled recording chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

A round glass coverslip was attached to the bottom of the stage and an additional stainless steel 25 mm chamber (MS-502S, Ala Scientific) was added to the stage to reduce the volume of recording solution (500 µL). Thermal grease was applied between the stainless-steel chamber (outer chamber) and the incubator stage. The metal surface of the outer chamber was covered with a thin layer of silicon or teflon spray for electrical insulation. Finally, a copper block of ~1 cm<sup>3</sup> with an embedded thermistor probe and an axial slit (0.7 mm diameter) in one face was positioned to make contact with the outer chamber. Once the whole-cell configuration was obtained, the cells were lifted and the pipette tip introduced into the slit in the copper block, which served as a 'buffer' to ensure that the temperature at the pipette tip closely matched that of the embedded thermistor. The addition of the copper block significantly increased the accuracy of temperature measurements, as judged from experiments in which the resistances of open pipettes were recorded during temperature ramps (data not shown). A fan-based heat sink (Koolance, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) for the Peltier elements in the temperature controlled-stage was used during heating when performing temperature-ramps, whereas a refrigerated water circulator (NESLAB RTE7, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, NA) at 6.3°C was used for cooling.

Remarkably, both I-T and P<sub>o</sub>-T relations displayed greatly diminished slopes and readily detectable channel activity at the lowest experimentally accessible temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). In addition, removal of external Na<sup>+</sup> produced marked temperature-dependent inactivation of TRPV1 channels between 25 and 38°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, see yellow arrow), a process that typically occurs after repetitive cycles of heating and cooling in the presence of extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joseph et al., 2013</xref>) and at temperatures above ~50°C in single heat-activation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, see purple arrow).

One possibility is that the mechanism of heat activation remains intact, but that increases in P<sub>o</sub> upon heating cannot be seen because channels run down after opening during temperature ramps (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref> and Materials and methods for an illustration using an allosteric model for channel gating). If this is the case, increasing the rate at which temperature is changed in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> should diminish the effects of rundown and reveal the presence of heat activation. To examine this possibility, we measured I-T relations in either the presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, large grey circles) or absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, large orange circles) of external Na<sup>+</sup> by rapidly jumping between solutions at different temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), and observed that I-T relations in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> obtained from temperature-ramps and from jumps agreed up to ~25°C, after which they deviated markedly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, note deviation between orange circles and small yellow circles as highlighted by the blue lines). Additionally, the rate of temperature-dependent inactivation in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> at T &gt; 45°C became so fast that the speed of our temperature-jumps was not sufficient to visualize the increase in P<sub>o</sub> before significant inactivation occurred (note the last orange circle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results suggest that temperature-dependent activation has been greatly perturbed in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> at temperatures below 25°C, but that activation at higher temperatures appears largely intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, compare orange and grey large circles). Taken together, these findings suggest that the Na<sup>+</sup> regulatory site is strongly coupled to a temperature-dependent transition that governs TRPV1 activation at low temperature, and confirm the presence of multiple temperature-dependent transitions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>External Na<sup>+</sup> tunes a temperature-dependent transition and stabilizes a closed state of the channel</title><p>The results obtained from measurements of P<sub>o</sub>-T relations are depicted schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, where dotted horizontal lines represent plateau regions where steep temperature-dependence cannot be readily observed (ΔH<sub>App</sub>~0), and arrows represent regions where P<sub>o</sub> increases steeply with temperature (ΔH<sub>App</sub>&gt;&gt; 0). The vertical dotted grey line indicates the lowest temperature that we can achieve experimentally, with the yellow arrow crossing that temperature representing a hypothetical temperature-sensitive transition in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup>. We include this transition because the P<sub>o</sub>-T relation in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup> shows some temperature-dependence to P<sub>o</sub> at T &lt; 10°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). To verify the existence of this transition in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup>, we tested two manipulations that should shift the temperature range over which that transition operates. Capsazepine has been proposed to shift heat activation of TRPV1 to higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matta and Ahern, 2007</xref>), and we therefore tested whether this allosteric inhibitor might produce a rightward shift in the P<sub>o</sub>-T relation, making the temperature- sensitive transition more readily detectable in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup>. Indeed, the addition of capsazepine resulted in clear temperature-dependence of P<sub>o</sub> at low temperatures in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>). Next, we tested intermediate external Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations to see if temperature-dependent changes in P<sub>o</sub> could be detected at lower temperatures. We obtained P<sub>o</sub>-T relations at 10, 30 and 65 mM external Na<sup>+</sup>, and observed clear temperature-dependence at low temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), with enthalpies close to those measured in the presence of 130 mM external Na<sup>+</sup> in the same temperature range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that the TRPV1 channel undergoes the same conformational transitions in response to heat regardless of whether external Na<sup>+</sup> is present, and thus that the enthalpy (ΔH<sup>o</sup>) associated with Na<sup>+</sup> binding is not itself responsible for temperature-dependent gating (for a more detailed discussion see Materials and methods). Rather, it seems that external Na<sup>+</sup> modifies the midpoint (or entropy, △S) of the temperature-sensitive transition that operates at low temperatures. Additionally, external Na<sup>+</sup> appears to stabilize a closed state of the channel independently of its effect on temperature-sensitivity, as the P<sub>o</sub> values corresponding to the inferred plateau regions (denoted by dotted lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> - insert) decrease as the concentration of external Na<sup>+</sup> is increased.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13356.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The response of the TRPV1 channel to heating is dominated by distinct conformational transitions over different temperature ranges.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Normalized P<sub>o</sub>-T relations (mean ± SEM, n = 3) obtained in the presence of 0 Na<sub>o</sub> and capsazepine (Cpz).

In the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>, the two temperature-sensitive transitions have similar midpoints, such that the plateau between the two is barely noticeable in the P<sub>o</sub>-T relation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> insert, grey arrows). Upon Na<sup>+</sup> removal, the midpoint of the first temperature-sensitive transition shifts to lower temperatures, effectively extending the middle plateau where P<sub>o</sub> is temperature-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> insert, yellow lines and arrows) and the channel mostly occupies the open/closed equilibrium highlighted with orange squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. Additionally, external Na<sup>+</sup> also negatively impacts the opening transition through allosteric coupling, which results in the intermediate plateau between the two temperature-dependent transitions in P<sub>o</sub>-T relations having a lower P<sub>o</sub> in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup>. This simple model can qualitatively reproduce our results at intermediate Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). One important feature of the model is that the opening transition is relatively temperature-insensitive, and that the channel can open even when the temperature sensor is in the deactivated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,</xref> C – O transitions with blue squares). Although we would not rule out measurable changes in ΔH<sup>o</sup> during opening, as shown by an alternate model that also satisfactorily reproduced our experimental results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), such a mechanism would require divergent temperature-sensitive transitions depending on whether external Na<sup>+</sup> is bound to the channel, which we consider to be more conceptually complex than the allosteric model proposed here (see Materials and methods for a more detailed discussion). Additionally, in the alternate model ii, external Na<sup>+</sup> influences the temperature-dependent transition that occurs at lower temperatures in the same way as in Model i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also cannot rule out the possibility that the temperature sensors have to activate for the channel to open (i.e., occupancy of the open states with blue squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> is negligible), as the gating of TRPV1 channels remains temperature-sensitive even at the lowest temperatures examined. However, in the absence of constraining experimental data, we have opted for the more general mechanism depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13356.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>An allosteric framework for TRPV1 channel gating.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme for Model i with two temperature-dependent transitions (horizontal arrows) given by equilibrium constants J<sub>1</sub> and J<sub>2</sub> of the form J(T) = exp(-(ΔH<sup>o</sup>-TΔS<sup>o</sup>)/RT)) and a temperature-independent opening transition (vertical arrows) with equilibrium constant L.

At 8°C, the fractional activation by saturating capsaicin in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup> was substantially lower than what we observed at 22°C, revealing that lowering temperature further decreased the efficacy of capsaicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>; 8°C colored circles; 22°C colored ramps; see black arrows). We then obtained the full P<sub>o</sub>-T relationship in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup> and capsaicin, as before for the WT channel, but for the turret deletion we observed large temperature-dependent changes in P<sub>o</sub>, with two components in the relation separated by a clear plateau at intermediate temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B</xref> for P<sub>o</sub>-T relations from individual cells). These findings with the turret deletion further support the allosteric framework for conceptualizing the mechanism by which Na<sup>+</sup> and capsaicin influence temperature-dependent gating. Notably, we could accurately describe the P<sub>o</sub>-T relations in saturating capsaicin and the dose-response for external Na<sup>+</sup> for the turret deletion using model i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), simply by assuming that the deletion of the pore turret increased the affinity of the channel for external Na<sup>+</sup> and reduced the strength of the coupling between the binding of capsaicin and the opening of the pore (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 7—source data 2E</xref>). Together, these results qualitatively show that capsaicin influences both the activity of the temperature-sensor and the open/closed equilibrium, but appears to have a larger influence on the latter. Even though the values of the coupling parameters in our modeling are not well-determined, we believe that the larger influence of capsaicin on the open/closed equilibrium is robust enough to support this conclusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Influence of DkTx on temperature-dependent gating</title><p>The results thus far demonstrate that the external pore of TRPV1 contains Na<sup>+</sup> ion binding sites that exert strong control over temperature-dependent activation and inactivation, as well as the closed/open equilibrium. Our previous results with DkTx suggest external Na<sup>+</sup> and DkTx modulate the TRPV1 through a common mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). In addition, our recent analysis of the interaction between DkTx and TRPV1 suggests that the toxin activates the channel by inducing a displacement of the S5-S6 segments relative to the S1-S4 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which results in the disruption of a cluster of buried hydrophobic residues at the extracellular ends of the S5 and S6 segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2016</xref>). This is interesting in light of a recent demonstration in the Shaker Kv channel that movement of hydrophobic residues between buried and solvent-exposed environments imparts temperature-dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chowdhury et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore measured P<sub>o</sub>-T relations in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup> and DkTx to test whether the binding of the toxin has an effect on temperature-sensitivity, and observed that activation of the channel by heat was effectively ablated between 5 and 35°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1B</xref> for P<sub>o</sub>-T relations from individual cells). This finding is particularly striking when considering that the P<sub>o</sub> is situated well below the theoretical upper limit of 1.0. These results demonstrate that DkTx also exerts strong control over temperature-sensor activation, which in our model can be achieved simply by trapping the channel in the intermediate plateau and preventing temperature-sensor deactivation or full activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10,</xref> insert).<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13356.033</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>The binding of DkTx to the outer pore of TRPV1 effectively ablates temperature-dependent gating over a wide range of temperatures.</title><p>P<sub>o</sub>-T relation (mean ± SEM, n = 9) for WT TRPV1 obtained in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup> and DkTx.

First, our results demonstrate that the TRPV1 channel has evolved external Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites that must be occupied for the channel to remain closed at physiological body temperatures in mammals. The steeply temperature-sensitive transition that normally opens TRPV1 in response to noxious heat still operates in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup>, yet without external Na<sup>+</sup> the channel would be spontaneously open at physiological temperatures, many channels would be inactivated, and responses to noxious heat would therefore be diminished. Our results also show that the Na<sup>+</sup> sites will play physiologically important roles in activation of the channel by acid, as protonation of acidic residues involved in binding Na<sup>+</sup> leads to diminished Na<sup>+</sup> occupancy and activation of the channel. This connection between Na<sup>+</sup> and pH regulation provides a mechanistic explanation for previous observations where mildly acidic solutions potentiate activation of TRPV1 by heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jordt et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, this Na<sup>+</sup> regulatory mechanism plays a fundamental role in tuning the properties of TRPV1 to serve as a detector of noxious heat and acid, and possibly other stimuli that have yet to be examined.</p><p>Second, our results reveal the existence of multiple temperature-sensitive transitions that are coupled to the opening transition (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A </xref>). Although we see only hints of the presence of distinct temperature-dependent transitions in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), they become unambiguous when Na<sup>+</sup> is removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>)and when studied in the presence of capsaicin with the turret deletion construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C)</xref>. Our results suggest that the role of the first temperature-sensitive transition is to maintain the channel in a closed state at physiological temperatures, whereas the second transition functions to activate the channel in response to noxious heat. It is interesting that both Na<sup>+</sup> and capsaicin do not seem to have a substantial impact on the second transition, at least to the extent that we could study this component in the presence of inactivation. In contrast, external Na<sup>+</sup> exerts strong control over the first transition. Capsaicin also modifies the shape of macroscopic P<sub>o</sub>-T relations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A)</xref>, but we were able to detect temperature-dependent transitions at low temperatures even in the presence of near-saturating capsaicin concentrations (e.g. 100 nM) that increase the P<sub>o</sub> at room temperature to values higher than those measured in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> or in the presence of DkTx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C)</xref>. In contrast, we observed marginal to no temperature-dependence in the P<sub>o</sub>-T relations at low temperatures in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> or in the presence of DkTx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">)</xref>. These observations suggest that the vanilloid has a larger influence on the open/closed equilibrium than on the temperature-sensing machinery. The existence of multiple temperature-sensitive transitions also provides a possible explanation for why P<sub>o</sub>-T relations at negative voltages are at least two-fold steeper than at positive voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Voets et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2010</xref>). If hyperpolarization shifts the temperature-sensitive transition operating at lower temperatures so as to coincide with the second temperature-sensitive transition, the △H<sup>o</sup> of the two transitions would add to make the P<sub>o</sub>-T steeper. Overall, the present results on the influence of Na<sup>+</sup> and capsaicin on temperature-dependent gating in TRPV1 provide a set of essential constraints for understanding the gating mechanism of the channel using an allosteric framework.</p><p>Third, our results provide clues about where these important Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites are located. Because Na<sup>+</sup> inhibition has only very weak voltage-dependence, these Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites are likely to be located outside the ion permeation pathway within each subunit. Indeed, the large outward Na<sup>+</sup> currents we observe on removing external Na<sup>+</sup> at positive voltages indicate that the permeation pathway must have a high Na<sup>+</sup> occupancy even in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup>. Mutating acidic residues forming the external Na<sup>+</sup> site would weaken Na<sup>+</sup> binding affinity, possibly leading to lower Na<sup>+</sup> occupancy in the presence of 130 mM external Na<sup>+</sup>. However, such an effect would not necessarily cause spontaneous TRPV1 activity because the lower Na<sup>+</sup> occupancy would be expected to promote the form of inactivation that we observed on removing external Na<sup>+</sup>. Additionally, removing external Na<sup>+</sup> would be expected to cause less activation of the channel compared to the WT protein because ion occupancy would be diminished by the mutant. E600 in the extracellular loop just after the S5 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) has been proposed to be responsible for proton-mediated potentiation of heat- and capsaicin-dependent activation of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jordt et al., 2000</xref>), making it an excellent candidate for forming the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site. The E600Q mutant displayed modest spontaneous activity when recording at room temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohta et al., 2008</xref>), and only weak activation when removing external Na<sup>+</sup> or applying DkTx when compared with the WT channel, consistent with a role in forming the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site. Interestingly, E600 is located near the pore turret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which when deleted from TRPV1 causes a dramatic increase in the apparent affinity of Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), and this residue is also located very close to where DkTx binds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our results have important implications for interpreting the recent cryo-EM structures of TRPV1 and in localizing the region of the protein involved in temperature sensing. In the cryo-EM studies on the turret deletion construct of TRPV1, capsaicin appears to produce a partial opening of the internal pore, and the combined influence of RTx and DkTx to produce further expansion of the internal pore together with a conformational change within the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These differences between the two structures might indicate that there are two gates that can be differentially regulated by activating stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, we discovered that capsaicin is a partial agonist of the turret deletion construct, suggesting that the partially open features of the capsaicin-bound channel may not represent a unique conformation of the protein, but an average of closed and open states. The cryo-EM structure of the apo state of TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 2013</xref>), however, reveals that the internal pore must expand for the pore to support ion permeation, consistent with accessibility studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salazar et al., 2009</xref>). The observation of temperature-independent plateaus in P<sub>o</sub>-T relations under diverse conditions that produce submaximal open probabilities suggests that the opening of the pore does not require the two temperature-dependent transitions to occur, and that the open/closed equilibrium itself is not the source of the temperature-sensitivity of TRPV1. If opening of the internal pore is indeed temperature-insensitive, what is the significance of the structural changes in the external pore observed in the structure of the RTx/DkTx-bound channel? The present findings with external Na<sup>+</sup> and DkTx suggest that these structural changes in the external pore are tightly associated with the temperature-sensing machinery, either by participating in allosteric coupling or in the actual mechanism of temperature-sensing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Channel constructs, cell culture and transfection</title><p>The WT rat TRPV1 channel in pcDNA3.1 vector was kindly provided by Dr. David Julius (UCSF), and subcloned into the low-expression pcDNA1 vector.

Both T and I were simultaneously recorded and the bath was kept static during the course of the recordings. Only a single experimental solution was tested per cell. Currents were elicited while increasing or decreasing temperature by applying trains of voltage pulses from -90 to +90 mV (from a holding of -90 mV), with pulse durations that ranged from 100 to 400 ms. Longer pulses were used for I-T relations at the lowest temperatures, since activation kinetics were much slower. Pulse length did not have an appreciable effect on I-T relations when evaluated at the same time-points for experiments with different pulse durations (data not shown). For obtaining I-T relations extending to cold temperatures, experiments were started at room temperature, and the temperature was decreased to the lowest value in which TRPV1 currents could still be reliably measured, as indicated by time-dependent relaxations in response to the depolarizing pulses that were at least twice the magnitude of the currents at -90 mV. Immediately after reaching the minimal temperature, experiments were initiated by increasing the temperature. For I-T relations starting at room temperature, the experiments were started without an initial cooling phase.</p><p>To generate I-T relations, steady-state currents at +90 mV for each pulse within a train were quantified and plotted as a function of temperature.

Standard errors for the temperature are also included in all I-T and P<sub>o</sub>-T relations shown, but are too small to be seen.

The P<sub>o</sub> at room temperature and +90 mV for 0 Na<sub>o</sub> (i.e., 130 mM extracellular NMDG) was then estimated from the macroscopic I-V relations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and C</xref>) to be ~0.2. For other experimental conditions where P<sub>o</sub> is similar to that measured in 0 Na<sub>o</sub>, we estimated the P<sub>o</sub>-values at room temperature and +90 mV simply by recording I-V relations at the test conditions and 0 Na<sub>o</sub> and scaling based on 0 Na<sub>o</sub>. The following conditions were scaled in this way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and C</xref>): 0 Na<sub>o</sub> + 1 µM Cpz., 0 Na<sub>o</sub> + 10 µM Cpz., 10 Na<sub>o</sub>, 30 Na<sub>o</sub>, 130 Na<sub>o</sub> + 100 nM caps., 130 Na<sub>o</sub> + 25 nM caps., 130 Na<sub>o</sub> + 1 µM DkTx.

We also validated our scaling procedure using noise analysis (see below for methodological description).

Macroscopic data from other laboratories also show less-than-maximal channel activation by temperature as compared with saturating capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). One important consideration in comparing single-channel and macroscopic data is the fact that temperature-inactivated channels can still respond to saturating capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2014</xref>), and that temperature-dependent channel inactivation (or rundown) also occurs in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup>, so that it is possible that a subset of channels in HEK293 cells cultured at 37°C are inactivated and therefore unresponsive to heat. This would lead to an underestimation of the P<sub>o</sub> in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> or in heat-activation experiments in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> when measured from macroscopic current recordings, as in the present study. However, we think that this underestimation is not large given our noise-analysis results in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D–G</xref>) and the observation of frequent closures in our outside-out recordings where the activity of single channels can be discerned, indicating that the P<sub>o</sub> in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> is not maximal even at 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

The data were acquired at a single temperature per cell. For the WT channel, currents in response to 40–50 voltage pulses (3 s inter-pulse interval) of 400 ms duration from -90 to +90 mV were obtained at 0 Na<sub>o</sub>, followed by another 50 pulses at 10 µM capsaicin + 130 Na<sub>o</sub>. For TRPV1-Δ604–626, 10 traces were obtained in 0 Na<sub>o</sub> (not used for analysis), followed by 50 traces in 10 µM capsaicin + 130 Na<sub>o</sub>, and finally 50 traces in 0 Na<sub>o</sub> + 10 µM capsaicin. For each experiment, the current variance (<italic>σ<sup>2</sup><sub>I</sub></italic>) was calculated from the ~50 current traces obtained with the same extracellular recording solution (i.e. 0 Na<sub>o</sub> or 130 Na<sub>o</sub> + caps, for the WT channel) as the ensemble average of the squared differences of successive currents records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heinemann and Conti, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2002</xref>), an optimal method for channels with rundown.

The noise-analysis approach used here assumes that <italic>i</italic> and <italic>N</italic> are not changed by Na<sup>+</sup>-removal or addition of capsaicin, since data obtained at two different conditions were plotted together in our variance vs mean plots, and fitted with the same parameters. We believe this assumption to be supported by several lines of evidence, as discussed above.</p><p>It is important to note that the single-channel current values at +90 mV estimated from noise analysis systematically underestimate <italic>i</italic> by a factor of ~2 when compared to single-channel recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2F</xref>).

However, the P<sub>o</sub> calculated using parameters from unconstrained fits are similar to that calculated using constrained fits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2G</xref>), indicating that the noise analysis provides approximate estimates of the P<sub>o</sub> that coincide with equivalent values obtained using single-channel recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Premkumar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hui et al., 2003</xref>). Notably, the temperature-dependence of <italic>i</italic>-T relations obtained from the estimates of <italic>i</italic> using noise analysis is consistent with estimates we obtained from macroscopic I-T relations in saturating capsaicin and single-channel recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-7"><title>Assumptions for the modeling of temperature-dependent gating of the TRPV1 channel</title><p>The allosteric model i is conceptually simple and contains the necessary features to qualitatively reproduce the most relevant aspects of our data pertaining to the effects of temperature, external Na<sup>+</sup> and capsaicin on the gating of TRPV1. A slightly simpler version of the model (with only a single temperature-dependent transition) has been used to accurately reproduce the effects of capsaicin, voltage and a narrow range of temperatures in TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matta and Ahern, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gregorio-Teruel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gregorio-Teruel et al., 2015</xref>). However, four mechanistically relevant assumptions inherent to this model are not so evidently justified by the data, and require further discussion.</p><p>The most important assumption regarding the model is that the opening transition is temperature-independent. This feature of the model was incorporated in order to reproduce the plateaus observed in some P<sub>o</sub>-T relations, in which the P<sub>o</sub> does not increase with temperature despite being well below its maximal theoretical value of 1.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Are there other gating mechanisms that produce temperature-independent gating at P<sub>o</sub> &lt; 1.0 and have a temperature-dependent open/closed equilibrium? This is relevant given a recent study on Kv channels, which suggested that the opening transition of channels structurally related to the TRPV1 can be steeply temperature-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, if the opening transition were responsible for the heat-activation of the TRPV1, a lot of information on the elusive mechanism of temperature-dependent gating could be readily gained from the structures of the channel in the closed and open states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). A temperature-dependent open/closed equilibrium implies that the enthalpies (H<sup>o</sup>) associated with the open and the closed states are different (i.e. ΔH<sup>o</sup> is large). A modulator such as Na<sup>+</sup> could affect the temperature-dependence of channel opening by altering the enthalpy of the open or the closed state such that ΔH<sup>o</sup> changes. In this scenario, a temperature-independent opening transition (with ΔH<sup>o</sup> ≈ 0) could become temperature-dependent through the binding of sodium, if sodium increases the enthalpy of the open state or decreases the enthalpy of the closed state. The resulting P<sub>o</sub>-T relations would be flat (no temperature-dependence) in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup>, and steeply temperature-dependent in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>. However, our experimental results suggest that the channel retains temperature-dependence in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup>, as evidenced by the steep I-T relations at T &gt; 30°C obtained from temperature jumps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and the I-T relations at low temperatures in the presence of capsazepine without external Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This indicates that external Na<sup>+</sup> is not directly responsible for conferring temperature-sensitivity to the TRPV1 channel. Thus, a model in which external Na<sup>+</sup> confers temperature-sensitivity to the opening transition would require distinct Na<sup>+</sup>-independent heat-driven transitions to occur in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> in order to replicate our experimental results. Model ii (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>) incorporates these requirements and reproduces our experimental findings with comparable accuracy as model i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, model ii is mechanistically more complex than model i, since it requires distinct temperature-dependent transitions depending on whether the channel is bound to external Na<sup>+</sup> or not, implying that the TRPV1 possess different mechanisms of temperature-sensing. On the contrary, model i requires a single pair of temperature-dependent transitions and a common mechanism for temperature-sensing. Although a distinction between the two possibilities cannot be made, we favor model i due to its simplicity. Additionally, it can be concluded that the opening transition is not obligatorily temperature-dependent, but could become temperature-dependent under more complex models for TRPV1 channel gating.</p><p>The second important assumption is the inclusion of an additional temperature-dependent transition in model i. The inherent complexity of P<sub>o</sub>-T relations in 130 Na<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) strongly suggest that there are at least two temperature-dependent transitions involved in the gating mechanism of the TRPV1 channel. Furthermore, the P<sub>o</sub>-T relations obtained with the turret-deletion construct in saturating capsaicin and external Na<sup>+</sup> unambiguously show the presence of at least two different temperature-dependent transitions associated with gating of TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B</xref>). One transition appears to dominate temperature-dependent gating at T &gt; 38°C, and represents the steep temperature-dependence that has been measured for TRPV1 in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Voets et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). Another transition dominates channel activity at lower temperatures, and appears to have a somewhat lower temperature-dependence, although this may only be the result of this temperature-dependent transition being close to saturation in the experimentally accessible range of temperatures. If the data is simulated using a model with a single temperature-dependent transition (Model iii, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>) with a large associated enthalpy, the resulting P<sub>o</sub>-T curves at T &lt; 35°C would be steeper than the experimental data. If the enthalpy for the temperature-sensor is chosen such that the model agrees well with the experimental data at T &lt; 35°C, then the predicted P<sub>o</sub>-T relations lack the highly temperature-dependent increase in P<sub>o</sub> at T &gt; 38°C that is characteristic of the TRPV1 channel (see the predictions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating that activation of the TRPV1 by heat involves at least two temperature-dependent transitions. Finally, we arranged the two temperature-dependent transitions in Model i sequentially, as opposed to considering them as separate coupled equilibria in a parallel arrangement. We chose a sequential arrangement of the transitions because it reduces the number of states in the model and eliminates a free parameter (the allosteric coupling constant between the two temperature-dependent transitions). However, fits to the experimental P<sub>o</sub>-T relations of identical quality could be obtained with a parallel arrangement of temperature-sensors (data not shown), so that this aspect of the model is unconstrained.</p><p>A third assumption in Model i is that external Na<sup>+</sup> can bind to the TRPV1 in all of its possible conformations (i.e., there are no states to which sodium cannot bind). This has important implications for the mechanism of Na<sup>+</sup>-regulation because one alternate mechanism by which sodium could inhibit the TRPV1 channel is by binding exclusively to the closed state. In that case, sufficiently high concentrations of external Na<sup>+</sup> should completely prevent opening of the channel by other stimuli. We can exclude this possibility because the channel can be robustly opened with capsaicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and heat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) in the presence of a saturating concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> (130 mM), or even when the concentration of extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> ions is increased to 600 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>) or 2 M (data not shown). In addition, temperature-dependent activation of TRPV1 in the presence of 600 mM external Na<sup>+</sup> does not qualitatively differ from that measured with 130 mM external Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting that external Na<sup>+</sup> does not modulate the temperature-sensor by binding exclusively to its resting state.</p><p>The fourth assumption in the modeling was to neglect the effect of voltage-dependent gating on the calculated P<sub>o</sub>-T relations, given that all experimental data were obtained at a fixed voltage. The low permeability of NMDG<sup>+</sup> relative to Na<sup>+</sup> greatly limited the range of voltages over which we could obtain useful data at most of the relevant experimental conditions in this study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). We therefore decided to estimate how much could changes in voltage above 0 mV alter the shape of P<sub>o</sub>-T curves in both saturating capsaicin and in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup>. To do this, we first calculated G-V relations in saturating capsaicin at two temperatures (22°C and 8°C) from families of currents elicited by voltage-steps from -120 to +140 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The G-V relations at both temperatures reach saturation at 0 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>), indicating that voltage does not appreciably influence channel gating and its temperature-dependence in saturating capsaicin at positive membrane potentials, consistent with previous measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matta and Ahern, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, this indicates that voltage-dependent changes in the I-V relations in saturating capsaicin at positive voltages reflect only the changes in single-channel current as a function of voltage but not changes in P<sub>o</sub>. We therefore divided the I-V relations in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> (22°C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>; 8°C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>) by the I-V relations in saturating capsaicin to obtain the fraction of open channels (P<sub>o</sub>) as a function of voltage for data at both temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C</xref>). The resulting P<sub>o</sub>-V relations at the two temperatures superimpose, confirming that removal of external Na<sup>+</sup> leads to negligible temperature-dependence in channel gating over a range from 5 to 25°C. Moreover, the P<sub>o</sub>-V relations show only weak voltage-dependence, suggesting that the effects of voltage-dependent gating on our P<sub>o</sub>-T relations measured at a fixed voltage should have a minimal influence on the interpretation of our results. We therefore decided not to include voltage-dependent transitions in our final model.</p><p>One final modification to the model was included to better account for the Na<sup>+</sup> and capsaicin concentration-dependence of P<sub>o</sub>, since both modulators seem to exhibit weak cooperativity. Indeed, cooperative interactions between capsaicin and protons have been proposed to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ryu et al., 2003</xref>), as well as positive cooperativity in the binding of other vanilloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acs and Blumberg, 1994</xref>). To explicitly introduce cooperativity would have required us to extend the model to take into account the tetrameric assembly of TRPV1, incrementing the number of states, free parameters and assumptions necessary to model the data. We therefore introduced an arbitrary cooperativity term for the binding of both Na<sup>+</sup> and capsaicin as is done in the Hill model of cooperativity, such that the modified capsaicin- or Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent equilibrium constants had the form: K<sub>1</sub> = (K<sub>1</sub>’ x [Na])<sup>1.5</sup> and K<sub>2</sub> = (K<sub>1</sub>’ x [caps.])<sup>1.5</sup>.</p><p>P<sub>o</sub> values from the models were calculated using programs written in Igor. Data was fit by visual inspection while manually varying the parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-8"><title>On the effect of heat capacity (ΔC<sub>p</sub>) on modeled P<sub>o</sub>-T curves</title><p>The molecular mechanism underlying high-temperature sensitivity in thermo-TRP channels remains unknown. In this regard, it was recently noted that changes in side-chain hydration associated with a protein conformational transition that involves only a few residues could result in moderate changes in ΔC<sub>p</sub>, which in turn would render that conformational change highly temperature-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clapham and Miller, 2011</xref>).

We therefore arbitrarily assigned <italic>k(T)</italic> a Na<sup>+</sup>- and temperature-dependent pre-factor <italic>k<sub>0</sub></italic> as follows: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo/><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where A is a constant and <italic>F<sub>Na</sub></italic> is the fraction of Na<sup>+</sup>-bound states at equilibrium relative to the total number of states in model i. Finally, to include time in the final calculation of inactivating P<sub>o</sub>-T curves we took advantage of the sigmoidal shape of our experimental temperature vs time plots (see the inserts on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>), allowing us to have an empiric function to transform the temperature in the x-axis of P<sub>o</sub>-T plots into time. The function was: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.83258</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>ln</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>3.3181</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>T<sub>max</sub></italic> is the maximal temperature (which was set to 333 K) and <italic>T</italic> is the temperature (in Kelvins). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5A</xref> shows a calculated temperature vs time plot, which was then used to obtain P<sub>o</sub>-T curves with inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5B</xref>). This approach allowed us to replicate the overall shape of P<sub>o</sub>-T curves with inactivation and their Na<sup>+</sup> dependence, confirming that temperature-dependent inactivation can indeed reduce the apparent steepness of P<sub>o</sub>-T relations and ultimately leading to a steep decay in open probability. The parameters used in the modeling were: <italic>A</italic> = 200, <italic>ΔH<sup>≠</sup></italic> = 45 kcal/mol, <italic>ΔS<sup>≠</sup></italic> = 0.133 kcal/mol.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Mark Mayer, Joe Mindell, Shai Silberberg, Gilman Toombes and members of the Swartz lab for helpful discussions.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, David Clapham, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another is Baron Chanda.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Jara-Oseguera, Bae, and Swartz carry out the most thorough biophysical investigation of the TRPV1 channel to date and establish the allosteric nature of capsaicin and temperature gating of this important ion channel. The general question is how TRPV1 responds to small temperature changes. The results demonstrate that the TRPV1 channel has an external Na binding site that must be occupied for the channel to remain closed at physiological temperature, and is also likely responsible for acid sensing. The Na<sup>+</sup> regulatory mechanism thus tunes TRPV1 for noxious stimuli. The authors find evidence for multiple temperature-sensitive transitions that couple to a relatively temperature-insensitive opening transition; the first temperature-sensitive transition maintains the channel in a closed state at physiological temperatures, whereas the second transition functions to activate the channel in response to noxious heat. Na<sup>+</sup> inhibition has only very weak voltage-dependence, and there is substantial evidence in this paper that the site is near the turret, likely involving E600 in the extracellular loop just after the S5 helix and close to the DkTx binding site. This is a solid contribution to the field and for the first time provides evidence for multiple temperature-dependent transitions in the TRPV1 channel. Nevertheless, we have some concerns mainly with regards to the interpretation of their data and its implications.</p><p>Points to consider in the revision:</p><p>1) The data and their models are consistent with an allosteric site for sodium binding which when occupied favors channel closure. This allosteric site like all the other allosteric sites has an independent equilibrium constant and is coupled to pore opening with a coupling constant. It also coupled to temperature-sensors and capsaicin binding site with coupling constants of different strengths. However, the manuscript is presented as if the sodium binding site is uniquely involved in temperature-dependent gating. The title states that &quot;sodium ion binding site controls temperature-dependent gating&quot; whereas, in our opinion, it would be more appropriate to state that &quot;sodium ion binding site is allosteric modulator of pore gating&quot;. The sodium ion binding site is as much of an influence on temperature-dependent gating as capsaicin, protons or voltage-sensor which incidentally was not included in this model. While the authors might argue that the coupling constants that link sodium ion binding site to the temperature-sensor activation is much higher than those linking capsaicin binding site, we think that simply reflects the problem of parameter identifiability. It is unclear whether these equilibrium parameters are unique especially in absence of kinetic constraints. For instance, if these model parameters are correct, then the coupling constants that link temperature dependent transition to pore opening is much smaller than those that link capsaicin binding or sodium activation to channel opening (models i and iii). Therefore, by this logic the TRPV1 channels are only weakly activated by temperature. In light of these uncertainties, it is incumbent on the authors to interpret their models with a degree of parsimony.

We have now addressed all of their concerns, as described in detail below. In addition to the changes suggested by the reviewers, we have made a couple of additional modifications to the manuscript which we will describe first:</p><p>1) For all figures depicting structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we have now used our refined structural models of the TRPV1 in the apo and the DkTx/RTx bound states, which includes the docked solution structure of the DkTx tarantula toxin. These models are described in another publication currently in press in <italic>eLife</italic> (Bae et al., 2016), and have been refined to contain significantly less structural violations and contain energy minimized positions for side chains and flexible loops. We also make reference to a possible mechanism for activation of the TRPV1 channel by DkTx inferred from that study, which points to a site on the extracellular pore which is affected by the binding of the toxin and that could potentially be involved in temperature-sensing.</p><p>2) We have included data showing that extracellular magnesium can directly activate the TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This is an important point, as two recent studies in which external sodium was replaced with magnesium proposed that the divalent ions affect the temperature-sensitivity of the channel without taking into consideration the inhibitory effect of sodium on TRPV1 (Cao et al., JGP, 2014 and Yang et al., JGP, 2014).</p><p><italic>Points to consider in the revision:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) The data and their models are consistent with an allosteric site for sodium binding which when occupied favors channel closure. This allosteric site like all the other allosteric sites has an independent equilibrium constant and is coupled to pore opening with a coupling constant. It also coupled to temperature-sensors and capsaicin binding site with coupling constants of different strengths. However, the manuscript is presented as if the sodium binding site is uniquely involved in temperature-dependent gating. The title states that &quot;sodium ion binding site controls temperature-dependent gating&quot; whereas, in our opinion, it would be more appropriate to state that &quot;sodium ion binding site is allosteric modulator of pore gating&quot;. The sodium ion binding site is as much of an influence on temperature-dependent gating as capsaicin, protons or voltage-sensor which incidentally was not included in this model. While the authors might argue that the coupling constants that link sodium ion binding site to the temperature-sensor activation is much higher than those linking capsaicin binding site, we think that simply reflects the problem of parameter identifiability. It is unclear whether these equilibrium parameters are unique especially in absence of kinetic constraints. For instance, if these model parameters are correct, then the coupling constants that link temperature dependent transition to pore opening is much smaller than those that link capsaicin binding or sodium activation to channel opening (models i and iii). Therefore, by this logic the TRPV1 channels are only weakly activated by temperature. In light of these uncertainties, it is incumbent on the authors to interpret their models with a degree of parsimony. These caveats should be also reflected in their Abstract.</italic> </p><p>We have now modified the title of the manuscript, the Abstract and the main text to emphasize a more general role of the external sodium site in the allosteric gating of TRPV1. We also now give more emphasis to the effects of capsaicin on temperature-sensitivity and gating in general. A small restructuring in the order of the figures in the paper has allowed us to provide a more compelling and precise discussion on the role of capsaicin on temperature-sensitivity. While the large number of free parameters in the model and the small number of experimental constraints don’t allow us to make comparisons between the relative magnitudes of the coupling constants for external sodium and capsaicin, we believe that the observation that P<sub>o</sub>-T relations at all subsaturating concentrations of capsaicin exhibit temperature dependence at low temperatures, in contrast to what we observe in the absence of external sodium, suggests that capsaicin has a much larger influence on the open/closed equilibrium than on the function of the temperature-sensor. Otherwise, no temperature-dependent changes in P<sub>o</sub> at low temperatures would be observed in the presence of capsaicin, as is observed in the case of DkTx. This is now discussed more clearly in the text. We have also incorporated a discussion on the possible alternatives to the model proposed here in the main text to stress that other alternative models are theoretically possible, but while also emphasizing the qualitative features of the data that are independent of the model. Finally, we now give equal weight to the allosteric effect of external sodium on temperature-dependent gating and on the open/closed equilibrium, as there is no way of drawing any quantitative conclusions on the relative magnitudes of the strength of the couplings between external sodium and the two other equilibria.</p><p><italic>2) The calculated P<sub>o</sub> in presence of full sodium is much smaller than 0.1 even at their highest temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

We think that one source of the difference is that there may be a fraction of channels that are heat-inactivated in macroscopic recordings, leading to an underestimation of P<sub>o</sub>. However, we think that there is variability in the maximal P<sub>o</sub> for heat activation, because our noise analysis is roughly consistent with our method for calculating P<sub>o</sub> from macroscopic currents and our recordings where unitary channel activity can be discerned are not consistent with a P<sub>o</sub> near 1. We have added a discussion of this issue in the Methods section (subsection “Scaling of Po-T relations based on macroscopic current recordings“, last paragraph), and pointed out how this does not affect any of the conclusions presented in our study.</p><p><italic>3) The authors do not have strong evidence to suggest that the temperature-sensor is allosterically coupled to the pore.

Two different issues are now mentioned: 1) whether the opening transition is itself temperature-dependent and 2) whether the channel requires activation of the temperature sensor in order to activate. We consider that the observation of temperature-independent plateaus in P<sub>o</sub>-T relations at P<sub>o</sub> values lower than 1 suggests that the opening transition itself is not obligatorily temperature-dependent, as the channel can still be closed by voltage while on the plateaus. This does not preclude the possibility of the activation gate of TRPV1 transitioning to various conformations, with some of these transitions occurring in a temperature-dependent manner. However, we consider this possibility to be mechanistically more complex than the model proposed in the manuscript, which is now described explicitly in the main text. Regarding the need of the temperature-sensor to activate in order for the channel to open, we now mention in the main text that this remains an open question, but that we have favored the more general mechanism that considers all possible transitions, including opening of channels with temperature sensors in the resting state. We have also modified the pictorial depiction of our model, which aids in the treatment of these issues.</p><p> <italic>4) TRPM7 is ubiquitous and contributes to outward currents in all cells we have examined.

Typically our whole-cell recordings have very small leak currents at negative voltages, with some exceptions that become more frequent as the passage number of the culture increases. TRPV1 displays prominent outward rectification, and in our recording conditions, the contaminating endogenous currents would become evident as larger inward currents at negative voltages and a reduction of the outward-rectifying character of IV relations for TRPV1. We systematically discarded cells that displayed less prominent outward rectification. We also noticed that these endogenous currents become more prominent at elevated temperatures (since they start to increase at T &gt; 20 °C), which is the reason why we included magnesium in the pipette solution for all heat-activation experiments. We had originally performed quite a few experiments at high-temperature without magnesium, which we repeated once we realized that these currents sometimes contaminated our recordings. We also checked that adding magnesium does not influence IV relations in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> or after addition of DkTx, and all of our experiments at room temperature display pronounced outward-rectification, so we are confident that these reflect the activity of TRPV1. We have now detailed this in the Methods section.</p></body></sub-article> </article>
