Surprisingly, less than 50% of hippocampal CA1 presynaptic boutons contain mitochondria, raising the question of whether synapses without mitochondria can sustain changes in efficacy. To address this question, we analyzed synapses from postnatal day 15 (P15) and adult rat hippocampus that had undergone theta-burst stimulation to produce long-term potentiation (TBS-LTP) and compared them to control or no stimulation. At 30 and 120 min after TBS-LTP, vesicles were decreased only in presynaptic boutons that contained mitochondria at P15, and vesicle decrement was greatest in adult boutons containing mitochondria. Presynaptic mitochondrial cristae were widened, suggesting a sustained energy demand. Thus, mitochondrial proximity reflected enhanced vesicle mobilization well after potentiation reached asymptote, in parallel with the apparently silent addition of new dendritic spines at P15 or the silent enlargement of synapses in adults.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15275.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15275.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>3D serial electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>synapses</kwd><kwd>dendritic spines</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>learning and memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS201184</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Kristen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006945</institution-id><institution>Texas Emerging Technology Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Kristen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH095980</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Kristen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS074644</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Kristen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH096459</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>Deborah J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000882</institution-id><institution>Brain Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Kristen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Three-dimensional electron microscopy (3DEM) demonstrates the dependence on presynaptic mitochondria for vesicle mobilization as dendritic spines are silently added at P15 or synapses are silently enlarged in adults after long-term potentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria are essential players in synaptic transmission. They produce more than 90% of all neuronal ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harris et al., 2012</xref>), which is needed in many steps of the synaptic vesicle cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Südhof, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chua et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sudhof and Rizo, 2011</xref>). Mitochondria synthesize the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from glutamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Waagepetersoen et al., 2003</xref>). The filling of synaptic vesicles with glutamate requires mitochondrial ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Forgac, 2007</xref>). Docking of synaptic vesicles does not appear to require ATP; however, priming them for subsequent release is an ATP-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yao and Bajjalieh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Verhage and Sørensen, 2008</xref>). Following release, dissociation of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex is an ATP-dependent process that reactivates monomeric SNARE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sudhof and Rizo, 2011</xref>). Endosome-based recycling of synaptic vesicles causes local depletion of ATP and increased production of ATP by mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rangaraju et al., 2014</xref>). Mitochondria contain their own DNA; the proteome of presynaptic mitochondria is enriched in proteins that supply energy and are engaged in synaptic transmission, whereas the proteome of nonsynaptic axonal mitochondria clusters around metabolic and morphogenic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Völgyi et al., 2015</xref>). Axonal mitochondria can move, although they typically remain stationary for periods of hours even after substantial activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Overly et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Obashi and Okabe, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, diffusion of ATP from mitochondria-containing boutons can sustain synaptic transmission at cultured hippocampal synapses without mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pathak et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, ATP from glycolysis can also support synaptic transmission under resting conditions, but mobilization of vesicles from the reserve pool requires mitochondrial ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Verstreken et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, total vesicular release correlates well with the presence and volume of presynaptic mitochondria, suggesting their proximity may enhance synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ivannikov et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Prior to weaning, at postnatal day 21 in rats, neurons have a low capacity for glucose utilization and instead use ketone bodies as their primary energy substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vannucci, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nehlig et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nehlig, 2004</xref>). Unlike glucose metabolism, ketone body metabolism requires mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fukao et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting there might be a stronger requirement for mitochondria to fuel synaptic vesicle cycling at younger ages. Changes in mitochondrial dimensions and the ultrastructure of matrix and cristae reflect altered energy demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ishihara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cagalinec et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hackenbrock, 1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Perkins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Packer, 1960</xref>). Under resting conditions, mitochondria have loosely packed matrix and narrow cristae, whereas under conditions of high energy demand the matrix compacts and cristae widen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hackenbrock, 1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">1968</xref>). These changes appear to reflect, for example, the action of mitochondrial dynamin-like proteins engaged in the metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mannella, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Patten et al., 2014</xref>). Mitochondria also provide local sequestration of calcium that is important for enhanced vesicular release during post-tetanic potentiation lasting a few minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tang and Zucker, 1997</xref>). Thus, the proximity and ultrastructure of presynaptic mitochondria should reliably reflect the capacity to mobilize vesicles and influence the duration of synaptic plasticity depending on the level of activation and the age of the animals.</p><p>Given their many critical functions, it was surprising to find that fewer than half of hippocampal presynaptic boutons contain a mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shepherd and Harris, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pathak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chavan et al., 2015</xref>). This finding raised the question of whether synapses without presynaptic mitochondria can sustain robust and enduring changes in efficacy. To address this question, we analyzed hippocampal synapses that had undergone theta-burst stimulation (TBS) to produce long-term potentiation (LTP) in rat hippocampal area CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourne and Harris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Watson et al., 2016</xref>). LTP is a cellular model of learning that produces enhancement of synaptic efficacy lasting hours to days or longer. Control synapses included those that had undergone test pulses in the same slice or from hippocampus that was unstimulated and perfusion-fixed in vivo. Comparisons were made between postnatal day 15, a pre-weaning age during peak synaptogenesis, and young adult rats at ages (55–70 days old) when intrinsic synaptogenesis has plateaued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fiala et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kirov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Semple et al., 2013</xref>). Prior work has shown an LTP-related increase in synapse number at P15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Watson et al., 2016</xref>), whereas, in the young adults, synapses enlarged at the expense of synaptogenesis by 120 min after the induction of LTP with TBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourne and Harris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2014</xref>). LTP is known to alter many presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayazitov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Enoki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ratnayaka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zakharenko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huganir and Nicoll, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arendt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hill and Zito, 2013</xref>). However, relationships between these changes in efficacy and the proximity of presynaptic mitochondria have not been investigated. Here, 3DEM was used to determine whether sustained synaptic plasticity was specific to mitochondria-containing presynaptic boutons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>At P15 and adult ages, control stimulation and theta-burst stimulation (TBS) produced independent physiological outcomes within the same slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

All boutons entering the inclusion volumes were followed through serial sections to determine whether they had a single synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), multiple synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), or no synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

These results are also consistent with findings from control slice conditions in adult hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shepherd and Harris, 1998</xref>). Since these findings were the same for both types of presynaptic boutons, subsequent analyses do not distinguish between single synaptic and multisynaptic boutons.</p><p>These configurations might have resulted from mitochondria being preferentially located in larger axonal swellings. Then their greater association with more vesicles might have been due to chance because the larger synaptic boutons contained more vesicles. We performed several analyses to address this concern. First, we computed that the portion of axonal volume occupied by mitochondria (28%) was markedly less than the portion of axonal volume without mitochondria (72%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Next, we showed that mitochondria were equally distributed between nonsynaptic inter-bouton regions (51%) and synaptic boutons (49%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). As predicted, we found that axonal diameters were significantly wider at synaptic boutons (0.41 ± 0.015 µm) than at nonsynaptic regions (0.32 ± 0.008 µm, n = 75, F<sub>1,71</sub> = 37.5, p&lt;0.001). However, mitochondrial diameters were similar at synaptic (0.24 ± 0.009 µm) and nonsynaptic (0.23 ± 0.007 µm) regions (n = 75, F<sub>1,71</sub> = 1.25, p=0.27). Finally, the mitochondria fit into all regions of the axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). These results suggest that mitochondria were not restricted from entering even the narrow inter-bouton regions of the axon, as would be required since they can move along axons. The findings also show that mitochondria were not uniformly distributed throughout the axon, as the vast majority of the axon length and volume contained no mitochondria. Furthermore, as shown in subsequent analyses, synapses spanning the full range of sizes (indicated by the presynaptic vesicle counts and PSD areas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) could be associated with presynaptic boutons that contained mitochondria as well as with those that did not contain mitochondria. Thus, the significant effects of mitochondrial proximity on changes in synapse size and presynaptic composition reported below do not appear merely to be due to a chance restriction of mitochondria to larger synaptic boutons.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15275.005</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Synapses had fewer vesicles and PSD areas were smaller as distance from an axonal mitochondrion increased.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Nondocked vesicles versus mitochondrial distance (D<sub>m</sub>) had a statistically significant breakpoint at 2.97 ± 0.67 µm (t(165) = 4.4, p&lt;0.001).

In contrast with earlier time points, the reserve pool of nondocked vesicles was also diminished at 120 min in the TBS relative to the control or perfusion-fixed conditions when the presynaptic boutons contained a mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C2</xref>).</p><p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> above, small synapses were added in the LTP condition at P15, and here we wanted to know whether vesicles proliferated or redistributed to the added synapses. The correlation between vesicle numbers and synapse size was strong for all conditions, whether or not a mitochondrion was present in the presynaptic bouton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). When a mitochondrion was present in the presynaptic bouton, the number of docked and nondocked vesicles was significantly decreased across synapses of all sizes at both 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>) and 120 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>) following the induction of LTP relative to control stimulation.

Synapses without mitochondria were more likely to have no presynaptically docked vesicles at both time points under control conditions (7C, G). More of the synapses without mitochondria lacked docked vesicles at 120 min after induction of LTP with TBS than under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).

While this reduction was present at all synapse sizes, it was most pronounced at larger synapses, suggesting that the newly formed small synapses had less vesicular mobilization.

Thus, mitochondria might not be as critical for elevated release or vesicle mobilization following the induction of LTP in adults versus P15, a pre-weanling age. To test this hypothesis, presynaptic vesicles were compared across boutons with and without mitochondria in adult hippocampal slices that had undergone the same TBS or control stimulation protocols described above for P15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourne et al., 2013</xref>).

Like P15, the PSD areas of the adult synapses were larger when their presynaptic boutons contained a mitochondrion (0.074 ± 0.0058 µm<sup>2</sup>) than when they did not contain a mitochondrion (0.040 ± 0.0025 µm<sup>2</sup>; F<sub>2,226</sub> = 26.3, p&lt;0.0001). Unlike P15, however, adult synapses rarely lacked docked vesicles whether or not a mitochondrion was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F2, G2</xref>). Also in the adults, the docked and nondocked vesicle numbers were well correlated with PSD area, whether or not the bouton contained a mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F1-3, G1-3</xref>). Furthermore, there was a marked decrease in vesicle numbers of mitochondria-containing boutons across synapses of all sizes at 120 min after TBS relative to control stimulation in adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8F2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). However, there was also a small decrease in vesicle number in boutons without a presynaptic mitochondrion in adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8G2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Thus, enhanced vesicular mobilization was greatest in mitochondria-containing presynaptic boutons at both ages but also occurred in those without mitochondria in adult hippocampus, contrasting with P15 where this mobilization only occurred in the mitochondria-containing presynaptic boutons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Changes in mitochondrial dimensions following induction of LTP by TBS</title><p>Increases in synaptic vesicle mobilization have been associated with increased demand for ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rangaraju et al., 2014</xref>). Mitochondria undergo fission to accommodate fluctuating energy demands.

To assess whether the sustained vesicular mobilization resulted in mitochondrial fission or fusion, we measured mitochondria in axons from the TBS and control conditions at 120 min for both ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). Mitochondrial volume was reduced at P15 and increased in adults in the TBS versus control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Mitochondrial diameters did not differ significantly between the TBS and control conditions for either age, although they were slightly wider in the adults than at P15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Mitochondrial lengths were shorter in the control than in the TBS condition at P15 but were longer in the control condition in adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). The frequency of mitochondria was greater in adults than at P15 under control conditions, but was much less in the adults after TBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>).</p><p>Together these findings suggest that by 120 min after TBS-LTP, mitochondria became smaller without fission at P15 and become larger through fusion in adults. This differential fission/fusion response suggests that at P15 the mitochondrial resources were depleted before new mitochondria could be generated or transported to the active sites to replenish those resources. In contrast, the findings from adults suggest that mitochondria fusion occured when the frequency of presynaptic boutons decreases following TBS. Furthermore, in adults, but not at P15, the elevated vesicular mobilization also occurred in boutons without mitochondria, which might have been feasible because glycolysis does not require mitochondria and can be a source of ATP in adults but not at P15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vannucci, 1994</xref>).</p><p>These data also show that at P15 the axonal mitochondria occurred on average at distances of 1 per 7.13 ± 0.48 microns after control stimulation, which was not significantly different from 1 per 8.07 ± 0.34 microns following TBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). Thus, the new dendritic spine synapses were likely to have occurred with presynaptic boutons that did not contain a mitochondrion because the distribution of mitochondria did not change significantly (Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, above).</p><p>In adults, mitochondria occurred on average at distances of 1 per 3.6 ± 0.25 microns following control stimulation, but only 1 per 6.10 ± 0.40 microns following TBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). Examination of the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> above suggests enlargement of adult synapses occurred at boutons with and without mitochondria. Similarly, presynaptic boutons sustained during control stimulation also occurred with and without mitochondria. In addition, as both synapses and mitochondria were reduced in frequency, the proportion of synapses that contained mitochondria was unchanged, suggesting that mitochondrial demand could partially be determined by the number of synapses that require their support.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>LTP-Associated changes in mitochondrial structure reflect enhanced ATP production</title><p>Changes in the internal structure of mitochondria in response to increased demand for energy include swelling of cristae and reduced density of the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Packer, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hackenbrock, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Perkins and Ellisman, 2011</xref>).

At P15, control stimulation eliminated dendritic spines, whereas following TBS there was a nearly 50% increase in spines, which served to sustain single synaptic boutons and increase multisynaptic boutons. In contrast, in adults the spinogenesis induced by control stimulation was blocked by the TBS-related synapse enlargement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourne and Harris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2014</xref>). At P15, less than 30% of the presynaptic boutons contained mitochondria at 2 hr following TBS, suggesting that TBS-related spinogenesis mostly involved presynaptic boutons without mitochondria. Since only the mitochondria-containing boutons had elevated vesicle mobilization at P15, the TBS-related spinogenesis likely occurred at boutons lacking enhanced vesicle mobilization. This arrangement could account for the stable level of potentiation at 2 hr despite the addition of new spines. In adults, more boutons contained mitochondria under both control and TBS conditions than at P15, and TBS resulted in fewer small spines and SSBs. The number of mitochondria also decreased in adult axons following TBS. These results suggest that in adults, but not at P15, mitochondrial and synaptic frequencies are coupled.</p><p>In adults, the TBS-related synapse enlargement and vesicle mobilization occurred at boutons with or without mitochondria. However, much of the growth in the PSD involved the addition of nascent zones that had PSDs but lacked presynaptic vesicles, and hence were likely to be unresponsive to vesicular release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, at both ages, synaptogenesis, synaptic growth, and vesicular mobilization either following control stimulation or TBS appear to have involved functionally silent processes. What mechanisms could be engaged and what are the functional consequences of building these silent synapses?</p><p>Closer proximity of axonal mitochondria was associated with larger PSD areas having more docked and nondocked presynaptic vesicles at both P15 and adult ages. At P15, half of all axonal mitochondria resided in nonsynaptic inter-bouton regions and only 28% of axonal volume surrounded the mitochondria. Thus, although mitochondria were found all along the axons, synaptic boutons with mitochondria had more vesicles and larger synapses than those without mitochondria. These findings are in agreement with those from cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Obashi and Okabe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sapir et al., 2012</xref>) and adult amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ostroff et al., 2012</xref>), where presynaptic boutons with mitochondria also had more vesicles. Only the presynaptic boutons that contained mitochondria showed a decrease in docked and nondocked vesicles after TBS-LTP at P15. In contrast, the sustained mobilization of vesicles after TBS-LTP was not as strictly dependent on mitochondrial proximity in adults. Results from cultured hippocampal neurons using FM1-43 show that a large proportion of axonal boutons do not release synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crawford and Mennerick, 2012</xref>). Chemical induction of LTP produces an increase in the number of release sites without enhancing the average vesicle release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolshakov et al., 1997</xref>), suggesting that the new synapses in this preparation might also be presynaptically silent. New synapses lack postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Petralia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shi et al., 1999</xref>) and hence also could be postsynaptically silent.</p><p>Consistent with our findings, a decrease in the number of synaptic vesicles following LTP has been reported for nearly forty years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Applegate et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fifková and Van Harreveld, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lushnikova, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayazitov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stanton et al., 2005</xref>), although not in the context of presynaptic mitochondria, postsynaptic growth, or explicit comparison between immature and mature synapses as reported here.

Enhanced mobilization of either pool could result in a decrease in presynaptic vesicles.

Since the potentiation of the (evoked) fEPSP plateaued by 5 min, but TBS-related vesicle mobilization was only detected after 30 min, the persistent enhancement of vesicle mobilization seems more likely to have involved spontaneously released vesicles.</p><p>The absence of fission or changes in position suggests that resident synaptic mitochondria were not highly motile even 120 min after TBS at either age. These results are consistent with live imaging in cultured neurons where most axonal mitochondria remained stationary at synapses for hours to days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Obashi and Okabe, 2013</xref>). As such, boutons with mitochondria will have greater access to the products and functions of mitochondria. Previous findings suggest that persistent vesicular mobilization puts a high demand on mitochondrial production of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rangaraju et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, ATP binding by synapsin IIa regulates the recruitment of reserve pool vesicles into the more readily releasable pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shulman et al., 2015</xref>). Mitochondrial ATP production is also coupled to synaptic vesicle recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rangaraju et al., 2014</xref>). The decrease in the orthodox configuration and widening of mitochondrial cristae provided evidence for an increase in demand for ATP lasting at least 120 min after TBS-LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hackenbrock, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Packer, 1960</xref>).</p><p>Presynaptic mitochondria also serve to regulate calcium. Mitochondrial calcium buffering enhances short-term plasticity, such as post-tetanic potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billups and Forsythe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tang and Zucker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2007</xref>).

However, blocking mitochondrial calcium buffering had no effect on synaptic vesicle release in hippocampal neurons and instead mitochondrial ATP was required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, the demand for ATP, rather than calcium sequestration and release, appears to account for the effect of mitochondrial proximity on enhanced vesicular mobilization following TBS-LTP.</p><p>Developmental changes in glucose metabolism could explain why only those presynaptic boutons that contained mitochondria showed increased vesicular mobilization at P15 but some presynaptic boutons without mitochondria also had increased vesicle mobilization in adults. Before weaning, rat diets consist primarily of fatty acids, which means their neurons rely on ketone bodies instead of glucose for energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edmond et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Raffo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yeh and Sheehan, 1985</xref>). Accordingly, rat hippocampal neurons begin to express glucose transporters at about P14, but expression does not approach adult levels until after P21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vannucci, 1994</xref>). Ketone body metabolism requires mitochondria while glucose metabolism does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fukao et al., 2004</xref>). Previous work in cultured hippocampal neurons demonstrates that both mitochondrial and glycolytic ATP production are upregulated under conditions of increased vesicle turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rangaraju et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, in adults, increased glycolysis could supply ATP in boutons that lack mitochondria. Additionally, the evidence for mitochondrial fusion in the adults suggests that mechanisms to replenish mitochondrial resources were triggered in the adults, consistent with prior work in older animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The sustained decrease in presynaptic vesicles could also reflect their use in the growth of active zones and plasma membranes surrounding the presynaptic bouton.

Thus, secretion of BDNF or related processes might link presynaptic mitochondrial activity to a persistent mobilization of presynaptic vesicles and serve to coordinate pre- and postsynaptic changes that enhance connectivity at P15 and balance synaptogenesis and growth in adults.</p><p>Spontaneous release normally suppresses local protein synthesis in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sutton et al., 2007</xref>). The positions of postsynaptic polyribosomes (the structural correlates of local protein synthesis) are dynamic following TBS-LTP in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourne and Harris, 2011</xref>). Polyribosomes are immediately recruited to large spine heads at 5 min. Between 5 and 30 min, polyribosomes become further elevated throughout the dendrites and spines under both control and TBS-LTP conditions. These dynamics could reflect protein synthesis-dependent processes for both control spinogenesis and TBS-LTP-related synapse enlargement by 120 min in adults. Similar analyses are not available for TBS-LTP at P15, although polyribosomes are known to be dynamic following tetanus-induced LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ostroff et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, if the presynaptic vesicle decrease resulted from increased spontaneous release, as discussed above, it might account for the return of local postsynaptic translation to control levels once the silent TBS-related synaptogenesis at P15 (or growth in adults) is complete.</p><p>Being an essentially silent process raises the question about the function of synaptogenesis or synapse growth following TBS. Despite the age-related differences in the sites of synaptogenesis, the occurrence of synapse enlargement, or the degree of vesicle mobilization, the responses of mitochondrial ultrastructure to TBS were nearly identical. At both ages, there was no change in the percentage of mitochondria that were located at presynaptic versus nonsynaptic sites along the axons. At both ages, more of the mitochondria had a non-orthodox configuration and the cristae were enlarged following TBS-LTP for synaptic and nonsynaptic mitochondria. These observations suggest that there were increased demands for ATP production all along the axons following TBS-LTP. Of course, oxidative stress and calcium concentrations also affect mitochondrial structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frezza et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hackenbrock and Caplan, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Scalettar et al., 1991</xref>). Future studies directly measuring ATP concentrations after TBS, together with higher resolution analyses of mitochondrial ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Perkins et al., 2010</xref>), will help to elucidate whether the LTP-associated changes in mitochondrial structure are a consequence of metabolic demand. Spinogenesis and synapse growth require energy and may reflect the preparation of synapses to respond to the next bout of plasticity. At P15, the next bout could stabilize the new connectivity, while in adults the next bout could recruit vesicles to new docking sites at the enlarged nascent zones. This interpretation is consistent with recent findings showing that sufficient time must pass before the initial LTP became unsaturated and a second bout of TBS could augment the potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babayan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao and Harris, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All animal use procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The University of Texas at Austin and complied with the NIH requirements for the humane use of laboratory rats.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Slice preparation, electrophysiology, and microwave fixation</title><p>Acute hippocampal slices were prepared from male Long-Evans rats (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RGD_2308852">RGD_2308852</ext-link>) at postnatal day 15 (P15, n = 7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Watson et al., 2016</xref>).

comparisons of boutons and mitochondria were performed using the chi-square test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, with percentages based on numbers in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The hierarchical nested ANOVA (hnANOVA) was used to evaluate differences in the frequency of docked or nondocked vesicles in boutons with or without mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, nested by experiment and condition). Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were done to test for differences between control and TBS conditions across PSD areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). The hnANOVA was also used to evaluate differences in mitochondria structure and frequency between control and TBS conditions and for P15 and adult ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, with experimental condition nested by animal). Categorical comparisons of mitochondria were performed using the chi-square test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B–D</xref>, with percentages based on numbers in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Cristae widths were compared using hnANOVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>, with experimental condition nested by animal).</p><p>Vesicle counts, mitochondrial dimensions, and PSD areas have skewed distributions with different variances and thus were transformed using the natural logarithmic function for all of the ANOVAs. Post-hoc analyses were performed using Tukey’s HSD test. The variances were similar across conditions, hence no transformations were required for the ANCOVAs. Data were plotted as means with standard error bars or as the raw data points on log axes to visualize both the skewed nature of the raw data and the linear relationships using a Power Regression to generate the trend lines (MS Excel). Synapses with zero docked presynaptic vesicles were set to a value of 0.1 and plotted along the x-axes of the log plots (set at the y value of 0.1). The percentages in the pie charts were based on the relevant numbers in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Results of the statistical analyses are designated in the text or figure legends. Significant post hoc values are indicated on the graphs with stars for *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, and ****p&lt;0.0001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Libby Perry, Robert Smith, and John Mendenhall for technical assistance with the electron microscopy.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mitochondria support persistent presynaptic vesicle mobilization with age-dependent synaptic growth after LTP&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors show that presynaptic mitochondria sustain vesicle mobilization following theta burst stimulation, an LTP protocol, in hippocampal area CA1. This suggests that the presence of mitochondria at a presynaptic bouton has direct consequences for the types of plasticity which this synapse can undergo. It also suggests that the availability of energy (e.g. in the form of ATP) is an important constraint not only for the ongoing operation of synapses, but also their plasticity.</p><p>The present study uses wild-type animals (unlike, for example, a previous study by Verstreken et al. 2005, which used <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants), and thus normal properties and a normal spatial distribution of mitochondria across presynaptic boutons can be assumed to exist at the beginning of the experiments. The authors also compare boutons containing mitochondria, boutons closer than 3 microns from a mitochondrion, and the remaining boutons, providing a direct comparison and internal control under otherwise identical experimental conditions. These methodological choices, together with their use of 3D electron microscopy – the gold standard for structural studies of synapses – has resulted in a compelling and high-quality manuscript. While the approach is essentially descriptive and correlative, the data on vesicle numbers and the correlation with mitochondrial location and volume are particularly compelling and interesting. The twist of analyzing this for young animals, before weaning (P15) vs. adult represents a very neat way to get at morphological correlates for tolerance to repetitive activation.</p><p>Although overall the work was judged to be very solid and a pleasure to read, the referees felt that some of the conclusions may have been overstated, and that the authors may have overgeneralized from their paradigm. These issues, and other concerns below, need to be addressed in the revised version.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the amount and level of analysis of 3D EM deployed in this work is impressive, the descriptive nature of this work results in overinterpretations, and in statements that are not tested further but are posited as truths. For example, in the last paragraph of the subsection “Mitochondria-related differences in synapse size and vesicle composition at P15 in vivo” they write that the proximity of presynaptic mitochondria supports larger synapses with more vesicles. Maybe the larger synapses are able to accommodate a mitochondrion while the smaller ones do not because of space limitations? It is not clear what is cause and what is consequence. In the last paragraph of the subsection “Influence of distance from mitochondria on synapse size and vesicle content” they then conclude that boutons containing a mitochondrion have more vesicles. If terminals with a mitochondrion are larger there is more space to accommodate vesicles. Hence, the presence of more vesicles is not necessarily due to the presence of a mitochondrion but maybe because of the larger size? In the same vein, it is unclear why the data were not normalized to bouton volume. In the aforementioned paragraph the authors conclude that the presence (or proximity) of a mitochondrion has a positive influence on synaptic efficacy; but this measure of efficacy is simply based on the number of vesicles (and PSD area). Functional studies are needed to make such statements. These issues should be addressed by a careful rewriting of the claims made from the data.</p><p>2) Another example of overstating conclusions is in the first paragraph of the subsection “Presynaptic Mitochondria also Sustain Vesicle Mobilization following TBS in Adults”: the authors conclude that the vesicle mobilization in adult synapses without mitochondria appears to be supported by glycolysis but no proof to support this statement that glycolysis supports the mobilization in these boutons is included. Further down they analyze the morphology of the cristae of the mitochondria and use these results to make statements about ATP levels and production. (e.g.: “these changes in mitochondria structure indicate an ongoing elevation in demand for presynaptic ATP at 120 min after TBS-LTP”). This is at best correlative and it is likely that other aspects of mitochondrial biology affect cristae structure as well. There are methods to measure ATP (also in situ) that could be used rather than having to rely on proxies to make conclusions that are unfounded. Again, careful rewriting of these sections should be performed to address these issues.</p><p>3) Statements like &quot;Thus, the proximity of presynaptic mitochondria supports larger synapses with more vesicles&quot; and &quot;These results suggest that the proximity of a mitochondrion has a strongly positive influence on synaptic efficacy&quot; should be qualified more carefully since cause and effect might also work in the opposite direction. Consider the following hypothesis: there is a certain average density of mitochondria per axon volume, but mitochondria are randomly distributed in this volume, and larger boutons therefore have a larger chance of containing a mitochondrion. We know from past studies that larger (by volume) boutons also tend to contain more vesicles, contain larger and more active zones, and form stronger synapses. How about this theory as the explanation for the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>? The authors should compare their data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> with the predictions of a simple model of random placement of mitochondria inside the volume of their axonal reconstructions, assuming a constant mean density given by the total number of mitochondria divided by the sum of the volumes of the axons they reconstructed.</p><p>4) Relating specifically to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>: what is the relative volume of SSBs and MSBs? Could the increased fraction of MSBs containing a mitochondrion simply be a consequence of a larger average volume of MSBs compared to SSBs (assuming a constant mean density of mitochondria per volume in the axon, and random placement of mitochondria according to this density)? Even if not, which percentage of the SSB-MSB effect shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> could simply be explained by random placement of mitochondria in the axon volume?</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E, F</xref>: in adult hippocampus, TBS leads to vesicle mobilization also in boutons without mitochondria (albeit to a lesser extent than in boutons with mitochondria). The importance of the presence of mitochondria for vesicle mobilization in adult synapses is therefore less clear. Is there a better way of quantifying the size of the TBS-control difference between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref> than the p-values, which are the same order of magnitude?</p><p>6) Why does the density of mitochondria per axon length drop to almost half of its control value after TBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>, Adult) while the fraction of boutons containing a mitochondrion, and the fraction of boutons within 3 µm of a mitochondrion, stay almost the same (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>)? One possible conclusion is that the (smaller) adult axon population analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> might not be representative of the (larger) adult axon population analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. In any case, the authors should find the reason(s) for, and address, this apparent inconsistency.</p><p>7) Although only a small quibble, data, regarding the structural state of the mitochondria – based on cristae widths and matrix structure, are weaker than other data in the manuscript. Their strategy is consistent with the way these differences are described in the literature, (orthodox vs. condensed state). Their analysis shows significant differences for the parameters measured, however the resolution and morphology of the images shown to represent the data analyzed do not engender confidence in data pertaining to those measures. 3D analysis of mitochondria (e.g., by EM Tomography, ssTEM, SBEM or FIB-SEM) to assess the overall pattern of the cristae and their subcomponent volume fractions may have served this purpose better. Lammelar cristae are generally associated with stationary mitochondria at node of Ranvier or in terminals while elongated mitochondria in axons tend to have longitudinally oriented cristae. Although difficult to see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, it looks like they have both types in their terminals and analysis.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Mitochondrial support of persistent presynaptic vesicle mobilization with age-dependent synaptic growth after LTP&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

To address these questions, we have added analyses of the relationships between mitochondrial and axonal dimensions. These analyses are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> (panel b4), 3C, 3D, and related text and figure legends. Nearly 50% of the mitochondria occurred outside synaptic boutons, in nonsynaptic regions of the axon with no surrounding vesicles. The synaptic and nonsynaptic mitochondria do not differ significantly from one another in their diameters. Both would easily fit even in places where there are no synapses and the axons are at their thinnest, in the inter-bouton regions (e.g. see the nonsynaptic mitochondrion of b4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> (3DEM), and 3B (b4, EM). This analysis clarifies that bouton or axon size does not restrict mitochondria locations. Similarly, there is room for vesicles in the nonsynaptic portions of the axon, as can be seen in all of our 3DEMs, as the vesicles (green) are all included at scale.</p><p>We have also modified the text as requested changing synapse “efficacy” to “synapse size and vesicle number”.</p><p><italic>2) Another example of overstating conclusions is in the first paragraph of the subsection “Presynaptic Mitochondria also Sustain Vesicle Mobilization following TBS in Adults”: the authors conclude that the vesicle mobilization in adult synapses without mitochondria appears to be supported by glycolysis but no proof to support this statement that glycolysis supports the mobilization in these boutons is included.

Similar to item 1 above, we have modified the language throughout the paper to be more circumspect about cause, effect, and function. In addition to the examples indicated above, we changed most statements involving the phrase ‘mitochondria support’ to ‘mitochondria were associated with’ and ‘synaptic efficacy’ to ‘synapse size or vesicle number’ where appropriate throughout the manuscript. We left the word ‘support’ in the title, because that is what we conclude based on our results together with findings from the literature. In deference to the reviewer’s comments, we added the word ‘of’ after the word support to be more circumspect about function.</p><p>The new analyses added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and discussed in item 1 above also address the theory offered about potential mitochondrial distribution being random vs nonrandom. Indeed, as now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, mitochondria are distributed roughly equally among synaptic and nonsynaptic locations. Furthermore, both synaptic and nonsynaptic mitochondria would easily fit in places where axons are at their thinnest, in the inter- bouton regions. This analysis clarifies that bouton or axon size does not restrict mitochondria locations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> are designed to assess whether synapse proximity to presynaptic mitochondria is associated with differences in synapse size and vesicle content. Hence, along with the clarification presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> we have respectfully retained the analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, as it provides the initial breakdown of effects on synapse parameters with respect to distance from a mitochondrion, used in subsequent analyses.</p><p><italic>4) Relating specifically to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>: what is the relative volume of SSBs and MSBs? Could the increased fraction of MSBs containing a mitochondrion simply be a consequence of a larger average volume of MSBs compared to SSBs (assuming a constant mean density of mitochondria per volume in the axon, and random placement of mitochondria according to this density)?

One possible conclusion is that the (smaller) adult axon population analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> might not be representative of the (larger) adult axon population analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. In any case, the authors should find the reason(s) for, and address, this apparent inconsistency.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this apparent discrepancy. In response, we have added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, which illustrates that the density of synaptic boutons was 50% less in the TBS versus the Control conditions at 2 hours after the induction of LTP in the adult hippocampus. This difference matches the 50% difference in synapse number, where small dendritic spines that form in response to control stimulation fail to form following LTP, when instead synapses enlarged (Bourne and Harris, 2011). The data in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> are a recapitulation of our published findings (Bourne JN, Chirillo MA, Harris KM. 2013). We agree that it is useful to republish them here to make it clear that the relative fractions of boutons with and without mitochondria were maintained in adults, despite the differences in axonal bouton numbers.</p><p><italic>7) Although only a small quibble, data, regarding the structural state of the mitochondria – based on cristae widths and matrix structure, are weaker than other data in the manuscript.

Although difficult to see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, it looks like they have both types in their terminals and analysis.</italic></p><p>We have tempered our text in light of these caveats (e.g. we added “might have”: “The mitochondrial configurations described in these papers and measures of cristae widths were used as proxies to investigate whether changes in energy demand might haveoccurred at 120 min after TBS.”). In addition, we added the following statement, “Future studies directly measuring ATP concentrations after TBS, together with higher resolution analyses of mitochondrial ultrastructure (Perkins et al., 2010), will help to elucidate whether the LTP-associated changes in mitochondrial structure are a consequence of metabolic demand.” We appreciate the importance of the additional study, which is beyond the scope of this work at present. We believe that these data are sufficiently suggestive as to provide motivation for the more demanding analyses in future work. Hence, we have left them in this paper.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors have satisfactorily addressed most of the comments of the reviewers, and have significantly improved the manuscript.
