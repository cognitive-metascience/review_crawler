Natural killer (NK) cells are essential tumor-killing effector cells of the innate immune system; however, little is known about whether or how other immune cells recognize tumor cells to assist NK cells. Here, we show that the innate immune receptor Dectin-1 expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages is critical to NK-mediated killing of tumor cells that express N-glycan structures at high levels. Receptor recognition of these tumor cells causes the activation of the IRF5 transcription factor and downstream gene induction for the full-blown tumoricidal activity of NK cells. Consistent with this, we show exacerbated in vivo tumor growth in mice genetically deficient in either Dectin-1 or IRF5. The critical contribution of Dectin-1 in the recognition of and signaling by tumor cells may offer new insight into the anti-tumor immune system with therapeutic implications.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04177.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04177.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04177.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When cells in the body grow and divide uncontrollably, cancerous tumors can form. An individual's likelihood of recovering from cancer is highly variable and often depends on the type of cancer and the extent of the disease at the start of treatment. Researchers are therefore interested in discovering how the body responds against cancerous cells.</p><p>The first line of defense against infection and disease is the body's innate immune system, which includes a suite of immune cells known as white blood cells. These cells patrol the body's organs and tissues in an effort to immediately respond to pathogens and damaged, stressed or otherwise abnormal host cells. Among white blood cells, natural killer cells are involved in identifying and destroying tumor cells. However, it was unclear whether or how other immune cells might help natural killer cells to destroy tumors. In addition, although immune cells detect pathogens and injured cells by producing proteins called pattern recognition receptors, it was unknown whether these receptors also detect tumor cells.</p><p>Here, Chiba et al. reveal that two other types of immune cell—dendritic cells and macrophages—play essential roles in helping natural killer cells to prevent tumors from growing in mice. The dendritic cells and macrophages produce a pattern recognition receptor called Dectin-1 that recognizes a molecule found on the surface of some—but not all—types of tumor cell. In doing so, Dectin-1 activates a critical signaling pathway and directs the activity of the natural killer cells so that they can effectively kill tumor cells. Chiba et al. found that these tumors grew faster in mice that lack the Dectin-1 protein.</p><p>The findings of Chiba et al. may also help to explain the effectiveness of certain antibodies—proteins that recognize and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses—in cancer therapy. In addition, the Dectin-1 pathway presents a new avenue of research that may offer new cancer treatments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04177.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04177.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>Dectin-1</kwd><kwd>NK cell</kwd><kwd>IRF</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taniguchi</surname><given-names>Tadatsugu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003382</institution-id><institution>Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yanai</surname><given-names>Hideyuki</given-names></name><name><surname>Nishio</surname><given-names>Junko</given-names></name><name><surname>Negishi</surname><given-names>Hideo</given-names></name><name><surname>Taniguchi</surname><given-names>Tadatsugu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An immune system pattern recognition receptor potentiates anti-tumor innate immune responses, offering new insight into anti-tumor activity of the innate immune system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In recent years, our understanding of innate immune recognition of microbial components and its critical role in host defense against infection has grown considerably. The discovery of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other classes of signal-transducing innate immune receptors exemplifies a model of pathogen recognition by germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system that detect components of invading pathogens, termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blasius and Beutler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kawai and Akira, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2011</xref>). Upon recognition of PAMPs, these receptors activate NF-κB, interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and other transcription factors, which then induce the transcription of cognate target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tamura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ikushima et al., 2013</xref>). This results in the evocation of innate immune responses that also instruct subsequent innate immune responses. Dead or injured cells also recruit and activate innate inflammatory cells in the absence of infection through recognition by PRRs of released self-derived molecules termed damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bianchi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubartelli and Lotze, 2007</xref>). To date, the role of innate immune receptors in anti-tumor innate immune response is unknown.</p><p>It has been well-established that natural killer (NK) cells are essential effector cells of the innate arm of the immune system to control virus infections and tumor developments by exerting cytotoxicity of target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yokoyama and Plougastel, 2003</xref>). NK cells are sub-classified into circulating conventional NKs (cNKs) and tissue-resident NKs (trNKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sojka et al., 2014</xref>). Thus far, most of the functional studies on NK cells have focused on cNKs, which are found to be abundant in the spleen. In view of the critical role of cNKs (referred to as NKs hereafter unless stated otherwise) in anti-tumor innate immunity, the interesting issue for whether PRRs expressed on NK and/or other immune cells may recognize tumor cells for the enhancement of tumoricidal activity of NK cells. It has been reported that cell-to-cell contact between dendritic cells (DCs) and resting NK cells causes an enhancement of NK cell-mediated cytolytic activity against tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandez et al., 1999</xref>); however, the involvement of PRRs in this context remains unknown. Of note, some TLRs appear to have the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rakoff-Nahoum and Medzhitov, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pradere et al., 2014</xref>). For instance, activation of TLR2 and TLR6 in macrophages enhances metastasis of tumor cells, wherein receptor activation is mediated by tumor cell-derived versican, an extracellular matrix proteoglycan that is up-regulated in many tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>During our studies on the IRF family of transcription factors in the context of regulation of PRR signaling and oncogenesis, we observed that mice genetically deficient for IRF5 (IRF5-deficient mice) show extensive lung metastasis of the B16F1 melanoma cells (hereafter referred to as B16 cells), a consequence reported to be controlled by NK cells. Since IRF5 is known to be activated by TLRs and other classes of PRRs, we asked whether any of these PRRs is involved in this process in the context of NK cell-mediated control of tumor cells. In light of the tumor-promoting effect by TLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rakoff-Nahoum and Medzhitov, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pradere et al., 2014</xref>), we hypothesized that another class of PRRs expressed on the cell surface may be involved in the recognition of tumor cells for the NK cell-mediated anti-tumor response. Dectin-1, a C-type lectin receptor (CLR) family member known to recognize β-glucans of fungal cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown, 2006</xref>), was of particular interest since (i) it is highly expressed in macrophages and DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herre et al., 2004</xref>) and (ii) IRF5 is involved in Dectin-1 signaling for anti-fungal innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">del Fresno et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We show here that Dectin-1 expressed on DCs and macrophages critically contributes to the enhancement of NK-mediated killing of tumor cells. Further, we demonstrate that IRF5 is activated by Dectin-1 signaling in these immune cells and that this Dectin-1-IRF5 pathway constitutes a critical limb for their orchestration of NK cells. We also provide evidence that tumor cell-mediated Dectin-1 signaling is instigated by receptor recognition of N-glycan structures on the surface of some but not all tumor cells, which we propose to term tumor-associated molecular patterns (TAMPs). Finally, the in vivo significance of these observations is validated by the massive growth of the TAMP-expressing tumors in mice genetically deficient for either Dectin-1 or IRF5.</p><p>We discuss our results revealing a new facet of the CLR family of receptors in the orchestration of anti-tumor innate immune responses as well as future prospects of innate recognition and control of tumor cells, which may have clinical implications.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A requirement for IRF5 in innate immune responses against B16 melanoma</title><p>Within the IRF family of transcription factors, several members including IRF3, IRF5 and IRF7 are particularly well-known for the pivotal roles they serve in the innate immune receptor-mediated gene induction programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Honda and Taniguchi, 2006</xref>).

In this context, it has been shown that enhanced glycosylation levels provide growth advantages to many if not all tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Granovsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu and Taniguchi, 2008</xref>). Interestingly, we found that sDectin-1 binding to B16 cells was markedly reduced upon N-glycosidase treatment, while treatment by O-glycosidase or neuraminidase showed only a marginal effect, suggesting there is a major requirement for N-glycan structures to Dectin-1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with this, a marked reduction of tumoricidal activity of splenocytes was observed when B16 cells were pretreated with N-glycosidase, whereas O-glycosidase treatment did not affect this activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Further, N-glycosidase treatment of B16 cells did not affect the in vitro killing activity of purified NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating in toto there is a critical role of Dectin-1 recognition of and signaling by N-glycan structures on tumor cells by DCs and macrophages.</p><p>We then investigated the nature of N-glycan structures on B16 cells by subjecting the supernatant generated after N-glycosidase treatment to mass spectrometric (MS) analysis. As reported previously, N-glycan structures, such as N-glycans with β1,6-GlcNAc branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandes et al., 1991</xref>), the expression of which is increased in tumor cells, were detected. Of note, pretreatment of the supernatant by sDectin-1 did not alter the MS peak pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4 fig3s5 fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplements 4–6</xref>). This observation suggests that N-glycan structures, highly expressed in tumor cells, need to be bound to proteins for the Dectin-1 recognition (See below).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Dectin-1 signaling and gene expression by tumor cells</title><p>To address the issue of whether Dectin-1 signaling is required for direct cell-to-cell contact or for the induction of a soluble mediator(s), we examined supernatants from CD11b<sup>+</sup> or CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells mixed with B16 cells and found that they had little, if any, effect on NK cell activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Further, these bands are abolished by the pretreatment of cells with N-glycosidase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, these data suggest that similar or identical N-glycan structures are expressed on multiple proteins that function as Dectin-1 ligands in these, and probably other, Dectin-1 binding tumor cells.</p><p>To examine the co-relationship between sDectin-1 binding and NK-mediated killing activity of splenocytes, we selected the lung carcinoma 3LL and YAC-1 cells with strong sDectin-1 binding and colon carcinoma SL4 cells with weak binding, and subjected them to the in vitro killing assay described above. We observed Dectin1-dependent cell killing activity against 3LL and YAC-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; left panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), whereas the killing activity of WT splenocytes against SL4 cells was significantly weaker as compared to that for 3LL or YAC-1 cells and was reduced only marginally in Dectin-1-deficient splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; right panel). These results support the notion that tumor cells expressing Dectin-1 ligands at high levels are more susceptible to NK cell-mediated killing in a manner dependent on Dectin-1 signaling.</p><p>We further expended our in vivo analysis to 3LL and SL4 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, a marked enhancement of lung metastasis of 3LL cells was observed in Dectin-1-deficient mice, but not in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; left panel), while SL4 cells without significant sDectin-1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; right panel) underwent massive metastasis in both WT and mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; right panel). Expectedly, massive metastasis of B16F10 cells was observed without significant difference between WT and Dectin-1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that B16F10 cells could have been selected to evade the Dectin-1-mediated anti-tumor orchestration. Thus, these in vivo observations are consistent with in vitro observations in that the recognition of and signaling by Dectin-1 in DCs and macrophages constitute a critical aspect of the NK cell-mediated anti-tumor innate immunity.</p><p>Finally, Dectin-1 binding to human tumor cell lines was examined by preparing a human sDectin-1. Interestingly, we found human sDectin-1 binds to several of these cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). We also observed the Dectin-1-dependent induction of <italic>Inam</italic> mRNA in mouse DCs by human cancer cell line HBC4, to which human sDectin-1 strongly binds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). Since mouse and human Dectin-1 are highly conserved, we infer the mouse DCs respond to human Dectin-1 ligands for gene induction. As such, these results suggest the presence of a similar or identical anti-tumor Dectin-1 signaling mechanism in the human immune system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The critical role of signal-transducing innate immune receptors in mediating innate and adaptive immune responses against invading pathogens is well known. However, it has been enigmatic if and how these receptors contribute to anti-tumor responses. In the present study, we demonstrated that the innate immune receptor Dectin-1 expressed on DCs and macrophages is important to NK-mediated killing of tumor cells. Our results indicate that NK cells are required to orchestrate with DCs and macrophages for cell killing, wherein activation of the IRF5 transcription factor by Dectin-1 signaling instigated by receptor recognition of N-glycan structures on tumor cells is critical. This notion is supported by an excessive growth of tumors with sDectin-1 binding in mice genetically deficient in either Dectin-1 or IRF5 in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that an innate immune receptor contributes to anti-tumor recognition and signaling through orchestration of innate immune cells. Our study offers new insight into the NK-mediated anti-tumor activity of the innate immune system (model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04177.034</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic view of the orchestration of innate immune cells for NK cell-mediated tumor killing.</title><p>Dectin-1 expressed by DCs and macrophages recognizes N-glycan structures on tumor cells and signals to activate IRF5 pathway and other pathways, thereby activating NK cells. Thus, NK cells require tumor recognition and signaling by these innate immune cells for their effective tumoricidal action. Although INAM is depicted here, the DC-mediated activation of NK cells would involve other molecules and this Dectin-1-IRF5-INAM pathway may represent only a part of the entire picture. It remains to be further characterized as to whether and how this and/or other effector ligands induced by Dectin-1 signaling contribute to NK activation in full. It is possible that DCs/macrophages are secondarily activated by yet unknown factors from NK cells (see dashed arrow).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04177.034">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04177.034</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04177-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>A more detailed structural analysis of the Dectin-1 ligand(s) needs to be clarified. Our sDectin-1 chemical cross-linking data suggest that similar or identical N-glycan structures are expressed on multiple protein molecules in tumor cells as Dectin-1 ligands. On the basis of the MS and chemical cross-linking data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4 fig3s5 fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 4–6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), we infer that N-glycan structures need to be bound to proteins for the Dectin-1 recognition.</p><p>Obviously further work will be required to discern the detailed nature of the ligands, it is possible that Dectin-1 recognition of and activation by N-glycan structures are contingent on the absolute expression levels of N-glycans and/or their associated proteins on the cell; that is, tumor cells with ‘increased self’ molecules are targets for innate recognition for activation of the immune system. However, it is also possible that Dectin-1 recognition requires particular, tumor-specific N-glycan-containing structures, which may belong to ‘altered self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Medzhitov and Janeway, 2002</xref>). Whichever the case, Dectin-1-binding structures may fit into the category of ‘tumor-associated molecular patterns (TAMPs)’ vis-à-vis PAMPs for invading pathogens and DAMPs for normal cells subjected to stress or death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubartelli and Lotze, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kawai and Akira, 2010</xref>). This issue obviously merits more advanced study.</p><p>Our data showing that Dectin-1-deficiency does not entirely abrogate the NK-enhancing activity of CD11b<sup>+</sup> or CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells suggests the interesting possibility that other CLRs are also involved in the orchestration of innate immune cells for the efficient NK cell-mediated anti-tumor immune response. It is curious that in many tumor cells glycosylation levels are generally enhanced, providing an advantage to tumor cells in migration and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Granovsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu and Taniguchi, 2008</xref>). If so, the host's innate system could have evolved to limit the immune evasion of tumor development through recognition of glycosylation products via Dectin-1 and other CLR family members. As such, the potential involvement of other CLR members in the recognition tumor cells, to which sDectin-1 binding is low, is also an interesting future issue to be addressed.</p><p>The examination of the role of Dectin-1 and other CLRs in the control of tumors in de novo carcinogenesis models will be an exciting issue to address in future studies. It is interesting to note that Dectin-1 mRNA is also expressed in CD11b<sup>+</sup> or CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells from liver and lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>); hence, we infer that Dectin-1 signaling may contribute to the control of tumor progression in various tissues. In addition, since tumor cells are phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous even within the same tumor mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meacham and Morrison, 2013</xref>), it is possible that tumor cells show a differential expression profiles for Dectin-1 ligands in vivo. If so, it may be the case that the in vivo progression of a tumor is controlled via direct and indirect Dectin-1 signaling, that is, NK cells activated by CD11b<sup>+</sup> or CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells via Dectin-1 signaling may exert tumoricidal activities on tumor cells regardless on their Dectin-1 ligand expression. Obviously, these possibilities are speculative and need to be investigated further.</p><p>Identification of critical target molecules of Dectin-1 signaling that participate to the enhancement of NK cells for anti-tumor response is also an interesting, though unanswered question. Although our study suggests the involvement of INAM, we infer that other membrane molecules identified here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which are without a known function at present, may also participate. This is obviously an important future issue to be rigorously addressed.</p><p>Our present study may also offer a novel view on the clinical efficacy of monoclonal antibodies (Abs) such as cancer therapeutics, specifically for how Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediates antitumor cytotoxicity via Fc receptor(s) on immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alderson and Sondel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seidel et al., 2013</xref>). Although the conventional wisdom has been that Fc receptors (FcRs) expressed on NK cells are responsible for ADCC, primarily based on in vitro studies using human mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alderson and Sondel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seidel et al., 2013</xref>), it has been appreciated for some time that in the mouse, Ab mediated tumor killing is mediated primarily by myeloid cells. For example, mouse IgG2a is the most potent Ab isotype for the activation of effector cells through its intermediate–affinity interaction with FcRIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nimmerjahn et al., 2010</xref>). Yet, this FcR is not expressed by NK cells, but is expressed by DCs and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nimmerjahn et al., 2005</xref>). It is also interesting to note that FcRIV utilizes FcRγ, the FcR common γ subunit, to transmit the Ab signal to the cell interior via pathways similar, if not identical, to those of CLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Honda and Taniguchi, 2006</xref>). As such, Abs may activate DCs and macrophages via FcRIV-FcRγ pathway to mediate both ADCC and further contribute to NK cell activation through a mechanism similar to the pathway we describe in this study. The process may be termed ‘indirect ADCC’. Clearly, Ab-mediated cancer therapeutics likely involves multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simpson et al., 2013</xref>); therefore, our speculation obviously needs further investigation, particularly in the context of human cancer therapeutics.</p><p>Finally, in light of the tenet that innate immunity instructs adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002</xref>), our study may also raise an interesting issue of whether Dectin-1 signaling by tumor recognition also affects adaptive anti-tumor immune responses, and also may provide new means for the efficient immune responses for cancers such as Dectin-1 agonistic Abs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were from CLEA Japan Inc. <italic>Clec7a (Dectin-1)</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>, <italic>Irf3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>, <italic>Irf5</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>, <italic>Irf7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>, <italic>Rag1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>, and <italic>Myd88</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice as described previously were maintained on a C57BL/6 genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sato et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Honda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takaoka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Honda and Taniguchi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saijo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kano et al., 2008</xref>).

Target cells were then mixed with effector cells at the indicated effector/target (E/T) ratios in flat-bottomed 96-well plates with a total volume of 200 µl and then co-cultured for 4 hr at 37°C. In all in vitro killing assays, 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> of <sup>51</sup>Cr-labeled target cells were used. Released <sup>51</sup>Cr radioactivity in the supernatants was measured with a Wallac 1480 Wizard 3′′ gamma counter (Perkin Elmer). The percentage of cytotoxicity was calculated as following formula: specific lysis (%) = (experimental release − spontaneous release)/(maximum release − spontaneous release) × 100. Target cell lysis was also measured by co-culturing target cells with myeloid cells in the absence of NK cells. This background value was subtracted from the total values obtained in the presence of NK cells and the calculated percentage of cytotoxicity was represented as Net lysis (%).

It's not shown whether Dectin-1 signal in DC is involved in NK cell expression of inflammatory and cytotoxic mediators in the co-culture system</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is an interesting issue to address further. Accordingly, we examined mRNA expression levels for typical inflammatory and cytotoxic mediators in the co-culture system, wherein the ratio of B16F1 cells, DCs, and NK cells is 1:30:10. Total RNA was isolated at zero time and 4 hrs after the co-culture and subjected to qRT-PCR analysis. We found that the mRNA levels for inflammatory cytokines, namely, IFN-g, IL-6, TNF-a remained unchanged between the co-culture with WT DCs and Dectin-1-deficient DCs. Moreover, we did not find any differences in mRNA expression for cytotoxic mediators such as granzyme B and perforin-1. These results are now presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2–figure supplement 8</xref>. As such, from these analyses, it seems unlikely that Dectin-1 signaling in DCs affects the expression of these molecules in NK cells. We agree that how NK cells are activated by DCs and macrophages that received Dectin-1 signaling to exert their anti-tumor cytotoxicity is a very interesting issue, but hope that the reviewer will agree that this out of the main scope of our present study.</p><p><italic>2) Did the authors detect the regulation of NK cell-mediated tumor cell lysis by DC in a transwell system?</italic></p><p>We have not examined the DC effect on NK cells in the transwell system. However, two experiments were carried out to examine the potential involvement of soluble mediators in the DC-mediated activation of NK cells. First, we examined supernatants from CD11b<sup>+</sup> or CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells mixed with B16 cells and found that they essentially had no effect on NK cell activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Second, antibodies against type I IFNs or IL12, both known as the potent cytokines for NK cell activation, showed no effect on the NK cell-enhancing activity by CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Taken together, these results support the notion that Dectin-1 signaling is crucial for mediating cell-to-cell contact and subsequent NK activation. In addition, we found no difference between WT and Dectin-1<sup>-/-</sup> DCs in the mRNA induction levels for IL15 or IL15Ra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>). As such, we think it is most likely that Dectin-1 signaling is crucial for mediating cell-to-cell contact between DCs/macrophages and tumor cells and that this contact leads to NK activation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that DCs/macrophages are secondarily activated by yet unknown factors from NK cells in the actual co-culture situation. Therefore, in order to make this point clearer, we revised the summary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), describing the possibility of bidirectional activation between DCs/macrophages and NK cells. This point is also mentioned in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) Could the authors show the binding between Dectin-1 on DC and N-glycan on tumor cells in confocal images?</italic></p><p>We agree that this is potentially a very interesting experiment. However, we find that the following two elements make such an experiment difficult. First, N-glycan structures on tumor cells are likely to be diverse (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4 fig3s5 fig3s6">Figure 3–figure supplement 4–6</xref>) and a suitable tool antibody is essentially not available. Second, Dectin-1 <italic>per se</italic> is also an N-glycosylated protein. As such, although interesting, we hope that the reviewers agree that we cannot perform this experiment.</p><p><italic>4) Liver is endowed with regulatory immune function. It is well known that liver is enriched in NK cells, and the chronic inflammation (especially virus infection-induced inflammation) may be involved in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Do Kupffer cells express Dectin-1? If so, does Dectin-1 in Kupffer cells affect NK cell-mediated anti-tumor responses? The authors should discuss this possible application of the findings of innate receptors in the control of liver cancer</italic>.</p><p>In response to these comments, we isolated macrophages and DCs from liver and lung, and examined the mRNA expression levels for Dectin-1 by qRT-PCR, as we previously examined in these cells from the spleen. Perhaps expectedly, <italic>Dectin-1</italic> mRNA expression was also observed in these cells, and these new data is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3C</xref>. Therefore, it is likely that Dectin-1 signaling in DCs and macrophages contributes to control of tumor progression in various tissues including lung and liver, as the reviewer pointed out. We discuss this point in the light of this data in the text as follows “we infer that Dectin-1 signaling may contribute to the control of tumor progression in various tissues.”</p><p><italic>5) Upon activation by DC recognition of N-glycan structures in tumor via Dectin-1, do the activated NK cells selectively kill the N-glycan-expressing cells of same origin? Could the authors discuss this?</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting point, although difficult to address experimentally. We think it is possible that once NK cells are activated by DCs/macrophages via Dectin-1 signaling, these NK cells will exert more potent tumoricidal activities on other tumor cells that do not express Dectin-1 ligands. Since it has been shown that tumor cells are phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous even in a given tumor mass (Meacham CE and Morrison SJ, <italic>Nature</italic>, 501, 328–337, 2013), it is possible that tumor cells show different expression profiles with each other for Dectin-1 ligands <italic>in vivo</italic>. If so, an interesting possibility is that those tumor cells, expressing Dectin-1 ligands, effectively induce DC/macrophage-mediated NK cell activation and that these so-called “licensed” NK cells may exert tumoricidal activities on tumor cells regardless on their Dectin-1 ligand expression. We thank the reviewers for pointing this out and we now discuss this possibility in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
