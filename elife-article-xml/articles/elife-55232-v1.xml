ago, molecular identity and developmental relation between human ILC1 and NK cells, comprising group 1 ILCs, is still elusive. To unravel their connection, thorough transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional characterization was performed from umbilical cord blood (CB). Unexpectedly, ILC1-like cells lacked Tbet expression and failed to produce IFNγ. Moreover, in contrast to previously described ILC1 subsets they could be efficiently differentiated into NK cells. These were characterized by highly diversified KIR repertoires including late stage NKG2A<sup>-</sup>KIR<sup>+</sup> effector cells that are commonly not generated from previously known NK cell progenitor sources. This property was dependent on stroma cell-derived Notch ligands. The frequency of the novel ILC1-like NK cell progenitor (NKP) significantly declined in CB from early to late gestational age. The study supports a model in which circulating fetal ILC1-like NKPs travel to secondary lymphoid tissues to initiate the formation of diversified NK cell repertoires after birth.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Innate lymphoid cells</kwd><kwd>KIR</kwd><kwd>neonatal</kwd><kwd>NK cells</kwd><kwd>ILC1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG SPP1937-UH91/8-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uhrberg</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neonatal ILC1-like cells are functionally immature but have the unique potential to generate NK cells characterized by downregulation of NKG2A and a highly diverse KIR receptor repertoire.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) constitute a novel family of non-B, non-T cell lymphocytes that was established within the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spits et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vivier et al., 2018</xref>). The ILC nomenclature mirrors previously established T cell effector definitions and can be divided into three functional groups: natural killer (NK) cells and ILC1 are grouped within group 1 ILCs due to their expression of the transcription factor (TF) T-bet and secretion of IFNγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spits et al., 2013</xref>); ILC2 belong into ILC group 2 and produce T<sub>H</sub>2-like cytokines as well as express the TF GATA-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mjösberg et al., 2011</xref>); ILC3 as well as fetal lymphoid tissue inducer cells belong into group 3 ILC, they secrete IL-17 and/or IL-22 and depend on TF RORγt expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hoorweg et al., 2012</xref>). In humans, non-NK ILCs are conventionally defined and physically enriched on the basis of IL-7 receptor expression (CD127) in combination with the exclusion of a lineage marker panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bianca Bennstein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Krabbendam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spits et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vivier et al., 2018</xref>). Further differentiation into ILC subgroups involves the presence of CD117 on ILC3, of CRTH2 on ILC2, and the lack of both in case of ILC1.</p><p>The transcriptional and functional identity of ILC1 in humans is still a matter of debate, which is partly due to the fact that in contrast to other ILC subsets, ILC1 are lacking robust markers enabling their positive identification and isolation. Within the original description, ILC1 were defined as lin<sup>-</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup>CD117<sup>-</sup>CRTH2<sup>-</sup>CD161<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernink et al., 2013</xref>). However, CD161 is also an NK cell ‘marker’ and CD127 is consistently expressed on the CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cell subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vivier et al., 2018</xref>). Nonetheless, ILC1 can be robustly separated from NK cells in most settings by the lack of the CD94/NKG2A heterodimer and/or KIR, representing the prime receptors for missing self-recognition, thereby constituting an exclusive phenotypic and functional hallmark of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Manser et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to the original described ILC1 subset, an intraepithelial CD103<sup>+</sup>Eomes<sup>+</sup> type 1 ILC has been described expressing T-bet and secreting IFNγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cella et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuchs et al., 2013</xref>). Of note, the intraepithelial CD103<sup>+</sup> subset expresses typical NK cell markers such as CD94, NKG2A, and granzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cella et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krämer et al., 2017</xref>). Since CD103 is an established tissue residency marker frequently found on NK cells within mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Freud et al., 2017</xref>) and moreover transcriptional as well as phenotypic analysis failed to clearly separate CD103<sup>+</sup> intraepithelial ILC1 from NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cella et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yudanin et al., 2019</xref>), the CD103<sup>+</sup> intraepithelial subset appears to be a tissue-resident NK cell subset.</p><p>Regarding the developmental relationship between human NK cells and ILC1, recent data support the existence of separate precursors for the development of ILC1 and NK cells downstream of the common lymphoid progenitor stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renoux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vivier et al., 2018</xref>), which is a revision of the initial model assuming a direct common progenitor of ILC1 and NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spits et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, the question remains what relationship the two human type 1 ILC types have to one another. Several studies in mice suggest a conversion of NK cells into ILC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cortez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Park et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, it is currently not known if ILC1 can be converted into NK cells, except by reprogramming of murine ILC1 with Eomes, a central TF for NK cell development and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pikovskaya et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, plasticity between NK and ILC1s has so far not been shown in humans.</p><p>So far, definitions of ILC1 are predominantly based on work in solid organs and tissues such as gut and lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Björklund et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, for circulating ILC1, information on origin, function, and developmental potential is still at its infancy. Given that the accessibility of ILCs in humans is mostly restricted to blood, an increased understanding of the biology of blood-borne ILC and their respective progenitors appears to be of pivotal importance for guiding and implementing future ILC-based cellular therapies. Of note, in PB it was recently shown that lin<sup>-</sup>CD117<sup>+</sup> cells, phenotypically resembling ILC3, were observed to be functionally immature but instead could be differentiated into all ILC subsets including NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lim et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, a thorough characterization of circulating type 1 ILC was performed in human umbilical cord blood (CB). CB represents a highly versatile and ethically non-problematic source of neonatal blood with low pathogenic burden that was recently shown to be enriched for ILCs compared to PB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vély et al., 2016</xref>). Our work demonstrates that CB-derived ILC1-like cells are distinct from NK cells on the transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional level but rather constitute NK cell progenitors (NKP) with a unique propensity to generate clonally diversified NK cell repertoires in vitro. A similar ILC1-like subset, albeit at lower frequency, was also found in peripheral blood.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Distinct transcriptional identities of neonatal circulating ILC1-like cells and NK cells</title><p>The transcriptional basis underlying the phenotypic and functional differences between NK cells and ILC1, together comprising the group 1 ILC family, is poorly defined in the circulation and direct comparisons between ILC1 and NK cells by bulk RNA sequencing are so far not available. A central purpose of the present study was to characterize group 1 ILC in CB, which provides a rich source for ILCs comprising all three ILC subsets as well as both major NK cell subsets, the regulatory CD56<sup>bright</sup> and the cytotoxic CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bianca Bennstein et al., 2019</xref>). To this end, ILC1-like cells, defined as lin<sup>-</sup>CD94<sup>-</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup>CRTH2<sup>-</sup>CD117<sup>-</sup> cells, CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells, and CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells were flow cytometrically sorted from freshly collected CB and subjected to RNAseq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). All three group 1 ILC subsets could be clearly separated from each other on the basis of their transcriptional patterns in the heatmap and principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). PC1, which accounts for 56% variance in the data, differentiates between the three cell subsets with ILC1-like cells clearly separated from CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells and CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells. Within PC2 accounting for 16% of variance, all three subsets could be further separated from each other. While in PC1 (56% variance) ILC1-like cells are more similar to CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells, in PC2 (16% variance) ILC1-like cells are more similar to CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ILC1-like cells have a unique gene signature distinct from NK cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) CB mononuclear cells (MNCs) were enriched prior to sorting via biotin-labelled antibodies (anti-CD3/CD19/CD14/CD66b) and sorted for ILC1-like cells, CD56<sup>dim</sup>, and CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for sorting strategy).

ILC1-like NKPs have a lin<sup>-</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup>CD117<sup>-</sup>CRTH2<sup>-</sup> phenotype, matching innate lymphoid cells previously defined as ILC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernink et al., 2013</xref>), but lacking expression of TBET, a common signature transcription factor of ILC1 and NK cells. We demonstrate that ILC1-like cells can be broken down into two subsets, a major CD5<sup>+</sup>CD161<sup>-/+</sup> subset expressing the chemokine receptors CCR7, CCR4, and CCR9 and failing to secrete IFNγ and a small CD5<sup>-</sup>CD161<sup>+</sup> subset not expressing any of the three chemokine receptors but showing IFNγ secretion after specific stimulation. Despite their difference in phenotype and functionality, both ILC1-like subsets possessed NKP potential. Single-cell cloning experiments revealed a high NKP frequency within CB-derived ILC1-like cells and a high propensity to differentiate into mature NK cells. In contrast to established CD34<sup>+</sup> or CD34<sup>-</sup>CD117<sup>+</sup> NKPs that predominantly generate NKG2A<sup>+</sup>KIR<sup>-</sup> NK cells, differentiation of ILC1-like NKPs led to a high frequency of KIR<sup>+</sup> NK cells including the NKG2A<sup>-</sup>KIR<sup>+</sup> subset, constituting an advanced maturation stage. The fact that neonatal ILC1-like cells are clearly distinct from NK cells on the transcriptomic, epigenetic, and functional level in combination with the single cell cloning experiments suggest that ILC1-like NKPs have a true progenitor relationship to NK cells.</p><p>Our study provides to our knowledge the first comparison of ILC1-like and NK cells by deep transcriptomic and epigenetic analysis in human blood. In the present study, ILC1-like cells could be clearly distinguished from CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells and the more mature CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells by RNAseq. The CB-derived ILC1-like cells completely lacked NK cell-specific molecules such as CD94, NKG2A, and KIR on the transcriptional and surface expression level. Moreover, chromatin accessibility studies suggested that the regulatory regions of the respective NK cell receptors were open in NK cells but closed in ILC1-like cells further confirming a lack of transcriptional activity for NK cell receptors in ILC1-like cells. The clear distinction between ILC1-like cells and NK cells contrasts with previous studies showing nearly indistinguishable expression patterns of the two group 1 ILC members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuchs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salomé et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yudanin et al., 2019</xref>). In the case of CD127<sup>-</sup>ILC, this is clearly a question of defining ILC1, since CD127<sup>-</sup>ILC1 cells are different from circulating NK cells due to expression of CD103 but indistinguishable from tissue-resident NK cells, including the expression of EOMES and CD94/NKG2A NK cell receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuchs et al., 2013</xref>) and might thus as well be defined as NK cells. In case of CD127<sup>+</sup>ILC1, contamination with CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells represents the main obstacle that has to be avoided by including CD94 in the lineage depletion cocktail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernink et al., 2013</xref>). Since the majority of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells are CD127<sup>+</sup> and CD16<sup>-</sup>, ILC1 subsets defined as CD56<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup> or CD56<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>-</sup> without exclusion of CD94<sup>+</sup> cells will be likely contaminated with CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loyon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salomé et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trabanelli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yudanin et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, the present data support previous work showing that NK cells can be accurately separated from other ILCs by consideration of CD94/NKG2A expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mjösberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scoville et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Almost all NK cell precursors described so far are characterized by expression of CD117 (cKIT), the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF), including CD34<sup>+</sup> early progenitors (stage 2) as well as more differentiated CD34<sup>-</sup> stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Freud et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, it was previously shown that CD117 is gradually downregulated during NK cell differentiation in secondary lymph nodes from early to late stages of NK cell development with mature CD16<sup>+</sup>CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells being the only CD117<sup>-</sup> stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Freud et al., 2016</xref>). The absence of CD117 on ILC1-like NKPs represents thus an unusual feature for NK cell progenitors and demonstrates that cKIT signaling is not required for triggering their inherent NK cell differentiation potential. The lack of CD117 sets ILC1-like NKPs also apart from the recently described circulating Lin<sup>-</sup>CD7<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup>CD117<sup>+</sup> multipotent ILC progenitors (ILCp) that gave rise to all ILC subsets including NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lim et al., 2017</xref>). We thus hypothesize that circulating ILC1-like NKPs are at a more advanced developmental stage than CD34<sup>+</sup>CD117<sup>+</sup> or CD34<sup>-</sup>CD117<sup>+</sup>NK cell progenitors and also compared to ILCp. However, the upstream progenitor of ILC1-like NK cells is currently elusive. Although it is possible that ILC1-like NK cells are developing from previously described CD117<sup>+</sup> NKPs, a linear developmental relationship between them appears to be unlikely since the specific potential to generate NKG2A<sup>-</sup>KIR<sup>+</sup> NK cells could so far not be detected when starting from the more immature CD117<sup>+</sup> NKPs.</p><p>Notably, some of the most significant transcriptomic differences between ILC1-like cells and NK cells pertained to the ILC1-specific expression of genes classically attributed to the T cell lineage such as <italic>CD5</italic>, <italic>CD6</italic>, <italic>CD28</italic>, and also components of the CD3/TCR complex, but without detectable expression of CD3 or TCR on the cell surface. The expression of T cell lineage-related molecules is in line with previous reports of ILC1 in peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roan et al., 2016</xref>) and tonsils by single cell RNAseq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Björklund et al., 2016</xref>). Of note, in the course of our experiments we did not observe any potential for T cell development neither with OP9 nor OP9-DL1 and this was true in the presence of NK cell (IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15) as well as T cell (IL-7 and FLt3L) conditions. This contrasts to the properties of CD34<sup>+</sup> early hematopoietic progenitors as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zúñiga-Pflücker, 2004</xref>). Nonetheless, the T cell signature could be an indication of a thymic origin of the circulating ILC1-like NKPs. Of note, it has been proposed that NKPs develop in the thymus from progenitors with failed T-cell program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klein Wolterink et al., 2010</xref>). Unlike the original model where NK/T bi-potent precursors directly convert to NK cells in the thymus after an unsuccessful attempt to become T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klein Wolterink et al., 2010</xref>), it could be speculated that `T-cell failure’ might lead to the release of CD5<sup>+</sup> ILC1-like NKP from the thymus into the periphery. Our data suggested some evidence, as CB ILC1-like cells express either CD4 or CD8, intracellular CD3δ, CD2 was selectively expressed on CD5<sup>+</sup> ILC1-like cells, and RNAseq analyses revealed a polyclonal repertoire of the genes <italic>TRAV</italic> and <italic>TRBV</italic> encoding the variable region of the T cell receptor alpha and beta chain, respectively. Of note, CD5<sup>+</sup> ILC-like cells expressing intracellular CD3 components were previously isolated from the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nagasawa et al., 2017</xref>) and intracellular CD3δ expression was reported previously within human fetal NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Phillips et al., 1992</xref>). Further studies of thymic ILC/NK progenitors will be necessary to better understand the origin of ILC1-like NKPs.</p><p>The prevailing view of NK cell development sees a linear consecutive relationship between CD117<sup>+</sup> NKPs, CD56<sup>bright</sup>, and finally CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Freud et al., 2006</xref>). This model was majorly defined by analysis of progenitors in SLNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Freud et al., 2006</xref>). The present data suggest that in the circulation, CD56<sup>bright</sup> and CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells might not be necessarily connected in a similar linear developmental relationship. Generally, CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells mostly rely on NKG2A as their only and rather broad HLA class I-specific inhibitory receptor, whereas the more mature CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells are characterized by complex HLA class I-educated KIR repertoires. The latter is necessary for sensitive detection of pathogen- or tumor-mediated downregulation of selected HLA class I genes. So far, a progenitor/product relationship has been widely assumed for CD56<sup>bright</sup> and CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells respectively, although other possibilities such as a branched model for NK cell development were suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cichocki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Michel et al., 2016</xref>). Here, employing identical differentiation conditions, ILC1-like NKPs rather than CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells were able to reconstitute complex NK cell receptor repertoires including NKG2A<sup>-</sup>KIR<sup>+</sup> NK cells. On the other hand, CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells showed a high proliferative capacity and mainly remained NKG2A<sup>+</sup>KIR<sup>-</sup>. Notably, cultured CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells changed from expressing the CD56<sup>bright</sup>-specific granzyme K to CD56<sup>dim</sup>-specific granzyme B, indicative of the acquisition of effector functions and consequently were cytotoxic after 14d of culture. The data are thus compatible with a non-linear, ‘branched’ model in which CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cell differentiation preferentially leads to NKG2A<sup>+</sup>CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells, whereas ILC1-like cells preferentially advance to the NKG2A<sup>-</sup>KIR<sup>+</sup> stage, which would make the roles of CD56<sup>bright</sup> and ILC1-like cells in building NK cell repertoires complimentary. In favor of this model, many of the T cell-specific markers that are in ILC1-like NKPs are also found in CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells, whereas they are low or absent in CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells. Examples of this are <italic>TRBC1</italic>, encoding the T cell receptor β constant region, <italic>BCL11B</italic> encoding a TF important for T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hosokawa et al., 2020</xref>), and <italic>CD3D</italic>.</p><p>The ILC1-like cells could be phenotypically and functionally further broken down into four subsets defined by expression of CD5 and CD161. While all subsets exhibited NK cell differentiation potential, they might differentially contribute to NK cell repertoire development.</p><p>When speculating on the developmental trajectories, CD5<sup>+</sup>CD161<sup>-</sup> cells might represent the most immature subset. They are characterized by the expression of various T cell molecules such as CD2, CD6 and CD28, compatible with their recent exit from the thymus and also possess chemokine receptors for further migration into SLN for further differentiation. In contrast, CD5<sup>-</sup>CD161<sup>+</sup> are likely to be a more differentiated ILC1-like subset since they have lost most of the T cell-specific molecules and chemokine receptors while acquiring effector functions. They might in fact remain in the circulation as an independent SLN NK cell source. The CD5<sup>+</sup>CD161<sup>+</sup> subset could constitute an intermediate subset as they possess T cell-specific molecules such as CD2 and chemokine receptors but have already acquire IFNγ effector function.</p><p>The frequency of ILC1-like cells was particularly high in CBs of early gestational age and decreased until term. Similar changes were not observed for other ILC groups that exhibited no changes in relation to gestational age but significantly decreased after birth in an ageing-like process. We hypothesize that the loss of ILC1-like cells is due to preferential migration into tissues during the perinatal phase of development. The large majority of ILC1-like cells expressed the chemokine receptor CCR7, which supports migration to SLN, an established site of NK cell maturation. Further subsets co-expressed CCR4 or CCR9, supporting migration to skin and the gastrointestinal tract. We thus suggest that the majority of ILC1-like NKPs travel to the SLNs before and around birth to differentiate into NK cells and eventually reenter circulation. The migration of ILC1-like NKPs to SLN would provide them with the necessary niche signals required for further maturation. A key signal required for NK cell maturation including expression of KIR is provided by NOTCH and the necessary NOTCH ligands are highly expressed in SLN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Radtke et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the dependence of ILC1-like NKPs on NOTCH signaling as observed here in OP-9 differentiation assays would support the idea of migration to lymphatic tissue for successful final maturation.</p><p>In summary, the present work constitutes a thorough dissection of group 1 ILCs in neonatal blood on the molecular and functional level. We demonstrate that ILC1-like cells are very different from NK cells on the transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional level but instead constitute a potent NKP. The lin<sup>-</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup>CD117<sup>-</sup> ILC1-like NKP is distinguished from previously defined NKPs and ILCPs by the absence of CD117 and the presence of T cell-specific molecules and also by the property of generating diversified NK cell repertoires characterized by KIR expression as well as the downregulation of NKG2A. ILC1-like NKPs were found in CB and PB, but the latter were less potent in generating mature NK cells. The study suggests high spatial and temporal dynamics within group I ILC during perinatal development that is driven by the migratory properties of ILC1-like NKP. For realization of the NKP potential, ILC1-like NKPs would travel to SLN, where they are exposed to signals such as NOTCH ligands and IL-15 that induce NK cell maturation. Although the fate of ILC1 NKPs in SLN is unknown, we suggest that they are released back to the circulation for building up diversified NK cell repertoires after birth.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human samples and ethics statement</title><p>Buffy coats of anonymous, healthy blood donations were kindly provided by the Blutspendezentrale at the University Hospital Düsseldorf.

cells in the cord blood. The authors show that cord blood ILC1 are a distinctive population of cells lacking signature NK cell genes and markers and instead expressing genes and markers of T-cell lineage. In appropriate culture conditions, a T-bet negative ILC1-like cell population can differentiate into a complex repertoire of functional NK cells that express both NKG2A and diverse KIRs. The conclusions are supported by the data and the results are relevant in the field of innate immune cell development.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Umbilical cord blood-derived ILC1-like cells constitute a novel precursor for mature KIR<sup>+</sup>NKG2A<sup>-</sup> NK cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Francesco Colucci (Reviewer #1); Nicholas Huntington (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, Bennstein et al. describe a T-bet negative ILC1-like cell population identified in cord blood. These cells lack the signature of NK cell genes and markers, and instead express genes and markers of T-cell lineage. In appropriate culture conditions these cells can differentiate into a complex repertoire of functional NK cells that express both NKG2A and diverse KIRs. The reviewers appreciated the attention to an important topic, but raised substantial number of concerns about the manuscript as it currently stands. We therefore ask the authors to modify the manuscript according to the review recommendations before we can re-consider your manuscript for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors state that ILC1-like cells which are T-bet and CD56 negative and lack expression of perforin and all 5 granzymes develop into effector NK cells with de novo CD94, NKG2A and KIR2DL3 expression. The authors need to further phenotype the differentiated cells, showing evidence of essential NK cell markers, including CD56, NKp46, granzyme B and perforin. Additionally, they should demonstrate that inhibitory KIR expression in the differentiated cells is functionally inhibitory and leads to increased cytotoxicity in educated cells. Despite the ILC1-like derived NK cells having increased KIR expression compared to the CD56bright-derived NK cells, CD56bright-derived NK cells were equally functional and exhibited more target-specific degranulation compared to ILC1-derived NK cells.</p><p>2) The idea proposed in the discussion that CB ILC1 may be cells that have failed to convert into T cells into the thymus is an attractive one and perhaps the authors may wish to test it by looking at markers of recent thymic emigrants in CB ILC1 – if possible?</p><p>3) It is unclear if proper functional controls were utilized in this study. Target-specific degranulation needs to be shown instead of total degranulation in Figure 5, as Figure 7C makes evident. Additionally, the equation used to calculate cytotoxicity for the CFSE-based method should be included in the Materials and methods section. For the ADCC assay, it is unclear what cells were used for the control. Individual controls (antibody negative) for each cell population should be included.</p><p>4) How do the authors explain the phenotypic and functional differences between the individual ILC1-like subsets as defined by CD5 and CD161 expression and how do these individual subsets contribute to their proposed NKP potential? This point should be discussed in more detail.</p><p>5) The authors state that ILC1-like cells preferentially differentiate into mature KIR<sup>+</sup> NK cells compared to CD56bright NK cells in the OP9-DL1 differentiation setting in the presence of IL-2, IL7 and IL-15. Cytokine stimulation (IL-2 and IL-15) of NK cells leading to the induction of proliferation and results in CD56 and NGK2A upregulation, even in mature CD56dim NK cells. Hence it is not surprising that CD56bright NK cells retained high NKG2A expression while actively proliferating. The present experimental setup therefore does not support their statement in paragraph five of the Discussion of a branched NK cell lineage model.</p><p>6) The authors clearly show that the CD127<sup>+</sup> Lin- population is highly heterogenous, just by looking at CD161, CD5, CCR9, CCR4 and CCR7. Therefore, the transcriptomic and epigenetic data on the bulk population are not informative. Single cell analysis should be used to define the heterogeneity, considering that Simoni et al. have previously reported the heterogenous nature of human ILC1s (Simoni et al., Immunity, 2017) and questioned the nature of lineages included.</p><p>7) The authors claim that the cells do not generate T cells. However, they only use IL-7 and FLT3, while in other protocols the used IL-7, FLT3L and SCF.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised manuscript &quot;Umbilical cord blood-derived ILC1-like cells constitute a novel precursor for mature KIR<sup>+</sup>NKG2A<sup>-</sup> NK cells&quot; for <italic>eLife</italic>.

As expected for effector NK cells, differentiated ILC1-like cells expressed CD56, NKp46 (low expression because of internalization in culture conditions), granzyme B, and perforin (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><p>As pointed out by the reviewers the ILC1-derived NK cells exhibited functional features comparable to CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells. This is not surprising since not only ILC1-like but also CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells differentiated into effector NK cells within the 14d culture period. It is well described that CD56 is generally upregulated on all NK cells during culture, i.e. CD56<sup>dim</sup> effector NK cell become CD56<sup>bright</sup> after a few days and CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells keep their strong expression of CD56 in culture, independent of other phenotypic and functional changes. The CD56<sup>bright</sup> status is thus a kind of culture artefact. In order to demonstrate that the CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells indeed converted to otherwise typical effector NK cells in culture, we additionally stained granzyme K, which is one of the few <italic>bona fide</italic> markers characterizing CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells. As shown in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 2, ex vivo isolated CD56<sup>bright</sup> cells express GzmK but not GzmB whereas CD56<sup>dim</sup> expressed GzmB only. In our differentiation cultures CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells loose GzmK and acquire GzmB expression, demonstrating their conversion to effector NK cells. (subsection “Neonatal ILC1-like cells contain a novel NK cell progenitor”, Figure 4—figure supplement 2)</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is an interesting question if the in vitro generated NK cells are licensed and if they exhibit a higher cytotoxic capacity. However, we are unable to address this question with the in vitro system we used. In order for NK cells to be licensed the respective KIR (2DL1/ 2DL2/L3) expressed on the NK cell needs to recognize the cognate self HLA-C (C2/C1). This is a process naturally happening in vivo, however our system generated NK cells on the murine feeder cell line OP9-DL1. Therefore, we are generating KIR-expressing NK cells in the absence of self HLA-C. Hence, they have not been educated due to the absence of self-ligands. This is the reason, why we could not address this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The idea proposed in the discussion that CB ILC1 may be cells that have failed to convert into T cells into the thymus is an attractive one and perhaps the authors may wish to test it by looking at markers of recent thymic emigrants in CB ILC1 – if possible?</p></disp-quote><p>Recent thymic emigrants are hard to characterize on the basis of a certain phenotype, as several publications observed different cell surface receptors depending on the T cell lineage of either CD8 or CD4(Fink, 2013; McFarland et al., 2000; Pekalski et al., 2017). Nonetheless, we were able to characterize our CB ILC1-like cells with regard to other T cell associated molecules in more detail and added a Supplementary Figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) and added information to the Results (paragraph two). Like recent thymic emigrants, CB ILC1-like cells either expressed CD4 or CD8 and intracellular CD3𝛿. We further detected specific CD2 expression within CD5<sup>+</sup> ILC1-like cells. We also observed a diverse repertoire of the variable regions of the α and β T cell receptor chains (<italic>TRAV</italic> and <italic>TRBV</italic>) within our RNAseq data of sorted CB ILC1-like cells, suggesting that ILC1-like cells are polyclonal on the basis of rearranged TCR. The data further support the idea of a conversion of ILC1-like cells into NK cells after failing to become T cells within the thymus, but in the absence of more definitive proof it still remains a hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is unclear if proper functional controls were utilized in this study. Target-specific degranulation needs to be shown instead of total degranulation in Figure 5, as Figure 7C makes evident. Additionally, the equation used to calculate cytotoxicity for the CFSE-based method should be included in the Materials and methods section. For the ADCC assay, it is unclear what cells were used for the control. Individual controls (antibody negative) for each cell population should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting this point and apologize if the respective statements within the manuscript were simplified. In fact, CD107a degranulation, CFSE, and ADCC assays were performed with proper controls. For the CD107a degranulation assay, we did already show target-specific degranulation, as we subtracted spontaneous CD107a degranulation (cells without target) from target specific CD107a degranulation (cells with K562). We have now introduced representative dot plots of spontaneous CD107a degranulation and the respective bar graphs (Figure 5A). We have also clarified this more clearly in the legend of Figure 5 as well as within the Material and methods section.</p><p>We have included a sentence and equation how we calculated the cytotoxicity for the CFSE based method.</p><p>Since in the ADCC experiment we originally included only a control of cells without target and Rituximab, we now added new data including controls with target cells but without antibodies as suggested by the reviewers. Similar to the CD107a degranulation assay, we newly included representative dot plots of target-specific killing (in vitro cultured cell with Raji as target and Rituximab) and spontaneous killing (in vitro cultured cell with Raji as target without Rituximab). Again, the ADCC data were comparable between ILC1-like and CD56<sup>bright</sup> cells. Unfortunately, in case of ILC1-like derived NK cells the data did not reach statistical significance compared to the controls. This is probably due to the low expression of CD16 after long-term culture, which is well described: ADCC effects are generally low in long-term cultured cells due to action of ADAM sheddases, which clip the CD16 molecules and make this process ineffective (Romee et al., 2013). We have included a description of ADCC with proper controls used within the legend of Figure 5 as well as within the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) How do the authors explain the phenotypic and functional differences between the individual ILC1-like subsets as defined by CD5 and CD161 expression and how do these individual subsets contribute to their proposed NKP potential? This point should be discussed in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the opportunity to share our thoughts of the developmental relationship between the different ILC1-like subsets. We have dedicated a new section within the discussion for this question. We inserted the following into our Discussion:</p><p>“The ILC1-like cells could be phenotypically and functionally further broken down into four subsets defined by expression of CD5 and CD161. […] The CD5<sup>+</sup>CD161<sup>+</sup> subset could constitute an intermediate subset as they possess T cell-specific molecules such as CD2 and chemokine receptors but have already acquire IFNγ effector function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors state that ILC1-like cells preferentially differentiate into mature KIR<sup>+</sup> NK cells compared to CD56bright NK cells in the OP9-DL1 differentiation setting in the presence of IL-2, IL7 and IL-15. Cytokine stimulation (IL-2 and IL-15) of NK cells leading to the induction of proliferation and results in CD56 and NGK2A upregulation, even in mature CD56dim NK cells. Hence it is not surprising that CD56bright NK cells retained high NKG2A expression while actively proliferating. The present experimental setup therefore does not support their statement in paragraph five of the Discussion of a branched NK cell lineage model.</p></disp-quote><p>A problem with the current linear model of NK cell differentiation is that CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells are assumed to be the precursors of CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells but in vitro remain NKG2A<sup>+</sup> and are very ineffective in developing into more differentiated NK cell subsets, in particular the highly diverse and functionally important NKG2A<sup>-</sup>KIR<sup>+</sup> subset. This is observed in different in vitro settings such as those using cytokines only but also feeder-supported cultures including murine AFT024, EL-08, OP-9 and even in our human MSC-supported model (Zhao et al., 2018). The unexpected finding in our study was that ILC1-like cells preferentially differentiate into more differentiated, less proliferative NKG2A<sup>-</sup>KIR<sup>+</sup> NK cells using the same culture conditions as those applied for CD56<sup>bright</sup>. And as discussed above (point 1, second paragraph), the NK cells derived from CD56<sup>bright</sup> maintain high CD56 expression but in fact differentiate into effector NK cells expressing perforin and GrzB. Thus, the chosen conditions are probably not the reason for the lack of further (terminal) differentiation but might rather be due to the more restricted developmental potential of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells. We thus discuss a non-linear, “branched&quot; model in which CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cell differentiation preferentially leads to NKG2A<sup>+</sup>CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells (which constitute the large majority of CB NK cells) whereas ILC1-like cells preferentially advance to the NKG2A<sup>-</sup>KIR<sup>+</sup> stage, which would make the roles of CD56<sup>bright</sup> and ILC1-like cells in building NK cell repertoires complimentary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors clearly show that the CD127<sup>+</sup> Lin- population is highly heterogenous, just by looking at CD161, CD5, CCR9, CCR4 and CCR7. Therefore, the transcriptomic and epigenetic data on the bulk population are not informative. Single cell analysis should be used to define the heterogeneity, considering that Simoni et al. have previously reported the heterogenous nature of human ILC1s (Simoni et al., Immunity, 2017) and questioned the nature of lineages included.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the transcriptional and phenotypic heterogeneity of circulating ILC1 might go well beyond what was defined in the present study. However, our study demonstrates that the NK cell differentiation potential is present in all major ILC1 subsets defined by single or combined expression of CD161 and CD5. In this regard, we went to great length to show by bulk and single cell cloning experiments that all major subsets similarly possess NK cell differentiation potential characterized by the NKG2A<sup>-</sup>KIR<sup>+</sup> phenotype and the respective NK cell effector functions. If we further divide these subsets into even smaller populations by single cell RNAseq we will probably identify more subsets but each of these newly defined and very small populations has then to be functionally defined and tested for their individual differentiation potential. We do not think that this kind of analysis would affect the main point of our study that the large majority of circulating ILC1 possess NKP potential.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors claim that the cells do not generate T cells. However, they only use IL-7 and FLT3, while in other protocols the used IL-7, FLT3L and SCF.</p></disp-quote><p>The combination of IL-7 and FLT3L is used in several seminal studies to differentiate CD34<sup>+</sup> cells into T cells (Schmitt and Zúñiga-Pflücker, 2002; Wang, 2012; Zúñiga-Pflücker, 2004). In addition, the combination seemed to be suitable since ILC1-like cells abundantly express the respective IL-7 receptor (CD127) and the FLT3 ligand. We did not use SCF as this was previously shown to selectively stimulate proliferation of the CD4/CD8 double negative stage while inhibiting further differentiation into the double positive stage in a dose dependent manner (Wang et al., 2006). Nonetheless, we are well aware that there is no consensus on which method to use for a given progenitor and several other approaches are published including classical FTOC and organoid models (Seet et al., 2017). Thus, we put our statement concerning the failure to differentiate into T cells into perspective by stating that although OP9-supported T cell differentiation is widely established it cannot be excluded that the T cell potential might be still present in ILC1-like cells but the in vitro approach was insufficient to deliver all necessary signals present in vivo (subsection “Neonatal ILC1-like cells contain a novel NK cell progenitor”).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, there is still one essential issue which you failed to address to comply with reviewer's recommendations.

We have prepared ATACseq data of ILC1-like cells and NK cells of two additional donors exactly as done before. In accordance with the results of the first sample shown in Figure 4C, the NK cell specific genes CD94/KLRD1, NKG2A/ KLRC1, and KIR2DL3 exhibited high accessibility in NK cells and no accessibility in ILC1-like cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The data reinforce our point that although ILC1-like cells can be readily differentiated into NK cells they are not already poised for transcription of NK cell receptors.
