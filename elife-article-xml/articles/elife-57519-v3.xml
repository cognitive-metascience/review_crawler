While other HDAC complexes have been implicated in neurogenesis, the physiological role of MiDAC remains unknown. Here, we show that MiDAC constitutes an important regulator of neural differentiation. We demonstrate that MiDAC functions as a modulator of a neurodevelopmental gene expression program and binds to important regulators of neurite outgrowth. MiDAC upregulates gene expression of pro-neural genes such as those encoding the secreted ligands SLIT3 and NETRIN1 (NTN1) by a mechanism suggestive of H4K20ac removal on promoters and enhancers. Conversely, MiDAC inhibits gene expression by reducing H3K27ac on promoter-proximal and -distal elements of negative regulators of neurogenesis. Furthermore, loss of MiDAC results in neurite outgrowth defects that can be rescued by supplementation with SLIT3 and/or NTN1. These findings indicate a crucial role for MiDAC in regulating the ligands of the SLIT3 and NTN1 signaling axes to ensure the proper integrity of neurite development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitotic deacetylase complex MiDAC</kwd><kwd>DNTTIP1</kwd><kwd>ELMSAN1/MIDEAS</kwd><kwd>HDAC1</kwd><kwd>neurite ourgrowth</kwd><kwd>SLIT and NETRIN signaling pathways</kwd><kwd>H4K20 acetylation</kwd><kwd>H3K27 acetylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00CA181506</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herz</surname><given-names>Hans-Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012524</institution-id><institution>American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herz</surname><given-names>Hans-Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification of the underlying molecular gene-regulatory mechanisms by which the histone deacetylase complex MiDAC controls neurite outgrowth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epigenetic regulators often constitute chromatin-modifying enzymes which catalyze the addition and removal of posttranslational modifications on histones and are involved in the control of gene expression by modulating chromatin structure and function. Among them, the families of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) acetylate and deacetylate lysine residues on histones and other proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shahbazian and Grunstein, 2007</xref>). Based on initial studies, a model emerged in which nuclear HDACs were thought to be recruited by transcription factors to facilitate transcriptional repression by creating a more condensed chromatin landscape at their target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kadosh and Struhl, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rundlett et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). However, more recently it was shown that HDACs tend to localize to transcriptionally active loci including promoters, gene bodies and enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, gene expression profiling studies also demonstrated that knockout of individual HDACs resulted not only in upregulation but also downregulation of a significant number of genes suggesting both activating and repressive roles for HDACs in regulating gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamaguchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zupkovitz et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>HDAC1 and HDAC2 belong to the family of class I HDACs, are highly similar (83% identity) and are involved in the control of gene expression by modulating chromatin structure and function. Their vital and often redundant roles in neurogenesis are well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gräff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jacob et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Montgomery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ye et al., 2009</xref>). They form the catalytic core of the SIN3, NuRD, CoREST and mitotic deacetylase (MiDAC) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kelly and Cowley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Millard et al., 2017</xref>). HDAC1/2 activity and targeting to specific gene loci strongly depends on their incorporation into these complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kelly and Cowley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Millard et al., 2017</xref>). At least one of the scaffolding proteins within the NuRD, CoREST and MiDAC complexes contains an ELM2-SANT domain which is instrumental in recruiting and activating HDAC1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Millard et al., 2017</xref>). While the molecular function of the SIN3, NuRD and CoREST complexes have been studied in greater detail little is known about the molecular function of MiDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kelly and Cowley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Millard et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>MiDAC is conserved from nematodes to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bantscheff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hao et al., 2011</xref>). In humans, MiDAC is composed of HDAC1/2, the scaffolding protein DNTTIP1, and the ELM2-SANT domain containing scaffolding protein ELMSAN1 (also known as MIDEAS) and/or the closely ELMSAN1-related proteins TRERF1 and ZNF541 (ZFP541 or SHIP in mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banks et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bantscheff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joshi et al., 2013</xref>). MiDAC constitutes a stoichiometric tetrameric complex that requires the N-terminal dimerization domain of DNTTIP1 for assembly. The C-terminus of DNTTIP1 mediates MiDAC recruitment to nucleosomes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Itoh et al., 2015</xref>). MiDAC specifically associates with cyclin A2 (CCNA2) and cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and interacts more prominently with certain HDAC inhibitors in mitotically arrested versus non-synchronized proliferating cells, suggesting a role in cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bantscheff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huttlin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pagliuca et al., 2011</xref>). Before MiDAC was described as a complex its individual subunits DNTTIP1 and TRERF1 were reported to function predominantly as transcriptional activators for select genes of the steroidogenesis and ossification pathways, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gizard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gizard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gizard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gizard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gizard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koiwai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kubota et al., 2013</xref>). In agreement with these findings, ELMSAN1 was found to be associated with chromatin enriched for the histone mark H3K27ac suggesting a role in active transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ji et al., 2015</xref>). While SIN3, NuRD, and CoREST have been functionally characterized as regulators of neurogenesis, the physiological role of MiDAC remains unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrés et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knock et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nitarska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MiDAC controls a neurodevelopmental gene expression program.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Subunits with domains of the human histone deacetylase complex MiDAC.

We found that MiDAC is recruited to promoters and enhancers genome-wide, directly regulates a set of neurodevelopmental genes, and can act as both an activator and repressor of different gene sets to modulate gene expression by negatively regulating the repressive histone mark H4K20ac or the active histone mark H3K27ac, respectively. Specifically, MiDAC binds to promoters and enhancers of axon guidance ligands of the SLIT and NETRIN families and is required for their activation. Genetic deletion of MiDAC components results in inactivation of SLIT3 and NTN1 signaling during neural differentiation and severely impairs neurite outgrowth and network formation. These findings reveal a novel function for MiDAC in regulating neural gene expression programs to ensure proper neuronal maturation and/or neurite outgrowth during neurogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DNTTIP1 interacts with ELMSAN1 and the histone deacetylase HDAC1 to form MiDAC in mESCs</title><p>We began by investigating the function of DNTTIP1 and ELMSAN1, two scaffolding components of MiDAC, in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To determine whether DNTTIP1 and ELMSAN1 function within MiDAC in mESCs, we examined the mRNA and protein levels of other MiDAC components in <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO and <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bantscheff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hao et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Elmsan1</italic> and <italic>Hdac1</italic> mRNA levels were unchanged, <italic>Hdac2</italic> mRNA levels slightly reduced and <italic>Dnttip1</italic> mRNA levels more strongly reduced in <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO versus WT mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and E</xref>). However, ELMSAN1 protein levels were severely reduced with no significant effects on HDAC1 or HDAC2 protein levels in <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO versus WT mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Compared to WT mESCs, <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO mESCs showed no significant differences in <italic>Elmsan1</italic>, <italic>Dnttip1</italic>, <italic>Hdac1</italic>, or <italic>Hdac2</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>); at the protein level, HDAC1 and HDAC2 appeared unaltered, but DNTTIP1 levels were significantly lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These results suggest that in mESCs MiDAC becomes destabilized upon loss of its core subunits, DNTTIP1 or ELMSAN1. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of ELMSAN1 in WT and <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO mESCs confirmed the existence of an HDAC1-containing MiDAC complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, consistent with the ELMSAN1 IP in WT and <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO mESCs, IP of DNTTIP1 in WT and <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO mESCs corroborated the presence of an HDAC1-containing MiDAC complex in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). However, we did not observe an interaction between ELMSAN1 and HDAC2 and DNTTIP1 and HDAC2 in mESCs, suggesting that only DNTTIP1, ELMSAN1 and HDAC1 interact to form MiDAC in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MiDAC controls a neurodevelopmental gene expression program</title><p>To determine transcriptional targets of MiDAC, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in WT, <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO and <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO mESCs.

Differential gene expression analysis via RNA-seq revealed 467 downregulated and 306 upregulated genes in <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO versus WT mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The gene expression patterns between <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO and <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO mESCs were highly correlated (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.88) with many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared between <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO and <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Of the DEGs in <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO and <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO mESCs a common set of 114 upregulated and 224 downregulated genes was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Pathway analysis of this MiDAC-regulated gene set revealed an enrichment for axon guidance signaling and neural development related genes among the downregulated category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Similar results were also obtained when DEGs in only <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO or only <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO mESCs were analyzed independently of each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D-G</xref>). Downregulated gene classes were generally associated with promoting neural differentiation (e.g., nervous system, axon guidance and GABAergic neurogenesis), whereas upregulated genes showed enrichment for pathways associated with repression of neuronal development (e.g., antagonists of nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D-G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Importantly, we identified a set of neurodevelopmental genes that is associated with neurogenesis, axon guidance, and neurotransmitter receptor signaling and co-regulated by both ELMSAN1 and DNTTIP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and G</xref>). However, loss of MiDAC function did not affect self-renewal or pluripotency as evaluated by assessing the mRNA levels of the pluripotency factors <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, and <italic>Nanog</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>), nor did it alter the percentage of alkaline phosphatase (AP)-positive colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Furthermore, DNTTIP1 or ELMSAN1 loss in mESCs did not alter the proliferation rate or cell cycle profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D and E</xref>), in contrast to the reported growth-promoting function of DNTTIP1 in oral and non-small cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sawai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).

Together, this suggests that loss of MiDAC function does not impair self-renewal and pluripotency in mESCs and that MiDAC’s role in controlling proliferation and the cell cycle is largely cell type or context-dependent. Rather, our findings indicate that DNTTIP1 and ELMSAN1 regulate a highly similar set of target genes in mESCs and that MiDAC controls a neurodevelopmental gene expression program, including genes that are important regulators of neurite outgrowth and morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MiDAC regulates neurite outgrowth</title><p>To investigate the function of MiDAC in neuronal development, we differentiated mESCs into neuro-ectoderm (NE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2009</xref>). We evaluated WT, <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO and <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO NE after 8 days of differentiation, a time point that corresponds to the initiation of differentiation into neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which is accompanied by increased expression of <italic>nestin</italic> (<italic>Nes</italic>) and <italic>Pax6</italic> as well as increased protein levels of the early NE differentiation markers, PAX6 and MASH1. No significant differences in mRNA and protein levels of the above-mentioned NPC markers were detected between WT and <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO or <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO cells at day 0 or day 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). Moreover, PAX6-positive cells from WT, <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO and <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO NE at day 8 displayed a similar cell cycle profile, indicating no differences in cell cycle distribution in NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These results demonstrate that loss of MiDAC function in mESCs does not affect the initiation of differentiation into the NE lineage. Upon extended differentiation through day 12, many WT cells underwent extensive morphological changes and developed into mature neurons with long neurites while the neurite length of <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO and <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO neurons was substantially shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent with these observations, <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO and <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO neurons showed significantly reduced <italic>Tubb3</italic> and <italic>Map2</italic> mRNA levels (immature and mature neuron marker genes, respectively) compared to WT neurons, suggesting that loss of MiDAC function affects neuronal maturation and/or differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO and <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO neurons also showed a significant decrease in the average neurite length per neuron as well as the total number of neurites per neuron compared to WT neurons as assessed by MAP2 staining at day 12 of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,E,F</xref>).

We next performed qRT-PCR at day 12 for a subset of NE genes involved in neurite outgrowth and morphogenesis. Similar to our findings in mESCs, <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO and <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO NE showed decreased expression of several positive regulators of neuronal development and axon guidance (e.g., <italic>Slit3</italic>, <italic>Ntn1</italic>, <italic>Ncam1</italic>) as well as increased expression of repressors of neuronal development (e.g., <italic>Spry4</italic>, <italic>Id1</italic>, <italic>Pacsin1</italic>) compared to WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

This analysis identified 61,505 DNTTIP1-specific peaks, of which 22% localized within +/- 1 kb of a transcription start site (TSS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The remaining 78% of DNTTIP1 binding sites were located upstream of (24%), downstream of (12%), or within (43%) a gene. Of the 47,657 non-TSS DNTTIP1 peaks, a majority (84%) was found at a distance of &gt;5 kb from the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Interestingly, a significant number of DNTTIP1 binding sites overlapped with the active histone marks H3K4me1 and/or H3K27ac and TSS-associated DNTTIP1 peaks were strongly enriched for the active histone mark H3K4me3 along with H3K27ac and H3K4me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, low DNTTIP1 binding at TSS correlated with increased enrichment of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Non-TSS DNTTIP1 binding sites were enriched for the enhancer marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, hinting at a potential role for DNTTIP1 in enhancer-mediated processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We next correlated our DNTTIP1 ChIP-seq data with gene expression data from <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO mESCs. This analysis revealed that out of 493 downregulated genes in <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO mESCs, 358 genes (73%) were bound by DNTTIP1, while out of 368 upregulated genes in <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO mESCs, 314 genes (85%) were occupied by DNTTIP1 at either their promoters or other gene regulatory regions such as enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Importantly, an even higher proportion of differentially expressed neurodevelopmental genes was also bound by DNTTIP1 (36 out of 39 (92%) in the downregulated and 22 out of 23 (96%) in the upregulated category) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This overlap is highly significant and indicates that the majority of DEGs in <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO mESCs constitute direct targets of DNTTIP1, including important regulators of neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth. Moreover, motif analysis of DNTTIP1 peaks revealed that DNTTIP1 binding sites associated with down- or upregulated genes in <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO mESCs are selectively enriched for transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, including some that have been implicated in neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These TFs include RBFOX2 (associated with genes upregulated in <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO mESCs) and ELK1, a member of the ETS TF family (associated with genes downregulated in <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO mESCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besnard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gehman et al., 2012</xref>). We further assessed the relationship between DNTTIP1 and ELMSAN1 by determining the genome-wide occupancy pattern of DNTTIP1 in <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO mESCs. While no DNTTIP1 binding to chromatin could be detected in <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO mESCs, DNTTIP1 association with chromatin was strongly reduced in the absence of ELMSAN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, some DNTTIP1 enrichment in <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO mESCs could still be observed, suggesting that DNTTIP1 retains the ability to bind to chromatin when ELMSAN1 is depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To study the genome-wide MiDAC binding landscape in mESCs, we compared the occupancy patterns of DNTTIP1 and HDAC1. We found that many DNTTIP1-bound regions (58%) also displayed considerable enrichment for HDAC1, and that 40% of all HDAC1 peaks colocalized with DNTTIP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Considering that HDAC1 also exists within several other complexes, including SIN3, NuRD, and CoREST, this finding suggests that a significant number of HDAC1-occupied loci is bound by MiDAC. Collectively, our findings suggest that MiDAC localizes genome-wide to enhancers and promoters in mESCs, thereby transcriptionally activating or inhibiting neurodevelopmental genes. We next examined activators and repressors of neurite outgrowth more specifically. We investigated SLIT3 and NETRIN1 (NTN1), which are key ligands of the SLIT/ROBO and NETRIN/DCC/UNC signaling pathways, and are regulators of neuron maturation and neurite outgrowth but are also playing roles in angiogenesis, lung morphogenesis, mammary gland development and cancer progression involving processes such as cell migration, cell interaction and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bashaw and Klein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blockus and Chédotal, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lai Wing Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seiradake et al., 2016</xref>).

Furthermore, DNTTIP1 was directly bound to the promoters and putative intra- and intergenic enhancers of <italic>Slit3</italic> and <italic>Ntn1</italic> in mESCs and many of these gene regulatory elements were also co-bound by HDAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Conversely, a repressor of neurite outgrowth and morphogenesis, <italic>sprouty4</italic> (<italic>Spry4</italic>), and an inhibitor of neural differentiation, <italic>Id1</italic>, were both transcriptionally upregulated in mESCs and NE upon loss of DNTTIP1 or ELMSAN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2; </xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alsina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lyden et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nam and Benezra, 2009</xref>).

In summary, these results indicate that MiDAC binds to regulatory regions of activators and repressors of neural differentiation and neurite outgrowth, thereby positively or negatively modulating their transcriptional output, which is in accordance with the phenotypic defects observed in <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO and <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,E,F</xref>). We next sought to identify potential histone substrates of MiDAC by screening for global changes of several histone acetylation marks in WT, <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO, and <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO mESCs. Of the histone acetylation marks tested, only H4K20ac was found to be consistently increased in <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO and <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO mESCs, suggesting that H4K20ac could be a major MiDAC substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Interestingly, H4K20ac has been recently described as a repressive histone acetylation mark, and its targeting by MiDAC might explain why we observed a greater number of downregulated compared to upregulated genes in <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO and <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO mESCs versus WT mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaimori et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>MiDAC binds to and modulates the expression of genes that regulate neural differentiation and neurite outgrowth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pie charts displaying the genome-wide distribution (left) and promoter distal distribution (right) of DNTTIP1 in WT mESCs.

However, we did not observe any effect on cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, or any transcriptional changes in the above-mentioned cell cycle-related genes (<italic>Ccna2</italic>, <italic>Cdkn1a</italic>, <italic>Cdkn1b</italic>) in mESCs with a loss in MiDAC function, arguing in favor of a cell- and/or context-specific role for MiDAC in controlling cell proliferation and the cell cycle.</p><p>The C-terminus of DNTTIP1 has been reported to bind to a specific DNA binding motif following ChIP-seq studies utilizing a FLAG-tagged version of DNTTIP1 in HEK293 cells (motif: TGCAGTG-(14 bp)-CACTGCA flanked by AT-tracts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koiwai et al., 2015</xref>). In concordance with these results, our study confirms a chromatin-associated function and binding of DNTTIP1 to both promoter-proximal and -distal elements in mESCs. Although we did not find evidence of a clear DNTTIP1 consensus binding motif, we did detect a significant enrichment of several TF motifs at DNTTIP1-bound sites (data not shown). This implies that MiDAC is specifically recruited to chromatin by TFs and that its ability to bind nucleosomes might aid in MiDAC spreading from its initial recruitment site to carry out histone deacetylation. Furthermore, motif analysis of differentially expressed genes that display DNTTIP1 enrichment at their promoters or enhancers revealed the binding motifs of several TFs with previously reported roles in neurogenesis. We postulate that MiDAC upregulates a transcriptional program that is driven by ELK1, a member of the ETS family of pioneer transcription factors, while downregulating genes through RBFOX2, which negatively affects neurodevelopmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besnard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gehman et al., 2012</xref>). However, it remains to be determined whether these TFs affect MiDAC recruitment and/or function during neurogenesis. Although DNTTIP1 levels are strongly reduced in <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO mESCs, we still observed some DNTTIP1 recruitment to chromatin. With TRERF1 and ZFP541 (ZNF541 in humans) two ELMSAN1-related proteins have been described that could also potentially be incorporated into MiDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gizard et al., 2001</xref>). While ZFP541 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner during spermatogenesis and not in mESCs, TRERF1 expression can be detected in mESCs (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the remaining DNTTIP1 in <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO mESCs might form an alternative MiDAC complex with the ELMSAN1 paralog TRERF1 which could account for the residually detected DNTTIP1 recruitment in the absence of ELMSAN1.</p><p>HDAC1/2-containing complexes are generally considered repressors of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kadosh and Struhl, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rundlett et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 1996</xref>). However, accumulating evidence suggests that HDAC1/2 might also be involved in transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamaguchi et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, genome-wide studies have shown that HDAC1/2 localize to promoters, gene bodies, and enhancers of actively transcribed genes, thus implicating HDAC1/2 as positive regulators of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Here, our finding that a high percentage of DNTTIP1-bound loci is associated with both down- and upregulated DEGs in <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO versus WT mESCs and NE shows for the first time a direct role for MiDAC in both transcriptional activation and repression. The exact mode of action whereby MiDAC achieves activation or repression has yet to be elucidated in greater detail, but our studies provide evidence for at least two possible scenarios. First, MiDAC could control gene activation and repression by deacetylating histones. Most histone acetylation marks, including H3K27ac, correlate with transcriptional activation, but recently H4K20ac has been reported as a mark that is associated with silenced genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaimori et al., 2016</xref>). Our data indicate that MiDAC might function as a repressor of genes that are marked by H3K27ac and more broadly as an activator on repressed genes by mediating deacetylation of H4K20. However, the relationship between H4K20ac and MiDAC in regulating gene expression is currently only restricted to correlative evidence and it remains to be determined to which degree H4K20ac is instructive in mediating gene repression and whether this mark constitutes a direct substrate of MiDAC. As a second possibility, MiDAC might exert its function by deacetylating TFs or other chromatin-modifying proteins such as histone acetyltransferases (HATs). If specific TFs or HATs are negatively regulated by deacetylation through MiDAC at distinct target sites, this could also potentially explain the increase in H3K27ac (through CBP/p300) or other histone acetylation marks on enhancers and promoters of up- or downregulated genes between WT, <italic>Dnttip1</italic> KO and <italic>Elmsan1</italic> KO mESCs and NE.</p><p>HDAC1 and HDAC2 are important regulators of many developmental processes including neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kelly and Cowley, 2013</xref>). But their function remains enigmatic as they can be recruited into at least four independent HDAC1/2-containing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Millard et al., 2017</xref>). While the HDAC1/2-containing SIN3, NuRD and CoREST complexes have been implicated in neurogenesis, the physiological function of MiDAC has been unexplored to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrés et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knock et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nitarska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we report that MiDAC directly controls a neurodevelopmental gene expression program and specifically targets enhancers and promoters of positive and negative regulators that are involved in neurite outgrowth during neural differentiation. While this study emphasizes the role of MiDAC in neural differentiation and neurite outgrowth, it is evident from our gene expression analyses that this neurodevelopmental gene expression program only constitutes a fraction of the MiDAC-regulated transcriptome in mESCs pointing to other biological roles of MiDAC. SLIT/ROBO, EPHRIN/EPH, NETRIN/DCC/UNC, and SEMAPHORIN/PLEXIN signaling represent the four major canonical axon guidance pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bashaw and Klein, 2010</xref>). Integration of our gene expression and ChIP data showed that MiDAC directly activates the genes of the axon guidance ligands SLIT3 and NTN1 while repressing the genes of the negative regulators SPRY4 and ID1. SLIT3 and NTN1 are ligands for their cognate receptors ROBO3 and UNC5B, respectively. Recombinant SLIT3 and NTN1 either alone or in combination were able to largely rescue the neurite outgrowth defects in neurons that have lost MiDAC subunits. Interestingly, blocking only ROBO3 or only UNC5B signaling was sufficient to inhibit the rescue effects of SLIT3 in combination with NTN1, suggesting that a heteromeric ROBO3/UNC5B axis is required for efficient transduction of SLIT3/NTN1 signaling to ensure proper neurite outgrowth. While evidence exists that heteromeric receptor association and signaling of ROBO3/UNC5B occurs, it has yet to be determined whether this also applies to the role of MiDAC in an in vivo system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zelina et al., 2014</xref>). In summary, while individual TFs have been reported to transcriptionally regulate select axon guidance ligands or receptors little is known about their regulation through chromatin-modifying components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Labrador et al., 2005</xref>). Here, we describe how the axon guidance ligands SLIT3 and NTN1 are transcriptionally controlled by an epigenetic regulator, the MiDAC complex. Finally, neurite outgrowth defects are observed in several neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, epilepsy, fragile X-syndrome and psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gilbert and Man, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang and Song, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krejčí et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wen et al., 2017</xref>). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Our study implicates MiDAC as an essential regulator of neurite outgrowth which suggests that it might be playing an important role in certain neurodevelopmental disorders. Interestingly, a recent study reported noncoding mutations in several MiDAC components among autism patients, thus supporting a potential role for MiDAC in certain neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Future studies of MiDAC in this context are thus likely to yield insightful mechanistic details about disease pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Male C57/BL6 Bruce-4 mESCs were purchased from Millipore (Millipore, SF-CMTI-2).

For histone ChIPs crosslinking was performed at RT for 15 min with 1% paraformaldehyde. Crosslinking was quenched with 150 mM glycine for 5 min at RT. After quenching the cells were pelleted, the supernatant aspirated and the cell pellet washed once in DPBS and then snap-frozen and stored at −80°C or immediately further processed.

Log<sub>2</sub> FPKM gene expression values were applied for bar plot diagrams.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-3"><title>Neurite and neuron analysis</title><p>The neuron-specific markers TUBB3 and MAP2 were used to identify neurons by IF as described under ‘Neural differentiation’. NeuriteTracer, a plugin of ImageJ (version 1.52a), was used to manually trace the length and number of neurites per neuron and to automatically detect nuclei based on DAPI staining using the IF raw image data for each genotype. The length of neurites was determined from 200 neurons for each genotype. The number of neurites per neuron was determined manually for a total of 200 neurons per genotype. The percentage of neurons within the total cell population in NE was calculated manually by determining the number of MAP2-positive neurons in relation to the total number of cells as determined by DAPI staining or alternatively by flow cytometry analysis of TUBB3/DAPI-stained NE cell populations. Neurite length was classified into shorter neurites (&lt;50 µm) and longer neurites (≥50 µm) and the mean length was compared amongst relevant conditions by applying the Student’s t-test. % of neurons = (number of neurons per image as assessed by MAP2 staining/total number of cells per image as assessed by DAPI staining) x 100. For each analysis, experiments were carried out in triplicate. An unpaired Student’s t-test as well as ONE-way ANOVA was performed for each of the treated conditions and compared either to the WT or to their respective controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-4"><title>Statistical analysis of qPCR and qRT-PCR data</title><p>qPCR signals for manual ChIPs were calculated as % of input (% Input) from technical duplicates. Error bars represent the standard deviation from technical duplicates. For qRT-PCR relative gene expression levels were calculated applying the delta-delta Ct method (2<sup>-ΔΔCt</sup>). Error bars depict the standard deviation from technical triplicates. Statistical significance was determined by applying the Student’s unpaired t-test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Public datasets and additional bioinformatics analysis</title><p>HDAC1 ChIP-seq data from WT mESCs was obtained from gene expression omnibus (GEO): GSE55437.

Below in a point by point response we have fully addressed all of the points raised by the reviewers and have also visibly implemented these changes in a revised version of our manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</p><p>The authors show MiDAC is required for the neurodevelopmental programme spanning from neuronal outrgowth to guidance mechanisms. They compare WT, Dnttip1 KO and Elmsan1 KO and they perform a series of RNAseq and CHIPseq studies followed by functional and biochemical assays in differentiating neurons.</p><p>The evidence is strong and the data are well presented and overall convincing</p><p>1) It would be great to see how this mechanism responds to neurotrophin, cross communicates with related epigenetic regulators and if modification of guidance affects neuronal behavior in vivo or in in vitro assays such as stripe assays for example.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer’s suggestion that future studies should include in vitro and in vivo experiments that further analyze additional aspects of MiDAC function in neurogenesis and should also address how MiDAC relates to other epigenetic regulators in this context. As this is the first publication reporting a physiological function for MiDAC, there is lots of potential for follow-up studies. We are particularly interested in MiDAC’s cross-communication with other epigenetic regulators and are actively working on this aspect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be good to make clear the biological replicates use for each RNAseq and CHIPseq experiments in the figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated all relevant figure legends accordingly to indicate which biological replicates from our RNA-seq and ChIP-seq experiments are depicted in the individual figure panels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance):</p><p>The manuscript provides an important advance to both the neuroscience and epigenetics community. I am a neurobiologist working in epiegenetics.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</p><p>Mondal and colleagues present a comprehensive analysis of the biological function of the poorly understood HDAC complex MiDAC. In contrast to the other HDAC1/2 containing complexes (NuRD, SIN3 and CoREST), MiDAC's function is poorly understood. The authors show that in mESCs Midac comprises DNTTIP1, ELMSAN1, TRERF1, ZNF541 and HDAC1 (but not HDAC2). Generation of mESC KO lines revealed that DNTTIP1 and ELMSAN1 are key for the integrity and targeting of MiDAC. Comparing the mESCs and their derived KO lines, the authors show that MiDAC binds promoters and enhancers genome wide and regulates a neurodevelopmental gene expression program. Key targets are identified and functional studies show their importance in neurite outgrowth. Surprisingly, MiDAC has a dualistic function, both activating (through H4K20 deacetylation) and repressing (through H3K27 deacetylation).</p><p>This manuscript describes for the first time a role for MiDAC in regulating neurodevelopment, while finding no evidence for a function in cell cycle control. The comprehensive experiments and data are of excellent quality, convincing and fully support the conclusions of the authors.</p><p>1) I have no demands for extra experiments. However, the authors might want to consider the role of HDAC1. It appears that MiDAC is unique in only harboring HDAC1, rather than both HDAC1 and HDAC2 (as SIN3, NuRD and CoREST). Thus it might be possible to exploit this redundancy in the other HDAc complexes to identify MiDAC-specific functions and targets for HDAC1.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the reviewer’s insightful comment. Indeed, in mouse ES cells a preference exists for HDAC1 to be incorporated into MiDAC (our data). However, other groups have previously shown that in other cell types both HDAC1 and HDAC2 can be incorporated into MiDAC (Bantscheff et al., 2011; Hao et al., 2011). We concur with the reviewer that at least in a cell type-specific context such as mouse ES cells this will open up an interesting avenue to identify MiDAC-specific targets and functions for HDAC1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The proposed direct role for H4K20 deacetylation in transcriptional activation, while interesting, remains somewhat speculative. The Discussion and Abstract should reflect this</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and have now more carefully phrased our proposed role for H4K20 deacetylation in transcriptional activation in the Abstract and Discussion, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors discuss the potential role of MiDAC in human neurodevelopmental disorders. Did they check available databases for MiDAc mutations associated with such disorders?</p></disp-quote><p>While we were not able to find any obvious association of mutations in MiDAC components in autism databases individual noncoding mutations in several MiDAC components have recently been reported in autism patients (Zhou et al., 2019). We now reference this article in the Discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>4) The MIDAC composition in Figure 7 needs to be made more clear. The letting is also very small.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated Figure 7 and the figure legend accordingly to better highlight the composition of MiDAC and increased the letter size for easier readability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The impressive amount of data in this MS at some places reads like a shopping list. Imposing more hierarchy, recaps and conclusions might improve structure and readability.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and have modified the manuscript at select locations to accommodate readability especially as it pertains to recaps and conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance):</p><p>The data are compelling and the findings are of general interest. This work reveals a mechanistic insight into a novel connection between an epigenetic regulator and (neuro)development. This work also generates valuable hypothesis and questions for follow-up research.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
