Infections are typically treated with azole inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis often leading to drug resistance. Studies in clinical isolates have implicated multiple mechanisms in resistance, but have focused on large-scale aberrations or candidate genes, and do not comprehensively chart the genetic basis of adaptation. Here, we leveraged next-generation sequencing to analyze 43 isolates from 11 oral candidiasis patients. We detected newly selected mutations, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy-number variations and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events. LOH events were commonly associated with acquired resistance, and SNPs in 240 genes may be related to host adaptation. Conversely, most aneuploidies were transient and did not correlate with drug resistance. Our analysis also shows that isolates also varied in adherence, filamentation, and virulence. Our work reveals new molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of drug resistance and host adaptation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00662.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00662.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00662.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nearly all humans are infected with the fungus <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. In most people, the infection does not produce any symptoms because their immune system is able to counteract the fungus' attempts to spread around the body. However, if the balance between fungal attack and body defence fails, the fungus is able to spread, which can lead to serious disease that is fatal in 42% of cases.</p><p>How does <italic>C. albicans</italic> outcompete the body's defences to cause disease? This is a pertinent question because the most effective antifungal medicines—including the drug fluconazole—do not kill the fungus; they only stop it from growing. This gives the fungus time to develop resistance to the drug by becoming able to quickly replace the fungal proteins the drug destroys, or to efficiently remove the drug from its cells.</p><p>In this study, Ford et al. studied the changes that occur in the DNA of <italic>C. albicans</italic> over time in patients who are being treated with fluconazole. Ford et al. took 43 samples of <italic>C. albicans</italic> from 11 patients with weakened immune systems. The experiments show that the fungus samples collected early on were more sensitive to the drug than the samples collected later.</p><p>In most cases, the genetic data suggest that the infections begin with a single fungal cell; the cells in the later samples are its offspring. Despite this, there is a lot of genetic variation between samples from the same patient, which indicates that the fungus is under pressure to become more resistant to the drug. There were 240 genes—including those that can alter the surface on the fungus cells to make it better at evading the host immune system—in which small changes occurred over time in three or more patients. Laboratory tests revealed that many of these genes are likely important for the fungus to survive in an animal host in the presence of the drug.</p><p><italic>C. albicans</italic> cells usually have two genetically distinct copies of every gene. Ford et al. found that for some genes—including some that make surface components or are involved in expelling drugs from cells—the loss of genetic information from one copy, so that both copies become identical, is linked to resistance to fluconazole. However, the gain of whole or partial chromosomes—which contain large numbers of genes—is not linked to resistance, but may provide additional genetic material for generating diversity in the yeast population that may help the cells to evolve resistance in the future.</p><p>These experiments have identified many new candidate genes that are important for drug resistance and evading the host immune system, and which could be used to guide the development of new therapeutics to treat these life-threatening infections.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00662.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00662.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Candida albicans</kwd><kwd>drug resistance</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>genomic</kwd><kwd>virulence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Funt</surname><given-names>Jason M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Full investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Regev</surname><given-names>Aviv</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ford</surname><given-names>Christopher B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>8DP1CA174427</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Regev</surname><given-names>Aviv</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2R01CA119176-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Regev</surname><given-names>Aviv</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

As a commensal, an intricate balance is maintained between the ability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to invade host tissues and the host's defense mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim and Sudbery, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumamoto and Pierce, 2011</xref>). Alteration of this delicate host–fungus balance can result in high levels of patient mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pittet et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charles et al., 2003</xref>): systemic <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections are fatal in 42% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wisplinghoff et al., 2003</xref>), despite the use of antifungal therapies, and <italic>C. albicans</italic> is the fourth most common infection in hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gudlaugsson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pappas et al., 2003</xref>). While compromised immune function contributes to pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gow and Hube, 2012</xref>), it is less clear how <italic>C. albicans</italic> evolves to better exploit the host environment during the course of infection.</p><p>Two classes of antifungals in clinical use target ergosterol, a major component of the fungal cell membrane: polyenes and azoles. Polyenes (e.g., Amphotericin B) are used sparingly due to toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rex et al., 1994</xref>), whereas azoles (e.g., fluconazole) are used widely because they can be administered orally and have few side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rex et al., 2003</xref>). However, resistance to the azoles arises within the commensal population of the treated individual, primarily because azoles are fungistatic (inhibit growth but do not kill) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowen et al., 2002</xref>). Epidemiological data suggest that the intensity of fluconazole use is driving the appearance of resistant isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pfaller et al., 1998</xref>). Studies of clinical isolates of <italic>C. albicans</italic> suggest that drug resistance can increase during an infection through the acquisition of aneuploidies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Selmecki et al., 2009</xref>) due to genomic plasticity and rapid evolutionary selection during infection.</p><p>Previous studies have identified two molecular mechanisms of azole resistance in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. First, increased activity or level of the enzymes of the ergosterol pathway (e.g., <italic>ERG11</italic>) reduces direct impact of the drug on its target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oliver et al., 2007</xref>). Second, increased efflux of the drug from cells by ABC transporters (encoded by <italic>CDR1</italic> and <italic>CDR2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coste et al., 2006</xref>) or by the major facilitator superfamily efflux pump (encoded by <italic>MDR1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunkel et al., 2008</xref>) reduces the effective intracellular drug concentration. In both cases, such alterations can result from point mutations in genes encoding these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marichal et al., 1999</xref>), in transcription factors that regulate mRNA expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">MacPherson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coste et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunkel et al., 2008</xref>), or from increased copy number of the relevant genes, via genome rearrangements such as whole chromosome and segmental aneuploidies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Selmecki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2009</xref>). Indeed, the genomes of drug-resistant strains isolated following clinical treatment often exhibit large-scale changes, such as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coste et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunkel and Morschhauser, 2011</xref>), copy-number variation (CNV), including short segmental CNV, and whole chromosome aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Selmecki et al., 2010</xref>) accompanied by point mutations.</p><p>While we understand some aspects of the molecular basis of resistance, we understand less about the mechanisms that drive the evolution of drug resistance and overall pathogenicity in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. It is challenging to use forward genetic approaches in <italic>C. albicans</italic> due to its diploid genome and lack of a complete sexual cycle. Although <italic>C. albicans</italic> has conserved the genomic elements needed for mating, mating occurs instead through rare mating-competent haploids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hickman et al., 2013</xref>) or via a parasexual cycle consisting of mating of diploid strains to form tetraploids followed by chromosome loss to regenerate diploids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett and Johnson, 2005</xref>). An alternative approach is to use isolates sampled consecutively from the same patient to study the changes in the frequency of variants in natural populations under selection for drug resistance. Studies in evolved isolates have implicated multiple mechanisms in drug resistance, but have focused on large-scale aberrations such as aneuploidies and LOH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Selmecki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2009</xref>) or candidate genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perea et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">White et al., 2002</xref>), and do not comprehensively chart the genetic basis of adaptation.</p><p>Here, we used genome sequencing of isolates sampled consecutively from patients that were clinically treated with fluconazole to systematically analyze the genetic dynamics that accompany the appearance of drug resistance during oral candidiasis in human HIV patients. Most isolates from each individual patient were highly related, suggesting a clonal population structure and facilitating the identification of variation. Because each clinical sample was purified from a single colony, we cannot assess the population structure at any single time point. Instead, we have measured the occurrence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), CNV, and LOH events in each isolate and then compared them between isolates from the same patient and across patients' series. Consistent with previous studies, we found that LOH events were recurrent across patients' series and were associated with increased drug resistance. To identify SNPs with likely functional impact in the context of substantial genetic diversity, we focused on those events that were both persistent across isolates within a patient and were recurrent in the same gene across multiple patient series. We found 240 genes that recurrently contain persistent SNPs, many of which may be related not only to antifungal exposure but also to the complex process of adaptation to the host and antifungal exposure. In contrast, aneuploidies were prevalent in the isolates, yet they were more likely to be transient, and aneuploidy, per se, did not correlate with changes in drug resistance. Our work uses comparative analysis of a fungal pathogen to reveal new molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance and host adaptation and provides a general model for such studies in other eukaryotic pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Whole genome sequencing of 43 serial clinical isolates from 11 patients</title><p>To study the in vivo evolution of azole resistance in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, we analyzed 43 longitudinal isolates from 11 HIV-infected patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">White, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perea et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

driver mutations in patient time courses. Shown is a schematic illustration of the genomes of isolates (gray bars) from two patient time courses (Patient A and B, left and right panels, respectively), ordered from the first isolate (progenitor, top) to the last (evolved, bottom). Background mutations (purple) exist in the all isolates; persistent mutations (yellow) are not in the progenitor, but found in all subsequent isolates after their first occurrence; transient mutations (pink) are not in the progenitor and only in some later isolates; recurrently polymorphic genes contain persistent mutations that occur in the same gene in more than one patient (black box). LOH events were also evaluated for persistence (light teal bar). Driver mutations, where a new persistent homozygous allele appears (e.g., G/T &gt; A/A), are annotated in association with persistent LOH events (dark teal) and independent of these events (not shown). Each of these can be associated with a change in phenotype, such as drug resistance (boxes, right). (<bold>B</bold>) Sampling in the context of de novo mutation and selection bottlenecks. Each strain is a single clone (circle) isolated from an evolving population (represented by a phylogenetic tree). The population evolves and undergoes selective sweeps (dashed lines), with phenotypic changes occurring during the course of infection and treatment (i.e., drug resistance, black: high, white: low; gray scale at bottom). Persistent mutations (yellow lightning bolt) have likely swept through the population, whereas transient mutations (pink lightning bolt) have not. (<bold>C</bold>) Sampling in the context of selection on existing variation. Selection acts to vary the frequency of different pre-existing genotypes in the population. Persistent mutations (yellow lightning bolt) have risen in the population to a frequency that they are repeatedly sampled (large circles) whereas transient mutations (pink lightning bolt) have not (small circle).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00662.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00662.004</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00662-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00662.005</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of discordant sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Degree of concordance (Y axis) with Sequenom iPlex genotyping for 1973 SNP X strain combinations overall (leftmost red bar; 93.9%) and in each tested strain (X axis).

all isolates in a series, including the first (‘progenitor’) isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, purple) and use them to determine that isolates within most series were clonally

To distinguish between a single primary (clonal) infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, top) and repeated, independent infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom), we determined the distance between every two isolates based on their SNP profile and used as a heuristic a neighbor-joining algorithm to construct a phylogenetic tree from this distance metric (‘Materials and methods’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Patient 64 contained one <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolate (4018) and one C. <italic>dubliniensis</italic> isolate (4380); therefore, we have excluded this series from further analysis. Additionally, we detected at least one non-clonal <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolate in three of the remaining ten patient series (PT 9,16, 42; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, red), indicating that at least ∼36% of the 11 patients sampled carried more than one unrelated <italic>Candida</italic> strain<italic>.</italic> We removed the four non-clonal samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, red) from further consideration, and all subsequent analyses focused on samples from the 10 patients with at least two clonal isolates.</p><p>Despite these clonal relationships, the distance between isolates indicated significant genetic diversity <italic>within</italic> each patient series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), typically with each isolate differing by several thousand SNPs from its ‘progenitor’ isolate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). These data are consistent with two different evolutionary scenarios: accumulation of de novo mutations followed by selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), or selection acting on pre-existing variation to vary the frequency of different genotypes in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The large number of SNPs detected suggests that isolates from later time points in a series are not simply direct descendants of the earlier isolate; however, since mutation and mitotic recombination rates can be elevated under stressful conditions (e.g., drug treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Galhardo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forche et al., 2011</xref>), we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the variation may be due to de novo events occurring between time points. Formally distinguishing between these two models is not possible with the samples and data at hand. However, the role of pre-existing diversity is supported by the observation that different isolates collected on the same day from the same patient (patient 14 [2440 and 2501] and patient 16 [3107 and 3119]) differed by 9668 and 18,291 SNPs, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) and had very different fluconazole MIC levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and different fitness phenotypes (see below), although in each case the strains were clearly genetically related (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, we conclude that a population of related but divergent genotypes of the same lineage exists within a given patient. We next sought to identify potentially adaptive genetic changes by focusing on large-scale events (LOH and aneuploidies) as well as single-nucleotide polymorphisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Genetic alterations absent from the progenitor isolate, persistent within a patient, and recurrent across patients are likely adaptive</title><p>Given the high number of SNPs, LOH events and aneuploidies, we next devised a strategy to identify those changes that are more likely to play an adaptive role in drug resistance and host adaptation. We previously filtered all <italic>background</italic> polymorphisms, defined as any SNP relative to the reference present in all isolates from a series. Next, we defined alterations as <italic>persistent</italic> if present within the same patient at all subsequent time points after the ‘non-progenitor’ isolate in which they are first identified. We reasoned that such persistent changes will include those variants that were driven to sufficiently high frequency by selection to ensure repeated sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, yellow lightning bolt), whereas non-persistent (transient) ones do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, pink lightning bolt). We consider the special case of a genetic change detected only in the endpoint isolate as ‘persistent’ as well, since several of the time courses consist of only two or three isolates. We apply the persistence filter to better identify potentially adaptive aneuploidies, LOH events, and SNPs.</p><p>Next, we further focused on non-synonymous polymorphisms in coding regions and employed two different strategies to identify potentially adaptive changes. In the first strategy, to identify potential <italic>drivers</italic> of adaptation, we focused on non-synonymous SNPs that were homozygous for a genotype not found in the progenitor strain that persisted in the subsequent isolates (e.g., G/T &gt; A/A) consistent with positive selection. In the second strategy, we analyzed genes that were <italic>recurrently</italic> polymorphic across patients, such that persistent, non-synonymous polymorphisms appeared within the same open reading frame (ORF) in different patient series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 5—source data 1A</xref>). For recurrence, we considered only those that were not included in LOH regions, as these regions artificially inflate the estimates of persistence and recurrence. Recurrence allows us to better handle polymorphisms from the endpoint isolate in a series for which ‘persistence’ does not provide a meaningful filter. Thus, we further considered polymorphisms occurring only in the terminal isolate in one patient if polymorphisms also recurred in the same ORF in a series from two other patients. For example, filtering for both persistence and recurrence across at least three series reduced the number of polymorphisms for patient 1 from 13,562 polymorphisms in 5022 genes to 23 recurrent genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 5—source data 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>LOH events are commonly associated with increased resistance</title><p>LOH events were detected in all of the series and were often persistent, recurrent, and associated with increased drug resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3 and 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). For example, three of four LOH events in Patient 1 were persistent and associated with an increase in MIC and both of these events were recurrent, such that LOH events in these genomic regions coincided with increases in MIC in other patients. Highly recurrent LOH events occurred on the right arm of chromosome 3 (in Patients 1, 9, 14, 16, 42, and 59; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B,D,F,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) and on the left arm of chromosome 5 (in Patients 1, 14, 15, and 43; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). These regions include key genes implicated in drug resistance: on Chromosome 3, genes encoding the Cdr1 and Cdr2 efflux pumps and the Mrr1 transcription factor that regulates the Mdr1 major facilitator superfamily efflux pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schubert et al., 2011</xref>), and on Chromosome 5, genes encoding the drug target Erg11, and Tac1, a transcription factor that positively regulates expression of <italic>CDR1</italic> and <italic>CDR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coste et al., 2006</xref>). The extent of persistence and recurrence of these two LOH events is statistically significant under a naïve binary model (p &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−4</sup> for the Chr3R LOH; p &lt; 0.01 for the Chr5L LOH). The recurrence of LOH events that coincide with changes in MIC suggests that they have been positively selected to rise in frequency relative to the progenitor strain.

In general, increased fitness in vitro (in the absence of drug) correlated with an increase in traits associated with virulence (adhesion, filamentation, and virulence in nematode). For example, the later isolates in the series from patients 30 and 43 had increased fitness and higher virulence by all three measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>); whereas, a decrease in fitness in isolate 13 of patient 1 was accompanied by a decrease in virulence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). A notable exception was patient 59, where fitness in vitro decreased while virulence phenotypes increased in a later isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This is consistent with the observations of Noble and co-workers that in vitro fitness is not always a reflection of virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Noble et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Initially in a series, drug resistance (MIC) and in vitro fitness (in the absence of drug) were inversely related, suggesting that these are competing selective pressures. When MIC increases first appeared, they were usually accompanied by a <italic>decrease</italic> in fitness in the absence of drug (Patient 1, isolates 2, 13, and 16, Patients 9, 14, 15 16, and 59, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Consistent with the elevated MIC, these isolates exhibited <italic>increased</italic> relative fitness in the presence of the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This is also consistent with a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sasse et al., 2012</xref>) showing that resistance conferred in <italic>C. albicans</italic> by gain-of-function mutations in the transcription factors Mrr1, Tac1, and Upc2 is associated with reduced fitness under non-selective conditions in vitro as well as in vivo during colonization of a mammalian host. Consistent with subsequent selection of strains with compensatory variations, isolates from later time points were often more fit than those from earlier time points (measured in vitro<italic>,</italic> in the absence of drug) without further changes in MIC (e.g<italic>.</italic>, patient 1, isolates 5-7, isolate 14, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), with notable exceptions (e.g., isolates 8 and 11). This general trend is consistent with previous studies in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bjorkman and Andersson, 2000</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gagneux et al., 2006</xref>) and in a single documented case in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Singh-Babak et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that compensatory mutations may subsequently arise to offset the major fitness cost of mutations conferring drug resistance. Nevertheless, substantial additional sampling will be required per time point to fully interpret such patterns.</p><p>In this context, it appears that aneuploidies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, green), while largely transient, may be an important intermediate giving rise to more stable adaptive genotypes in some cases, as was recently demonstrated in budding yeast adapting to a stressful environment in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yona et al., 2012</xref>). For example, in Patient 1 isolate 13, an increase in MIC and a trisomy of 5 of 8 chromosomes accompanies a large decrease in fitness (in the absence of drug) relative to the preceding isolate 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) but has increased fitness in the presence of drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Isolate 14 has a similar MIC phenotype to isolate 13 but is euploid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and is much more fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Consistent with the general negative effect of aneuploidy on fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tang and Amon, 2013</xref>), the absence of the extra chromosomes resulted in improved overall fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Candidate mutated genes associated with drug resistance or virulence</title><p>The analysis of clinical isolates identified a range of new candidate genes that may affect drug resistance, fitness, and/or virulence.

Therefore, it is possible that the recurrent non-synonymous coding SNPs in the new loci, we identified in the clinical isolates confer resistance. Alternatively, these loci may not be involved in fluconazole resistance per se and may have a more general role in adaptation to the complex host environment.</p><p>Consistent with a role in host adaptation, 5 of the 22 deletion mutants reduced in vitro fitness in a culture medium thought to approximate in vivo conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’).

This approach allowed us to distinguish (and remove from further analysis) isolates that were non-clonal and to estimate that at least ∼30% of the patients (3/10) carried at least one non-clonal strain of <italic>C. albicans.</italic> We used the clonal isolates to identify persistent SNPs, and the different series to identify those persistent SNPs that recurred within the same ORFs, thereby focusing the analysis on a small number of loci where the identified variants are more likely to be adaptive and excluding the substantial background of likely neutral variation that hitchhike along with selective beneficial mutations.</p><p>Our study identified substantial genetic diversity in each series, in contrast to the report of only 26 SNPs detected in a single clinical series of <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> isolates that spanned a 10-month period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Singh-Babak et al., 2012</xref>). Several reasons may account for this difference. First, fluconazole, the antifungal drug used to treat the patients in our series, is fungistatic, such that many cells exposed to the drug arrest their growth but do not die. Thus, the range of diversity in the initial population is not entirely lost. In contrast, the <italic>C. glabrata</italic> study involved exposure to caspofungin, an echinocandin fungicidal drug. Therefore, most cells likely died upon drug exposure and only the rare survivors went on to seed the remaining population. Accordingly, the <italic>C. glabrata</italic> isolates may have been subjected to selection that would have removed much of the initial diversity in the population, whereas in the <italic>C. albicans</italic> series diversity persisted and selection acted mostly to change the relative proportions of different genotypes. Second, <italic>C. albicans</italic> is a highly heterozygous diploid whereas <italic>C. glabrata</italic> is haploid. Mutations can be more readily assimilated in a diploid than in a haploid organism, since deleterious mutations are potentially buffered by a functional version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, because <italic>C. albicans</italic> genomes are initially much more diverse (with tens of thousands of heterozygous SNPs in a given isolate), LOH is a high frequency mechanism available to reveal mutations more readily. Third, <italic>C. albicans</italic> lab isolates likely undergo a stress-induced elevation of mutation and mitotic recombination rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ponder et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rosenberg, 2011</xref>), and exposure to a mammalian host results in elevated frequencies of LOH and aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Forche et al. 2009</xref>). Thus, it is possible that <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolates within the human host also undergo elevated levels of LOH and of point mutations to generate a wider range of diversity. Thus, <italic>C. albicans</italic> like <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gresham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yona et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2013</xref>) generates large scale genetic variation as a means of adaptation. This adds another level of variation to the genome and protein diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Santos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Selmecki et al., 2010</xref>) that <italic>C. albicans</italic> is able to tolerate.</p><p>LOH in several genes important for fluconazole resistance has been reported previously for <italic>ERG11</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oliver et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>TAC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coste et al., 2006</xref>), and <italic>MRR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schubert et al., 2011</xref>), but the degree to which LOH is important in clinical infections was not known. In the ten patients studied here, LOH was commonly observed and was associated with changes in MIC. As we detected LOH of mutations in <italic>ERG11</italic> in three patients, it would be of interest to know if the LOH in these known genes was sufficient to increase MIC, or if other genes within the homozygous region make important contributions.</p><p>Aneuploidies appeared frequently within the drug-resistant isolates, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Selmecki et al., 2006</xref>). Unlike LOH events, aneuploidies were often transient and not consistently correlated to increases in drug resistance. Perhaps these aneuploidies provide a mechanism akin to genetic assimilation (‘phenotype precedes genotype’), in which cells are provided with a phenotypic mechanism that facilitates survival until a more stable and/or less costly mechanism is attained. In this case, the ‘phenotypic’ mechanism would be genetic but unstable—the acquisition of one or more extra chromosomes. Nevertheless, aneuploidies may cause increased frequencies of LOH events through whole chromosome loss, as well as by increasing the likelihood of recombination events. A transient role for aneuploidy is consistent with recent findings from in vitro evolution studies in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yona et al., 2012</xref>) in which a transient aneuploidy was responsible for fitness at elevated temperature, but was eventually replaced by a more stable mutation.</p><p>In addition, a substantial number of persistent and recurrent SNPs, and clusters of co-occurring SNPs, implicate a broad range of pathways and functions that likely provide some growth advantage in the presence of the complex selective pressures found in the host. In particular, there was strong enrichment for cell wall gene families thought to be critical determinants of the transition from commensalism to pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gow and Hube, 2012</xref>). The genes in several of these families (e.g., <italic>ALS1</italic>-<italic>4</italic>,<italic>7</italic>,<italic>9</italic> and <italic>HYR</italic>/<italic>IFF</italic> genes) frequently contain intragenic tandem repeats. Variation in intragenic repeat number modulates phenotypic diversity in adhesion and biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Verstrepen et al., 2005</xref>). This functional diversity of cell surface antigens has been proposed to allow rapid adaptation to the environment as well as evasion of the host immune system in fungi and other pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gemayel et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, the cell wall deletion mutants (<italic>HYR1</italic>, <italic>HYR3,</italic> and <italic>PIR1</italic>) were among the least fit in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, many of the isolates evolved additional phenotypes, including changes in in vitro fitness, filamentation, adhesion, and in vivo virulence, and the data presented here points to candidate genes that underlie some of these evolved traits. For example, the evolved isolate 4617 in patient 59 had a dramatic increase in filamentation relative to the progenitor, which was concomitant with the appearance of persistent SNPs in genes associated with filamentous growth: <italic>CHO1</italic>, <italic>MNN2,</italic> and 7 different <italic>FGR</italic> (filamentous growth regulator) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Uhl et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The evolution of drug resistance in <italic>C. albicans</italic> has many parallels with the somatic evolution of cancer cells undergoing chemotherapy or treated with specific inhibitors. These include variation on a background of clonal descent, lack of sexual recombination, acquisition of drug resistance, tolerance of aneuploidy and genome plasticity, and increased mutation and mitotic recombination rates under stress. Indeed, several recent studies have shown a similar spectrum of genetic alterations to those observed here during the somatic evolution of cancers in patients undergoing chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Podlaha et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Landau et al., 2013</xref>) or treated with specific inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 2012</xref>) to those observed here.</p><p>Finally, our data and analyses provide a rich and novel resource for <italic>Candida</italic> researchers and a host of candidate genes for further functional studies. While our analysis focused on recurrent SNPs in ORFs, we nonetheless cataloged the many genetic alterations found in intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), some of which could affect gene regulation. It will be especially interesting to analyze the similarities and differences in additional <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome sequences that are likely to become available in the near future. Our results suggest there may be complex population dynamics during the transition from commensal to pathogen and across the course of treatment. As sequencing capacity continues to grow, it will be especially interesting to more fully sample this population-level diversity during longitudinal collection to better understand these dynamics. In particular, it will be interesting to determine the degree to which specific mutations recur in different isolates prior to and after the acquisition of drug resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Isolates</title><p>Isolates were obtained from HIV-infected patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">White, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perea et al., 2001</xref>).

To minimize false positive SNP calls near insertion/deletion (indel) events, poorly aligning regions were identified and realigned using the GATK RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner (GATK version 1.4-14, [version 1.4-14]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>). Coverage for each strain is reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Coverage was defined as the total number of bases with BWA mapping quality greater than 10 divided by the total number of sites in the nuclear genome. Isolate 4380 aligned poorly to the SC5314 genome; however, this sequence aligned at high identity to the <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> genome and was therefore removed from further analysis. These data can be accessed from a genomics portal hosted by the Broad Institute at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/pubs/candidadrugresistance/">http://www.broadinstitute.org/pubs/candidadrugresistance/</ext-link>. Reads are deposited for access to the NCBI SRA under project accession number PRJNA257929.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>SNP calling</title><p>SNPs were identified using Unified Genotyper (GATK version 1.4.14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>), using read alignments to the SC5314 reference sequence. Unreliable SNPs were identified using the GATK Variant Filtration module, with the version 3 best practice recommended annotation filters (QD &lt; 2.0, MQ &lt; 40.0, FS &gt; 60.0, HaplotypeScore &gt;13.0, MQRankSum &lt; −12.5, ReadPosRankSum &lt; −8.0) except that the HaplotypeScore was also filtered if greater than two standard deviations above the mean of all HaplotypeScore values. The combined list of SNP positions across all strains was used to evaluate those matching the reference allele; by emitting all sites using Unified Genotyper, high quality reference matches were identified as positions with quality of 30 or greater, with positions with extremes of read depth (top or bottom 0.5% quantile) eliminated. A matrix of all strains by all positions was created from the SNP calls, with reference calls added where identified. Non-clonal isolates (see below) were removed from further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Sequenom iPLEX genotyping assay</title><p>We chose 1973 genetic locus X strain combination (523 unique sites across nine patients) for iPLEX genotyping as either (1) persistent within their time course (605 sites), (2) background mutations (1263 sites), or (3) transient mutations (105 sites). All selected loci were at least 150 bp away from any other SNP in either direction to avoid ambigious iPlex calls. Sites producing multiple iPlex results were eliminated from further consideration. 1,853 predictions were confirmed as correct by Sequenom genotyping and 120 were discordant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), to a calling accuracy of 93.9%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Determination of relatedness to determine clonality</title><p>We investigated the phylogenetic relationship of all strains using SNP calls to determine relatedness between strains; positions with missing data in 10% or more of strains were eliminated, resulting in a total of 201,793 parsimony informative positions. A distance based tree was estimated using maximum parsimony with PAUP* (4.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Swofford, 2002</xref>); a step matrix was used to estimate the distance between homozygous and heterozygous positions, where each of the homozygotes is two steps apart from each other and one step from the heterozygote. SNP positions were resampled using 1000 bootstrap replicates, and the phylogeny re-estimated to test the branch support. We define isolates with a branch distance of greater than 20,000 as non-clonal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Copy-number determination</title><p>For each strain, we calculated a per-locus depth-of-coverage using GATK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>), with a minimal mapping quality of 10. The number of reads aligning to each 5 kb window across the nuclear genome was calculated and then normalized to the genome median. Each bin was then multiplied to the ploidy for the majority of the genome as determined by a FACS assay (below). We then applied a sliding window across each bin, defining a potential CNV if 70% of 10 consecutive bins had a normalized count &gt;2.5×. Regional amplifications are identified if &gt;15% of the chromosome is identified as having a CNV. Boundaries were confirmed by visual inspection in the Integrative Genome Viewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>High-resolution ploidy analysis by flow cytometry</title><p><italic>C. albicans</italic> cultures were grown to log phase. 200 μl of culture was centrifuged in a round bottom microtiter plate, and pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of 50 mM Tris pH8/50 mM EDTA (50/50 TE). 180 μl of 95% ethanol was added and suspensions were stored overnight at 4°C. Cells were centrifuged and pellets washed twice with 200 μl of 50/50 TE, then resuspended in 50 μl of RNAse A at 1 mg/ml in 50/50 TE and incubated 1 hr at 37°C. Cells were centrifuged and pellets resuspended in 50 μl of Proteinase K at 5 mg/ml in 50/50 TE for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were washed in 50/50 TE and pellets resuspended in 50 μl of a 1:85 dilution SYBR Green I (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in 50/50 TE and incubated overnight in the dark at 4°C. Cells were centrifuged and pellets were resuspended in 700 μl 50/50 TE and read on a FACS caliber flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Flow data were fitted with a multi-Gaussian cell cycle model to produce estimates for whole genome ploidy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>LOH determination</title><p>For each time course, we assembled the high quality SNPs (post-filtering, above) from multi-sample calling into the columns of a matrix, ordered by genome position, with the isolates in rows, ordered temporally. The genetic state of each locus in each sample was coded to distinguish loci homozygous for the haploid reference (−1), heterozygous SNPs (0), and homozygous SNPs for the non-reference state (1). We then applied a sliding window method across each chromosome, only looking at sites in which a SNP call was made in at least one isolate. An LOH event was defined as occurring if (1) at least one isolate had a heterozygosity content &gt;40%, and (2) at least one other isolate had a heterozygosity content &lt;5%. Window sizes were of length 500. Boundaries were trimmed such that if a window terminated in a heterozygous site in the isolate for which the LOH occurred, it was trimmed back until it was homozygous. If two 500+ windows were within 7 KB of each, the region was assessed to determine if the event was actually one event and merged if the heterozygous sites in the inter-window space had homozygosed. If two isolates had LOHs that overlapped but did not have precisely identical boundaries, the LOH regions were combined such that the LOH interval for both isolates was the same. All LOH regions were confirmed by visual inspection and are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Classification of SNPs</title><p>For each time course, each SNP was classified for its position in the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). If the SNP fell within an ORF, the reference and altered amino acids were reported. If the SNP fell outside of an ORF, the distance to the closest flanking ORF(s) was reported, as well as the SNP's orientation with respect to these ORFs. SNP genotypes that are common to all isolates (including the ‘progenitor’) were classified as background mutations. Genotypes not present in the progenitor or evolved strain, but that occur in one or more intermediate strain, are classified as transient. Finally, genotypes that occur after the progenitor, and persist through the terminally evolved time point, are classified as persistent.</p><p>To determine if the number of persistent non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) occurring in conjunction with changes in MIC was greater than expected, we developed a simple model to simulate the occurrence of nsSNPs outside of LOH regions at each time point.

We generated for each such gene a binary patient vector, and we used NMF clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunet et al., 2004</xref>) to identify the optimal number of clusters, based on local maximas. This was accomplished using the ‘NMFConsensus’ module (version 5) in GenePattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reich et al., 2006</xref>). To determine the most appropriate number of clusters, k was selected such that it was the smallest value for which the cophenetic correlation begins decreasing. We then tested each of the co-occurrence gene clusters for functional enrichment (below). To determine if the degree of co-occurrence would have arisen by chance, we ran 1000 iterations of 1 million edge-pair swaps from the original binary matrix, calculating a Pearson correlation matrix for each of the 1000 iterations. We compared the distribution of Pearson correlations on the real and permuted vectors using a two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test and Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Functional enrichment</title><p>We calculated the overlap of each co-occurring cluster with Gene Ontology gene sets using the Gene Ontology toolset from the Candida Genome Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnaud et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Inglis et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2013</xref>).

Isolates stored at −80°C were revived on rich media petri plates and then grown overnight in 3-ml cultures of minimal media in a roller drum at 35°C. An aliquot of cells in each culture was removed, sonicated in a Branson 450 sonifier, and the concentration of cells was determined using a Cellometer M10 (Nexcelom, Lawrence, MA). The reference strain and experimental competitors were added to fresh RPMI medium in a 1:1 ratio and a final cell concentration of 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml. The cultures were grown for 24 hr in a roller drum at 35°C. Cells were then counted as above, and 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were transferred to fresh RPMI medium grown for 24 hr in a roller drum at 35°C (transfer cycle 1). This procedure was repeated (transfer cycle 2). This protocol represents 5–10 generations of growth, depending on the strain genotype. The ratio of the two competitors was quantified at the initial and final time points by flow cytometry (Accuri, San Jose, CA). 3 to 6 independent replicates for each fitness measurement were performed.

This strain was chosen since it was a euploid strain with the highest MIC. There were two strains from patient 42 (3731 and 3733) with a higher MIC but these strains are aneuploid and thus the potential loss of additional chromosomes during the course of the competition could alter fitness and confound our results. The addition of the YFP marker reduced the fitness of the strain relative to the unaltered one and slightly reduced the fluconazole MIC as measured by the E-strip test.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.

There is very little statistical modeling to assess how likely these combinations of certain mutational patterns are due to real selective events due to specific phenotypic consequences or just by chance.

However, the data suggest that the variants that distinguish <italic>C. albicans</italic> genomes at different time points did not arise during the sampling window but were largely, maybe entirely, pre-existing (standing variation). This view is based on: (i) the very considerable genetic diversity (thousands of SNP differences) between isolates of the same strain within the same host, sampled less than a few months apart, in one case on the same day; (ii) the implausible mutation rate that would be needed to explain this variation as newly arising by mutation; and, (iii) the lack of analysis demonstrating that the data shows any signal of “measurable evolution”.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00662.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank the reviewers’ for their thoughtful comments, which we addressed in full in the revised manuscript. We first highlight the key aspects of the revision and then address each point in the response below. We realize that this re-submission has been delayed: as we explain below this is due to our decision to re-sequence all strains to substantially greater depth to ensure the reproducibility and validity of our results. This was critical as this is a resource intended for the wider community.</p><p>1) Extensive deeper sequencing of each strain shows high concordance in genotype calls: the reviewers pointed out that there was a lower than desired agreement between our Sequenome iPLEX assay genotyping and the corresponding base calls from our sequencing data (87% in the original study on average per patient, 77% averaged over all samples with some strains near 100% and others much lower; new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–supplement 1A</xref> in red). The reviewer raised the possibility of a sample switching. We first ruled out the possibility of a sample switch by repeating our genotyping from newly isolated DNA, but many of the discrepancies remained. We then examined the discordant calls and found that those were typically related with lower sequence coverage. Although our initial analysis used best practices at the time of original data collection, in some regions of lower sequencing coverage our GATK pipeline defaulted to the genotype of the provided reference genome, resulting in erroneous SNP calls when comparing between strains. Because our strains are also a resource used widely by the community, we decided to re-sequence all the strains to high coverage (53-283X, an average of 103X); this was not feasible when our data was initially collected, but major increases in sequencing yields made it readily possible now. The new sequencing data resolved the discrepancies, such that concordance between Sequenom iPlex and Illumina data reached 94% across all patients (see also the response to the issue 3 below; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A</xref> in blue). All the key results and conclusions that we originally reported were all reproduced in this deeper analysis.</p><p>2) The new data has added many new interesting genes to our list of those most likely to have adaptive polymorphisms. Our repeated sequencing revealed 4,756 persistent SNPs across all isolates and 240 recurrent genes. While previous clustering analysis of persistent and recurrent SNPs failed to produce significant functional enrichments, clustering of the recurrence matrix of our new data reveals significant functional enrichment in four clusters (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Additionally, of the 240 recurrent genes identified, 23 were available as deletion library mutants (up from five previously), and we evaluated them for phenotypic differences (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These new data significantly extend our previous manuscript, and have allowed us to make additional conclusions regarding drug resistance and adaptation to the host environment.</p><p>3) We have clarified the two possible evolutionary scenarios—de novo mutation and selection or selection on largely pre-existing variation. We now clearly note that, although the data favors selection of pre-existing variation as the predominant mode, we cannot rule out that some of the observed variation was due to de novo events that occurred in the sampling window.</p><p>4) We have provided statistical modeling where possible, including stochastic simulations to model the occurrence of (1) persistent non synonymous SNP-containing ORFs associated with changes in MIC, and (2) the expected degree of recurrence amongst these ORFs.</p><p>5) We have heeded the reviewers’ suggestion to expand our description and interpretation of the validation experiments with the available deletion mutants for recurrent loci; as the number of recurrent loci grew, we now tested 23 deletion mutants, three of which were significantly more fit than the parental strain (SN250) as determined by growth in standard tissue culture media (RPMI).</p><p>6) We assessed the rate and time scale of evolution by applying Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees (BEAST) in the one patient series with a sufficient density of longitudinal samples and have included that analysis.</p><p>7) We addressed all other comments, including clarification of our use of the word “clonal” as detailed in the point-by-point response below.</p><p>Response to specific comments:</p><p><italic>The manuscript by Funt and colleagues provide an in-depth analysis of whole genome sequence of</italic> C. albicans <italic>progressively in HIV patients to infer selective events and describe patterns of mutations, and those that survive and likely have an impact on resistance.

The experimental and sequence analysis methodologies seem to be state of the art</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for these comments. As we note below, realizing that the data set could serve as a gold standard (and indeed is being used by several labs already), we decided to leverage the advances in sequencing yields, to generate much deeper sequencing and better analysis. Below we address each of the concerns raised.</p><p><italic>1) One major concern arises from consideration of all sections of the manuscript. There is very little statistical modeling to assess how likely these combinations of certain mutational patterns are due to real selective events due to specific phenotypic consequences or just by chance. Most of the manuscript is presented in this style, and it is hard to know which signals are truly significant. We provide two of the many examples in the manuscript to illustrate this point</italic>:</p><p><italic>In the Results section, the authors state: “We consider… two to three isolates”. While this is a reasonable argument, without proper statistics it is not possible to evaluate it.

We appreciate the suggestion for linkage or LD analysis, however it is important to emphasize that linkage/LD, by their very nature, are a function of mating and meiosis; and while mating can be engineered in the laboratory, meiosis has never been observed in <italic>C. albicans.</italic> Instead, <italic>C. albicans</italic> is thought to proliferate primarily by asexual reproduction and thought to only rarely undergo a cryptic, parasexual lifestyle in which two diploid individuals fuse into a tetraploid, and followed by chromosome loss in subsequent mitotic divisions to a converge on diploidy. This feature of <italic>C. albicans</italic> biology is a major limitation to genetic dissection of <italic>C. albicans</italic> population genetics either in the lab or in natural settings, and is important to bear in mind when considering our work.</p><p>It is for this reason that we think that those mutations that are simultaneously concomitant with increases in drug resistance and that are also recurrent are likely a footprint of selection (regardless of whether all were selected from existing diversity within the population, all arose de novo, or perhaps, a combination thereof). Without a substantially increased number of samples and non-treated human-passaged <italic>C. albicans</italic> longitudinal isolates, it is infeasible to adequately model this system for particular point mutations and genes affected. Furthermore, our samples were archived over decades, by clinicians who have typically archived only a single clone (sampled from what is likely a complex heterogeneous population). Our assessment of the larger gene sizes for those genes with recurrence in the original manuscript was an open acknowledgement of the possible contribution of random mutations to our results.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have now more clearly described the inherent challenges of this system and the limitations of our analysis, and we have attempted to clarify its statistical basis wherever possible. First, we now highlight these challenges early in the manuscript, clearly acknowledging the inherent limitations at deriving direct statistical significance driven by a model of the underlying phenomena. Second, whenever possible, we articulate the statistical basis for our analyses. For example, consider the LOH presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3 and 4</xref>. There are 30 LOH events, if we limit LOH events to chromosomes arms (of which they occur on 15 out of 16 possible chromosome arms). Of these 30 LOHs, 23 meet our standard for persistence. The right arm of chromosome 3 has a persistent LOH 7 times. If we assume a naïve binary distribution, then the probability of this occurring is less than<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mn>23</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mn>7</mml:mn></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>15</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mn>7</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>14</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>15</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>16</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> = 4.76 × 10<sup>-4</sup>. The same calculation applies to the left of arm 5 (Chr5L), but with 5 LOH events for a probability of 0.0128. Unlike chromosome 3, Chr5L is known to be a functionally significant LOH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coste et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Selmecki et. al, 2006</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2008</xref>). We have added this analysis to the text.</p><p>Furthermore, we now use stochastic simulations to generate null distributions of: (1) the expected number of persistent non-synonymous SNP-containing ORFs associated with changes in MIC; and (2) the degree of recurrence amongst these ORFs. These models (described in the revised Methods) suggest that the number of observed cases of each of (1) and (2) is significantly larger than expected by chance (p&lt;0.0001). The distributions are shown in Author response image 1 below, and the results are reported in the revised text.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Null distributions of (a) the expected number of persistent, recurrent non synonymous SNPs outside of LOH regions, and (b) persistent non-synonymous SNPs associated with MIC changes outside of LOH regions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00662-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) The last part of the Results describes some validation experiments where the specific mutations are brought to an experimental setting with deletion mutants. This is an experiment that was necessary but surprisingly it was not given the proper weight (it was only a small fraction of the total text), plus it was not as conclusive as one would like regarding the MIC phenotype</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to further emphasize these results . The diploid genome and lack of a complete sexual cycle make genetic manipulation of <italic>C. albicans</italic> challenging. Therefore, we relied on an existing resource of available homozygous deletion mutants from a deletion strain collection of 674 loci to gain insight into the contribution of these loci to drug resistance and fitness. In the original manuscript, we tested all those loci recurrently mutated by our original analysis for which a deletion mutant was available.</p><p>Following our deeper sequencing, we could reliably detect a larger number of recurrently mutated loci, and hence could test 23 deletion strains (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In this expanded panel of tests, consistent with a role in host adaptation, 8 out of 23 mutants affected in vitro fitness in a culture medium thought to approximate in vivo conditions. Strikingly, three mutants show an increased level of fitness relative to the WT parental isolate, SN250. We have clarified the text to convey this point. The results reported in the original submission were from fitness experiments conducted using the drug-resistant reference strain (also used in the fitness experiments illustrated in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In principle, any reference strain can be used in relative fitness experiments. However, in this revision we used the <italic>same</italic> reference strain to quantify the fitness of the clinical isolates and the deletion mutants, such that that results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> can be readily comparable by the reader.</p><p><italic>3) Considering the central role in the paper of the various classes of mutations called from the sequencing reads, I think that one technical issue in particular deserves further exploration and/or discussion. The SNP calling accuracy was found to be 87.3% on average (using a Sequenome iPLEX genotyping assay; Results, “Sequenome iPLEX genotyping assay”, and</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"><italic>Table 2</italic></xref><italic>).

Could this be due to intra-patient diversity, with different</italic> Candida <italic>subpopulations being sampled for the two assays? Is there any other potential explanation? If not, these inconsistencies should be listed as an important limitation of the study.</italic></p><p>The same genomic DNA from a single archived clone was used for both the original sequencing and the Sequenom assay. We were originally concerned that a switching in samples was the cause of the discrepancy, but repeated genotyping and re-examination of the Sequenome iPLEX versus the sequencing data suggested that when sequence coverage was relatively low, our GATK pipeline defaulted to the genotype of the provided reference genome resulting in erroneous SNPs calls across isolates in the same time course. Given that the extensive sequence data set is a major strength of our study, and with the substantial increase in sequencing yields since the time when we originally sequenced these isolates, we chose to re-sequence all the strains to high coverage (53-283X, average depth of coverage: 103X).</p><p>The new sequencing data resolved the discordance between the Sequenom and sequencing genotype calls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) such that our average concordance rose to 94% (85%-98%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A</xref>). To further understand the nature of our discordant sites, and importantly, determine if improved filtering of the SNP calls could improve concordance, we examined the discordant sites for any potential base bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). From this analysis, it is apparent that the majority of discordant sites are those that are identified as homozygous by Sequenom iPlex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B</xref>, teal bars), but as heterozygous by Illumina sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B</xref>, orange bars). We compared several quality metrics for these sites in our Illumina data for discordant vs. concordant sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C-G</xref>: depth of coverage (DP), mapping quality (MQ), PHRED scaled quality scores (QUAL), the QD score (confidence of a variant call), and the ratio of alternative allele to reference allele (AB)). We found that while the distributions of some quality scores for discordant sites are somewhat lower, the degree of overlap is so extensive that any improvement in specificity will come at a substantial sensitivity cost. Given that the discordance rate is already low, and that we focus on SNPs that both persist within a series and recur across series (and are thus called many independent times), we opted not to use any stricter thresholds for SNP calling. We present this comparison in the revised text, in the Results section.</p><p>Importantly, all previous conclusions were reproduced in this enhanced analysis, and we were able to draw additional conclusions based on these higher quality data. For example, the new set of 240 mutated genes is now enriched for several functions known to influence pathogenicity, including fungal-type cell wall (18 genes, p&lt;0.0012) and cell surface genes (24 genes, p&lt;0.00012), with several members in each of three cell wall gene families important for biofilm formation and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoyer et al., 2008</xref>): the Hyr/Iff proteins (HYR1 and 3, IFF8 and 6), the ALS adhesins (ALS1-4,7,9), and the PGA-30-like proteins (7 genes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 5–source data 1</xref>). All three families are specifically expanded in the genomes of pathogenic <italic>Candida</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, seven members of the FGR gene family, involved in filamentous growth that is specifically expanded in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler et al., 2009</xref>), are also among the 240 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 5–source data 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) The paper is presented as a study of the within-host mutations that occur and are selected for in the</italic> Candida albicans <italic>genome between longitudinally sampled genomes before and after the introduction of antibiotic treatment. However, the data suggest that the variants that distinguish</italic> C. albicans <italic>genomes at different time points did not arise during the sampling window but were largely, maybe entirely, pre-existing (standing variation). This view is based on: (i) the very considerable genetic diversity (thousands of SNP differences) between isolates of the same strain within the same host, sampled less than a few months apart, in one case on the same day; (ii) the implausible mutation rate that would be needed to explain this variation as newly arising by mutation; and, (iii) the lack of analysis demonstrating that the data shows any signal of “measurable evolution”.</italic></p><p>We completely agree with the reviewers that, given the evidence of considerable genetic diversity existing in the same host, selection may primarily be driving an increase in the frequency of variants that already existed in the population. We have revised the text throughout the manuscript to clarify this point (especially in the Introduction and Results sections). Nevertheless, there is also ample evidence that mutation rates are increased under stressful conditions (e.g., drug treatment) in many systems, including yeasts, akin to what occurs in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Galhardo et al., 2007</xref>). Mitotic recombination events that give rise to LOH occur at a much higher rate (3 x 10<sup>-5</sup>) than single-nucleotide mutation rates and are also increased by stress. Specifically relevant here, LOH rates are elevated in <italic>C. albicans</italic> treated with fluconazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forche et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that some genetic changes, including LOH events, occurred de novo during the treatment and sampling window. We discuss this point in the revised manuscript, in the Discussion.</p><p>Importantly, we are unable to distinguish pre-existing from de novo events with the data in hand. The rate of collection and number of samples we have for the majority of patients likely does not constitute a dataset that can be analyzed by existing approaches to ‘measurably evolving population’ (MEP, as per Drummond et al., 2003), and we do not want to overstate our evolutionary scenario. However, even if, as the reviewers suggest, <italic>“all ‘persistent mutations’ are those pre-existing variants driven to sufficiently high frequency by selection to ensure repeated sampling, whereas transiently observed variants are not”,</italic> this scenario is still an evolutionary process, involving heritable variation and selection, and can still inform our functional understanding of host-pathogen interactions.</p><p>With these limitations in mind, we were intrigued by the reviewers’ suggestion to assess the rate and time scale of evolution in these strains. While the majority of our patient series represent only a few sequentially isolated clonal samples, Patient 1’s series consists of 16 clonal, sequential isolates sampled over a period of nearly two years, and thus these samples can be analyzed for evidence of measurable evolution. We have used a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte-Carlo approach (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees, BEAST; Drummond et al., 2012) to assess the rate of mutation in these populations and the likely time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA).</p><p>To test the hypothesis that the majority of mutations occurred before the sampling period, we sampled trees generated using a set of parameters based on available data. Because there are no estimates of the per-basepair, per-generation mutation rate in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, we began with the assumption that <italic>C. albicans</italic> mutates at a rate similar to the per-base pair, per-generation rate of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Lynch et al., 2008). We then adjusted this rate to a per-day rate based on the generation time observed for C<italic>. albicans</italic> in a mouse model (1.56 generations per day, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Forche et al, 2009</xref>), and determined the TMRCA for the isolates from Patient 1. Based on these assumptions, the TMRCA for these 16 isolates is ∼ 235 years (Author response image 2A). Indeed, using these parameters, many of the nodes separating two isolates are dated to be ∼150 years in the past. While little is known of the genetic diversity present <italic>in C. albicans</italic> populations at the time of colonization, it seems unlikely that the most recent common ancestor for the clonal population seen in Patient 1 evolved 235 years prior to isolation: if colonization occurs primarily during birth, it would mean that much of the diversity present in this patient actually evolved in the patient’s grandmother, or great grandmother.</p><p>To better understand the diversity present in the population, we repeated this analysis, but with a broader estimate of mutation rate (for the prior, the same mean as above, 5.5 x 10<sup>-10</sup> mutations/bp/day, but with a larger standard deviation), resulting in a 5 to 55 fold increase in the estimated substitution rate, and a corresponding reduction in the likely TMRCA (Author response image 2B,C). To determine which of these three models best fit the data, we performed a pairwise calculation of Bayes factors (Author response image 2D), and we find that model (C), with an estimated substitution rate of 8.48 x 10<sup>-8</sup> best approximates our data. These results are consistent with the reviewer’s comment that considerable variation developed before the onset of treatment and sampling; however, they also suggest that a substantial portion of the observed variation occurred during the treatment period in Patient 1. Importantly, they also suggest that an elevated mutation rate likely explains some of the diversity we observe, consistent with previous observations of in vivo hypermutability during infection and treatment (Oliver et al, Science 2000, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Galhardo et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forche et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>The results of three separate MCMC analyses based on differing priors for mutation rate are shown. This analysis is based only on SNPs from isolates of Patient 1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00662-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>Further work is necessary to determine: (1) the extent of population diversity at any given time point, (2) the extent of the bottlenecks during colonization and drug treatment, and (3) the impact of the host immune response and antifungal therapy on the mutation rate <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. In light of these issues—which are relevant to a variety of pathogens—this analysis is particularly provocative. However, as many of the parameters necessary to make these estimates are poorly informed and our sampling limits the analysis to only one patient series, we do not feel this analysis merits inclusion in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
