By analyzing intracranial electrode data from humans, we demonstrate for the first time that there are prominent beta (15–35 Hz) and theta (4–8 Hz) oscillations in both the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the DLPFC during REM sleep. We further show that these theta and beta activities in the ACC and the DLPFC, two relatively distant but reciprocally connected regions, are coherent. These findings suggest that, counter to current prevailing thought, the DLPFC is active during REM sleep and likely interacting with other areas. Since the DLPFC and the ACC are implicated in memory and emotional regulation, and the ACC has motor areas and is thought to be important for error detection, the dialogue between these two areas could play a role in the regulation of emotions and in procedural motor and emotional memory consolidation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18894.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18894.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18894.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Over the course of a night we cycle through several different stages of sleep. During one of these stages, our eyes move rapidly from side to side behind our closed eyelids. This movement gives this stage its name: rapid eye movement sleep, or REM sleep for short. Most other muscles are paralyzed during REM sleep, possibly to prevent us from acting out the vivid dreams that also occur during this stage of sleep. But despite the distinctive properties of REM sleep, relatively little is known about about why we need it or how the brain generates it.</p><p>Vijayan et al. have now obtained new insights into the brain activity that underlies REM sleep by recording from the brains of human patients with epilepsy. The patients all had electrodes temporarily inserted into their brains to help neurologists identify the area of the brain that was responsible for their seizures. By recording from these electrodes overnight, Vijayan et al. were able to study the activity of individual brain regions while the patients slept.</p><p>Analysis of the recordings revealed rhythmic waves of neuronal activity in areas at the front of the brain during REM sleep. Two types of brain waves dominated: theta waves, which are relatively slow waves with a frequency of 4–8 cycles per second (Hertz), and beta waves, which are faster with a frequency of 15–35 Hertz. These theta and beta waves were especially pronounced in two subregions of the frontal lobe of the brain, called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).</p><p>The discovery of prominent rhythmic activity in the DLPFC was unexpected. This is because previous studies had shown that this region, which is involved in decision-making and planning, was relatively inactive during REM sleep. Indeed it had been suggested that the limited activity of the DLPFC subregion might be responsible for the often bizarre and illogical nature of our dreams. Instead, Vijayan et al. showed that the ACC and the DLPFC coordinate their activity during REM sleep. The next challenge is to find out whether this dual activity helps support other roles that the two regions share in common, such as the strengthening of memories and the regulation of emotions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18894.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18894.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>REM Sleep</kwd><kwd>Oscillations</kwd><kwd>Anterior Cingulate Cortex</kwd><kwd>Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMS-1042134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vijayan</surname><given-names>Sujith</given-names></name><name><surname>Lepage</surname><given-names>Kyle Q</given-names></name><name><surname>Kopell</surname><given-names>Nancy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000006</institution-id><institution>Office of Naval Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N00014-13-1-0672</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cash</surname><given-names>Sydney S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two regions of the frontal lobe – the anterior cingulate cortex and, unexpectedly, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex – show coordinated rhythmic activity during REM sleep.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A night’s sleep consists of periods of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and periods of non rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. We have a relatively detailed picture of the spatio-temporal pattern of activity that occurs during NREM sleep, and this has allowed detailed hypotheses concerning the circuits and mechanisms at play during NREM sleep. For example, the transfer of memories from the hippocampus to the neocortex during NREM sleep is thought to be mediated by the coordination of oscillatory activity seen in the local field potentials, namely by the interaction of hippocampal ripples (80–250 Hz) with neocortical spindles (11–16 Hz) and slow (&lt;1 Hz) oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battaglia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ji and Wilson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee and Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mölle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Siapas and Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sirota et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Skaggs and McNaughton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>).</p><p>The spatio-temporal patterns of activity during REM sleep are not as well characterized. This may be due in part to the fact that the activity patterns seen during REM sleep do not easily lend themselves to neat description like those seen during NREM sleep. During REM sleep field potential recordings are not dominated by prominent oscillations; rather they are irregular and of low voltage, similar to recordings during awake behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>). During awake activity, the oscillations that emerge during cognitive tasks are thought to play a key role in aspects of cognition such as working memory and communication between brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Başar et al., 2001</xref>). Thus a detailed understanding of the spatio-temporal characteristics of emergent oscillations during REM sleep may shed light on which areas are interacting during REM sleep, how dreams are generated, and how some of the putative functions of REM sleep, such as memory consolidation, are carried out. Little is known about oscillatory activity during REM sleep with the notable exceptions of theta oscillations in the rodent hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Louie and Wilson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Montgomery et al., 2008</xref>), gamma oscillations in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Llinás and Ribary, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Steriade et al., 1996</xref>), and pontine-geniculate-occipital (PGO) waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calvo and Fernández-Guardiola, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Datta, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Datta and Hobson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Steriade et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>We decided to focus on the oscillatory dynamics of the frontal cortices during REM sleep based on imaging studies and REM sleep’s putative functional roles. Imaging studies suggest that activity patterns in certain regions of the frontal cortices are markedly different during REM sleep than during awake activity, with some areas (e.g., the anterior cingulate (ACC)) being more active and some (e.g., the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)) less active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maquet et al., 1996</xref>). These differences in activity patterns suggest that important REM sleep processes might be taking place in the frontal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maquet et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muzur et al., 2002</xref>). At a functional level, REM sleep has been hypothesized to play a role in such processes as the consolidation of emotional and procedural motor memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fischer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gilson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nishida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nitsche et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith, 2001</xref>) and the regulation of emotions. Since the frontal cortices serve memory, emotional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buhle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Etkin et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2006</xref>), and motor functions, they make good candidate areas for the mediation of procedural motor memory and emotional memory consolidation as well as emotional regulation during REM sleep.</p><p>We show that the frontal cortices are dominated by bursts of beta activity and theta oscillations, in particular in the ACC and the DLPFC. The prominent oscillatory activity in the DLPFC is especially surprising since current thinking, based on imaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maquet et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muzur et al., 2002</xref>), is that the DLPFC is relatively quiet during REM sleep in comparison with awake periods, and it has been postulated that the relative quiescence of this ‘executive’ structure might be responsible for the bizarre nature of our dreams. We also show the novel result that beta bursts and theta oscillations during REM sleep are coherent between the DLPFC and the ACC, two relatively distant structures. This finding is especially intriguing since the ACC and the DLPFC are both implicated in memory and emotional processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buhle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Etkin et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goldman-Rakic, 1995</xref>), and the ACC is interconnected with motor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates and Goldman-Rakic, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dum and Strick, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hatanaka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morecraft and Van Hoesen, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Picard and Strick, 1996</xref>), is thought to have motor regions itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paus, 2001</xref>), and is thought to be important in error detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Holroyd and Yeung, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paus, 2001</xref>). Therefore the rhythmic activity we observe in the frontal cortices may play a role in some of the hypothesized functions of REM sleep such as the consolidation of emotional and procedural motor memories and the regulation of emotions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We examined overnight sleep recordings of five patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing invasive recordings to localize the focus of their seizures.

In particular, REM sleep onset resulted in the appearance of prominent bursts of beta activity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> depicts the spectrogram from an exemplar frontal electrode. The activity shown here and in other figures (and the activity included in all analyses) was detected by bipolar derivations from two neighboring contacts; thus this physiological activity is relatively local in nature. As REM sleep begins there is a change in the spectral content; beta bursts appear and then occur throughout the REM sleep episode. To get an impression of the global occurrence of the beta bursts we identified periods during which there was a prominent beta activity on a given electrode (three standard deviations above the median power and at least two cycles in length). This analysis suggested that the beta bursts indeed tended to occur in the frontal electrodes after onset and throughout the REM sleep episode, but not in temporal lobe electrode leads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Furthermore, the beta bursts seemed to occur in close proximity to one another across the frontal electrodes.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18894.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Oscillatory activity across scales.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Spectrogram shows the activity pattern detected from a bipolar derivation of an electrode located in the frontal cortices during REM sleep.

The theta peak occurred at approximately 22 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>), suggesting that theta activity on average tended to occur first in the DLPFC. The peak of the beta cross-covariance function occurred very close to zero but was slightly positive (2 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>), suggesting that the beta activity occurred nearly simultaneously in the DLPFC and ACC but that on average it occurred very slightly earlier in the DLPFC.

In particular, we subtracted the area under the cross-covariance curve from −100 to 0 ms from that of 0 to 100 ms.

The network includes the DLPFC, which prior studies had suggested was relatively quiescent during REM sleep, and the ACC. The bursts of theta and beta activity in the DLPFC and the ACC are coherent between these structures. We suggest that interactions between these two areas may play an important role in the function served by REM sleep.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>DLPFC activity during REM sleep</title><p>Imaging studies, in particular Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies, suggest that the DLPFC is relatively quiescent during REM sleep in comparison with quiet awake periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maquet et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muzur et al., 2002</xref>). The relative silence of the DLPFC, a structure thought to be important for executive functions, during REM sleep has been postulated to underlie the often bizarre and illogical nature of our dreams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muzur et al., 2002</xref>). Our data suggest that the DLPFC is actually active during REM sleep, since it displays significant theta and beta oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b,d</xref>). Furthermore, the DLPFC might be communicating with other structures, since theta and beta bands in the DLPFC are coherent with those in the ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–c</xref>). The DLPFC might communicate directly with the ACC or it might be driven by a third structure that coordinates the activity of the DLPFC with other areas. A discrepancy in brain activity levels assessed by PET studies and electrophysiological techniques has also occurred with respect to sleep spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dang-Vu et al., 2010</xref>). PET studies suggest that the thalamus is relatively quiet during sleep spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hofle et al., 1997</xref>), while a large body of animal studies shows that spindles are generated precisely by thalamocortical interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCormick and Bal, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Steriade et al., 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">1987</xref>). One possibility is that during REM sleep the periods outside the oscillatory events may show less overall neural activity than is seen during awake periods, so that PET measurements, which average over relatively large periods of time (on the order of minutes), indicate that the DLPFC is less active during REM sleep than during quiet awake periods. Another possibility is that the oscillatory activity observed in the DLPFC during REM sleep may manifest under relatively inhibited conditions; the connectivity patterns between the DLPFC and the ACC suggest that the DLPFC may receive more inhibition from the ACC under the physiological conditions of REM sleep in comparison with awake conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Medalla and Barbas, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional implications</title><p>What functional role sleep plays has yet to be resolved. There is a large body of evidence suggesting that NREM sleep may play an important role in memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>), but whether or not REM sleep also plays a role in memory consolidation remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dudai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>). Some animal and human studies suggest that REM sleep plays a role in procedural and emotional memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fischer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Karni et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Louie and Wilson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nishida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nitsche et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Popa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wagner et al., 2001</xref>), but other studies, especially human studies, do not corroborate these findings and suggest that REM sleep may be important for other cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walker et al., 2002b</xref>) such as emotional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baran et al., 2012</xref>) while stage 2 NREM sleep may be more important for the consolidation of procedural memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mantua et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tamaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Walker et al., 2002a</xref>). Whether these differential findings arise because of the different natures of the tasks, differences across species, or simply because REM sleep plays little or no role in memory consolidation remains to be determined. Below we discuss our findings in light of previously known facts about the structures and oscillations at play during REM sleep. Our discussion is driven by the perspective that REM oscillatory activity may play an important role in memory, and we put forward hypotheses for how the rhythmic activity that we have observed during REM sleep could serve a role in memory consolidation, but we note that rhythmic activity during REM sleep could serve some other function or possibly no function at all.</p><p>We observed rhythmic activity in the beta and theta bands that was coherent between the ACC and the DLPFC, two relatively distant structures that are reciprocally connected and both implicated in memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goldman-Rakic, 1995</xref>). It is possible that this activity could be important in the procedural motor memory consolidation since the ACC is interconnected with motor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates and Goldman-Rakic, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dum and Strick, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hatanaka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morecraft and Van Hoesen, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Picard and Strick, 1996</xref>), is thought to have motor regions itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paus, 2001</xref>), and is thought to be important in error detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Holroyd and Yeung, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paus, 2001</xref>). In humans, beta activity has been shown to follow PGO waves during REM sleep in the subthalamic nucleus of the basal ganglia, so the beta activity observed in our work could result from the transmission of the PGO-related beta activity from the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amzica and Steriade, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fernández-Mendoza et al., 2009</xref>); pontine wave density has been correlated with sleep-related improvements in memory tasks and the expression of plasticity-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Datta, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Datta et al., 2008</xref>). This possibility is in line with our findings that the observed beta activity tends to manifest at approximately the same time in both the ACC and the DLPFC, suggesting that it may originate from a subcortical source. Such a scenario leads to the intriguing possibility that PGO waves may trigger an evaluation of a motor plan by a dialogue occurring via the beta band channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18894.014</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic of Hypothesized Circuit Involved in REM Sleep Memory Consolidation.</title><p>PGO waves originating from the PPN may trigger beta activity in the basal ganglia.

These studies have primarily focused on REM-related processes (both at the unit and LFP level) in the medial temporal lobe. We build on this knowledge base by examining the spatio-temporal characteristics of rhythmic activity in the frontal cortices.

The postoperative CT scan was then coregistered with the 3D rendering, thus providing a RAS coordinate for each electrode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dykstra et al., 2012</xref>). FreeSurfer automatically generated subcortical and cortical parcellations with anatomical labels using the Desikan-Killiany Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Desikan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fischl et al., 2002</xref>). Using these parcellations and the RAS coordinates, we determined the anatomical location of each electrode contact. We considered contacts labeled as being in rostral middle frontal by FreeSurfer according to the Desikan-Killiany Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Desikan et al., 2006</xref>) to be in the DLPFC. We considered the inferior frontal gyrus to consist of contacts labeled as parstriangularis, parsopercularis, and parsorbitalis. Contacts labeled as middle temporal gyrus were categorized as such. The locations of the contacts were also determined by a trained neurologist. In the case of the midline contacts (in relation to this paper, the anterior cingulate contacts) there was some discrepancy between the locations of the contacts determined by the neurologist and by the FreeSurfer labeling scheme. The locations determined by the neurologist were used. We employed bipolar derivations using two abutting contacts so that we could be sure the activity being analyzed was relatively local in nature. Only electrode derivations for which both contacts had labels within the same defined region and such that at least one of the contacts was in the gray matter were used for subsequent analyses. We did not use bipolar derivations with contacts in two different regions since in these cases it was not possible to determine from which region the activity originated. In addition, contacts that showed epileptic activity were eliminated from subsequent analyses (36 bipolar derivations were eliminated by this criterion). After eliminating bipolar derivations based on these criteria, we were left with 15 bipolar derivations in the DLPFC, 22 in the ACC, 12 in the inferior frontal gyrus, and 19 in the medial temporal gyrus. In other defined regions, there were relatively few bipolar derivations that met the criteria for inclusion in our analyses, and not all subjects had bipolar derivations in these regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Sleep staging</title><p>Scalp electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and electrooculography (EOG) were used to score sleep.

For each electrode, a t-test was used to determine whether the set of mean values of the spectrum estimates for a given band was significantly different (p&lt;0.05, Bonferroni corrected for number of electrodes) from the set of mean values of the fitted curves. We used this method rather than a comparison with awake activity since during awake conditions the calculated power spectrum would depend on the cognitive state and the task being performed. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> for power spectrum comparisons between NREM sleep and REM sleep, which demonstrate that the spectral content is very different between the two states and show the clear distinction between spindling activity during NREM sleep and beta activity during REM sleep. Note that all subjects had at least 21 min of REM sleep, resulting in over 125 10 s windows per electrode in each subject. Only electrode contacts showing significant power in the band of interest were used for subsequent analysis. However, this resulted in the elimination of very few electrodes. In the DLPFC no electrodes were eliminated from the theta band analyses (0/15) and two electrodes were eliminated from the beta band analyses (2/15). In the ACC no electrodes were eliminated from the beta band analyses (0/22) and three electrodes were eliminated from the theta band analyses (3/22).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Coherence estimates</title><p>We estimated coherence values using the Chronux toolbox. Coherence was examined for 34 ACC-DLPFC electrode pairs in the theta band (3 ACC electrodes were eliminated because theta power was not significant) and 31 ACC-DLPFC electrode pairs in the beta band (2 DLPFC electrodes were eliminated because beta power was not significant). We estimated the coherence during REM sleep by first dividing all REM sessions of a subject into 2 s windows. All 2 s intervals of data were included in a single coherence calculation for that subject using the coherence formula employed by Chronux (see equations 7.77 and 7.80 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitra and Bokil, 2008</xref>). The time-bandwidth was set such that the coherence estimate for the center band (e.g., 6 Hz for theta) integrated the entire band of interest. We assessed significance using two methods: by using the confidence level provided by Chronux and by doing Monte Carlo simulations (2000 shuffles). The confidence level provided by Chronux is based on the distribution of the statistic (i.e., the coherence measure) given the null hypothesis of zero coherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bokil et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brillinger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jarvis and Mitra, 2001</xref>).

See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brillinger (2001)</xref> for details regarding the asymptotic convergence of the coherence estimator under the hypothesis of zero coherence. For the Monte Carlo simulations, a shuffle was done by permuting the 2 s windows of one of the electrode pairs and then calculating the coherence. Using the distribution of coherences from the shuffles we determined the probability of getting the coherence value we got using our data. Both methods identified the same set of DLPFC-ACC electrode derivation pairs as having significant (p&lt;0.05, Bonferroni corrected for number of electrode pairs) beta or theta coherence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Power Cross-covariance estimates</title><p>The cross-covariance of the power was calculated by first filtering the raw signal in the band of interest. The instantaneous amplitude was then calculated using the Hilbert transform of the filtered signal. Using these calculated instantaneous amplitudes the cross-covariance of the power (amplitude) of an ACC-DLPFC electrode pair was calculated for each two-second REM sleep window. For a given electrode the cross-covariance functions for all two-second windows were averaged to obtain an average cross-covariance function.</p><p>Only those REM windows in which both electrodes had power in the top quartile in the band of interest with respect to the REM episode were used for the analysis. We also restricted our analysis to those electrode pairs that showed a significant coherence in the band of interest.</p><p>Finally the average cross-covariance functions for all electrodes were averaged to obtain an overall average cross-covariance function. The max lag reported is simply the time lag at the maximum value of the overall average cross-covariance function. We used 23 ACC-DLPFC bipolar electrode pair derivations for the beta band cross-covariance analysis and 26 ACC-DLPFC bipolar electrode pair derivations for the theta band cross-covariance analysis (we omitted eight electrode pairs from the theta and beta analyses).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>SV, KL, and NK acknowledge support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant DMS-1042134.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript presents a study in which intracranial recordings of REM sleep were conducted in humans (epileptic patients). Based on neuroimaging studies, the authors have thought of the ACC and DLPFC as regions of specific interest, which may be inversely active to each other (ACC high, DLPFC low) during REM. However, the results of the present study suggest that both areas are active, with significant beta and theta activity that occurs coherently between the regions. The authors suggest that the results indicate a neurological basis for a proposed function of sleep in memory consolidation.</p><p>All reviewers acknowledge the importance of spatio-temporal analyses of spontaneous oscillations during REM sleep in human. However, a multitude of analyses and statistical procedures are unclear.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers have agreed that significantly better clarification of analyses and control analyses are necessary.</p><p>For example:</p><p>“With regards to the data analysis, it's not clear how conclusions such as &quot;showed significant theta activity&quot; are drawn. It seems that frequency analyses were done in either 10- or 30-sec bins. Either way, a bin may not be 100% REM. Presumably the 'edges' on the sleep stage would have some other sleep (and frequencies). And, what make it 'significant'? A t-test is used (as indicated by the reported statistic) but this is not in the Data Analysis section”.</p><p>“It was not clear how many out of all channels were analyzed and where these channels were placed (scalp locations). &quot;Frontal cortices&quot; usually indicates a huge extent and thus ambiguous. How specific could the ACC and DLPFC be in comparison to other frontal regions (superior frontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex etc.)? Is it the case that the ACC and DLPFC were more active compared to other frontal cortices? Or is it the case that the ACC and DLPFC were as active as other frontal cortices but more active than other non-frontal cortices? It is stated that Bonferroni correction was made based on the number of electrodes. However, the number of electrodes is not reported”.</p><p>“The authors limited their analysis to a potentially quite restricted subsample of the data. First, data from frontal electrodes were reduced to electrodes in the ACC and DLPFC, because beta and theta activity was most prominent in these regions. From these electrodes, only those were used for coherence analysis that showed a significant power increase in the frequency bands of interest. From these electrode pairs, only those that showed significant coherence were used for the subsequent power cross-covariance analysis, which was moreover only calculated for time windows with power in the top 25% within each REM episode. All of this data-driven sub-selection potentially bias the results towards positive findings. As an example, using only electrode pairs with high coherence for power cross-covariance can be problematic since these two measures are not independent (Lachaux, Rodriguez et al. 1999, Srinath and Ray 2014). Furthermore, it is not clear how much data (sleep epochs, electrodes, time windows, electrode pairs) were discarded in absolute numbers in each step (only the ratios of electrodes used based on power and coherence are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Please report the number of recorded electrodes per subject including their location. Please give an idea on how many data were finally used at each analysis step. Coherence was tested for statistically significant differences using Monte Carlo simulations as well as the &quot;confidence level provided by Chronux&quot; (subsection “Coherence Estimates”). What is this confidence level based on? Apparently, both methods yielded &quot;the same results&quot; (Paragraph six Results section). Please elaborate, are the results indeed fully identical? How did the authors deal with the influence of the number of trials for the estimation of coherence (e.g. Maris, Schoffelen, Fries 2007). Was the number of observations equalized across REM sleep periods? In the subsection “Coherence Estimates”, the calculation of coherence reads as if the coherence between two electrodes was calculated for each window and then was averaged. However, since calculating coherence for a single trial (here: 2-s time window) will always result in a coherence of 1 (as well as their average), I assume that the cross-spectra were calculated for each time window and then used to calculate coherence (not &quot;average coherence&quot;) across time windows. Please clarify the procedure”.</p><p>Please state in significantly clearer way how you conducted the analyses, what was compared, or how the statistical significance was obtained. Bin length, definition of regions, data selection (if any), procedures of a coherence analysis, cross-covariance analysis, and data visualization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> each show spectral data from only one bipolar derivation or electrode pair. How representative are these data? Is there a way to present data aggregated from more than one electrode / subject?), etc. are unclear. In addition, please clarify whether you compared REM sleep vs. NREM sleep or Wake stage.</p><p>2) All reviewers agreed that discussion about REM sleep and memory consolidation are too far-reaching based on the present data, particularly because it is not shown that the obtained effects are specific to REM sleep.</p><p>“The function of REM in procedural memory consolidation is questionable as the result is not found in many studies. Recent studies seem to suggest that REMs role in emotional memory consolidation is limited (e.g., see Payne et al., 2015) and perhaps reflects emotional processing without consolidation (see Baran et al., 2012). Keeping in mind that the present data contain no cognitive measures, it cannot be stated &quot;These findings, in conjunction with previous work on REM sleep, suggest a system for the consolidation of memories during REM sleep.&quot; It seems that much of the discussion is focused on just this point – the REM role in consolidation – which I see no clear support for in the present data. Sure they support some cognitive role of REM but is it necessarily emotional or procedural memory consolidation? That link is absent”.</p><p>“The authors speculate that activation of the ACC during REM sleep relates to consolidation motor learning. However, there are many functions in which the ACC is suggested to play roles. Mere activation of the ACC during REM sleep may leave other possibilities than its involvement in consolidation of motor learning”.</p><p>Please revise the relevant statements so that the manuscript would not go too far beyond the current data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18894.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) All reviewers have agreed that significantly better clarification of analyses and control analyses are necessary.</italic> </p><p>We have substantially modified the Methods and Results sections to make our approaches to analyses clearer. We have added much more detail on electrode selection, electrode localization, statistical measures for frequency, coherence and cross-covariance estimates, sleep staging, determination of statistical significance, and more. The changes to the manuscript are detailed below in response to specific reviewer queries.</p><p><italic>For example:</italic> </p><p><italic>“With regards to the data analysis, it's not clear how conclusions such as &quot;showed significant theta activity&quot; are drawn.

A t-test is used (as indicated by the reported statistic) but this is not in the Data Analysis section”.</italic> </p><p>As stated in the section entitled Determination of Significant Theta and Β Activity, power spectra were calculated in 10-second bins. For each calculated power spectrum a 1/f fit was determined using a robust least-squares regression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then calculated the mean power for each power spectrum and each fit in the band of interest. We then used a t-test to determine if the set of means of the power spectra differed significantly from the set of means of the fits in the bands of interest. An electrode is said to show significant theta activity if the means of the power spectra in the theta band were significantly different from the means of the fits in the theta band as assessed by a t-test (P&lt;0.05, Bonferroni corrected for number of electrodes).</p><p>We used conservative measures in identifying REM periods. We chose relatively long REM periods that were not interrupted by non-REM sleep stages. Furthermore, we selected the beginning and the end of each REM period (first and last 10 seconds) such that there were no other stages or transition stages present. Thus our results were not influenced by spectral content from any other sleep stages.</p><p>To address the reviewer's concerns, we have added the relevant details to the section of the Methods entitled Contacts with Significant Theta and Β Power (see the section entitled Determination of Significant Theta and Β Activity for details).

It is stated that Bonferroni correction was made based on the number of electrodes. However, the number of electrodes is not reported”.</italic> </p><p>Identification of Electrode Localization</p><p>Subjects were implanted with depth electrodes. Each depth electrode had 6 to 8 contacts. Subject 1 had 10 depth electrodes (2 anterior temporal (bilateral), 2 posterior temporal (bilateral), and 6 frontal (bilateral)), subject 2 had 8 depth electrodes (2 anterior temporal (bilateral), 2 posterior temporal (bilateral), 4 frontal (bilateral)), subject 3 had 5 depth electrodes (1 anterior temporal, 1 posterior temporal, 2 frontal, and 1 parietal), subject 4 had 10 depth electrodes (2 anterior temporal (bilateral), 2 posterior temporal (bilateral), and 6 frontal (bilateral)), subject 5 had 10 depth electrodes (2 anterior temporal (bilateral), 2 posterior temporal (bilateral), and 6 frontal (bilateral)).</p><p>Electrode locations were determined by co-registering the postoperative CT scan with the preoperative MRI scan (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref> in the manuscript for an example) using techniques previously developed in the lab (Dykstra et al., 2012). In brief, FreeSurfer (Dale et al., 1999; Fischl et al., 1999) was used to create a 3-D rendering of the brain using the MRI scan and place the rendering in a 3-D coordinate system, thus providing a 3-D coordinate for each electrode contact. FreeSurfer was also used to automatically parcellate the cortical and subcortical structures and provide anatomical labels using the Deskian-Killany atlas; from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in Deskian et al. (2006). The 3-D coordinate assigned to each electrode contact was used to assign a unique anatomical label to each contact.</p><p>We employed bipolar derivations using two adjacent contacts so that we could be sure the activity being analyzed was relatively local in nature. Only electrode derivations for which both contacts had labels within the same defined region and such that at least one of the contacts was in the gray matter were used for subsequent analyses. We did not use bipolar derivations with contacts in two different regions since in these cases it was not possible to determine from which region the activity originated. In addition, contacts that showed epileptic activity were eliminated from analyses (36 bipolar derivations were eliminated by this criterion). After eliminating bipolar derivations based on these criteria, we were left with 15 bipolar derivations in the DLPFC, 22 in the ACC, 12 in the inferior frontal gyrus, and 19 in the medial temporal gyrus. In other defined regions there were relatively few bipolar derivations that met the criteria for inclusion in our analyses; furthermore, not all of the subjects had bipolar derivations in these regions. For instance, other frontal areas (e.g. orbitofrontal cortex) had very few bipolar electrode derivations that satisfied our criteria and each of these areas had electrodes in only 2 or fewer out of 5 subjects.</p><p>In this study, scalp electrodes were used only for sleep staging. All other analyses utilized depth electrodes, which do permit anatomical localization using the methods outlined above.</p><p>To address the reviewer's concerns, a paragraph has been added to the methods section entitled Subjects and Recordings. The relevant text is pasted below.</p><p>“Each depth electrode had 6 to 8 contacts. Subject 1 had 10 depth electrodes (2 anterior temporal (bilateral), 2 posterior temporal (bilateral), and 6 frontal (bilateral)), subject 2 had 8 depth electrodes (2 anterior temporal (bilateral), 2 posterior temporal (bilateral), 4 frontal (bilateral)), subject 3 had 5 depth electrodes (1 anterior temporal, 1 posterior temporal, 2 frontal, and 1 parietal), subject 4 had 10 depth electrodes (2 anterior temporal (bilateral), 2 posterior temporal (bilateral), and 6 frontal (bilateral)), and subject 5 had 10 depth electrodes (2 anterior temporal (bilateral), 2 posterior temporal (bilateral), and 6 frontal (bilateral)).”</p><p>To address the reviewer's concerns, a paragraph has also been added to the methods section entitled Electrode Localization. The relevant text is pasted below.</p><p>“We employed bipolar derivations using two abutting contacts so that we could be sure the activity being analyzed was relatively local in nature. Only electrode derivations for which both contacts had labels within the same defined region and such that at least one of the contacts was in the gray matter were used for subsequent analyses. We did not use bipolar derivations with contacts in two different regions since in these cases it was not possible to determine from which region the activity originated.

In other defined regions there were relatively few bipolar derivations that met the criteria for inclusion in our analyses, and not all subjects had bipolar derivations in these regions.”</p><p>Determination of Significant Theta and Beta Activity</p><p>For each region of interest (e.g., the DLPFC) all bipolar electrode derivations in the region were tested for significant theta and beta activity. Identified REM periods were divided into 10-second windows (i.e., the bin size was 10s). The power spectrum was calculated for each 10-second window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and a 1/f fit was calculated for each calculated power spectrum using a robust least-squares regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine if there was significant power in a given band (e.g., theta) we took the mean power within the given band for each spectrum estimate and each fit, for each 10 -second bin. This gave a set of paired values corresponding to the mean powers (for the given band) for the spectrum estimates and for the fitted curves of the various 10- second bins. For each bipolar derivation, a t-test (P&lt;.05, Bonferroni corrected for number of bipolar derivations) was used to determine whether there was significant power in the band of interest.</p><p>We used this method rather than a comparison with awake activity since during awake conditions the calculated power spectrum would depend on the cognitive state and the task being performed. We have included in the figure supplements power spectrum comparisons between NREM sleep and REM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) to demonstrate that the spectral content is very different between the two states and to show the clear distinction between spindling activity (11-16 Hz) during NREM sleep and beta activity during REM sleep.</p><p>We found there to be significant beta and theta activity in the ACC and the DLPFC (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> in the manuscript). The presence of rhythmic activity in the DLPFC is surprising since imaging studies suggest that the DLPFC is relatively inactive during REM sleep; the relative inactivity of the DLPFC, a structure thought to be important for executive functions, has been argued to be the cause of the illogical nature of our dreams. The high-frequency activity generated in the DLPFC presumably requires a fair amount of metabolic energy. Furthermore, the ACC and the DLPFC, two relatively distant structures, were coherent in the theta and beta bands, suggesting that the DLPFC may in fact be interacting with other structures during REM sleep. There was also significant theta and beta activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> supplement in manuscript). There were not enough bipolar derivations to determine the nature of the rhythmic activity present in other frontal structures; note that the placement of the electrodes was determined strictly by clinical criteria. The frontal structures that were examined exhibited more high frequency activity (i.e., beta) than did temporal areas (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> in the manuscript). The difference in power between the various frontal structures cannot be determined using our data since power depends on the geometric arrangement of the neuronal process relative to a given electrode as well as the proximity to the electrode.</p><p>For subsequent analyses we used only electrodes that showed significant power in the band relevant to the analysis. However, this resulted in the elimination of very few electrodes. In the DLPFC no electrodes were eliminated from the theta band analyses (0/15) and 2 electrodes were eliminated from the beta band analyses (2/15). In the ACC no electrodes were eliminated from the beta band analyses (0/22) and 3 electrodes were eliminated from the theta band analyses (3/22).</p><p>We have now included the number of electrodes used for each of the relevant analyses in the manuscript.</p><p>To further address the reviewer's concerns, the following two paragraphs have been added to the section of the Methods entitled Identification of Contacts with Significant Theta and Beta Power. The relevant text is pasted below.</p><p>“We used this method rather than a comparison with awake activity since during awake conditions the calculated power spectrum would depend on the cognitive state and the task being performed.

Please report the number of recorded electrodes per subject including their location. Please give an idea on how many data were finally used at each analysis step.</italic></p><p>We have now added details about the selection of data to be included in the analyses. The selection of the particular frontal areas used in the analyses was based on anatomical criteria and the requirement that each area has a sufficient number of electrodes across all subjects. As stated, since we used bipolar derivations using neighboring electrodes, we required that both electrodes be from the same anatomically defined region and that at least one of the electrode contacts be in the grey matter. These selection criteria resulted in 15 bipolar derivations in the DLPFC, 22 in the ACC, and 12 in the inferior frontal gyrus. These selection criteria allowed us to have confidence that the activity of a given derivation was local in nature and that it originated from the region of interest; if two contacts had been from two different regions it would not have been possible to determine the regional origin of the activity.</p><p>The reviewer correctly points out that we eliminated electrodes that did not show significant power in the theta or beta bands for subsequent analyses. However, this resulted in the elimination of relatively few electrodes. In the DLPFC no electrodes were eliminated from the theta band analyses (0/15) and 2 electrodes were eliminated from the beta band analyses (2/15). In the ACC no electrodes were eliminated from the beta band analyses (0/22) and 3 electrodes were eliminated from the theta band analyses (3/22). Therefore, for the coherence analysis we examined 34 ACC-DLPFC electrode pairs in the theta band (3 ACC electrodes eliminated) and 31 ACC-DLPFC electrode pairs in the beta band (2 DLPFC electrodes eliminated).</p><p>Cross-Covariance Calculations</p><p>Since the coherence measure indicated that there was a relationship between the time series of the electrode pairs, we were interested in determining whether on average a rhythm originated in one region or the other when there was ongoing rhythmic activity in both bipolar derivations. In other words, the primary motivation was to determine the time lag, not the amplitude, of the relationship. Since we were interested in electrode pairs whose time series had a temporal relationship, we restricted our analysis to pairs of electrodes whose coherence measure was significant. Also, to get a better estimate of the lag we restricted the analysis to periods when the power was high and employed the cross-covariance method as described in (Adhikari et al., 2010). We used 23 ACC-DLPFC bipolar electrode pair derivations for the beta band cross-covariance analysis and 26 ACC-DLPFC bipolar electrode pair derivations for the theta band cross-covariance analysis (we omitted 8 electrode pairs from the theta and beta analyses).</p><p>We calculated cross-covariance by first filtering the raw signal in the band of interest during the REM episodes and five minutes before and after the REM episodes to avoid edge effects. The instantaneous amplitude was then calculated using the Hilbert transform of the filtered signal; following this step we used the data from only the REM period. Using the calculated instantaneous amplitude the cross-covariance of the power (amplitude) of an ACC-DLPFC electrode pair was calculated for each two- second REM sleep window. For a given electrode the cross-covariance functions for all two-second windows were averaged to obtain an average cross-covariance function (Adhikari et al., 2010).</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concerns we have added details about the number of electrodes used in each step. We have also added the following sentence to the section entitled Power Cross-Covariance Estimates (in the Materials and,methods section).</p><p><italic>“</italic>We used 23 ACC-DLPFC bipolar electrode pair derivations for the beta band cross- covariance analysis and 26 ACC-DLPFC bipolar electrode pair derivations for the theta band cross-covariance analysis (we omitted 8 electrode pairs from the theta and beta analyses).<italic>”</italic></p><p>Activity Across Subjects</p><p>The examples of spectral data that we included in the manuscript are representative. For each example spectrogram from a single subject, we also included the average power spectrum (averaged across all subjects). Note that these average power spectra show significant power in the same bands in which the example spectrogram shows power. For example, the example spectrogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> in the manuscript shows activity in the theta and beta bands, and the average power spectrum in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> in the manuscript also shows power in the theta and beta bands. To give a better sense of the distribution of the power across the subjects and to address the reviewer’s concerns we have now added lines showing +/- the standard error for the power spectrum across the subjects. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> we have added traces showing +/- the standard error for the power spectrum across the subjects. The included standard error traces for the ACC, DLPFC, and Middle Temporal Gyrus indicate that the observed beta and theta activity is consistent across the subjects. Note that in the instance of the inferior frontal gyrus, for which we provide data in the figure supplements, the standard error traces indicate that theta and beta activities are variable across the subjects.</p><p><italic>Coherence was tested for statistically significant differences using Monte Carlo simulations as well as the &quot;confidence level provided by Chronux&quot; (subsection “Coherence Estimates”).

One method was to use the confidence level provided by Chronux. The confidence level is based on the distribution of the statistic (i.e., the coherence measure) given the null hypothesis of zero coherence (Bokil et al., 2010; Brillinger, 2001; Jarvis and Mitra, 2001).

The other method was via Monte Carlo simulations (2,000 shuffles). A shuffle was done by permuting the 2-second windows of one of the electrode pairs and then calculating the coherence. Using the distribution of coherences from the shuffles we determined the probability of getting the coherence value we got using our data. Both of these methods gave identical results in the sense that they identified the same set of electrodes as having significant beta activity and the same set of electrodes as having significant theta activity.</p><p>To address the reviewer's concerns and make these details clearer, we have amended the text in the Materials and methods section entitled Coherence Estimates.

Bin length, definition of regions, data selection (if any), procedures of a coherence analysis, cross-covariance analysis, and data visualization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> each show spectral data from only one bipolar derivation or electrode pair. How representative are these data? Is there a way to present data aggregated from more than one electrode / subject?), etc. are unclear. In addition, please clarify whether you compared REM sleep vs. NREM sleep or Wake stage.</italic> </p><p>We have now included bin lengths and data selection criteria in each of the relevant sections. Details about the definition of regions can be found in the response titled Identification of Electrode Localization. Details about coherence analyses can be found in the responses sections titled Coherence Calculations I and Coherence Calculations II. Details about cross-covariance analyses can be found in the response section titled Cross-Covariance Calculations.</p><p>The data are representative across the subjects; we have modified some of the figures to give a better sense of the consistency across the subjects. Please see the section entitled Activity Across Subjects for more details. We have also provided details about the comparisons that were made and how significances were obtained; these details are in multiple sections, but most notably in the response section titled Determination of Significant Theta and Β Activity.</p><p><italic>2) All reviewers agreed that discussion about REM sleep and memory consolidation are too far-reaching based on the present data, particularly because it is not shown that the obtained effects are specific to REM sleep.</italic> </p><p><italic>Please revise the relevant statements so that the manuscript would not go too far beyond the current data.</italic> </p><p>We have substantially modified and reduced our discussion of REM sleep and memory. We have made it clear that our claims are hypotheses and we have added the necessary caveats. Since the functional role of REM sleep remains largely a mystery, we feel that some hypotheses about the putative functional role of the rhythmic activity we observed are warranted in the discussion to motivate future studies. Of course, we are open to further modifications if the changes we have made are unsatisfactory. We have rewritten this section and pasted it below in response to one of the reviewer comments.</p><p><italic>“The function of REM in procedural memory consolidation is questionable as the result is not found in many studies. Recent studies seem to suggest that REMs role in emotional memory consolidation is limited (e.g., see Payne et al., 2015) and perhaps reflects emotional processing without consolidation (see Baran et al., 2012). Keeping in mind that the present data contain no cognitive measures, it cannot be stated &quot;These findings, in conjunction with previous work on REM sleep, suggest a system for the consolidation of memories during REM sleep.&quot; It seems that much of the discussion is focused on just this point – the REM role in consolidation – which I see no clear support for in the present data. Sure they support some cognitive role of REM but is it necessarily emotional or procedural memory consolidation? That link is absent”.</italic> </p><p>To address the reviewer’s concerns we have substantially modified the Discussion section and any claims about the functional role of REM sleep in the manuscript. The new Discussion section is pasted below.</p><p><italic>“</italic>What functional role sleep plays has yet to be resolved. There is a large body of evidence suggesting that NREM sleep may play an important role in memory consolidation (Rasch and Born, 2013), but whether or not REM sleep also plays a role in memory consolidation remains unclear (Dudai et al., 2015; Rasch and Born, 2013).[…] Furthermore, emotional information from the limbic system conveyed via the theta band may bias the processing and consolidation of procedural memories with high emotional content (Popa et al., 2010). Note that many different functions have been attributed to the ACC (Paus, 2001), so its activation during REM sleep does not necessarily mean that it serves the function of emotional or procedural memory consolidation during REM sleep.”</p><p>“The authors speculate that activation of the ACC during REM sleep relates to consolidation motor learning. However, there are many functions in which the ACC is suggested to play roles. Mere activation of the ACC during REM sleep may leave other possibilities than its involvement in consolidation of motor learning”.</p><p>As the reviewer points out activation of the ACC during REM sleep could serve some other role than the consolidation of motor learning.</p><p>To address the reviewer's concerns and make these details clearer, we have added the following to the text in the Discussion section entitled Functional Implications. The relevant text is pasted below.</p><p>“Note that many different functions have been attributed to the ACC (Paus, 2001), so its activation during REM sleep does not necessarily mean that it serves the function of emotional or procedural memory consolidation during REM sleep.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
