Although RNA interference (RNAi) is known to mediate antiviral immunity in plant and animal models, the mechanism of antiviral RNAi in rice and other economically important crops is poorly understood. Here, we report that rice resistance to evolutionarily diverse viruses requires Argonaute18 (AGO18). Genetic studies reveal that the antiviral function of AGO18 depends on its activity to sequester microRNA168 (miR168) to alleviate repression of rice AGO1 essential for antiviral RNAi. Expression of miR168-resistant <italic>AGO1a</italic> in <italic>ago18</italic> background rescues or increases rice antiviral activity. Notably, stable transgenic expression of AGO18 confers broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice. Our findings uncover a novel cooperative antiviral activity of two distinct AGO proteins and suggest a new strategy for the control of viral diseases in rice.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05733.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05733.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05733.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Rice is a major food crop, providing over a fifth of all calories consumed by people around the world. As such, it is important to find ways to prevent the diseases that affect rice plants. Many of the viruses that infect rice are transferred between plants by insects and many insects carry more than one virus at a time; this means it can be difficult to predict where a disease will next emerge. As a result, there is a pressing need to develop new and effective strategies that boost the ability of rice plants to fight off harmful viruses.</p><p>One way that plants defend themselves from viruses involves using a system called RNA interference to identify and destroy the RNA molecules that viruses produce. This process depends on the Argonaute (AGO) family of proteins, although the roles of many of its members are not well understood. One of the better-studied AGO proteins is called AGO1 and is known to be important for defending plants against viruses. Unfortunately, a small RNA molecule called miR168 acts to limit the amount of AGO1 in a cell, and the levels of miR168 increase in virus-infected rice plants.</p><p>Wu, Yang et al. exposed rice plants to two species of insect that each carried a different plant virus. Rice plants infected with these viruses increased their levels of both AGO1 and another AGO protein called AGO18. Modifying the ability of rice plants to produce AGO18 revealed that the anti-viral activity of AGO1 is abolished in plants lacking AGO18. However, plants that over-produce AGO18 are better able to fight off viral infections. Wu, Yang et al. further showed that AGO18 binds to miR168 and so prevents this small RNA from reducing AGO1 levels. Therefore, AGO1 and AGO18 work together to defend rice plants from viruses.</p><p>Wu, Yang et al. suggest that engineering rice plants to make more AGO18 could make them more resistant to viruses. Further work will be needed to confirm whether AGO1 and AGO18 also work together to defend rice against viruses other than the two tested so far and to investigate whether these proteins also perform similar roles in other crops.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05733.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05733.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression via RNA interference (RNAi) pathways in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baulcombe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hauptmann and Meister, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meister, 2013</xref>). The RNAi machinery contains many proteins involved in the biogenesis and function of specific types of small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hauptmann and Meister, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meister, 2013</xref>). Among these are two categories that act as the core of the RNA silencing machinery: DICER (DICER-LIKE or DCL in plants) and ARGONAUTE (AGO). DICER and DCL proteins mainly function to process double-stranded or folded stem-loop precursor RNAs into small RNA duplexes. AGO proteins incorporate one strand of an siRNA duplex to form an effector complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to regulate the stability/translatability of target RNAs or to mediate methylation of target DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baulcombe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meister, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pfaff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rogers and Chen, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In plants, the RNAi machinery has undergone extensive amplification and functional specialization during evolution. For instance, the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> encodes four DCLs that function indistinct and yet overlapping RNAi pathways to control diverse biological processes ranging from development, response to abiotic stresses, to defense against pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deleris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chapman and Carrington, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia-Ruiz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vazquez et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> encodes 10 AGOs whose functions are not all understood. Well-studied AGOs include AGO1 that mediates mRNA cleavage is critical for development, AGO4 that directs DNA methylation, and AGO2 that functions in DNA double strand break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumberger and Baulcombe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mallory and Vaucheret, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ye et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wei et al., 2012</xref>). AGO1 is particularly notable in that its homeostasis is controlled at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels. At the post-transcriptional level, the <italic>AGO1</italic> mRNA is a target of miR168. Therefore, miR168-guided cleavage of <italic>AGO1</italic> mRNA by AGO1 protein exerts auto-regulation. Moreover, <italic>AGO1</italic> is co-expressed with miR168 and AGO1 protein can stabilize miR168 post-transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vaucheret et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vaucheret, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mallory and Vaucheret, 2010</xref>). At the post-translational level, the accumulation of AGO1 can be reduced by F-box proteins in a proteasome-independent manner through the autophagy pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Derrien et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rogers and Chen, 2013</xref>). The auto-regulation of AGO1 indicates that its level within a cell can be dynamic and this dynamics may significantly impact the biological activities of a plant.</p><p>RNA-mediated immunity against viruses operates in plants, fungi, invertebrates, and mammals to specifically destroy viral RNAs through the cellular RNA silencing machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maillard et al., 2013</xref>). In plants, it is well known that AGO1 is a major effector of antiviral RNAi; AGO1 associates with virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs) and mediates the degradation of viral RNAs. Furthermore, AGO2 and AGO7 are induced during viral infection, and both proteins can bind viral siRNAs. The antiviral function of AGO2 and AGO7 requires their slicing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). AGO2 is repressed by AGO1-associated miR403, and AGO1 and AGO2 appear to exert antiviral functions in a non-redundant and cooperative manner. Specifically, AGO1 functions in the first layer of antiviral RNAi; when AGO1's antiviral function is inhibited, a second layer is activated involving AGO2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harvey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaubert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scholthof et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carbonell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2014</xref>). AGO2 also recruits miR393* to regulate plant immunity against bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). As a counter-defense strategy, some plant viruses have evolved silencing suppressors to target AGO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burgyán and Havelda, 2011</xref>). Moreover, infection of many viruses can elevate the miR168 level to down-regulate AGO1, thereby nullifying this layer of host defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Várallyay et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, regulation of AGO1 by both host and viral factors plays a critical role in determining host responses to viral infection. Whether a host has positive regulators to check the viral counter-defense activities is not understood. How different AGOs have evolved to regulate plant responses to pathogen infection also remains an outstanding question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding and Voinnet, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia-Ruiz et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) is one of the most important food crops as well as an experimental model plant for monocotyledonous plants (monocots). However, rice production and consequently food sustainability is under the constant threat of emerging and reemerging viral diseases. Rice viral pathogens are genetically diverse and many highly pathogenic viruses such as <italic>Rice stripe Tenuivirus</italic> (RSV, with a genome comprising 4 negative-stranded RNAs) and <italic>Rice dwarf Phytoreovirus</italic> (RDV, with a genome comprising 12 double-stranded RNAs) are transmitted persistently and solely by arthropod vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hibino, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2011</xref>). Because of the global circulation of these vectors and lack of virus resistance germplasms, the incidence and severity of rice viral diseases in many rice-growing regions are unpredictable. Infection by multiple viruses is also a common and severe challenge for other important crops. Therefore, developing new and effective strategies to control infection by multiple viruses for a crop, especially the prevalent food crops in the monocot group such as rice, maize, and wheat that have traditionally been under-investigated, is of paramount importance for human food sustainability. Successful development of such strategies requires a knowledge base of the mechanisms of viral infection and host defense responses.</p><p>The rice genome encodes five DCLs and 19 AGOs. How different AGOs regulate antiviral RNAi in rice is not known. In this study, we report a critical role of RNAi in antiviral defense in rice under natural infection conditions, when the plants were inoculated, as in the field, by viruliferous insect vectors brown planthopper (<italic>Laodelphax striatellus</italic>) and leafhopper (<italic>Nephotettix cincticeps</italic>) that transmit RSV and RDV, respectively. Intriguingly, we found that AGO18, a member of a new AGO clade that is conserved in monocots, is specifically induced by the infection of two taxonomically different viruses and is required for the antiviral function of AGO1. Loss-of-function <italic>ago18</italic> mutation abolishes, whereas over-expression of AGO18 increases, the AGO1 antiviral activity. We further demonstrated that AGO18 competes with AGO1 for binding miR168, resulting in elevated levels of AGO1 in the infected plants to enable antiviral defense. Expression of an miR168-resistant <italic>AGO1a</italic> variant in the <italic>ago18</italic> background rescues or increases rice antiviral activity. The antiviral function of AGO18 requires its small RNA-binding, not slicing activity. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism AGO1 homeostasis regulation by AGO18 for antiviral defense and have significant implications in understanding the evolutionary amplification of RNA silencing mechanisms and in developing novel antiviral strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A role for AGO1 in rice antiviral immunity under natural infection conditions</title><p>Our understanding of RNAi as an antiviral defense mechanism in plants mainly comes from viral infection systems involving model plants <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> by mechanical inoculation with virions or in vitro viral RNA transcripts or by agro-infiltration with viral cDNAs.

We found that AGO18 was induced only in the transgenic lines that over-expressed CP, but not in those that over-expressed three other viral proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that RSV CP is an effector to induce AGO18 expression during viral infection.</p><p>The induction of AGO18 expression by RSV infection prompted us to investigate its function in antiviral defense.

We further profiled small RNAs in AGO18 complexes prepared from RSV-infected plants using deep sequencing. For comparison, small RNAs in total extracts, AGO1a, and AGO1b complexes were also profiled in parallel. We found that vsiRNAs accounted for about 4.48% of the total small RNAs in RSV-infected plants and 17.37%–9.77% of those in the AGO1a and AGO1b complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>), indicating that vsiRNAs are highly enriched in the AGO1 complexes.

Building upon the conserved core components of the RNA silencing machinery such as DCLs and AGOs, plants have evolved extensive variants of these components, especially AGOs. This evolutionary amplification of the machinery components implies amplification/diversification in regulatory mechanisms/functions. While the roles of some AGOs in specific functions of RNA silencing in gene regulation and innate immunity have been well studied, the roles of most AGOs remain unknown or poorly understood. Besides AGO1, only the slicing function of AGO2 appears to be also important for antiviral defense in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harvey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaubert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scholthof et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carbonell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2014</xref>). Current studies on the roles of several <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AGOs in antiviral defense are dictated by the target RNA-slicing paradigm.</p><p>In the arms race between host defense and viral counter-defense, plant viruses have evolved various strategies, including encoding suppressors of RNA silencing, to interfere with different steps of the host RNA silencing defense pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding and Voinnet, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding, 2010</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, infection by many viruses leads to increased levels of <italic>AGO1</italic> mRNA readying the plants to combat viruses, but the viruses also simultaneously increase the expression levels of miR168 to down-regulate AGO1 to defeat host defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Várallyay et al., 2010</xref>). RSV infection of rice also leads to an increase in miR168 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, elevated miR168 expression appears to be a broad mechanism of viral counter-defense.</p><p>In this study, we discovered a novel mechanism of positive regulation of AGO1 activity by AGO18 in antiviral RNAi. We showed that AGO18 does not have antiviral function by itself, but its presence is required for the antiviral function of AGO1. AGO18 accomplishes this not via its slicing function but through its competition with AGO1 for binding miR168. This binding inhibits miR168-mediated auto-regulation of AGO1, thereby boosting the accumulation levels of AGO1 to enable antiviral function. Thus, AGO18 has evolved as a novel and dedicated positive regulator of the plant surveillance/defense system. Our findings suggest that AGO18-bound miR168 is not competent in cleaving <italic>AGO1</italic> mRNA in RSV-infected rice plants, albeit AGO18 contains conserved DDH motif for slicing activity. Several possible mechanisms can be considered. First, the catalytic activity of AGO18 may not be as potent as that of AGO1 due to some sequence/structure differences between these two AGOs. Second, the slicing activity of AGO18 may be repressed by a yet-to-be-identified protein that specifically interacts with AGO18. Third, the cellular compartmentation of AGO18/miR168 complex may be distinct from that of AGO1/miR168 and prevent its access to <italic>AGO1</italic> mRNA. Finally, AGO18 binding of miR168 may subsequently induce the degradation of miR168. It will be highly interesting to test these possibilities in future studies.</p><p>There were previous examples of competitive binding of other miRNAs between other AGOs and AGO1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. miR168 can be incorporated into AGO10 to decrease the translation efficiency of <italic>AGO1</italic> mRNA in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mallory et al., 2009</xref>). The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> miR166/165 are significantly enriched in AGO10-bound miRNAs, preventing them from being loaded into AGO1 to fulfill their normal roles in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ji et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manavella et al., 2011</xref>). MiR390 is associated with AGO7 to mediated trans-acting siRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montgomery et al., 2008</xref>), through cooperative activity of AGO1. In addition, miR408 associates with both AGO1 and AGO2 redundantly to regulate <italic>Plantacyanin</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maunoury and Vaucheret, 2011</xref>). This competition, however, does not affect AGO1 homeostasis. In contrast to these negative regulations of AGO1, binding of miR168 by AGO18 in infected rice plants boosts AGO1 accumulation. Thus, among mechanisms of AGO-regulation of AGO1 homeostasis or activity, the up-regulation of AGO1 via AGO18 binding of miR168 represents a novel type of mechanism. Whether other AGOs function similarly in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, and other plants to up-regulate AGO1 or another AGO to impact developmental processes or defense responses is an outstanding question to be addressed in future studies. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to miR168, several miRNAs including miR528, miR159a, and miR159b were also recruited by AGO18 in RSV-infected rice plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>). Thus, for AGO18, we cannot rule out the possibility that AGO18 plays regulatory roles in other capacities or has its own independent biological functions.</p><p>It is important to emphasize that most plant viruses are transmitted to plants by insect vectors under natural infection conditions in the field, and yet the vast majority of studies so far on the mechanisms of RNA silencing-mediated antiviral responses employed infection methods such as mechanical inoculation with in vitro viral RNA transcripts or virions and infiltration with agrobacteria carrying engineered viral DNAs. These studies often used viral delivery methods with much higher levels of inoculum than natural field conditions. How some of such manipulations would alter host responses remains an outstanding question. Here, we used insect vectors that carry the natural forms of viruses to inoculate plants, best reflecting what happens under field infection conditions with regard to the behavior of viruses and host responses. This is not only important to dissect the natural infection and defense mechanisms, but also important for developing effective technologies to combat viral infection under natural infection conditions. Recent studies indicated that natural infection in early stage of virus infection may trigger different host-defense reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>AGO18 is of special interest because it has evolved as a conserved clade in monocots that encompass many important crop plants for foods and biofuels. Whether it plays a similar role in antiviral defense in other monocots warrants further investigations. From a broader perspective, we expect that further studies on the extensive RNA silencing machinery components evolved in crop plants may lead to new discoveries about their functions in shaping plant diversity with regard to phenotypes and innate immunity mechanisms. Finally, sequestering miR168 by AGO18 to regulate AGO1 homeostasis represents an evolutionary novelty. It raises the question of whether small RNA competition-based regulations between other types of proteins have also evolved to regulate different biological processes in plants and other organisms. This mechanism functions against infection by two evolutionarily distinct viruses, and likely has broader significance in resistance against more viruses in a wide range of monocots. We propose that engineering rice and other cereals to over-express AGO18 may provide a new strategy for the control of diverse viral pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant growth and virus inoculation</title><p>Plant growth and virus inoculation were essentially carried out as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2011</xref>).

The major reservations are that:</p><p>1) The concept described overlaps with the previously described AGO1-AGO10 competition;</p><p>2) The study is incomplete. Some obvious experiments have not been done include (but are not restricted to) the use of miR168 resistant AGO1 mRNA and analysis of AGO2;</p><p>3) The fact that all RNAi lines (DCL1, DCL2, DCL3a, DCL3b, DCL4, AGO1) have the same phenotype, raising the possibility that there is interference of transgene RNAi and antiviral RNAi.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>The paper confirms that RNA silencing mediates defense against RSV and RDV delivered by insect vectors. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> confirms that several DCL proteins and AGO1 are required as in the canonical RNA silencing pathway. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> data implicates a monocot conserved AGO18 in this antiviral silencing. The AGO18 promoter is induced in infected plants and the mutants are hypersusceptible to virus infection. Conversely the overexpressing plants are less susceptible to infection than the control. However the AGO18 does not bind viral siRNA as effectively as AGO1 and a simple role of this unusual AGO in straightforward RNA silencing is ruled out. The AGO18 bound RNAs are instead enriched for miR168 relative to AGO1. The role of miR168 is to silence the mRNA for AGO1 and so the data are consistent with a model in which AGO18 is a negative regulator of a negative regulator of AGO1. Data to support this model are from: Competition experiments showing that overexpression of AGO18 competed with AGO1 for binding of overexpressed miR168 but not miR443 and from the findings that a mutant AGO18 with defective miRNA binding was not able to complement the mutant phenotype but the protein with inactivating mutations in the nuclease active site did.</p><p>Overall these are nicely executed experiments although I would say that the obvious and most direct test of the hypothesis with a miR168 resistant AGO1 message is conspicuously absent. The data also do not test the prediction that AGO18 induction in virus-infected plants would mediate overexpression of AGO1 and that the timing of the effect would precede the maximal rate of virus accumulation. The finding that the plant AGO-mediated antiviral silencing can be enhanced in virus-infected plants is not new and the decoy AGO mechanism is also not novel although it was described previously in a different context. Taking the sum of these considerations my view is that the paper in its present form is more suited to a specialist journal.</p><p>There are several interesting features in this paper that could be followed up to make a new paper that might be more appropriate to <italic>eLife</italic>. It would be interesting to know for example about the features of AGO18 that differentiate it from other AGO clades and to know more about the regulation of AGO18 in virus-infected plants. Specific questions would concern the role of insect vectors in the activation of this gene and the possibility (implied by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) that there is a systemic signal associated with its induction. We know about signals induced in disease resistant plants but this would be a signal in susceptible plants. Is it an RNA or perhaps it is a JA response induced by the insect vectors of the virus?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>In this manuscript, Wu et al, show that AGO18, a monocot-specific member of the ARGONAUTE family, is induced during virus infection and preferentially binds to miR168, a miRNA that normally down-regulates AGO1, which has antiviral RNAi activity. Thus, AGO18 induction titrates miR168, leading to up-regulation of AGO1 and increased resistance to viruses. The data are convincing and support the authors' conclusions.</p><p>However, the authors totally ignore the contribution of AGO2, both in the bibliographic introduction and in the development of their story. Indeed, at least five papers have shown that, in addition to AGO1, AGO2 contributes to antiviral RNAi activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harvey et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scholthof et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaubert et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carbonell et al, 2012</xref>). None of these papers is referenced in the Introduction and only a brief sentence in the Discussion says that, in addition to AGO1, AGO2 also has catalytic activity against viral RNA, but there is no reference cited. The absence of investigation on AGO2 in this paper is a big concern, considering that the authors have previously shown that AGO2 is induced during virus infection, and actually more induced than AGO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al, 2011</xref>). Could AGO18 induction also lead to AGO2 up-regulation, and by which mechanism? This question needs to be addressed.</p><p>In addition, the results obtained with the <italic>dcl</italic> RNAi lines are puzzling and actually raise a number of concerns regarding the RNAi strategy. Indeed, RNAi against either DCL1, DCL2, DCL3a, DCL3b or DCL4 increases infection rates. How is this possible, given the different role of each DCL? Isn't it that the production of very large amounts of dsRNA during RNAi somehow titrates the DCL(s) required for antiviral activity? If so, the results obtained during AGO1 RNAi are also questionable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>Small RNAs (sRNAs) including miRNAs and siRNAs are a group of non-coding RNAs that regulate expression of complementary target genes. sRNAs are loaded into AGO-centered RNA inducing silencing complexes (RISCs) and guide AGO to cleave their targets. It is well-known that plants, and possibly other organisms as well, utilize RNAi system to defense themselves from virus propagation. On the other hand, viruses encode viral suppressors to block different steps of posttranscriptional gene silencing pathway (i.e. destabilizing and inhibiting AGO proteins) to counter defense the host responses. It has been also shown that some viruses evolve a mechanism that induces expression of endogenous miR168 that happens to target AGO1 effector itself, leading to suppression of RNAi so that viruses can survive.</p><p>In this paper, Wu and collaborators studied siRNA responses of plants to the RSV infection, the authors took advantage of the RSV/RDV–Oryza sativa patho-systems. These RNA viruses infect rice by a planthopper vector and establish infection by overcoming the AGO1-mediated antiviral siRNA response in the plant. Nonetheless, the sRNA machinery is highly diversified in rice, encoding 5 DCL and 18 AGO proteins, most of which have still unknown functions. Importantly, the authors opted to use the natural insect vector of the viruses in the inoculation of the plants to mimic the natural infection conditions and be able to discern important effectors in the sRNA mediated antiviral defense. They found that one AGO protein, AGO18, is specifically upregulated by virus infection and also essential for antiviral immunity. They then tried to explore the mechanism underlying AGO18 function. They found that AGO18 bound less viral-derived siRNAs compared to canonical AGO1, leading to their proposal that AGO18 is unlikely an effector protein for viruses. Because they previously published a paper that the viral infection elevate the expression of both miR168 and AGO18, they hypothesized there might be come connection between the two events. They performed a deep-seq and found that AGO18 bound a large amount of miR168 (but not the largest group), and therefore proposed a model and evidence that Ago18 maintains AGO1 level by sequestering miR168 as an antiviral strategy.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is interesting and presented lots of nice data, most of which are likely solid. It will advance the field, especially, understanding of the arms race between hosts and pathogens. This manuscript is amazingly an extension of a previous story that AGO10 specifically sequesters miR165/166 to antagonize the silencing activity of AGO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu, et al., 2011</xref>. Cell). However, there are some issues in the manuscript, some of them might be serious if not solved.</p><p>1) The authors should integrate their work in the literature context. Starting from the Introduction of well-studied AGO functions, the authors selectively emphasized their own work and ignored other elegant work (i.e. AGO7-miR390; Montgomery, et al.; 2008). Another example is that the mechanism presented here is essentially the same as the AGO10-AGO1 story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu, et al., 2011</xref>). The only difference is AGO18-AGO1 for miR168 (which happens to feedback regulate AGO1). The way the authors wrote the manuscript suggests that their discovery is completely novel, if one does not go deep through the Discussion part.</p><p>2) The manuscript missed one piece of important information: could sequestering of miR168 under AGO18 promoter through miRNA sponge or target mimicry rescue ago18 responses to viral infection?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> it is apparent an increase in AGO18 levels upon RSV infection, especially in line #5. This is unexpected given that the gene is under a constitutive promoter. Is it possible that the virus infection affects the protein stability? It is known that AGO proteins are unstable in the apo form (this is without sRNA bound), could it be possible that virus miR168 induction regulates AGO18 stability? The authors could address this issue by checking transcript and protein levels of AGO18 in OE lines before and after virus infection. Is the concurrent increase of AGO18 and miR168 upon viral infection synergetic effect?</p><p>4) In the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary File 1C</xref>, the highest accumulation of miRNA in AGO18 complexes is of miR528, which is more than 9-fold higher than in <italic>AGO1b</italic> or ∼3-fold <italic>AGO1a</italic> under virus infection. Given that miR528 is an important metabolic regulator during embryo development in rice, it seems very interesting to discuss its possible relationship to virus defense and whether AGO18 acts also as a decoy and not a silencing effector with this miRNA.</p><p>5) In the Discussion part, the authors attempted to differentiate this finding from the AGO10-AGO1 weakens, instead of strengthening, their discussion, for having evidence of this phenomenon used not only for development but as an adaptive mechanism for viral defense in a distant organism as rice, makes it ubiquitous and conserved.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Viral-Inducible Argonaute18 Confers Broad-Spectrum Virus Resistance in Rice by Sequestering A Host MicroRNA” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

As discussed in the Results section, indeed there were previous examples of competitive binding of other miRNAs between other AGOs and AGO1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. This competition, however, does not affect AGO1 homeostasis. In contrast to these negative regulations of AGO1 activities, binding of miR168 by AGO18 in infected rice plants directly boosts AGO1 accumulation. Thus, among mechanisms of AGO-regulation of AGO1 homeostasis or activity, the up-regulation of AGO1 via AGO18 binding of miR168 represents a novel type of mechanism.

Taking the sum of these considerations my view is that the paper in its present form is more suited to a specialist journal</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the role of some AGOs in antiviral defense has been well demonstrated. However, our findings indicate that we are still far from understanding the mechanisms and that the field is still open for important new discoveries. We would like to discuss the novelty and importance of our work from three perspectives. First, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the antiviral function of AGO1 requires the presence of another AGO. This represents an evolutionary novelty, at least in the monocots. Given the amplification and diversification of AGOs and other RNA silencing machinery components, our finding adds another important new layer of regulatory mechanism for studies on the evolution and mechanisms of RNA silencing machinery.</p><p>Second, the well-studied AGO1 and AGO2 are effectors of vsiRNAs and use their slicing activity in antiviral response. In contrast, AGO18 functions in a different mechanism – not through its slicing activity but through its small RNA binding activity. In the host defense field, this is a novel mechanism of AGO function.</p><p>Third, for the comment that “decoy AGO mechanism is also not novel”, we feel there is a major difference between our finding and previous findings to make it novel and interesting. As discussed, indeed there were previous examples of competitive binding of other miRNAs between other AGOs and AGO1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. This competition, however, does not affect AGO1 homeostasis. In contrast to these negative regulations of AGO1 activities, binding of miR168 by AGO18 in infected rice plants directly boosts AGO1 accumulation.

Another example is that the mechanism presented here is essentially the same as the AGO10-AGO1 story (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59"><italic>Zhu, et al., 2011</italic></xref><italic>). The only difference is AGO18-AGO1 for miR168 (which happens to feedback regulate AGO1). The way the authors wrote the manuscript suggests that their discovery is completely novel, if one does not go deep through the Discussion part</italic>.</p><p>As we responded to a similar comment from reviewer #1 above, we have discussed our findings in the context of previous findings in the main text. We believe our finding adds a new and important layer regulatory mechanism of AGO functions that is of high and broad interest.</p><p><italic>2) The manuscript missed one piece of important information</italic>: <italic>could sequestering of miR168 under AGO18 promoter through miRNA sponge or target mimicry rescue ago18 responses to viral infection?</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s great suggestion on the experiment to test whether AGO18 acts through miR168 regulation of AGO1 to confer viral resistance. We totally agree that results from the suggested experiment will be very informative. However, it takes more than one year to generate stable transgenic rice. Before we obtain these transgenic lines, we hope we can convince this reviewer that AGO18 plays its role in viral resistance through miR168 regulation of AGO1 by providing several lines of evidence: 1) AGO18 and AGO1 are both induced by RSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>); 2) AGO18 competes with AGO1 for binding miR168 both in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); 3) upregulation of AGO1 by viral infection is compromised in <italic>ago18</italic> mutant; and 4) our new data showing that the expression of miR168-resistant <italic>AGO1a</italic> rescued the deficiency of <italic>ago18</italic> for viral resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B, C and D</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2H</italic></xref> <italic>it is apparent an increase in AGO18 levels upon RSV infection, especially in line #5</italic>. <italic>This is unexpected given that the gene is under a constitutive promoter. Is it possible that the virus infection affects the protein stability? It is known that AGO proteins are unstable in the apo form (this is without sRNA bound), could it be possible that virus miR168 induction regulates AGO18 stability? The authors could address this issue by checking transcript and protein levels of AGO18 in OE lines before and after virus infection. Is the concurrent increase of AGO18 and miR168 upon viral infection synergetic effect?</italic></p><p>We apologize for this confusion. We have repeated twice the Western blot experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and realized that the lower AGO18 level in line #5 in the original figure was most likely due to inefficient transfer of protein to the membrane. We have replaced the figure with new Western blot results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). As the reviewer suggested, we have also measured the mRNA and protein levels of AGO18 in OE lines before and after RSV infection by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. We found that there was a mild increase in both AGO18 mRNA and protein levels in AGO18 OE lines upon RSV infection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). Such increase is very likely attributed to the expression of endogenous AGO18 induced by RSV.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-05733-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>4) In the</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data"><italic>Supplementary file 1C</italic></xref><italic>, the highest accumulation of miRNA in AGO18 complexes is of miR528, which is more than 9-fold higher than in</italic> AGO1b <italic>or ∼3-fold</italic> AGO1a <italic>under virus infection. Given that miR528 is an important metabolic regulator during embryo development in rice, it seems very interesting to discuss its possible relationship to virus defense and whether AGO18 acts also as a decoy and not a silencing effector with this miRNA.</italic></p><p>We have been discussed this in the main text.</p><p><italic>5) In the Discussion part, the authors attempted to differentiate this finding from the AGO10-AGO1 weakens, instead of strengthening, their discussion, for having evidence of this phenomenon used not only for development but as an adaptive mechanism for viral defense in a distant organism as rice, makes it ubiquitous and conserved</italic>.</p><p>As described above, we have revised our discussions to clarify how our findings add a new layer of regulatory mechanism to AGO functions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>We appreciate the favorable comments made by the Senior and Reviewing editors. In the revised manuscript, we have provided additional data or explanations to address some minor concerns raised by the two editors. We wish the revisions are sufficient and the manuscript is now acceptable for publication. Point-by-point responses are listed below.</p><p><italic>1) We strongly recommended removal of the</italic> dcl <italic>mutant analysis as the interpretation is not conclusive and the data are not required for the interpretation of the AGO18 analysis.</italic></p><p>As recommended, we have removed the data and text about the <italic>dcl</italic> mutant analyses.</p><p><italic>2) We recommend a brief discussion of the follow points</italic>:</p><p><italic>a) What is the proposed fate of the AGO18 bound miR168</italic>?</p><p>We have added the following paragraph in the Discussion: “Our findings suggest that AGO18-bound miR168 are not competent in cleaving <italic>AGO1</italic> mRNA in RSV-infected rice plants […]. It will be highly interesting to test these possibilities in future studies.”</p><p><italic>b) What is the sensing mechanism of viral RNA that triggers AGO18 expression</italic>?</p><p>After submitting the manuscript, we obtained new data to address this question. We examined the possibility that viral proteins produced during infection induce AGO18 expression. To do this, we generated transgenic rice plants that over-express Myc-tagged RSV P2, CP, pC4 and P4 proteins, respectively. We found that AGO18 was induced only in the transgenic lines that over-expressed CP, but not in those that over-expressed three other viral proteins. This suggests that RSV CP is an effector to induce AGO18 expression during viral infection. These new results are included in a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
