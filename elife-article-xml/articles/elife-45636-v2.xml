animals is challenging, in part because the timing of sensory inputs is affected by the animal’s behavior. To address this challenge in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> we developed the Sip-Triggered Optogenetic Behavior Enclosure (‘STROBE’). The STROBE is a closed-looped system for real-time optogenetic activation of feeding flies, designed to evoke neural excitation coincident with food contact. We previously demonstrated the STROBE’s utility in probing the valence of fly sensory neurons (Jaeger et al., 2018). Here we provide a thorough characterization of the STROBE system, demonstrate that STROBE-driven behavior is modified by hunger and the presence of taste ligands, and find that mushroom body dopaminergic input neurons and their respective post-synaptic partners drive opposing feeding behaviors following activation. Together, these results establish the STROBE as a new tool for dissecting fly feeding circuits and suggest a role for mushroom body circuits in processing naïve taste responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>taste circuits</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>feeding behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2016-03857</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Michael D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPAS-49246-16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Michael D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Sip-Triggered Optogenetic Behavior Enclosure (STROBE) produces robust behaviors via activation of peripheral or central neurons in the fly, and mimics key features of feeding driven by chemical taste ligands.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has emerged as a leading model for understanding sensory processing related to food approach, avoidance, and consumption behaviors. However, although the gustatory system is recognized as mediating a critical final checkpoint in determining food suitability, much remains to be learned about the neural circuits that process taste information in the fly brain.</p><p>Like mammals, flies detect several taste modalities, each of which promotes food acceptance or rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yarmolinsky et al., 2009</xref>). Taste compounds activate gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) localized on the fly’s proboscis, legs, wings, and ovipositor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scott, 2018</xref>). Among the different classes of GRNs present, cells expressing the Gustatory Receptor Gr64f respond to sweet compounds and induce strong acceptance behavior. Conversely, GRNs labeled by Gr66a respond to bitter compounds and evoke avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dahanukar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dahanukar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thorne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2004</xref>).

Memory formation occurs mainly in a central brain structure called the mushroom body (MB), composed of ~2000 Kenyon cells per hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heisenberg et al., 1985</xref>). The MBs receive sensory information that is assigned a positive or negative output valence via coincident input from dopaminergic neurons (DANs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Waddell, 2010</xref>). Little is known about how taste information is relayed to the MBs, but taste projection neurons (TPNs) connected to bitter GRNs indirectly drive activation of the paired posterior lateral cluster 1 (PPL1) DANs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). PPL1 neurons signal punishment to MBs and are required for aversive taste memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Claridge-Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kirkhart and Scott, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Masek et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, the protocerebrum anterior medial (PAM) cluster of DANs signals rewarding information and is involved in the formation of appetitive memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huetteroth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamagata et al., 2015</xref>). Although they have well-established roles in memory formation, PPL1 and PAM involvement in feeding has not been extensively investigated.</p><p>Kenyon cells and DANs make connections to specific mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) within discrete compartments of the MBs. MBONs project to protocerebral integration centers and are required for memory formation and retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouzaiane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felsenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ichinose et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Masek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Plaçais et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Séjourné et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>). An emerging model is that DAN/MBON pairs innervating a specific MB compartment produce behavioral responses of opposing valence, and that KC-MBON synapses in that compartment are depressed upon DAN activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felsenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Séjourné et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>). While MBONs are known to modulate innate behaviors such as taste sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Masek et al., 2015</xref>) and food seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsao et al., 2018</xref>), the possible contribution of MB input and output circuits to feeding behavior remains unclear.</p><p>Manipulating neural activity is a powerful method for assessing neural circuit function. Silencing neuron populations in freely behaving flies, which forces the neurons into a chronic ‘off’ state to mimic a situation where the fly never encounters an activating stimulus, is a straightforward way to determine their necessity in feeding. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gordon and Scott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LeDue et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pool et al., 2014</xref>). However, gain-of-function experiments for feeding and taste, or any other actively sensed stimulus, are more complicated. Behaviors produced by forcing a neuron into a stimulus- and behavior-independent ‘on’ state can be difficult to interpret. The possible exception is activation of a neuron that elicits a stereotyped motor program, but even these situations are more easily interpreted in a tethered fly where the effect of a single activation can be monitored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Dahanukar, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gordon and Scott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Masek et al., 2015</xref>). To effectively probe the sufficiency of neuron activation during feeding events, it would be ideal to temporally couple activation with feeding.</p><p>Recently, three new systems for closed-loop optogenetic control of feeding flies have emerged: the optoPAD and STROBE, developed as additions to the FlyPAD system; and the optoFLIC, built on the FLIC platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jaeger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">May et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moreira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Steck et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we provide a more extensive characterization of the STROBE and its utility. We demonstrate that coincident activation of sweet GRNs with feeding on agar drives appetitive behavior, and bitter GRN activation elicits aversion. These effects are modulated by starvation and can be inhibited by the presence of chemical taste ligands of the same modality. We also show that activation of central feeding circuit neurons produces repetitive, uncontrolled food interactions, demonstrating the STROBE’s efficacy in manipulating both peripheral and central neurons. We then establish that activation of PPL1 neurons negatively impacts feeding, while activating PAM neurons promotes it. Finally, in agreement with mushroom body circuit models, activating MBONs drives feeding responses in opposition to the DANs from the same MB compartment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The STROBE triggers light activation temporally coupled with food interactions</title><p>The FlyPAD produces capacitance signals that reflect a fly’s interaction with food in either of two sensors (or ‘channels’) in a small arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Itskov et al., 2014</xref>). When a fly physically bridges the two electrodes of a sensor by standing on one electrode and making contact with food sitting on the other, it produces a rise in capacitance. This signal, which is acquired at 100 Hz, is then decoded <italic>post hoc</italic> by an algorithm designed to identify sipping events. We designed the STROBE to track the raw capacitance signal in real-time and trigger lighting within the arena during sips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

If the capacitance surpasses a set threshold above the minimum value recorded within the preceding 10 cycles (100 ms), the LED is turned on and remains illuminated until the threshold is no longer exceeded. By definition, this means that elevated plateaus of capacitance that last longer than 100 ms will produce a lighting response only within the first 100 ms. Because this algorithm is run on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), the signal to lighting transition times are theoretically on the order of tens of milliseconds, providing a rapid response following the initiation of a sip. We confirmed the short latency of activation with a wire standing in for the fly’s proboscis. Based on video captured at 178 frames per second, the latency of LED activation following a touch was 37 ± 17 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This latency is short enough to ensure LED triggering during sips, which generally last longer than 100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Itskov et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, video of flies feeding in the STROBE, shot at 60 frames per second, consistently showed light activation in the same frame as the fly’s proboscis fully extending onto the food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-45636-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45636.006</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>This movie shows an individual fly feeding on the light-triggering food in a STROBE arena.</title></caption></media><p>The STROBE records the state of the lighting activation system (on/off) and transmits this information through USB to the PC, where it is received and interpreted by a custom end-user program. This program displays the capacitance signals from each fly arena in real-time, as well as its lighting state. It also counts the number of LED activations over the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). To confirm that the STROBE algorithm triggers the LED during sips detected by the original <italic>post hoc</italic> FlyPAD algorithm, we first used both algorithms to analyze the capacitance signal from a short (~11 s) feeding bout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Visually, this showed that each time a sip is detected with the FlyPAD algorithm, the STROBE algorithm triggers the LED at a similar time. However, we also noted that the STROBE algorithm triggers more LED activations than the number of sips called by the FlyPAD algorithm. We confirmed these observations on a larger scale by examining the correlation between the output of each algorithm in 1 min bins across a full 1 hr experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Here, there is a strong correlation between the two (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.963), with the number of LED illuminations triggered by the STROBE algorithm being about 1.4 times the number of sips detected by the FlyPAD algorithm. This increased number is likely the consequence of the FlyPAD algorithm filtering out capacitance changes not adhering to certain criteria of shape and duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Itskov et al., 2014</xref>). Since these parameters are, by definition, unknown at sip onset, the STROBE cannot use them as criteria. Thus, we expect that a fraction of LED activations in the STROBE are actually triggered by more fleeting interactions with the food. Indeed, video of flies in the STROBE confirmed that a subset of leg touches triggered light activation (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Thus, we defined each LED activation as representing a food ‘interaction’, the majority of which are sips. Since flies detect tastes on multiple body parts, including the legs, even non-sip interactions are likely still relevant to taste processing and feeding initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Activation of GRNs modifies feeding behavior</title><p>To validate the utility of the STROBE, we first tested flies expressing CsChrimson, a red-light activated channel, in either sweet or bitter GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>). Flies were given the choice between two identical neutral food options (plain agar), one of which triggered light activation. Under these conditions, flies expressing functional CsChrimson in sweet neurons under the control of <italic>Gr64f-GAL4</italic> showed a dramatic preference towards feeding on the light-triggering food, while control flies of the same genotype that were not pre-fed all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinal, and thus carried non-functional CsChrimson, displayed no preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E</xref>). The number of interactions on the light-triggering side of the chamber was dependent on light intensity, with increasing interactions up 6.5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, above which interaction numbers decreased as a function of intensity. However, preference was relatively stable above a threshold of 1.85 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). Additionally, interactions generally accumulated linearly over time at all intensities, with a stable preference index established within the first 15 min of a one-hour experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that neither sensitization nor adaptation occurs during the course of the experiment. Moreover, the flies do not appear to adjust their behavior in response to the perceived mismatch between the sweet taste and lack of energy content of the food source.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45636.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Activation of sweet and bitter sensory neurons drives feeding preferences in the STROBE.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescent detection of <italic>UAS-CsChrimson.mVenus</italic> driven by <italic>Gr64f-GAL4</italic>.

Once again the behavioral response was intensity-dependent, with maximum suppression of interactions occurring at the highest intensity tested (16.4 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>). As with sweet GRN activation, the flies’ preference develops in roughly the first 15 min and remains relatively stable for the rest of the hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since the light intensities eliciting maximal effect for Gr64f and the Gr66a activation are 6.5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> and 16.4 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, we decided to use the intermediate value of 11.2 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> as the intensity for all further experiments. Using a full set of genotypic and non-retinal controls, we confirmed that these conditions produced robust and specific preference behaviors for both sweet and bitter GRN activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Next, we sought to test whether GRN activation affects feeding per se, rather than simply driving non-ingestive food interactions.

We then calculated a <italic>post hoc</italic> preference based on the number of individual flies showing blue versus red dye in their abdomen following the assay, and compared this to the preference calculated based on food interactions measured by the STROBE. In all cases, these studies confirmed that the changes in food interactions driven by GRN activation are accompanied by strong effects on food ingestion in the expected direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Starvation modulates the behavioral impact of GRN activation</title><p>Starvation duration has a well-known impact on fly feeding – the longer flies are food deprived, the more they will initiate and sustain feeding on sweet foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scheiner et al., 2004</xref>).

Consistent with its effect on sugar feeding, starvation increased flies’ preference for the light-triggering food in the STROBE when their sweet neurons expressed functional CsChrimson (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This elevated preference index is driven by a dramatic increase in interaction number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Indeed, adding increasing concentrations of sucrose to both food options caused dose-dependent inhibition of <italic>GR64f &gt; CsChrimson</italic> flies’ preference for the light-triggering food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). This change is driven by a progressively higher number of interactions on the no-light side, with relatively constant interaction numbers on the light side as sucrose concentration increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). On the other hand, the addition of sucrose mildly enhanced the negative preferences driven by STROBE activation of Gr66a bitter neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Consistent with these results, activation of PAM γ3 neurons (<italic>MB441B-GAL4</italic> and <italic>MB195B-GAL4</italic>) in the STROBE produced light avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), while activating the corresponding β’1,γ3 MBONs (<italic>MB083C-GAL4</italic> and <italic>MB110C-GAL4</italic>) was attractive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, PAMs targeting different MB compartments can be either attractive or aversive in the context of feeding.</p><p>Finally, we chose the PPL1 cluster and their corresponding MBONs to examine the impact of MB circuits on feeding in greater detail. First, we asked whether the interaction preferences driven by activating these populations reflected genuine changes in feeding behavior. Strikingly, dye ingestion in the STROBE consistently produced stronger measures of preference than those calculated with interaction numbers, mirroring the effects seen with GRN activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This was true across a range of stimulus intensities, even when the differences in interaction numbers were quite low. Interestingly, in contrast to sweet GRN stimulation, which elicited peak interaction numbers midway in the series of intensities tested, <italic>MB026B-GAL4</italic> MBON activation produced linearly increasing interactions across the range of intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Second, given the important role that PPL1s play in aversive conditioning, we examined whether activation of either population caused a shift in behavior over the course of the one-hour assay. However, as with GRN activation, relative interaction numbers remained quite stable throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>). Third, we tested whether silencing each population with expression of the inward rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1 would affect feeding behavior. After disabling LED activation in the STROBE, we counted flies’ interactions with either a low concentration of sucrose or plain agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). This failed to reveal an effect of PPL1 or MBON silencing on food choice, indicating that, while activation of these populations is sufficient to affect food choice, they are not necessary in the particular task tested.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45636.032</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Activation of mushroom body circuits drives ingestion behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the PPL1 driver used.

The primary advantage of the STROBE over existing systems for neural activation during fly feeding is its temporal resolution, which provides two key benefits. First, acutely activating neurons while the fly is choosing to interact with one of two available food sources allows us to explore the impact of neural activation on food selection in a way that is impossible with chronic activation. Second, by tightly coupling stimulation with food interaction events, light-driven activity from the STROBE should more closely mimic the temporal dynamics of taste input. Conceptually, these advantages are similar to those achieved by expression of the mammalian TRPV1 in taste sensory neurons and lacing food with capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caterina et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Dahanukar, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marella et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, however, the STROBE allows activation of either peripheral or central neurons.</p><p>The implementation of interaction detection and light triggering on an FPGA allows the STROBE to trigger LED activation with minimal latency, well within the time frame of a single sip. Thus, neural excitation is tightly locked to the onset and offset of food interactions, providing the means to manipulate circuits during active feeding. Our decision to implement an algorithm that terminates illumination during capacitance plateaus exceeding 100 ms has both advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is avoiding the LED becoming ‘stuck’ in the on state during shifts in baseline capacitance that could result in constant illumination for seconds or even minutes during which the fly may not be interacting with the food. A possible disadvantage is LED illumination that does not last the entirety of an interaction. This could produce insufficient activation to mimic specific properties of long sips. It could also result in suboptimal light-mediated silencing, although the efficacy of neural inhibition in the STROBE has not been tested.</p><p>These temporal qualities of light triggering are the primary difference between the STROBE and another recently described optogenetic FlyPAD, termed ‘optoPAD’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moreira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Steck et al., 2018</xref>). OptoPAD carries out sip detection and light control on a USB-connected computer. The benefits of this strategy are the ability to implement a more complex feeding detection algorithm, and more flexible control of the lighting response timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moreira et al., 2019</xref>). However, the tradeoff is longer and more variable latencies of LED activation. Moreover, the set illumination period further decouples the timing of illumination from the fly’s behavior. Each of these systems may have specific advantages, depending on the application. While they have not been directly compared, it is likely that tight temporal coupling of the STROBE to food contact will be more useful for studying the effects of acutely activating core taste and feeding circuit neurons, while the longer, adjustable, light pulse from the optogenetic FlyPAD may be better for silencing neurons or activating reinforcement circuits.</p><p>Interestingly, similar closed-loop optogenetic paradigms have recently been developed for rodents. Lick-triggered blue light stimulation of taste receptor cells or circuits in the amygdala is sufficient to drive appetitive and aversive taste behaviors in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zocchi et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the same principle is able to reveal important insight into consummatory behaviors in multiple animals.</p><p>Although optogenetic neuronal activation is artificial, light-driven behavior in the STROBE shows some important properties that mimic natural feeding. For example, the number of food interactions evoked by stimulation of sweet sensory neurons increased in response to starvation, demonstrating a dependence on internal state that mirrors what is seen for sugar feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scheiner et al., 2004</xref>). One curious observation is that the number of interactions driven by activation of sweet neurons peaks at a sub-maximal stimulus intensity, with fewer interactions observed at higher levels of illumination. Compensatory decreases in feeding are known to occur at high food concentrations, but this is likely from consumption of nutrients that are not present in the STROBE experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deshpande et al., 2014</xref>). Since we observe no evidence of sensory-specific satiety over the time course of our experiments, we suspect that suppression of interactions may occur either from non-physiological neuron responses at high intensities or an interaction between visual cues from the increased light intensity and the sweet taste-mediated attraction. Regardless of the mechanism, the non-linear intensity-dependence of sweet neuron activation contrasts with that of bitter neurons and the MB neurons tested, which all show the largest behavioral responses at the highest light intensity. This demonstrates the important practical point that different neuron types can produce maximal effects at different stimulus intensities. Thus, it will be important for anyone using the STROBE or a similar optogenetic system to carefully calibrate the light intensity for their specific neurons of interest with the goal of matching either the neurons’ physiological responses, or the animals’ behavioral responses, to natural stimuli.</p><p>We also showed that the behavioral impact of sweet and bitter GRN activation in the STROBE could be abolished by the presence of natural taste ligands. Interestingly, this property did not generally hold true for attraction mediated by PAM or appetitive MBON activation, which was typically similar in the presence or absence of sugar. This may suggest that sweet taste input and PAM or MBON activation drive attraction via parallel circuits, producing an additive effect when both are present. Or perhaps suppression would be observed at higher sucrose concentrations or lower light intensities. It is also notable that flies preferred 1 M sucrose alone over 1 M sucrose coupled to optogenetic activation of sweet GRNs. We suspect that optogenetic activation of sweet GRNs in the STROBE plateaus below the excitation achieved with 1 M sucrose, and somehow prevents further activation by very high sugar concentrations. We favor this interpretation over the alternative that the combination of 1 M sucrose with optogenetic activation of sweet neurons becomes ‘too sweet’; however, both remain formally possible.</p><p>One interesting question is whether the valence of GRN activation in the STROBE is mediated by hedonics or effects on the feeding program itself. For example, sweet neuron activation is thought to carry appetitive hedonics, and therefore the flies may continue feeding because consequent light activation of Gr64f neurons is somehow pleasurable. On the other hand, these neurons also initiate feeding (and conversely, activation of Gr66a neurons terminates it). Thus, it is possible that each food contact evokes light-driven activation of a subsequent contact, and so on, creating a positive feedback loop. This is undoubtedly true of Fdg neuron activation, which is known to initiate a complete feeding sequence, likely downstream of any hedonic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flood et al., 2013</xref>). Flies appear to become ‘trapped’ in a feeding loop until the end of the experiment, suggested by the very high number of evoked food interactions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Activation of MB input and output neurons also modulates feeding in the STROBE. PPL1 stimulation in the STROBE produces avoidance, while appetitive PAM stimulation produces attraction, consistent with the established valence of each population in memory formation and a previously reported role for PAMs in foraging behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Das et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huetteroth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kirkhart and Scott, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Landayan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Masek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamagata et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, MBON activation drives feeding behavior in the opposite direction to activation of DANs from the same compartment. This relationship supports the current model that DAN activity depresses KC to MBON synapses in their respective compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felsenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Séjourné et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, not all PAM neurons convey a positive signal upon activation. PAM γ3 neurons are excited by electric shocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>) and inhibited by sucrose stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamagata et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings that PAM γ3 activation drives aversive feeding behavior is consistent with these neurons signaling negative valence to the MBs. Finally, it is worth noting that, although silencing experiments failed to reveal any requirement for PPL1s and their post-synaptic MBONs in the feeding paradigm used, it is possible that effects would be seen with silencing of broader neuron populations.</p><p>Although the mechanisms by which DANs affect feeding behavior remain unclear, MBONs can modulate innate behavior such as taste sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Masek et al., 2015</xref>), naïve response to odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald et al., 2015</xref>), place preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>), and food seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsao et al., 2018</xref>). Could the modulation of feeding by DAN activation result from learning? This seems unlikely with our current experimental design, as both food options were always identical, and thus there would be no predictive cues to associate with appetitive or aversive DAN stimulation. We think it is more likely that the same reward or punishment signals that underlie memory formation also acutely modify feeding behavior. However, the possibility of pairing circuit activation with specific food cues may offer a new paradigm for studying food memories, and neuronal activation via self-administration opens new avenues for the study of operant conditioning and addiction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>STROBE system</title><p>The STROBE system consists of a field programmable gate array (FPGA) controller attached to a multiplexor board, adaptor boards, fly arenas equipped with capacitive sensors and lighting circuits. The hardware, with the exception of the lighting circuit units, is based on the FlyPAD design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Itskov et al., 2014</xref>). Each fly arena is paired with a lighting circuit and an opaque curtain (to prevent interference from external light). This pair will be referred to as a fly chamber unit. The entire system accommodates 16 fly chamber units (16 fly arenas and 16 lighting circuits), through eight adaptor boards. The FPGA used is a Terasic DEV0-Nano mounted onto a custom-made multiplexor board.</p><p>The multiplexor board is one of the intermediate connection components between the fly chambers and the FPGA controller. The multiplexor board has eight 10-pin ports each of which facilitate communications between two fly chambers and the FPGA controller. The board also has a FTDI module allowing data transfer over serial communications with a computer. The other intermediate connection component is the adaptor board which connects on one side to the multiplexor board via a 10-pin line, and splits the 10-pin line from the multiplexor board into four 10-pin ports which connects to two fly arenas and two lighting circuits. The fly arena consists of two annulus shaped capacitive sensors and a Capacitance to Digital Converter (CDC) chip (AD7150BRMZ) that the main multiplexer board communicates with to initiate and collect data (and ultimately to stop collecting data). The CDC interprets and converts capacitance data from the two sensors on the fly-arena to a digital signal for the FPGA to process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Itskov et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The lighting circuit consists of a two-pin connector to receive power from an external power supply, a 10-pin connector to receive signals from the FPGA controller via the intermediate components, a 617 nm light emitting diode (LUXEON Rebel LED – 127lm @ 700mA; Luxeon Star LEDs #LXM2-PH01-0060), two power resistors (TE Connectivity Passive Product SMW24R7JT) for LED current protection, and two metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs; from Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany, IRLML0060TRPBF) allowing for voltage signal switching of the LEDs.</p><p>When a fly performs a sip and triggers a high signal on a capacitive sensor, the CDC chip on the fly arena propagates a signal via the multiplexor to the FPGA controller. The FPGA processes the capacitive sensor signal, decides a legitimate food interaction took place, and sends a high signal through the multiplexor to the MOSFET of the lighting circuit. The MOSFET then switches its lighting circuit on, allowing current to flow and turning on the monocolor LED positioned directly above the capacitive sensor. The process for determining a legitimate food interaction is described next.</p><p>In order to trigger optical stimulation with short latency upon food contact, we designed a running minima filter that operates in real-time to detect when a fly is feeding. We implemented this filter by modifying the state machine on the FPGA. When a fly feeds, its contact with the capacitance plate generates a ‘step’, or rising edge in the capacitance signal. Our filter determines the minimum signal value in the last 100 ms and checks whether the current signal value exceeds that minimum by a set threshold. This threshold (100 capacitance units) was selected to be large enough to discriminate rising edges of capacitance representing true food interactions from noise, but small enough to not miss true interactions. If this condition is true, the filter will prompt the lighting activation system to activate the LED (or keep it on if it is already on).</p><p>By design, this means that the control system will send a signal to deactivate the lighting upon the falling edge of the capacitance signal, or if the capacitance signal has plateaued for 100 ms, whichever comes sooner. At this point, a low signal is sent to the MOSFET which pinches off the current flowing through the lighting circuit, turning off the light. The signal to lighting response transition times are on the order of tens of milliseconds, providing a nearly instantaneous response.</p><p>After each lighting decision (on/off/no change), the system will then automatically record the state of the lighting activation system (on/off) and transmit this information through USB to the computer, where it is received and interpreted by a custom end-user program (built using Qt framework in C++) which can display and record both the activation state and signal measured by the STROBE system for each channel of every fly arena, in real-time.</p><p>All STROBE design materials are available as a supplemental download.</p><p>All STROBE software is available for download from Github:</p><p>FPGA code: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rcwchan/STROBE-fpga">https://github.com/rcwchan/STROBE-fpga (copy archived at </ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/STROBE-fpga">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/STROBE-fpga</ext-link>).</p><p>All other code: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rcwchan/STROBE_software/">https://github.com/rcwchan/STROBE_software/ (copy archived at </ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/STROBE_software">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/STROBE_software</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Latency measurements</title><p>A wire was attached to the outer electrode of the light-triggering channel, and agar was placed on the inner electrode as one would for a normal experiment. Video was captured at 178 frames/s, which corresponds to 5.6 ms per frame. Eight individual touches were analyzed by identifying the last frame where the wire was clearly not touching the agar. The subsequent frame was taken as the time of touch. The number of frames between the touch frame and the frame where LED activation is observed were then counted and multiplied by 5.6 ms to generate the latency of activation for that touch. We consider this a maximal estimate of latency, since the optics of the camera made close proximity and touch difficult to discriminate in some frames, in which case it was assumed that touch was occurring.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Fly strains</title><p>Fly stocks were raised on standard food at 25°C and 60% relative humidity under a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mani Ramaswami as Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes the technical features and utility of STROBE, a closed-loop stimulation system, which improves on a version of FlyPAD described by Steck et al. (2018). STROBE allows light delivery – and therefore optogenetic activation of neurons – to be temporally coupled to flies' physical interaction with agarose substrates and has good throughput. The new system has tighter coupling of the onset of the light stimulus with feeding initiation, and so may claim greater relevance to the activity of neurons directly activated by the act of feeding or tasting. By quantifying how frequently flies triggered the light pulses, one can quantify how activation of specific groups of CsChrimson-expressing neurons modifies flies' interactions with specific agar substrates. The system will be useful for the field of feeding behavior, as studying how neuronal activation can change due to taste and how it can control behavioral outputs is critical to our understanding of neural circuits and maladaptive feeding relating to human disease. The manuscript's findings that the STROBE is an important new tool for acutely probing feeding behavior questions with manipulation of peripheral taste and central associative neurons is reasonably well supported by a few important proof-of-principle experiments with STROBE such as showing that flies with CsChrimson expressed in their sweet neurons significantly increase their interaction with a sugarless agar that was coupled to light. In addition, they also use STROBE to provide some new biology by demonstrating a potential role of specific dopaminergic neurons (DANs) and mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) in regulating feeding. This is interesting because these specific DA neurons are generally known for mediating reinforcement signals (US) during learning as opposed to regulating innate behaviors.</p><p>In general, the technique appears useful but the impact of the manuscript would be improved by both technical clarifications and by some experiments using it to provide increased biological insight.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors assess the accuracy of STROBE – i.e., whether LEDs are turned on when and only when flies sip – by comparing STROBE LED activations to sips detected by FlyPAD. While an independent analysis would be better, this seems acceptable assuming the sip detection in FlyPAD was done well. It is possible however, that for the main comparison between STROBE and FlyPAD (Figure 1E), bins with no sips called by either algorithm were excluded from analysis (according to the figure legend). This may hide errors STROBE may make compared to FlyPAD and so needs to be analyzed in more detail.</p><p>2) According to the algorithm shown in Figure 1C and its description in the sixth paragraph of the subsection “STROBE System”, STROBE is designed to turn off the LED after just 100 ms during longer sips. This is also shown in Figure 1D at the end of the trace, where FlyPAD detects a long sip for which only a fraction is illuminated by STROBE. While the manuscript claims this is &quot;by design,&quot; a discussion of the impact on the experiments is required. A related issue is that in some figures the y axis was labeled &quot;sips&quot; and in some &quot;interactions.&quot; Are the two terms are used interchangeably? The writing should be clarified here.</p><p>3) While it is interesting to see that optogenetic activation of punishment-mediating and reward-mediating DANs or specific MBONs impacted fly-substrate interactions in a manner that is consistent with known properties of these neurons, two additional experiments are needed to ascertain that these neurons indeed play a role in regulating feeding. First, one should probably directly quantify food consumption triggered by STROBE activation of these neurons. Second, one should silence these neurons and assess the impact of such silencing on food consumption. (Silencing experiments need not be done with STROBE of course). This is because activation of these neurons may not affect feeding per se; rather, flies may simply seek to increase or decrease activation of these neurons by staying around the light-coupled agarose or moving away from it (as suggested by Aso et al.).</p><p>4) Why was only one intensity used to stimulate neurons following the initial studies of intensity-dependent GRN activation? Sweet GRNs, as appetitive neurons, have a U-shaped (bi-directional) response curve to increasing intensity stimuli (Figure 2D, E), while aversive neurons (bitter GRNs) have a linear negative correlation with intensity (Figure 2I, J). This clearly indicates a fundamental difference in how appetitive and aversive stimuli are processed – and may indicate that sweetness intensities above a certain concentration may have aversive side effects, so it would be more appropriate to choose different stimulus intensities for appetitive vs. aversive stimuli, instead of using one stimulus for both. Furthermore, greater intensities may affect actual neuronal function in different ways, depending on the neuronal population (or the circuits they engage). Given the absence of direct measurements of light-evoked neuronal activity and since central-brain neuron populations likely have their own response dynamics distinct from those of the peripheral systems, it seem crucial to test different intensities of light stimulation for these circuits. In the absence of this experiment, even if the behavior moves in the expected directions, there is no reason to believe that the conditions used reflect a biologically relevant stimulus (i.e., consider different patterns of activation, such as slow tonic firing, or bursting, or no APs at all but only gradual changes in membrane potential.) As the intensity chosen was higher than the &quot;optimal&quot; intensity for sweet-GRN responses (and so produced a lesser preference despite greater stimulation), could a lower intensity have had a different effect in Figure 4B? Particularly, since many in the field may base their stimulation protocols on this manuscript after publication, a more detailed and careful evaluation of stimulus intensities for the DA+ neurons and MBONs, together with a discussion of the limitations of this new analysis, will be very useful.</p><p>5) The interpretation that increasing concentrations of sucrose to both wells induces an enhancement of aversion (see text for Figure 4C) for flies with bitter-GRN activation is not entirely convincing. An alternative explanation is that the flies become more attracted to the other well – this might be true especially if the light stimulus &quot;traps&quot; a neuron in a particular firing rate regardless of additional stimuli. Increasing only the sucrose concentration in the light-coupled well would clarify this point (as would some analysis of the neuron activation due to the light stimulus if this were possible.)</p><p>6) All experiments were done within an hour, and preference was described for the full hour. However, pairing activation only of sweet taste neurons with a starved fly's interaction with a non-caloric substance like 1% agar likely only has very acute effects. How does preference change over the course of the hour? Does the fly learn that there is no energy associated with the &quot;sweet taste&quot; of the light-coupled agar? If so, is this abolished with the DAN/MBON manipulations, or does it persist? A more in-depth temporal analysis of the feeding behaviors would improve the manuscript, especially since the FlyPAD records all the data.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Closed-loop optogenetic activation of peripheral or central neurons modulates feeding in freely moving <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

First, we validated a dye-based consumption assay in the STROBE using GRN activation and saw that sweet or bitter neuron activation had the expected effects on consumption (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). We then used this assay to show that activation of PPL1 or its postsynaptic MBONs also affect consumption as predicted by the interaction numbers measured by the STROBE (Figure 7). In fact, we saw larger effects on our consumption metric than on interaction numbers in all cases.</p><p>We also performed silencing experiments on the same pair of PPL1 and MBON drivers. In this case we expressed Kir2.1 in each neuron set and measured interaction numbers and dye ingestion in the STROBE with no light stimulation (Figure 7—figure supplement 3). Flies were given a choice between 10 mM sucrose and plain agar. In this paradigm we saw no effects of PPL1 or MBON silencing on feeding, suggesting that activation of these circuits is sufficient to drive changes in feeding, but not necessary for a simple food choice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why was only one intensity used to stimulate neurons following the initial studies of intensity-dependent GRN activation?

However, we are also subject to practical limitations and must consider the cost-benefit ratio for additional experiments – for example, performing an experiment on one genotype under one condition across five light intensities requires about 25 2-hour (16 fly) experiments. Thus, performing intensity curves across five different conditions (e.g. different sucrose intensities in Figure 4B) would take 125 experiments, which would be well over a month of full-time work from one person. Given that the most likely outcome is that the curve simply shifts slightly in either direction by changing the intensities, this seems impractical.</p><p>However, we did perform intensity curves on two example mushroom body populations – the PPL1s and their postsynaptic MBONs (<italic>MB026B-Gal4</italic>). This data is now shown in Figure 7, which demonstrates that, in both cases, the effect size increases with increasing light intensities. Interestingly, unlike sweet GRN stimulation, which displays the noted U-shaped response, activation of these attractive MBONs produced linearly increasing interaction numbers across the range of intensities tested. Also, as we now point out in the text, we actually see a more noticeable effect on ingestion than we see on interaction numbers for both neuron populations tested, demonstrating that these circuits do indeed robustly affect feeding (as discussed above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The interpretation that increasing concentrations of sucrose to both wells induces an enhancement of aversion (see text for Figure 4C) for flies with bitter-GRN activation is not entirely convincing.

We have reworded this passage to be more clear. Increasing the sugar concentration on the light-triggering channel only could show us the concentration of sucrose (if there is one) that is able to overcome the aversiveness of bitter GRN stimulation. However, given that light intensity is also a variable (and the experiment number limitations discussed above), this experiment is unlikely to reveal any fundamental insight into the system (or biology). We were more interested in examining the masking of GRN stimulation by taste ligands of the same modality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) All experiments were done within an hour, and preference was described for the full hour.

As we discuss in the text, we generally see very stable relative interaction numbers (and therefore preference indices) after they are established in the first 15 minutes. This is true for peripheral and central neuron activation, and does not provide any evidence for sensitization, adaptation, or learning affecting the results we see over the course of a 1-hour experiment. This is not to say that learning does not (or cannot) occur in the STROBE, but this is an interesting avenue where, as we mention at the end of the Discussion, the STROBE could provide valuable insight in the future.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers acknowledge that the manuscript has been improved by extensive revisions.

However, we also believe that truly understanding this phenomenon is not a straightforward prospect. The effect could be from non-physiological neuron responses at high intensities; a form of sensory-induced satiety; an interaction between the “virtual” sweet taste and visual responses to the flashing lights; or a host of other factors that are likely difficult to tease apart. The intention of this experiment was to illustrate that intensity was an important variable in the response, and the reviewer is correct that we could have highlighted this more clearly in discussing both the Gr64f and DAN/MBON intensity curves. We have now described the Gr64f result in more detail and added a passage to the Discussion (Discussion, fifth paragraph) that considers possible interpretations of the Gr64f result and emphasizes the general importance of calibrating light intensity to mimic physiological and/or behavioral responses to natural stimuli.</p></body></sub-article></article>
