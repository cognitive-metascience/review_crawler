A first wave of apoptosis, peaking at embryonic day (E) 14 in the rodent cortex, is believed to select the appropriate neural clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blaschke et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">1998</xref>). A second surge of apoptosis affects the early postnatal cortex, triggering the loss of up to 50% of newly differentiated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nikolić et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dekkers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Southwell et al., 2012</xref>). Developmental cell death therefore represents an important process contributing to the establishment of the final number of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haydar et al., 1999</xref>) and ultimately to the establishment of high order complex behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The death of developing neurons is mediated by the evolutionary conserved mitochondrial pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi, 2001</xref>). In the mammalian brain, this intracellular pathway is highly regulated by proteins of the Bcl-2 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Southwell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ledonne et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shindler et al., 1997</xref>). Pro-survival factors suppress the cell death machinery and thereby prevent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Léveillé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davies, 2003</xref>). In the peripheral nervous system, neurotrophins represent the main pro-survival factors by activating the PI3K/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways, while inhibiting the JNK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kristiansen and Ham, 2014</xref>). Thus, competition for the neurotrophins released by the innervated targets ensures the matching between number of innervating neurons and size of their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Levi-Montalcini, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barde, 1989</xref>). However, experiments using transgenic mice have shown that this so-called ‘neurotrophic theory’ does not apply to the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jones et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Minichiello and Klein, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dekkers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silos-Santiago et al., 1997</xref>). In developing cortical neurons, the intracellular Akt/PI3K pathway is of particular importance to promote neuronal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wagner-Golbs and Luhmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Golbs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murase et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Datta et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bittigau et al., 2003</xref>), but the upstream factors defining the fate of single developing neurons in vivo remain unknown. In general, an increase in spontaneous activity is commonly associated with a decreased rate of apoptosis whereas a reduction of electrical activity exacerbates the number of central neurons undergoing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Golbs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murase et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ikonomidou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lebedeva et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, transplantation studies with embryonic GABAergic interneuron populations suggest that both the extent and time point of cell death in cortical inhibitory neurons are intrinsically determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Southwell et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To address the question whether neuronal identity and/or neuronal activity determines the cell fate of developing cortical neurons, we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments in early postnatal mouse cerebral cortex using immunohistochemical and electrophysiological methods. These experiments demonstrate that during a defined time window of early postnatal development, the neocortex shows clear layer- and area-disparities in the number of apoptotic neurons. By comparative analysis of two functionally distinct cortical areas displaying particularly striking differences in the number of apoptotic neurons, the primary motor cortex (M1) and primary somatosensory cortex (S1), we demonstrate that electrical activity is essential to control the number of apoptotic versus surviving neurons in an area-specific manner. We further report that somatosensory deprivation in vivo leads to exacerbated amounts of degenerating neurons specifically in the corresponding sensory cortical area, demonstrating for the first time that electrical activity affects the final number of central neurons in order to match the size of functional neuronal networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Developmental apoptosis affects cortical neurons in an age-, area- and layer-dependent manner</title><p>We first characterized the temporal profile of cell death in the developing neocortex of wild-type mice over the first two postnatal weeks.

In agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Southwell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Verney et al., 2000</xref>), the overall rate of cell death in the developing mouse neocortex increases from P2 on, peaks around P5 to P6 and subsequently declines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>; one-way ANOVA, R²=0.54, p=0.002, n = 38 mice).

Functional cortical areas were identified in flat mounts by immunhistochemical staining against the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leingärtner et al., 2007</xref>) and apoptotic cells were co-labeled by aCasp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Although the whole cortex is populated by apoptotic cells at this age, strong area discrepancies become evident. Most obviously, the primary motor cortex (M1) shows higher densities of aCasp3-positive cells (39.66 ± 14.93 aCasp3/mm²) compared to the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) (15.51 ± 6.90 aCasp3/mm²; n = 3 mice), although the difference is not significant (t-test, p=0.28). For a comprehensive, comparative analysis of cortical cell death in these two areas, we used coronal brain sections containing both regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The cortical hemispheres in these coronal sections were divided into six equal sectors - with medial sectors a and b corresponding to M1 and more lateral sectors c to f to S1. The relative density of aCasp3-labeled cells per sector was quantified in layers I to IV, layer V and layer VI. In most cases, aCasp3-positive neurons are located in layer II at the border of layer I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Interestingly, previous in vivo recordings of the developing neocortex demonstrated that spontaneous electricalactivity is much more abundant and complex in S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2014</xref>) than in M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khazipov et al., 2004</xref>). To address the question whether differences in electrical activity can indeed be correlated to different rates of apoptosis in S1 and M1, we performed simultaneous in vivo recordings of spontaneous activity in the upper layers of S1 and M1 of P6 to P7 mice using two 4-shank electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).

Comparative analysis of the in vivo network activity recorded in the two cortical areas demonstrates that S1 activity is characterized by a significantly higher spectral power in the delta to gamma range than M1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D1 and D2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>; two-way ANOVA, cortical area p&lt;0.0001; frequency p&lt;0.0001; n = 5 animals). A detailed analysis of this activity further reveals that in S1, the overall number of troughs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>; 156 ± 27.8 min<sup>−1</sup>, n = 5 animals) and the median trough frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; 1.43 Hz, n = 2333 events) is significantly higher than the overall number of troughs (63 ± 20 min<sup>−1</sup>; Mann Whitney test, p=0.0317) and median trough frequency (0.82 Hz; n = 944 events; Mann Whitney test, p&lt;0.001) in M1. To verify that the area-dependent level of activity is not due to a differential effect of urethane between M1 and S1, we next recorded the activity in the upper layers of S1 and M1 in non-anesthetized animals. Also under this condition, the spectral power of S1 in vivo activity is significantly higher than the spectral power of M1 in vivo activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E1 and E2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>; two-way ANOVA, cortical area p=0.0015, n = 5 animals).

A substantial portion of electrical activity in S1 is generated in the sensory periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Minlebaev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2016</xref>) and this portion may even be increased under physiologically relevant behavioral condition like nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sullivan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhmetshina et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, deprivation of sensory inputs by whisker clipping and simultaneous hourly lidocaine (2% gel) application to the whisker pad massively reduces the level of electrical activity in S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). Quantification of aCasp3-labeled cells shows that already within 5 hr, whisker deafferentation leads to an increased density of apoptotic neurons in the corresponding contralateral barrel field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>; 18.74 ± 1.88 aCasp3 positive cells/mm², n = 10 mice) as compared to the somatosensory cortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere receiving non-obstructed whisker afferents (13.77 ± 1.41 aCasp3 positive cells/mm²; t-test, p=0.038). These results provide direct evidence that periphery-driven electrical activity in S1 provides an anti-apoptotic signal that contributes to the area-specific differences in rates of apoptosis.</p><p>In summary, our data show for the first time that electrical activity regulates cell death in the developing cortex in a cortical area-dependent manner and thus represents an important factor for the functional and structural maturation of the brain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>While size, complexity and processing capacity of the cerebral cortex have incredibly expanded during mammalian evolution, apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oppenheim, 1991</xref>) and early spontaneous synchronous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khazipov and Luhmann, 2006</xref>), two temporally overlapping hallmark features of immature cortical networks, are phylogenetically conserved. It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that both processes - electrical activity and programmed cell death - are essential elements which might not only co-occur, but mutually interact to ensure the proper development of the cortex. The experiments provided in this study support this hypothesis as they demonstrate for the first time that (i) M1 exhibits low neuronal activity and a high number of apoptotic neurons while S1, with a higher rate of spontaneous activity, shows less apoptotic neurons, (ii) enhancing neuronal activity in vitro and in vivo reduces the rate of apoptosis in M1, (ii) in vitro replay of S1 activity recorded in vivo to M1 reduces apoptosis in this area, and (iv) suppressing sensory-driven activity in vivo enhances the number of apoptotic neurons in S1. We conclude from these results that neuronal activity is a major determinant of the region-dependent rate of apoptosis in the developing neocortex.</p><p>In accordance with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferrer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Southwell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nikolić et al., 2013</xref>), the present study shows that the immature cortex displays higher rates of apoptosis than the adult cortex. We additionally demonstrate that during the first postnatal week, functionally diverse neocortical areas reveal distinct levels of neuronal apoptosis. While a mediolateral apoptosis profile of neocortical neurons comparable to the M1 versus S1 difference reported in the present study has been shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ikonomidou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Verney et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mosley et al., 2017</xref>), a direct relation of apoptotic densities to functional neocortical areas has, to our knowledge, not been reported before. Our data are an important extension of previous observations demonstrating neuron-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Derer and Derer, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Del Río et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Robertson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blanquie et al., 2017b</xref>) and brain-region specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ikonomidou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Verney et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mosley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahern et al., 2013</xref>) rates of cell death, and thus underline the important role of apoptosis for the establishment of functionally distinct neural circuits during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferrer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Southwell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nikolić et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>It has been demonstrated in vitro that the rate of neuronal apoptosis at early developmental stages is to a large extent negatively regulated by electrical/synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Golbs et al., 2011</xref>). In line with these in vitro results, the present study confirms that an elevation of neuronal activity by pro-convulsive conditions diminishes the rates of apoptosis in the immature neocortex under in vitro and in vivo conditions. We further show that already two hours of elevated electrical activity are sufficient to significantly decrease the number of apoptotic cortical neurons. As immature brains are highly susceptible to acute changes in electrical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Ari and Holmes, 2006</xref>), this stresses the clinical relevance of the presented data. Interestingly, neocortical slices reveal a higher number of apoptotic neurons compared to the same neocortical areas in vivo. This observation could be due to the lower rate of spontaneous electrical activity in acute slice preparations. Indeed, increasing neuronal activity by pharmacological or electrical stimulation reduces the number of apoptotic neurons in vitro. Interestingly, also under in vivo conditions, the rate of apoptosis is reduced upon application of the pro-convulsive agent kainate. This effect is only significant for M1, but not for S1, either because the smaller number of apoptotic neurons in S1 impedes the analysis of such rescue experiments, or because differences in the electrical activity between S1 and M1 influence the amount of additional spikes introduced by convulsive conditions.</p><p>We observe a higher rate of electrical activity in S1 than M1, as quantified by the higher number of events as well as by the higher median discharge frequency, indicating a higher firing frequency during bursts of activity. This observation is in line with several studies reporting a higher occurrence and greater complexity of spontaneous activity in S1 compared to M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khazipov et al., 2004</xref>). The negative correlation observed between activity levels and rates of neuronal apoptosis in S1 versus M1 suggests that differences in spontaneous activity levels underlie the distinct rates of apoptosis between the two neocortical areas. To provide causal evidence for this hypothesis, we first demonstrate in vitro that replay of S1 activity to M1 significantly reduces the number of apoptotic neurons, while replay of M1 activity has a significantly lower pro-survival effect. In addition, we show in vivo that blocking peripheral activity arising from the mystacial whiskers, which decreases the frequency of spindle bursts and gamma oscillations in S1 by about 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2009</xref>), significantly reduces the rate of apoptosis in the corresponding S1 barrel cortex. In summary, these results indicate that electrical activity and levels of apoptosis are negatively correlated and provide strong evidence that regional differences in electrical activity are indeed causal for the different levels of apoptosis in functionally distinct neocortical areas. One additional intriguing observation of the present study is that organotypic slices, in which the electrical activity is synchronized over the whole preparation, do not display any regional differences in apoptotic rates. Since in this preparation blockade of all electrical activity with TTX also does not uncover regional differences, it is tempting to postulate that electrical activity per se provide the major regionalization cue regulating specific rates of apoptosis. While the effect of elevated neuronal activity dramatically reduces the number of neurons undergoing apoptosis already after 4 hr, the effect of chronic activity blockade seems to be more moderate. In vivo, the absence of synaptic transmission leads to a dramatic apoptotic response directly after neurons have assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Verhage et al., 2000</xref>). We therefore hypothesize that the survival of cortical neurons in silenced organotypic cultures is not due to an alternative pro-survival pathway but rather to the presence of pro-survival factors present within the culture medium. However, which factor promotes the survival of which neurons under these conditions remains an open question.</p><p>We also observe differences in the density of apoptotic neurons between layers within one cortical area. This finding is in line with a previous report demonstrating that layers II to IV show more apoptotic neurons than layers V and VI in the first postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heumann and Leuba, 1983</xref>). However we find this pattern only in M1. In S1, the density of apoptotic neurons in layer V tends to be higher than in layers I-IV. Surprisingly, in vivo recordings in the M1 region of P6 mice across all neocortical layers do not show a negative correlation between activity levels and rates of apoptosis (unpublished data). Whether M1 neurons present a layer-dependent intrinsic sensitivity to electrical activity as a pro-survival factor or whether other factors rule the cell death of deep layer neurons remains unknown. In the future, investigating the correlation between activity levels and rates of apoptosis across layers, that is in regions of different cellular composition, will help uncover cell type-specific differences in the regulation of neuronal apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanquie et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>Lower layer VI contains the early-generated subplate neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kanold and Luhmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Higashi et al., 2005</xref>). It has been suggested that a proportion of these neurons is eliminated by apoptosis during the first postnatal weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Price et al., 1997</xref>). Interestingly, we found a low density aCasp3-labeled neurons in the layer VI. We attribute this low cell death density to two reasons. First, the subplate layer represents a very thin layer of about 50 µm-width located between the white matter and layer VI-a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2013</xref>). Because, apoptotic neurons are cleared away by macrophages with 2.5 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thomaidou et al., 1997</xref>), the chance to stain apoptotic neurons in this layer is very low. Second, recent reports have demonstrated that only a fraction of subplate neurons is eliminated by apoptosis, while other subplate neurons such as Nurr1 or Lpar1-GFP-labeled neurons survive beyond the postnatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2013</xref>). In line with the existence of a substantial fraction of surviving subplate neurons, it has been recently shown that the layer VI-b consists of persistent neurons from the subplate layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marx et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the immature brain, including that of humans, a variety of intrinsically-generated and sensory-evoked activity patterns can be observed in different cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Milh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khazipov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khazipov and Luhmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kilb et al., 2011</xref>). The distinct levels of spontaneous neuronal activity in the immature sensory, motor or association cortex have been frequently attributed to the development of adequate connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Ghosh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Luhmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spitzer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hartung et al., 2016</xref>). The results of the present study demonstrate that a direct influence of sensory-driven and spontaneous neuronal activity on the size and probably also the composition of the cellular pool underlying neuronal networks must also be considered as an important element during brain formation.</p><p>Human brains display activity patterns similar to the rodent ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khazipov and Luhmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vanhatalo and Kaila, 2006</xref>). For instance the electroencephalogram of preterm babies exhibits at an equivalent developmental period a local rhythmic activity in a similar frequency range than spindle bursts: the so-called delta brushes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Milh et al., 2007</xref>). These human preterm activity patterns most probably also modulate neuronal apoptosis in the developing human brain, which points to an additional mechanism by which inadequate activity can lead to persistent changes in the nervous system. As revealed by previous animal studies, subsequent modification of the number of cortical neurons results in pathophysiological outcomes such as autistic-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>). In line with behavioral deficits as a consequence of changes in the neuronal population size, a large fraction of children suffering from autistic spectrum disorders shows an elevated number of neocortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Courchesne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casanova et al., 2006</xref>). While it has been proposed that mostly enhanced neurogenesis causes this autism-related increase in cerebral volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaushik and Zarbalis, 2016</xref>), we propose that activity-dependent alterations in apoptosis must be also considered as possible cause. Further, a recent study reported that sensory whisker deprivation during the first postnatal days, that is through the period covering the critical period of cell death, induces not only the expected deficits in tactile sensation but also exacerbated fear and anxiety-related responses as well as impaired social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Soumiya et al., 2016</xref>). In conclusion we demonstrate that neuronal electrical activity at pre- and peri-natal stages, besides affecting neuronal proliferation, migration or integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Marco García et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Weissman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">López-Bendito and Molnár, 2003</xref>), also directly influences apoptosis. This implies on the one hand that physiological activity patterns are essential for the establishment and refinement of functional circuits in the cortex; and that drugs or pathophysiological conditions interfering with early activity and cell death likely contribute to many neuropsychiatric diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van Diessen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Ari, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Silva et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with National and European (86/609/EEC) laws for the use of animals in research and were approved by the local ethical committee (Landesuntersuchungsamt Rheinland-Pfalz 23.177–07/G 10-1-010).

For TUNEL, reaction mixture (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit Fluorescein, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was applied for 2 hr at 37°C. Thereafter, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with DAPI and Cy3- or DyLight488-coupled secondary antibodies (Dianova and Biomol, Hamburg, Germany) diluted in 2% bovine serum albumin with 0.05% azide in PBS at RT for 2 hr. Specimens were mounted with Fluoromount (Sigma-Aldrich). The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-cleaved Caspase 3 (aCasp3) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) 1: 200; DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) 1: 200; guinea pig polyclonal anti-serotoninergic transporter (Synaptic Systems, Goettingen, Germany) 1:200; mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP (Synaptic Systems) 1:500.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Image analysis</title><p>For aCasp3 and TUNEL quantification, images of slices were taken with a 10x objective at an Olympus IX81 epifluorescence microscope and subsequently analysed with ImageJ. Experimenters were blinded for experimental conditions. Based on the DAPI staining, cortical region of interest was divided into six sectors a to f of 0.55 mm width for age group P5-7, with sector a positioned at 0.73 ± 0.4 mm from midline. Sector-width was adjusted to the respective brain volume in additional analyzed age groups. For colocalization analysis of aCasp3 and GAD67-GFP signaly or aCasp3 and GFAP signals, pictures were taken with a confocal microscope (TCS SP5, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Representative images of single neurons were taken with a confocal microscope (63X, TCS SP5, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and processed using Huygens Remote Manager Deconvolution and ImageJ softwares. Maximal projections of minimum of 52 stacks were used to obtain the respective Z-projections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data were analyzed with Prism (GraphPad Software) and are expressed as mean ±SEM. p values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant, whereas p values greater than 0.05 were considered non-significant (n.s.). Experimental groups consisted of at least three biological replicates gathered from minimum 3 independent experiments. Statistical analysis of 2 experimental groups was performed with the parametric two-tailed Student’s t-test. If more than 2 groups were compared, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed and differences between groups were analyzed by a subsequent Newman–Keuls post-hoc test. If applicable, two-way ANOVA was performed and replicate means were compared by a subsequent Bonferroni pos-hoc test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by funding from the DFG to HJL and AS (SFB 1080).

As they have already stained younger and older material in order to generate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, it would be illuminating if the authors could comment on whether L6 has cell death occurring at other ages in the range they tested.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: to demonstrate the overlap between aCasp3 and TUNEL staining, a higher magnification panel is needed, as the TUNEL image looks virtually unstained (background level signal) in the figure (panel E1).</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: Panel A3 and B3 suggest a similar rate of apoptosis in both pharmacological conditions – yet the images in panels A2 and B2 look like there is much more cell death in sector A/B of B2 than A2 (pharmacological manipulation) – is the B2 image representative of the entire data set?</p><p>6) In main text, give indication of number of animals used for whisker clipping/lidocaine experiments.</p><p>7) The authors are experts in subplate and layer 6b. Surely they need to give some kind of statement on the apparent lack of apoptotic profiles in layer 6 and especially layer 6b. This layer is largely considered as a transient layer (see Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnar review). Moreover, it has been demonstrated with combined birthdating and marker expression studies that some layer 6b cells survive in larger number than others (Cereb Cortex. 2013 Jun;23(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">6</xref>):1473-83.).

Also, some neuronal types seem to be well protected from apoptosis and their survival does not seem to depend on activity (such as L6 cells as shown in this report). Is the rule that activity protects against apoptosis universal for all neurons? What are the factors that define particular vulnerability of certain neurons? It would be interesting to know the authors opinion on these questions in the Discussion.</p><p>16) The authors should provide some specific statements on subplate cell death in mouse (or the lack of it).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27696.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Given the areal differences in aCasp3 staining reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend needs to be more precise about the areas imaged and quantified.</italic> </p><p>We included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend that the quantitative analysis of the density of apoptotic cells was performed “in the mouse primary motor and somatosensory cortices”.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> reports aCasp3+ as cells/mm2 – during this time, the cortex expands considerably, so it would be valuable to have an estimate of cell death/brain volume in order to identify whether the decline in aCasp3+ density observed after P6 is a decrease in total number of cells dying, or a decrease in cell density due to cortical expansion.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that an increase in brain volume could influence the density of apoptotic neurons. In the present study, we have assessed the lateral expansion of the brain by measuring the distance between the midline and the lateral boundary of acute coronal slices (Author response image 1A1). While we found that cortices expand laterally by a factor of 1.2 between P1-3 and P5-7, we did not observe a significant lateral expansion between P5-7 and P9-11 (Author response image 1A2). We also estimated the radial expansion of the cerebral cortex in the 3 age groups (Author response image 1A1 and 1A3). While the thickness of cortical layers I to VI markedly increases between P1-3 and P5-7, we did not find any significant radial growth between P5-7 and P9-11. This is in agreement with previous data showing in mice that the largest expansion of the brain takes place during the 5 first postnatal days (Baloch et al., 2009). Thus, we are confident that the decline in aCasp3-positive neurons density observed between P6 and P10 is not due to brain expansion but reflects a physiological decline in cell death. These results are in agreement with previous data showing a decrease in the density of apoptotic cells per brain volume from P1 to P7 on depending on the brain region (Mosley et al., 2016, Ahern et al., 2013).</p><p>To follow the reviewers’ suggestion, we further estimated the number of apoptotic cells/mm³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). 50 µm slices were imaged using an epifluorescence microscope. All aCasp3-positive neurons can be imaged within one focus plan. Thus, we used 0.05 mm as thickness of our field of view for calculation. However, because cell number/mm² is the unit used throughout the manuscript and because the relative change in apoptotic densities over time is not biased by the unit, we would prefer to keep the graph in aCasp3/mm² in the manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Brain expansion and apoptosis in the developing mouse neocortex.</title><p>(<bold>A1</bold>) Lateral expansion of developing mouse brains was determined by measuring the distance between midline and lateral boundary of coronal sections (filled arrow).

However, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>, it is very challenging to quantify either the number of nuclei (DAPI) or the number of neurons (NeuN) using the magnification used throughout the manuscript (Author response image 2A1 and 2B1) as well as at a higher magnification (Author response image 2A2 and 2B2). The difficulty is not due to the quality of the immunostaining but rather to the high cell density of layers II-IV. In addition, because aCasp3 staining labels cells only during two to three hours, a co-immunostaining with a neuronal marker would underestimate the actual portion of neurons undergoing apoptosis. Other studies have quantified the total number of neurons and cells within the rodent brain using methods such as isotropic fractionator (Bandeira et al., 2009, Herculano-Houzel et al., 2006, Collins et al., 2010) or design-based stereology (Schmitz and Hof, 2005). However, such studies are beyond the scope of the present study.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Immunostaining against DAPI and NeuN in coronal cortical slices from P6 mouse brains.</title><p>(<bold>A1</bold>) In the S1 region, immunostaining against DAPI and NeuN respectively allows the detection of nuclei in the overall cortical population and the cytoplasm of neurons.

In these representative images, an aCasp3-positive neuron with an intact nucleus (Figure 2C1) as well as aCasp3-positive neuron displaying a typical nuclear degradation (Figure 2C2) are shown in the two regions of interest. We further stress in the text (subsection “Developmental apoptosis affects cortical neurons in an age-, area- and layer-dependent manner”, second paragraph) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> legend that aCasp3-labeling allows the detection of apoptotic neurons at various stages of nuclear and morphological degradation.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Characterization of neuronal apoptosis in the developing mouse neocortex in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A1</bold>) Most of aCasp3-positive neurons (green) are GAD67-negative, putative glutamatergic neurons.

These experiments revealed that in non-anesthetized animals, the frequency of detected troughs in S1 (Figure 4E3; 159.73 ± 23.6 min<sup>-1</sup>) and in M1 (51.9 ± 23.4 min<sup>-1</sup>, n=5 animals) is comparable to what is observed in urethane-anesthetized animals (Figure 4D3; 156 ± 27.8 and 63 ± 20 min<sup>-1</sup>, respectively) and more importantly the trough rate is also higher in S1 compared to M1 (Mann Whitney test p=0.03). For the spectral power, we also observed significantly higher values in S1 compared to M1 in non-anesthetized mice (Figures 4E1 and 4E2; two-way ANOVA, cortical area p=0.0015). Furthermore, the spectral power in non-anesthetized mice is significantly higher than in urethane-anesthetized mice for S1 recordings (two-way ANOVA, anesthesia p=0.04) but not different for M1 recordings (two-way ANOVA, anesthesia p&gt;0.05). Overall, these results indicate that also in non-anesthetized animal, activity levels in S1 are significantly higher than that in M1. These results are now added to the manuscript (subsection “Differences in electrical activity of M1 and S1 in vivo parallels area-specific apoptosis”, first paragraph) and displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>All recordings from S1 and M1 were recorded in layers II-III to layer IV, as identified from the penetration depth of the electrodes. For S1, this information was substantiated by current source density analysis. Recording sites in S1 were localized above or within the thalamoreceptive layer IV identified as the instant current sink upon sensory stimulation. We included this information in the revised version of the manuscript (subsection “Differences in electrical activity of M1 and S1 in vivo parallels area-specific apoptosis”, first paragraph and subsection “In vivo electrophysiological recordings”, second paragraph).</p><p>We next addressed the question, whether rates of apoptosis and activity levels correlate across the different layers. In M1 (sectors a-b; Figure 3A2, previous Figure 2D2), the density of apoptosis is significantly higher in layers I-IV than in the deeper layers while in S1 (sectors c-f), the layer-specificity is more complex (see point 13). In order to test the correlation between rates of apoptosis and activity levels across neocortical layers, we therefore compared the spontaneous in vivo activity in non-anesthetized with the cell death density in M1 only. We found that the summation of spectral power is not significantly lower in layers I-IV compared to deeper layers, but rather tends to be higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>; one-way ANOVA, layers p=0.10). Thus, while levels of activity and rates of apoptosis in layers I-IV are negatively correlated between M1 and S1, this is not the case across cortical layers of M1. We discussed this interesting result in the manuscript (Discussion, fifth paragraph).</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Density of apoptotic neurons and levels of activity in M1 positively correlate across cortical layers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In M1, the density of apoptotic neurons is significantly higher in layers I-IV than in the deeper layers.

Also, some neuronal types seem to be well protected from apoptosis and their survival does not seem to depend on activity (such as L6 cells as shown in this report). Is the rule that activity protects against apoptosis universal for all neurons? What are the factors that define particular vulnerability of certain neurons? It would be interesting to know the authors opinion on these questions in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>While the effect of elevated neuronal activity dramatically reduces the number of neurons undergoing apoptosis already after 4 hours, the effect of chronic activity blockade by TTX seems more moderate. Cell-type specific differences in vulnerability to activity modulations have been shown previously, e.g. in Cajal Retzius neurons (Blanquie et al. 2016), and likely also occur in other neuronal subpopulations. In the present study, we focused on functional region-dependent differences in the total neuronal population of layer I-IV. Whether neuronal activity differentially affects neurons in different neocortical layers, i.e. regions of different cellular compositions, remains to be investigated (see point 14). This interesting point is now raised in the Discussion (fourth and fifth paragraphs).</p><p><italic>16) The authors should provide some specific statements on subplate cell death in mouse (or the lack of it).</italic> </p><p>We agree that the low rate of apoptosis in the layer VI is interesting (see point 7). This issue is now addressed is the Discussion (sixth paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
