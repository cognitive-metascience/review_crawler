The timing and temporal precision of APs when they reach each of the synapses are fundamentally important for information processing in the brain. Due to small diameters of axons, direct recording of single AP transmission is challenging. Consequently, most knowledge about axonal conductance derives from modeling studies or indirect measurements. We demonstrate a method to noninvasively and directly record individual APs propagating along millimeter-length axonal arbors in cortical cultures with hundreds of microelectrodes at microsecond temporal resolution. We find that cortical axons conduct single APs with high temporal precision (~100 µs arrival time jitter per mm length) and reliability: in more than 8,000,000 recorded APs, we did not observe any conduction or branch-point failures. Upon high-frequency stimulation at 100 Hz, successive became slower, and their arrival time precision decreased by 20% and 12% for the 100th AP, respectively.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axonal physiology</kwd><kwd>HD-MEA</kwd><kwd>electrode-neuron interface</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Grant 267351'NeuroCMOS'</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hierlemann</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Grant 694829 'neuroXscales'</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hierlemann</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>205321_157092/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hierlemann</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ambizione Grant PZ00P3_132245</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bakkum</surname><given-names>Douglas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ambizione Grant PZ00P3_167989</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franke</surname><given-names>Felix</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A method was developed to non-invasively and simultaneously track individual action-potentials propagating across multiple branches of identified neurons in neocortical cultures.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>According to the classical view, axons are seen as conduction cables that reliably transmit action potentials (APs) between synaptically connected neurons in a digital (all-or-none) fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>). However, more recently, a growing body of evidence suggest that a more refined view of axonal conduction might be appropriate. A number of experimental and modeling studies provided insights into different mechanisms that might fine-tune information processing in mammalian axons, and, thereby, affect synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debanne, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bucher and Goaillard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Debanne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sasaki et al., 2011</xref>). It has been shown that a modest increase in the somatic membrane potential of presynaptic cortical neurons leads to a proportional increase in the amplitude of axonal action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shu et al., 2006</xref>). An increase in the AP amplitude facilitated synaptic release and increased the average amplitude of the postsynaptic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alle and Geiger, 2006</xref>). In addition, it was found that gating dynamics of voltage-gated ion channels can regulate the length of axonal AP waveforms and, thereby, modulate the synaptic release. For example, slow inactivation of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels in mossy fiber boutons was found to mediate activity-dependent broadening of APs during high-frequency neuronal activity, which facilitated synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geiger and Jonas, 2000</xref>). Contrary to a classical notion that information flows from the dendritic membrane toward the axon terminals, parallel patch-clamp recordings from soma and axons revealed that axons possess a certain level of functional independence from the presynaptic input. Thus, for example, during gamma oscillations of pyramidal cells, ectopic APs were found to be generated in the distal axon but did not invade the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dugladze et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that hippocampal interneurons can share the output across a coupled network of axons and can respond with persistent firing even in the absence of input to the soma or dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sheffield et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, the temporal precision with which APs arrive at a neurons’ synapses is essential for encoding and computing neural information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rieke, 1999</xref>). E.g., cortical neurons are specialized to detect coincident arrival of APs on the order of milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stuart and Häusser, 2001</xref>). In contrast, theoretical studies suggest that ion channel noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clay and DeFelice, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">White et al., 2000</xref>) introduces random variability in axonal AP waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neishabouri and Faisal, 2014</xref>), decreases the temporal precision of AP propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Faisal and Laughlin, 2007</xref>), and compromises the reliability of the conduction itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Faisal and Laughlin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Skaugen and Walløe, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strassberg and DeFelice, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rubinstein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schneidman et al., 1998</xref>). Taken together, the role of these effects for neural information processing are not yet well understood, and clarification of their exact influence will require experimental access to individual APs across entire axonal arbors.</p><p>Mainly due to methodological limitations to track individual APs across multiple sites of mammalian axons, it was not yet possible to record the temporal evolution of a single AP throughout entire axonal arbors. Whole-cell patch-clamp of axonal blebs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shu et al., 2006</xref>), boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alle and Geiger, 2006</xref>), or the Calyx of Held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Forsythe, 1994</xref>) enables recording of individual axonal signals, however, the technique is invasive and limited to recording from a single site. Axon-attached patch clamp allows for experimental access to intact axons and enables simultaneous recordings from two axonal sites, but stable recording is only possible for less than 60 min and with success rates of ∼50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sasaki et al., 2012</xref>). Owing to the small diameter of neocortical axons (0.08 to 0.4 µm diameter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Debanne et al., 2011</xref>), classical electrophysiological tools, such as patch clamp, cannot be used to spatially track the propagation of action potentialat more than a couple sites. Over the past decades, optical microscopy techniques and application of fluorescent indicators, sensitive to voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peterka et al., 2011</xref>) or calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grienberger and Konnerth, 2012</xref>), have become popular means for recording electrical activity from neuronal processes in invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stepnoski et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fromherz and Müller, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antić and Zecević, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zecević, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antic et al., 2000</xref>) and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antic et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antic, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Djurisic et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kampa and Stuart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Palmer and Stuart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canepari and Vogt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Djurisic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acker and Antic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Palmer and Stuart, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holthoff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Foust et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Popovic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Popovic, 2015</xref>).

However, optical techniques did not yet provide sufficient temporal resolution and signal quality that would allow for the reliable detection of single individual APs in mammalian axons over longer periods of time.</p><p>In the present study, we present a method to noninvasively record individual axonal APs in rat cortical neurons cultured over complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) –based high-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frey et al., 2010</xref>). We use template matching to detect individual axonal APs by combining the simultaneously recorded signals from multiple electrodes. We show recordings of individual APs as they propagate across hundreds-of-micrometer-long-cortical axons at high spatiotemporal resolution. Using the developed method, we measure (I) latencies and temporal precision of AP initiation in response to extracellular voltage stimulation; (II) temporal precision of arrival times of individual APs as they propagate along axonal branches; (III) gradual changes in velocities and temporal precision of propagating APs during high-frequency neuronal activity. We use live imaging to assign the measured extracellular electrical activity to the morphology of individual neurons in the network.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We recorded cultures of neurons from rat cortex using a state of the art HD-MEA system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frey et al., 2010</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Owing to the low-noise recordings provided by our CMOS-based HD-MEAs, averaging over multiple recordings of a single neurons’ APs allows for discerning small-amplitude axonal signals from the background noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bakkum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>). However, the reliable detection of single axonal APs is needed to investigate the consistency, reliability and precision of axonal conduction, as averaging across multiple APs removes the AP-to-AP variability. Nevertheless, we found that a single axonal AP can be observed if the very same AP is recorded simultaneously on several neighboring electrodes. The detectability of axonal APs can be further improved by combining the signals recorded from multiple electrodes via a matched filtering technique, which we will refer to throughout this work as ‘template matching’. In brief (see Materials and methods section for details), the method works by first establishing the prototypical waveform of a neurons’ or axons’ AP, called its template, on each recording electrode. A multi-electrode filter is then computed from a multi-electrode template that is optimally matched to the individual electrode templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franke et al., 2015</xref>). The filter is then convolved with each (non-averaged) period of recorded data and is analyzed for the presence, or absence, of the neuron’s or axon’s AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franke et al., 2015</xref>). If the AP is present, the filter will give a large response that is detected by thresholding (see Figure 2a). To estimate the template, we first performed a set of recordings and analytical steps in order to electrically identify axonal arbors of individual neurons within cell cultures of cortical neurons. For this purpose, the high-spatial-resolution of our electrode arrays facilitated ‘spike sorting’ of extracellular APs which was used for identifying individual neurons and their axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jäckel et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the applied techniques enabled the electrical identification of the respective axon initial segments (AIS), which co-localize with the largest-amplitude and first-emerging extracellular AP traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spatiotemporal distribution of average extracellular APs captures electrical activity across an entire neuron</title><p>For each neuron presented in this study, we used spike-triggered averaging, triggered by the strong extracellular signals recorded close to the neuron’s AIS, to capture the neuron-wide AP propagation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>). After each spike detected at the AIS, we recorded a 10 ms time window on all electrodes that we refer to as a ‘single trial’. As only 126 of the array’s 11,011 electrodes can be read out at the same time, for each neuron, we recorded its spontaneous extracellular activity by scanning ~200 different configurations of recording electrodes, in 2 min recordings per configuration, covering the entire array. All ~200 electrode configurations had a small number of electrodes in common. These electrodes were located close to the neurons’ AIS and were used for spike detection. For each electrode configuration, we averaged 40 single trials to compute the single-electrode templates. The set of all single-electrode templates provided an array-wide spatiotemporal distribution of the extracellular APs, referred to as an AP ‘footprint’ or ‘electrical image’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The presented footprint spread over 1200 electrodes. Averaging of 40 trials per electrode was needed in order to discern small-amplitude APs of axons and proximal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bakkum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>).

To estimate our capability to detect individual APs in single axonal branches, we used the strong signal on the electrodes close to the AIS as a ground truth of the presence of a given AP. We then tried to detect the same AP independently, only relying on the recording of groups of neighboring electrodes located close to an axonal branch, using several detection strategies: either thresholding individual electrodes or template matching using one, or groups of three or six neighboring electrodes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). In general, we used multiple electrodes to independently detect signals that propagated across an individual axonal branch. This enabled us to discriminate detection errors (i.e., some of the electrodes along a branch do not detect an AP) from possible conduction failures (i.e., none of the electrodes along a branch or axonal segment detects an AP). Template matching strongly improved the detection performance as compared to single electrode thresholding and allowed for detecting a single AP simultaneously and independently in multiple axonal branches with high precision (&gt;90% detection performance). In general, reliable detection of large APs, recorded near the AIS, can be attained by using a simple amplitude threshold set to 5σ<sub>noise</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Quiroga et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

This was possible owing to: (I) electrical identification of the AIS based on the extracellular activity pattern of the neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bakkum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>); (II) reliable detection of the comparably large AIS signals that served as a trigger for the averaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>), and (III) low-noise recording provided by the array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frey et al., 2010</xref>), which allowed to discern small-amplitude APs of the neurites after averaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bakkum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>). In general, an AP footprint captures electrical activity across the AIS, axonal trunk and lower-order branches, which enables to electrically visualize large portions of the axonal arbor and to track AP propagation in multiple axonal branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bakkum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>). The soma and proximal dendrites provide minor contributions to the extracellular footprint, which are typically masked by the much larger AIS signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>). Owing to their small extracellular signals, distal dendrites seem not to be detectable with the HD-MEA devices used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bakkum et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We analyzed AP footprints obtained from 20 neurons and observed a strong decrease in the average amplitude of the extracellular APs over a 100 µm Euclidean distance from the AIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). This can be explained by the electrical contribution of voltage-gated ion channels, whose concentration is high at the AIS and significantly drops moving towards somatodendritic and axonal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Debanne et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We found that AP amplitudes broadly varied across neurites, however, such variation was largely independent of the Euclidean distance of the recording site to the AIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The amplitude of an extracellular AP is proportional to the sum of all transmembrane currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gold et al., 2007</xref>) weighted by the relative proximity of the current sources to the recording electrode, the filter properties of medium and electrode, and the characteristics of the analog filters in the recording circuitry and of the digital filters used for data analysis. Whereas the filter properties can be safely assumed to be identical for all electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Obien et al., 2014</xref>), the distance between the membrane and electrode likely varies across axonal arbors and recording sites. Therefore, axonal compartments that are tightly attached to the electrode surface could provide large signal amplitudes, whereas axonal sections that are between electrodes could render much smaller amplitudes. In addition, the electrode-neuron interface could be affected by local interactions between axons and glial cells. Thus, for example, glial cells may elevate axons away from the array’s surface, making them less accessible to recording. Alternatively, they might cover an axon over an electrode, and thereby tighten the electrode-axon contact and increase signal heights. Supporting evidence from our previous study shows that axonal sensitivity to extracellular stimulation also varies across an axonal arbor, which might be caused by similar factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>). Besides the quality of the electrode-neuron contact, the biophysical properties of an axon itself could explain amplitude variations along the arbor. Differences in the distributions of voltage-gated ion channels and various morphological features, such as branching points and axonal varicosities, could, for example, play a role in determining AP amplitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Debanne et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In general, APs recorded near the AIS were, on average, approximately 10 times larger in their amplitudes compared to those captured near axonal arbors and dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The extracellular amplitude depends on the transmembrane currents of each neural compartment, but also on the spatial arrangement of the compartment with respect to the specific electrode that is recording the signal. This means that one cannot directly derive quantitative information about the transmembrane currents from the extracellular recording. The high density of electrodes and the availability of a multitude of electrodes at different distances from a signal-generating source or neuronal compartment, however, do enable to derive a spatial profile of signal intensity. The high amplitudes at the AIS signals could be reliably detected within a single trial using simple threshold-detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Reliable detection of signals from the AIS can then be used to facilitate detection of small-amplitude signals recorded from the axonal arbor. Under the assumption that AP propagation velocity is, within certain boundaries, constant over subsequent trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bakkum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bakkum et al., 2008</xref>), it can be expected that individual electrodes near distal axons always captured APs at approximately the same time with respect to the time of the AIS signal. In this sense, the large-amplitude signal from the AIS could serve as a ground truth for the detection of small-amplitude signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>), however, it did not allow for discerning individual APs within the background noise. Therefore, averaging over 40 trials was previously needed to discern small-amplitude signals recorded from the axonal arbor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bakkum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>By using template matching with multi-electrode templates, we were now able to detect individual APs propagating across an entire neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), including APs recorded near axonal terminals hundreds of micrometers away from the AIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This was possible using the optimal matched filter, a finite impulse response filter, which maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio of a given transient signal in the background noise when convolved with the recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franke et al., 2015</xref>). Consequently, separability of the signal from the noise obtained through template-matching-based detection was significantly better compared to that provided by a simple threshold-detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Both, detection failures and false-positive detections could be strongly reduced by constructing a multi-electrode filter using signals recorded by a group of three or six neighboring electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b,c</xref>).</p><p>We found that an increase in stimulation voltage decreased activation latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) and increased precision of the activation itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). A decrease in the latency could be explained by the fact that more charge activates a higher number of ion channels at once, leading to faster recruitment of other channels in the membrane and eventually to faster activation of the AIS.</p><p>In our measurements, AP propagation jitter accumulated during axonal conduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g,h</xref>). We determined the arrival time jitter to be 100 µs per mm axonal length. Arrival time jitter of individual APs will impact the reliability of coincidence detection of multiple PSPs at the postsynaptic neuron and will, therefore, impact neural-network computations based on a temporal code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">König et al., 1996</xref>). However, for unmyelinated axons of less than a few mm length, other sources of variability, such as temporal imprecision of synaptic transmission, synaptic transmission failure, or PSP amplitude variability, seem to contribute to a larger extent to imprecision in information transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ribrault et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krächan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The inconsistency in AP propagation time could be attributed to the thermodynamic noise inherent to the gating dynamics of voltage-gated ion channels in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">White et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeFelice, 2012</xref>). Supporting evidence from modeling studies suggests that such noise can cause threshold fluctuations in axonal membrane and affect reliability of AP initiation in membrane patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Skaugen and Walløe, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strassberg and DeFelice, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rubinstein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schneidman et al., 1998</xref>). Considering theoretical studies, the accumulation of AP jitter along a conduction path may be influenced by two factors: (I) the cumulative afflux of the noise along the propagation path, and (II) more noise being introduced, as the axonal diameter decreases from proximal regions towards axonal terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faisal et al., 2005</xref>). Other phenomena, such as ephaptic coupling and the presence of gap-junctions could also be a source of electrical noise in unmyelinated axons, although we did not observe any related evidence. Furthermore, axonal morphology is not uniform along the arbor, and it is possible that branching points and axonal varicosities locally impact on AP propagation. We also noticed that cortical axons conducted single action potentials with high reliability: in more than 8,000,000 recorded action potentials we did not observe any conduction or branch-point failure.</p><p>In a next set of experiments, we found that the high-frequency regime of neuronal activity induced a decrease in velocity and an increase in jitter of the AP propagation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Previous studies have reported deceleration of AP propagation velocities during repetitive electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Soleng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raastad and Shepherd, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shimba et al., 2015</xref>), but, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the propagation jitter, accumulated during AP conduction, and its increase by high firing rates were measured. Repetitive neuronal activation at high frequency leads to an increase in the intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Col et al., 2008</xref>), which hyperpolarizes the axonal membrane through activation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Soleng et al., 2003</xref>). Such hyperpolarization could explain the deceleration of AP propagation during high-frequency stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Soleng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shimba et al., 2015</xref>).

To initially identify the locations of neurons, array-wide spontaneous activity of the network was captured by sequential scanning of 95 recording configurations. In each configuration, up to 126 randomly selected electrodes sampled neuronal activity for a duration of 60 s. The average voltage traces, recorded by each electrode, were extracted and used to reconstruct the map of the network’s electrical activity. Since the largest extracellular signals occur near the AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>), and signals from axonal arbors have much smaller amplitude, regions with large-amplitude signals in the activity maps indicated the locations of the AISs. Spike-triggered averaging, synchronized with the putative AIS spikes, enabled us to reconstruct the spatiotemporal distribution of extracellular AP waveforms arising from neuronal processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The first step in obtaining these data was selecting electrodes with the four largest spike amplitudes per putative AIS region found in the activity map. We next designed multiple recording configurations covering the entire array, where, in each configuration, 4 of the 126 read-out channels were set as the four preselected electrodes.

Elicited neuronal responses were estimated by observing stimulation-triggered APs recorded from pre-identified axonal branches (see above). To ensure selective and reliable activation of individual neurons in the network, we used approaches thoroughly described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>). In brief, we applied neuron-wide stimulation over a range of voltages and revealed that sites with the lowest activation threshold resided within a proximal part of the neuron’s extracellular AP footprint, near the largest and first-emerging AP voltage traces. Stimulation was applied at 4 Hz for voltages from ±10 to ±300 mV, with steps of ±10 mV. Each stimulation voltage was applied 60 times per site, and thresholds were defined as the minimum voltage to trigger an AP in 100% of the trials. To get more precise excitability profiles, the most sensitive sites were then stimulated with voltages stepped by 1 mV (60 stimuli per step in random order). To next ensure that high-frequency stimulation near the most sensitive sites provided reliable neuronal responses, we stimulated the neuron 100 times with a series of 100 pulses streamed at 100 Hz, and chose the stimulation electrode that provided neuronal activation in 100% of the trials at the lowest voltage. To further verify whether the chosen stimulation parameters provided selective activation of a single neuron, instead of activating other neurons in the culture, we observed stimulation-triggered responses across the entire array and checked that no other large-amplitude APs (i.e. AIS spikes) were evoked. In all cases presented here (8 neurons in eight different preparations), threshold stimulation near the largest and first-emerging trace of the neuron’s AP footprint provided selective and reliable neuronal activation at comparably low stimulation voltages of around 50 mV. In all stimulation experiments, bath application of synaptic blockers was used to avoid possible interference from synaptic inputs when measuring neuronal excitability and AP propagation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Template-matching-based AP detection</title><p>An extracellular footprint was obtained through spike-triggered averaging triggered at the AIS. This was possible, as the AIS produced electrical signal amplitudes large enough to be reliably detected through a simple amplitude thresholding. The extracellular footprint was used as a template for the detection of single directly-evoked APs that propagated across an entire neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). For this purpose, sets of electrodes across an entire footprint were grouped into local clusters that contained 3–6 electrodes in close proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Single trials recorded by each electrode were next convolved with a matched filter, derived from the template at that electrode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franke et al., 2015</xref>), and the result was summed over the electrode cluster. The result of this convolution was the template matching output. When the template matching output crossed a threshold, the presence of a spike was detected. As the peak of the template matching output is a robust estimate of the true temporal position of the AP within the raw data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franke et al., 2015</xref>), we were able to extract precise occurrence times of individual APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This was particularly important for extracting occurrence times of small-amplitude APs with very low signal-to-noise ratio. To compute the matched filter and the optimal threshold to detect spikes, the noise statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pouzat et al., 2002</xref>) have to be estimated. We used periods of the data, where no spikes could be detected in the raw recordings, to compute the standard deviation of the noise and the noise covariance matrix. The template matching procedure used here provided an optimal detection threshold analytically and did not require manual intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franke et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Propagation time and activation latency</title><p>The arrival time of an AP (<italic>T<sub>arrival</sub></italic>), elicited by extracellular stimulation at the AIS, and recorded from the proximal axon, represents a summation of the activation latency (<italic>T<sub>activation</sub></italic>) and the propagation time (<italic>T<sub>propagation</sub></italic>) between the stimulation and recording site (<italic>T<sub>arrival</sub> = T<sub>propagation</sub> +  T<sub>activation</sub></italic>). To estimate the propagation time, we assumed that the activation time is close to zero for high stimulation voltages (<italic>V<sub>suprathreshold</sub></italic>), as those were found to provide immediate activation (<italic>T<sub>immediate_activation</sub></italic>) when applied to the neuron’s AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Radivojevic et al., 2016</xref>) (<italic>if V<sub>stimulation</sub> = V<sub>suprathreshold</sub></italic> ⇒ <italic>T<sub>activation </sub>= T<sub>immediate_activation</sub> ≈ 0</italic>). Therefore, the propagation time corresponded to the respective arrival time for the largest stimulation voltage (<italic>T<sub>propagation</sub> = T<sub>arrival</sub> − T<sub>immediate_activation</sub></italic>). To calculate activation latencies for lower stimulation voltages, we subtracted the estimate of the average propagation time from the measured arrival times (<italic>T<sub>activation</sub> = T<sub>arrival</sub> −</italic> <italic>T<sub>propagation</sub></italic>). We averaged over 60 trials per stimulation voltage (N = 8 neurons from eight different preparations) to express average activation latencies and to obtain the estimate of the average propagation time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Activation jitter</title><p>The jitter of the AP arrival time (<italic>J<sub>arrival</sub></italic>) was expressed as a standard deviation of AP arrival times (<italic>J<sub>arrival</sub> = std(T<sub>arrival</sub>)</italic>) and represents a summation of the activation jitter (<italic>J<sub>activation</sub></italic>) and the propagation jitter (<italic>J<sub>propagation</sub>; J<sub>arrival</sub> = J<sub>activation</sub> +  J<sub>propagation</sub></italic>). To estimate the effect of the stimulation voltage on the activation jitter, we assumed that the AP propagation jitter does not depend on the stimulation voltages (<italic>J<sub>propagation</sub> = const.</italic>). Therefore, the decrease in the jitter of AP arrival time with increasing stimulation voltages could be attributed exclusively to a decrease in the activation jitter (<italic>J<sub>arrival</sub> = J<sub>activation</sub> + const.</italic>). The lowest measured jitter of AP arrival times, measured when neurons were stimulated with high voltages, were used as the estimate of the AP propagation jitter. Therefore, we were able to calculate the activation jitter by subtracting the estimate of the propagation jitter from jitters of AP arrival times for different voltages (<italic>J<sub>activation</sub> = J<sub>arrival</sub> − J<sub>propagation</sub></italic>). We used 60 trials per voltage (N = 8 neurons from eight different preparations) to calculate jitters of AP arrival times and to obtain the estimate of the propagation jitter. The distance between stimulation and recording electrodes was &lt;500 µm, and the obtained propagation jitters were &lt;50 µs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Propagation jitter</title><p>We computed the propagation jitter at a single electrode as the standard deviation of the arrival times of individual action potentials at that electrode. To estimate the propagation jitter as a function of distance from the reference electrode (where the jitter was set equal to zero), we used linear regression: If the jitter introduced by each axonal segment was independent of that introduced by the other segments, the measured jitter over axial distance could be described as a white noise Gaussian process, so that variance increased linearly with axial distance. Therefore, we fitted the variances at each electrode as a function of axial distance by a linear function with a y-intercept of zero. The square root of the slope of this regression then yielded the average propagation jitter per unit length of axon.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the European Community through the European Research Council Advanced Grants 267351’NeuroCMOS’ and 694829 ‘neuroXscales’, as well as the Swiss National Science Foundation through Grant 205321_157092/1, the Ambizione Grant PZ00P3_132245 and the Ambizione Grant PZ00P3_167989.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been closely overseen by Reviewing Editor David Kleinfeld. Eve Marder serves as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and with the Reviewing Editor. We congratulate you on lovely experimental work that beautifully illustrates cell biophysics. The experimental tests of single-neuron computational ideas, such the notions of branch point failure (2 million records!) and jitter as a function of spike rate, are important. We request that you make changes to the manuscript that, with one exception, require only Discussion points. These will address the issues raised by the reviewers and the Reviewing Editor.</p><p>1) The statement in the third paragraph of the Introduction on the phototoxicity of voltage sensitive dyes is overstated. It has been extensively documented that action potentials can be monitored optically in the axonal arbor in brain slices without extensive averaging using voltage indicators. Please consider a revised statement.</p><p>2) It is probably incorrect to call cell culture of cortical neurons &quot;cortical networks&quot;. The latter term implies a particular function in the brain which is certainly not maintained in culture.</p><p>3) The relationship between the amplitude of extracellularly recorded AP signals and the amplitude of the transmembrane voltage transients that represent AP should be included. Without clarification, the statement in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion that APs from the initial segments are 10-times larger in amplitude is misleading, as only the recordings of these signals are 10-times larger.</p><p>4) Please add images of the experimental setup, including neurons plated and grown on the MEA, as a supplementary material. Further, please clarify the extent of histological staining.</p><p>5) Much of the Discussion on the technique belongs in the Materials and methods section. This will streamline the manuscript.</p><p>6) There is prior art on optical measurements of signal propagation in processes of single cells from Fromherz (e.g., Fromherz and Muller, PNAS 1994), Kleinfeld (Stepnoski et al. PNAS 1991), and Zecević (Zecević, Nature 1996; Antić et al., J Physiol 2000; Djurisic et al., J Neurosci 2004; Foust et al., J Neurosci 2010) that bears on speed and pulse width, although none of the prior data sets are as strong as your current data. Some historical prospective would be useful.</p><p>7) Discussion of the computational aspects of your work could be strengthened, which would also ensure a larger audience. For example, the increased jitter with high spike rates is consistent with a growing level of inactivation of the Na-currents. You might also relate the changes in jitter of presynaptic cells to changes in temporal coincidence of PSPs in a common postsynaptic cell, and thus the reliability of readout. In this regard, we suspect that the effect of propagation delay is small, as the jitter is only ~0.1 ms, but the effect of jitter on synaptic release probability will still be significant through jitter in the height of the AP that effects the presynaptic voltage-dependent Ca-flux.</p><p>8) In support of a more thorough computational approach, a plot of the fractional jitter in peak extracellular voltage as a function of distance from the soma, much like the existing plots of temporal jitter as a function of distance from the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E, F</xref>), would be a welcome addition to the analysis in Results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30198.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] 1) The statement in the third paragraph of the Introduction on the phototoxicity of voltage sensitive dyes is overstated.

In this study, we do not have access to the PSPs but we could measure the amplitudes of the spikes. In the manuscript, we show the change of the spike waveforms with stimulation number and the change of spike amplitudes as a function of distance from the soma. However, we did not analyze the variability of the spike amplitudes across individual spikes. The reviewers suggest including an analysis pertaining to the standard deviation of spike amplitude as a function of electrode and stimulation number. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response images 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">2</xref> show such an analysis for the neuron shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> of the main text. As can be seen, the standard deviation of the spike amplitude seems to be fairly stable for each electrode and over stimulation number. It does increase slightly, but only by 7% on average from the 1<sup>st</sup> stimulation to 100<sup>th</sup> stimulation. The standard deviation of the spike amplitude is a function of the variability of the spike waveform plus the variability due to noise. The larger the spike amplitude, the smaller is the relative influence of the noise. The reviewers asked for a plot showing the fractional amplitude jitter (standard deviation). This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>. In both figures we see only a very small effect of stimulation number on the standard deviation of the spike amplitude, independent of the electrode (and, therefore, the average amplitude of the spike).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Amplitude variability as a function of stimulation number.</title><p>The plot shows the standard deviation of the spike amplitudes of the neuron shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> of the main text as a function of stimulation number (1<sup>st</sup> to 100<sup>th</sup>). The standard deviation is computed over 39 repetitions for each individual electrode (grey lines). The black line shows the mean over all electrodes; the green line the linear regression to the mean. The average standard deviation of amplitudes for periods of noise is shown in red as a comparison. The average standard deviation of spike amplitudes increases with stimulation number (7% from 1<sup>st</sup> stimulation to 100<sup>th</sup> stimulation), but the increase is small.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30198-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Fractionalamplitude variability as a function of stimulation number.</title><p>The plot shows the standard deviation of the spike amplitude, divided by the spike amplitude for each electrode, of the neuron shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> of the main text.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30198-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig><p>Considering the fact that the extracellular amplitude is only a proxy for the intracellular amplitude (see also the added text to the Discussion section), we find it hard to draw any strong conclusions from this analysis and do not think that such a plot would significantly add to the main message of our paper and would prefer to not include it in the main text.</p><p>While performing this analysis we noticed, however, that the way to compute the standard deviation of the arrival time jitter could be improved. Instead of a linear regression of the standard deviation of the arrival times, we compute now the linear regression of the variances of the arrival times against the axial distance. This had only a small impact on the reported values, but it significantly changed the line fits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, which are now square-root functions instead of linear functions. The reason to fit the variance against distance instead of the standard deviation is that, if the jitter introduced by each axonal segment is independent of that of the other segments, the jitter as a function of distance can be described by a white noise Gaussian process, so that the variance increases linearly with axial distance. The data seem to support this notion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
