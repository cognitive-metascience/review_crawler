NSCs inhabit a complex cellular microenvironment, the niche, which influences their behaviour. To ensure sustained neurogenesis, niche cells must respond to extrinsic, environmental changes whilst fulfilling the intrinsic requirements of the neurogenic program and adapting their roles accordingly. However, very little is known about how different niche cells adjust their properties to such inputs. Here, we show that nutritional and NSC-derived signals induce the remodelling of <italic>Drosophila</italic> cortex glia, adapting this glial niche to the evolving needs of NSCs. First, nutrition-induced activation of PI3K/Akt drives the cortex glia to expand their membrane processes. Second, when NSCs emerge from quiescence to resume proliferation, they signal to glia to promote membrane remodelling and the formation of a bespoke structure around each NSC lineage. The remodelled glial niche is essential for newborn neuron survival.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural stem cell</kwd><kwd>niche</kwd><kwd>glia</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003762</institution-id><institution>Institut Pasteur</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LBX-73 S-CR11019-34</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spéder</surname><given-names>Pauline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Investigator Award 103792</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brand</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programme Grant 092545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brand</surname><given-names>Andrea H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>092096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brand</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C6946/A14492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brand</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Royal Society Darwin Trust Research Professorship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brand</surname><given-names>Andrea H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cross talk between neural stem cells and their glial niche enables the niche to adapt to the evolving needs of the stem cells throughout development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem cell niches support the normal function of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bjornsson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lander et al., 2012</xref>). The mammalian NSC niche displays an intricate and compact architecture made up of diverse cell populations, including neurons, astrocytes, blood vessels forming part of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and resident immune cells, the microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bjornsson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Silva-Vargas et al., 2013</xref>). Both mechanical and diffusible signals pass between cell populations to influence NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bjornsson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Silva-Vargas et al., 2013</xref>). Local astrocytes are in close association with both NSCs and the vasculature. In addition, stem cells contact endothelial cells, receiving systemic inputs from the blood. Combinatorial and coordinated interactions between different niche cells are thought to provide the permissive environment for appropriate neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldman and Chen, 2011</xref>). How niche cells respond to NSC inputs and how these interactions respond to external pressures remain to be determined.</p><p>To investigate how niche cells adapt to systemic and local changes to support neurogenesis, we turned to a simpler model, the post-embryonic central nervous system (CNS) of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval CNS comprises the central brain (CB), the optic lobe (OL) and the ventral nerve cord (VNC). Larval NSCs are found in a microenvironment that includes neurons, a blood-brain barrier and a variety of different glia that structure the brain in layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ito et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stork et al., 2012</xref>). Several of these populations modulate NSC behaviour, thus acting as niche cells. <italic>Drosophila</italic> NSCs go through two distinct rounds of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Truman and Bate, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Egger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kang and Reichert, 2015</xref>). They proliferate actively during embryogenesis to generate primary neurons that form the functional larval nervous system. NSCs then become mitotically dormant, entering a quiescent phase. Post embryonically, in response to nutrition, NSCs awaken almost synchronously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britton and Edgar, 1998</xref>) and enter a second neurogenic program. The reactivation and proliferation of these central brain and ventral nerve cord NSCs ultimately generate secondary neuronal lineages that form the adult nervous system.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30413.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Individual <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural stem cells and their lineages are progressively enclosed in cortex glial chambers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two waves of neurogenesis take place in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS.

It is exclusively of glial nature, formed by a layer of perineurial glia and a layer of subperineurial glia, while the vertebrate BBB is a composite of endothelial cells and glial cells (astrocytes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stork et al., 2008</xref>). Both fulfill neuroprotective roles, relying on a physical paracellular barrier (tight junctions of the vertebrate endothelial cells and septate junctions of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> subperineurial glia). Importantly, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> BBB mediates the impact of nutrition on NSC reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Spéder and Brand, 2014</xref>). Essential amino acids in the larval diet trigger the local production and secretion of insulin-like peptides (dILPs) by the subperineurial glial layer of the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Spéder and Brand, 2014</xref>). dILPs bind to the Insulin/IGF receptor on NSCs, activating the conserved PI3K/Akt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, NSCs enlarge and re-enter the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These reactivated, actively cycling NSCs are found in close association with the cortex glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoyle, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoyle et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pereanu et al., 2005</xref>). This association is known to protect NSCs from oxidative stress and nutritional restriction during late larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Cortex glia display a remarkable organisation around NSCs and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pereanu et al., 2005</xref>). Each NSC and its progeny is individually enwrapped in a chamber formed of cortex glial membrane, which separates the lineages from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and C–D</xref>“). The lineage is organised within the chamber, with the NSC at the top and the newly-born neurons being eventually pushed down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Notably, younger neurons are enclosed in the same chamber as their mother NSC, whereas older neurons display their own individual chambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pereanu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dumstrei et al., 2003</xref>). Primary neurons are also surrounded by cortex glia membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pereanu et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>An important question has been whether the cortex glial chamber is present throughout post-embryonic life, enclosing NSC lineages from quiescence to proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Limmer and Klämbt, 2014</xref>), or whether the cortex glial niche evolves over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pereanu et al., 2005</xref>). To address this, we used a protein trap that labels cortex glial membranes (Nrv2::GFP) to follow the association between cortex glia and NSCs throughout larval life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F’</xref>). At ALH0 (ALH, hours after larval hatching), quiescent NSCs were not separated from each other by cortex glial membranes. Cortex glial membranes then progressively underwent three developmental steps. First, membranes expanded. This expansion phase lasted for about a third of larval life. At this stage, NSCs were still not enclosed individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D’</xref>). Second, membranes fully encased each NSC lineage, forming a chequerboard of cortex glia chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–E’</xref>). We call this event “encasing&quot;. Finally, during an extension phase, cortex glial adapted to lineage expansion while maintaining chamber organisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–F’</xref> and data not shown for ALH96). The use of another cortex glial membrane marker confirmed these results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>).</p><p>To gain further insight into the relationship between cortex glia, NSCs and the BBB, we analysed 3D reconstructions. Interestingly, at ALH0 NSCs were not covered by a sheet of cortex glial membrane, but directly abutted the BBB layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). However, at ALH72 the cortex glial membrane fully encased NSCs, isolating NSCs from the BBB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Importantly, the absence of cortex glial chambers at early stages enables BBB-secreted insulin-like peptides to reach NSCs, consequently triggering NSC reactivation. However, at late larval stages, when NSC reactivation is complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>) and proliferation no longer depends on insulin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>), the cortex glial membranes generate a dense interface. These results indicate that cortex glial chambers evolve throughout larval life. Furthermore, the evolution of cortex glial membrane morphology strikingly parallels NSC reactivation, including an initial growth phase followed by a decisive switch: chamber formation on the one hand and mitotic entry on the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p><p>We assessed whether cortex glial chamber formation was also controlled by nutrition, the key trigger of NSC reactivation. We first asked whether removing the nutritional signal was sufficient to block cortex glial chamber formation. Unlike control fed larvae, larvae starved for 72 hr did not develop a sealed chequerboard structure around NSCs, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B’</xref>). To better describe and quantify chamber organisation defects, we plotted normalised intensities of cortex glial membrane, NSCs and neuron signals against depth (see Materials and methods for details). Wild-type cortex glial chambers, from fed larvae, show a characteristic graph profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The cortex glial signal peaks first, as a readout of the dense membrane layer forming on top of NSCs, just under the BBB. Next the peak corresponding to NSCs appears, situated in the upper part of the chamber. Finally, the last peak corresponds to the newborn neurons under the NSCs. In contrast, in starved larvae cortex glia, NCSc and neurons all peak at the same depth, pinpointing a lack of chamber order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). We also calculated the ratio of cortex glial membrane to NSC number in both conditions. Starvation resulted in a loss of cortex glial membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Altogether these results demonstrate that nutrition is critical for cortex glial chamber formation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30413.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cortex glial remodelling depends on nutritional cues.</title><p>(<bold>A–A’</bold>) Cortex glia enclose each NSC and its lineage into an individual membrane chamber in control fed larvae.

Insulin-like peptide secretion relies on gap junction-dependent coordinated calcium oscillations in the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Spéder and Brand, 2014</xref>). First, we performed a gap junction knockdown in the BBB. This resulted in strong chamber defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–A’</xref>), suggesting that BBB-secreted insulin-like peptides are indeed required for cortex glial chamber formation. To identify which dILPs are expressed by the BBB at the time of membrane growth, we determined RNA Pol II binding in the subperineurial glia of fed larvae (Jessie Van Buggenum, P.S. and A.H.B., unpublished).

Impairing insulin signalling only in the cortex glia, by expressing Δp60 which has a dominant-negative effect on PI3K activity, resulted in incomplete NSC encasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B’</xref>). More precisely, formation of the top cortex membrane layer was incomplete and erratic, with NSCs touching one another (see arrowheads). Cellular organisation of the chamber was lost, as shown by the disordered plots and peak values between cortex glia, NSCs and neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). Furthermore, the ratio of cortex glial membranes to NSC number strongly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Notably, affecting insulin signalling directly at the level of the insulin receptor, by expressing a dominant negative form (2X InR<sup>DN</sup>), also led to impaired chamber formation, with loss of cellular organisation and strongly decreased membrane signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data demonstrate that direct integration of dILP6 binding and insulin signalling are required in the cortex glia for NSC chamber building. In addition, they show that chamber loss results in NSC lineage disorganisation, as was suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pereanu et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, formation of the cortex glial chamber relies on an external systemic stimulus, nutrition.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30413.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The insulin pathway is required in the cortex glia for autonomous chamber growth.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Knockdown of insulin signalling specifically in the cortex glia impairs chamber formation.

Starvation maintains NSCs in a quiescent state. Expression of a constitutively active form of Akt (Akt<sup>Act</sup>) specifically in the cortex glia neither rescued individual NSC enclosing, nor chamber organisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–K</xref>). However, it led to an increase in cortex membrane ratio to NSC number, compared to the starved control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>), indicating that insulin signalling autonomously promotes membrane expansion. Surprisingly, cortex glial membranes still wrapped around primary neurons, providing them with tailored chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–H’</xref>). This could explain the increase in cortex glial signal above NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>, column 2). These results indicate that PI3K/Akt pathway activation in the cortex glia alone is not sufficient to re-establish chamber formation under starvation.</p><p>Interestingly, cortex glia start to divide actively around the time chambers form (ALH48, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avet-Rochex et al., 2012</xref>) and our own observation). Moreover, cortex glial division is partially under the control of the insulin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avet-Rochex et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we checked that cortex glial division did not account for insulin-dependent chamber formation. Indeed, hampering cortex glial proliferation through knockdown of <italic>string</italic> (<italic>stg</italic>, the <italic>Drosophila cdc25</italic>) did not prevent NSC chamber formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similar results were obtained by expressing <italic>dacapo</italic>, an inhibitor of cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results indicate that cortex glia have a certain plasticity, compensating for population loss to meet NSC demand.</p><p>Our data suggest that another signal is necessary to shift cortex glial membrane expansion towards chamber formation. Notably, NSC reactivation is triggered by nutrition and is fully complete around chamber closing time (ALH48, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and I</xref>). We thus decided to test whether NSC reactivation promotes chamber formation. First, we delayed NSC reactivation by blocking insulin signalling specifically in NSCs using the PI3K inhibitor, PTEN. Although phenotype expressivity was partial, we found that NSC chamber formation was strongly affected in parts of the VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B’</xref>). Several NSCs were grouped together rather than individually enclosed and cortex glial chamber organisation was altered compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>). Membrane growth was not significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This could be due to the autonomous effect of insulin signalling on cortex glial expansion or to the fact that reactivation was only delayed and not fully blocked. Similar results were obtained with overexpression of either Δp60 or 2X InR<sup>DN</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B’</xref>). To confirm the requirement for NSC reactivation in cortex glial chamber organisation, we turned to intrinsic regulators of this process. Spindle matrix proteins have recently been shown to be required for the mitotic re-entry of quiescent NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, RNAi knockdown of <italic>east</italic> in NSCs resulted in a dramatic loss of the mitotic marker phosphohistone H3 (PH3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We found that this condition also led to impaired cortex glial chamber organisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–H</xref>), whereas membrane growth was little affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>).

This led us to reflect on the importance of the timely formation of the cortex glial chamber for NSC lineages. We thus assessed NSC and neuronal behaviour when chamber formation is impaired. First, we investigated the effect of chamber formation on NSC survival and proliferation, knocking down the PI3K/Akt pathway in cortex glia (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). NSC numbers were unaffected, showing that NSC survival is not compromised when the chamber cannot be built (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We then determined the cell cycle profile of NSCs by staining for phosphohistone H3 (PH3) and assessing EdU incorporation. We observed a small, but significant increase in PH3<sup>+</sup> and PH3<sup>-</sup> EdU<sup>-</sup> NSCs, at the expense of EdU<sup>+</sup> NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We then turned to NSC progeny, wondering if a primary function of cortex glia during late larval stages is to support newborn neurons. Using TUNEL staining, we determined the degree of neuronal cell death when chamber formation is impaired. Whereas control conditions showed few TUNEL<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), PI3K/Akt pathway knockdown in cortex glia induced pronounced TUNEL<sup>+</sup> neuron staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). In addition, VNC total neuronal volume decreased in this condition compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that neuron number is decreased when chamber formation is impaired. We thus propose that preventing cortex glial chamber formation leads to increased neuronal apoptosis. In contrast, a condition where cortex glial behaviour is affected without chamber impairment (<italic>stg</italic> knockdown in cortex glia, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) did not alter NSC division or the number of TUNEL<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). Altogether these results indicate that preventing cortex glial chamber formation has little impact on NSC survival and proliferation, but is crucial for newborn neuron survival.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we demonstrate that the cortex glial niche cells are able to integrate both external, nutritional signals and local NSC behaviour, triggering remodelling of their architecture. The encasing of each NSC lineage is in turn essential for successful neurogenesis by ensuring the survival of newborn neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Importantly, our work reveals a previously unidentified NSC lineage to cortex glial signal. NSC reactivation, sufficient for triggering lineage encasing, leads to the production of new neurons. NSC lineages are enclosed at about the time of the first NSC division, before any substantial production of neurons. Although we cannot completely rule out that neurons contribute to lineage encasing, we propose that NSCs are the signal-sending cells due to the timing of the event.</p><p>The instructive signals sent by NSCs to remodel the cortex glia could be either mechanical or secreted. Interestingly, blocking endocytosis and vesicle recycling in NSCs through dynamin inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) has a limited impact on chamber formation, mostly leading to a small reduction in cortex glial membranes. This suggests that dynamin-dependent signalling in NSCs is not a major player required to complete chambers around each NSC lineage. Further investigation will be required to identify the main molecular cues from the NSCs, and how they are transmitted to the cortex glia.</p><p>How the cortex glial chamber protects newborn neurons from apoptosis remains to be understood. In the adult mammalian brain, astrocytes are key players supporting the different stages of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gengatharan et al., 2016</xref>). This includes neuronal survival, by providing ion buffering and neurotransmitter recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sloan and Barres, 2014</xref>). However, to what extent astrocytes adapt to environmental changes while maintaining these protective roles is as yet unknown. We show that early in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval development, cortex glia architecture allows BBB-derived insulin-like peptides to reach NSCs during reactivation. Only once NSC proliferation has become nutrition-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>), is cortex glial chamber formation fully achieved. This illustrates the importance of cortex glial integration of both environmental and NSC signals. In mammals, BBB endothelial cells also constitute a source of diffusible and contact-dependent signals important for NSC maintenance, proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldman and Chen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tavazoie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ottone et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, mammalian NSCs and endothelial cells closely associate at specific sites lacking pericyte and astrocyte covering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tavazoie et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, a remarkable coordination between niche architecture and signalling across the BBB exists in both mammals and Drosophila. In the light of our findings, it would be of great interest to see if and how the BBB, astrocyte and NSC cross talk adapts to external and internal changes whilst supporting neurogenesis in the mammalian brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Genetics</title><p>The following stocks were used: <italic>Nrv2::GFP</italic> (protein trap FlyTrap, BDSC stock 6828), <italic>NP2222-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Awasaki et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>cyp4g15-GAL4</italic> (Janelia line, BDSC stock 50472, this study), <italic>grh-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>), <italic>insc-GAL4</italic> (<italic>Mz1407</italic> from J.

Murphy). The tracked markers are cortex glial membrane (Nrv2::GFP, green), NSC nuclei (Dpn, grey) and neuronal nuclei (ElaV, red). The script allows a subregion of the sample to be selected by drawing a bounding box in the X,Y plane. This is necessary in the real world where only a portion of the image may be relevant. For example, a brain image may contain substantial amounts of trachea (stained by Nrv2::GFP) that must be avoided.</p><p>The average intensity is computed within the bounded region for each layer of the stack and for each channel. This gives an average intensity versus depth curve for each channel. Since it is the distribution of marker that is of interest here, not its absolute value, the curves are normalised such that the peak intensity for each channel is one. A quadratic is fitted to the peak intensity sample and its two immediate neighbours for each channel. Differentiating the quadratic allows the position of the curve's peak to be estimated with precision better than the stack spacing. Each channel's curve is plotted with depth on the X-axis and averaged intensity on the Y-axis. A vertical line is plotted through the estimated peak position for each curve to facilitate reading the peak position against the X-axis scale.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cortex glial membrane measurements</title><p>For each VNC we selected a portion of the image, centred on thoracic NSCs, that is devoid of tracheal signal. We measured NSC numbers as well as the total intensity of the cortex glial membrane signal (Nrv2::GFP, green). For each experiment (control and experimental conditions), one specific threshold was chosen that would best fit the actual staining and kept throughout the analysis. The GFP intensity divided by NSC numbers represents the ratio of cortex glial membrane to NSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>VNC neuronal volume measurements</title><p>For each VNC, we selected only the thoracic portion.

Cortex glia evolve throughout larval development by undergoing 3 distinctive stages: membrane expansion, formation of NSC chamber and glial extension, which is closely co-related to reactivation and development of NSC. Authors have showed that starvation prevents proper formation of the cortex glial chamber, of which phenotype is recapitulated either by disrupting BBB or by expression of PI3K_DN in the cortex glia. However, constitutive activation of AKT in the cortex glia upon starvation is not sufficient to restore neither NSC nor the cortex glia organization. These results indicate that autonomous PI3K/AKT activity in the cortex glia is not enough to establish its own structure. Interestingly, blocking NSC reactivation strongly affects the cortex glia organization and forced NSC reactivation upon starvation is sufficient to restore the cortex glia, suggesting that NSC reactivation is necessary and sufficient for the cortex glia formation upon starvation. Finally, authors also have showed that cortex glia formation is particularly important for the survival of new-born neurons as lack of cortex glia induces neuronal cell death.</p><p>This work is straightforward and interesting in that it suggests dual modifications of the NSC niche development in association with the NSC development. However, I found the study requires further supports for mechanistic details underlying these phenomena, which are very central points for the paper.</p><p>1) Although previous studies have identified that Dilp6 originated from the surface glia is essential for the NSC reactivation via BBB, it is unclear whether cortex glia development is also controlled by the same insulin.

If NSC-derived local signal only contributes to the organization of the cortex glia, timely control of NSC activity during development will differentially influence the cortex glial structure. Current version of study lacks detail developmental analysis on distinctive control of expansion or organization of the cortex glia, which would further strengthen the relevance of findings.</p><p>3) Correlated to point 1 and 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H, J,K and L</xref>, expression of Akt_act in the NSC upon starvation at 96 ALH shows almost complete restoration of cortex glia formation compare to fed control.

Neuronal stem cells when re-activated in the larva start proliferation and give rise to a progeny of neurons. During this process niche cells are enclosed in a microenvironment consisting of NCS, cortex glia and neurons. The encasement formed by cortex glia is vital for proper differentiation and survival of the newborn neurons and the cellular interactions giving rise to this tailored niche was not known in detail prior to the present study. The authors first describe the sequence of morphological events in the formation of the encasement, then move on to show how nutritional signals, cells of the blood brain barrier (BBB), NSCs and cortex glia interact in a sequence to ensure proper differentiation of the niche cells. Signals include nutrients, insulin-IGF signaling (IIS) and some unknown factor (matrix protein?). The study takes us a small step forwards in understanding how the niche develops and its importance for survival of newborn neurons, but does not impress me as a huge conceptual leap. However, the paper seems to be written as a short communication, and as such it may be alright that the story is not complete. The schematic figures (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5 and Supplemental Figure 1</xref>) are really instructive.</p><p>I have some rather minor queries and suggestions for improvement of the paper.</p><p>1) The paper is apparently some form of short communication and the authors have only one header: Introduction and Results. What about Discussion/Conclusions? Usually Results and Discussion are merged (with a separate Introduction) or there are no headers at all (e. g. as in Nature letters).</p><p>2. In the Introduction: the authors say &quot;… a simpler model, the postembryonic larval brain of…&quot;. However, they study the simpler VNC, not the brain (which is far more complex, and probably not equally suitable for this kind of study).</p><p>3. In the Introduction the authors mention that the BBB mediates the impact of nutrition on the NCS reactivation and that one BBB derived signal is insulin like peptides (DILPs) that bind to the receptor (InR) on NCSs. However, the authors do not really define what constitutes the BBB. What cells are forming this tissue and which of them produce DILPs? Presumably the same cells are nutrient sensing. Is it known what the sensor is? Is it slimfast or some similar transporter? I ask this because in mammals the BBB is formed by several cell types and structures. Only in the Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> there is an indication that the BBB is composed of specific cells (glial cells) – but no mention in the text. Would be useful to have some more detailed information on the BBB in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in the Introduction.</p><p>4.

The experiment to show the role of NCS mitotic entry, rather than enlargement (growth), promotes chamber completion, by testing Perlecan mutants seems rather weak and preliminary as evidence.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In their manuscript, Spéder and Brand address a largely unconsidered but important question of how cells that constitute stem cell niches (in this case cortex glia) adapt and remodel over time to meet the needs of the stem cells and stem cell progeny they harbor.</p><p>The authors focus on neural stem cells and neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ventral nerve cord. They are enveloped in discreet chambers by cortex glia. These glia respond to systemic nutritional status to reactivate quiescent neural stem cells through the secretion of insulin-like peptides. They characterize the changes in cortex glial membrane remodeling in relation to the quiescence and reactivation of the neural stem cells. They find that cortex glia undergo striking membrane remodeling in parallel with stem cell reactivation to form chambers around them and their neuronal progeny. The authors go on to show that PI3K activity in cortex glia leads to membrane expansion but not encapsulation or chamber formation. Instead they show that stem cell reactivation (by PI3K activity) is required for encapsulation. Finally, the authors show that while glial chamber formation or encapsulation is dispensable for stem cell proliferation and survival, it is required for the survival of newly formed neurons. Overall, this work nicely addresses an interesting aspect of niche cell dynamics in relation to changing stem cell needs and shows that two-way communication between niche cells and stem cells and/or their progeny is required to coordinate the process.</p><p>Nonetheless, the manuscript would be improved by addressing the following points:</p><p>1) The authors clearly showed that stem cell reactivation is required for chamber formation. A major focus of the manuscript is the argument that NSCglial signals promote chamber formation. However, the experiments in the manuscript cannot distinguish whether the relevant encapsulation-promoting signals arise from the stem cells (as the authors assert) or from the neuronal progeny born when these cells become reactivated. This is an important point to clarify as it is strongly emphasized in the text. For example, how does encapsulation proceed when neuronal progeny are killed off? How does Shibirets expression in stem cells or neurons affect chamber formation?</p><p>2) If the relevant signals do indeed arise from stem cells, they could be either mechanical, or secreted as suggested by the authors. They note chamber formation defects in perlecan mutants and suggest that &quot;NSC mitotic entry, rather than enlargement, promotes chamber completion around each NSC lineage&quot;. The link between defects in perlecan mutants and stem cell mitotic entry is not clear. What is the source of perlecan (systemic or local)? Whole animal perlecan mutants are very disrupted. How does overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases in either stem cells or neurons affect chamber formation?</p><p>3)The authors show that glial chamber formation is dispensable for stem cell proliferation and survival, thus in this context once reactivated by glial insulins, stem cells carry on independently of the niche. On the other hand neuronal progeny survival depends on glial chamber formation. Thus, rather than providing a niche for supporting stem cells, cortex glia may be providing a differentiation niche for neurons. Do these neurons differentiate appropriately if neuronal death is prevented by overexpression of P35 when chamber formation is impaired?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30413.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1) Although previous studies have identified that Dilp6 originated from the surface glia is essential for the NSC reactivation via BBB, it is unclear whether cortex glia development is also controlled by the same insulin.

Manipulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in the cortex glia shows that it is necessary for membrane growth but not sufficient for chamber organisation. This suggests that membrane growth does not lead per se to NSC encapsulation and that the two elements are indeed separable. It also suggests that an additional input is needed to convert this growth into a tailored architecture, anchoring it to NSC lineages. In addition, our analysis of the developmental timing of chamber formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 B-F</xref>) shows that substantial membrane growth occurs before complete NSC reactivation. Delaying NSC reactivation affects glial architecture more than membrane growth, whilst forcing NSC reactivation is able to lead to NSC encapsulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).
