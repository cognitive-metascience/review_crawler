activity to the vasculature driving cerebral hemodynamics is important for (1) the basic understanding of cerebrovascular regulation and (2) interpretation of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals. Using a combination of optogenetic stimulation and 2-photon imaging in mice, we demonstrate that selective activation of cortical excitation and inhibition elicits distinct vascular responses and identify the vasoconstrictive mechanism as Neuropeptide Y (NPY) acting on Y1 receptors. The latter implies that task-related negative Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI signals in the cerebral cortex under normal physiological conditions may be mainly driven by the NPY-positive inhibitory neurons. Further, the NPY-Y1 pathway may offer a potential therapeutic target in cerebrovascular disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14315.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14315.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14315.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Unlike other cells in the body, brain cells contain almost no energy reserves and rely on blood vessels for continuous supply of oxygen. A change in the brain’s activity can cause these blood vessels to either dilate or constrict, which alters the supply to match the change in demand. However, it is not known which signals cause these changes in the blood vessels.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that individual blood vessels in an intact brain tend to dilate when the brain’s activity increases, and constrict when brain activity is inhibited. However, these studies were based on correlations, and there was no direct evidence that the inhibitory cells cause blood vessels to constrict.</p><p>Uhlirova, Kılıç et al. now provide such evidence. The experiments made use of mice that had been genetically modified such that the excitatory or inhibitory nerve cells in their brains could be selectively activated by shining a blue light on the brain’s surface. The vessels in the outer millimeter of the gray matter of each mouse’s brain were imaged in detail, both before and after the blue light was used to activate the nerve cells.</p><p>The experiments reveal that both excitatory and inhibitory nerve cells can cause blood vessels in the brain to dilate. However, blood vessels in the brain will only constrict in response to inhibitory nerve cells. Uhlirova, Kılıç et al. went on to identify a molecule called Neuropeptide Y (or NPY short) as a signal that triggers the constriction of the blood vessels. This signaling molecule is released by a specific sub-type of inhibitory nerve cell and it binds to a receptor protein on the brain’s blood vessels to make them constrict.</p><p>These findings suggest that NPY and its receptor on blood vessels may offer promising targets for drugs to treat diseases of the brain’s blood vessels. Further studies are now needed to identify the signals responsible for the dilation of blood vessels in the brain.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the past decade, the field of cerebral blood flow and metabolism has experienced a paradigm shift with respect to neurovascular coupling mechanisms. An earlier 'metabolic' hypothesis postulated that an increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to increased neuronal activity (a.k.a. 'functional hyperemia') was directly related to energetic costs and driven by bi-products of energy consumption (CO<sub>2</sub>, lactate, H<sup>+</sup>, etc.) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Raichle and Mintun, 2006</xref>]). However, a growing body of experimental evidence, including our own, indicates that while molecules produced by increased energy metabolism do have a vasoactive effect, much of the acute CBF response in vivo under healthy conditions is driven by vasoactive messengers related to neuronal signaling (for recent reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kleinfeld et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cauli and Hamel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buxton et al., 2014</xref>]). These messengers, released by specific cell types, actively regulate arteriolar diameters – a key control parameter in the CBF response. Thus, activation of specific types of neurons (and potentially astrocytes) as opposed to the undifferentiated spiking or synaptic activity is likely to determine the vascular response.</p><p>Previous studies provided evidence for the involvement of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in CBF regulation. In Pyramidal cells (PCs), activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has been demonstrated to stimulate release of prostaglandin E2 produced by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) causing an increase in CBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lacroix et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lecrux et al., 2011</xref>). In inhibitory neurons (INs) – that can be further classified into subtypes based on their neurotransmitter/neuropeptide content, shape, and neurophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Markram et al., 2004</xref>) – release of neuropeptides and nitric oxide (NO) has been hypothesized to provide a bidirectional CBF control (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cauli and Hamel, 2010</xref>]). Indeed, experiments in cortical brain slices have demonstrated that stimulation of INs can cause dilation or constriction of arteriolar segments embedded in the sliced tissue with the polarity of the effect depending on the INs cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cauli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Perrenoud et al., 2012</xref>). Further, selective optogenetic (OG) stimulation of INs in vivo was shown to increase CBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anenberg et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>On the level of single cortical arterioles, two-photon imaging studies have revealed that the hemodynamic response to a sensory stimulus is composed of a combination of dilatory and constrictive phases with the relative strength of vasoconstriction co-varying with that of neuronal inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Devor et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tian et al., 2010</xref>). However, direct evidence that activation of INs can cause arteriolar vasoconstriction in vivo is missing. Therefore, in the present study, we asked whether selective OG stimulation of INs can cause the biphasic dilation/constriction sequence characteristic of sensory-induced responses and whether the constriction phase was specific to activation of INs rather than excitatory neurons. Our results confirm the ability of INs to drive the biphasic arteriolar response and provide the first in vivo evidence for the major role of the NPY-Y1 pathway mediating vasoconstriction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sensory stimulation induces arteriolar dilation followed by constriction with the fastest dilation onset below layer IV</title><p>Previously, we and others have shown that sensory stimuli in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) induced biphasic changes in arteriolar diameters – dilation followed by constriction – with the onset and time-to-peak of dilation depending on the cortical depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lindvere et al., 2013</xref>). In these studies, imaging was performed in the rat SI within the top ~500 μm (layers I-IV in the rat SI), and the fastest dilation occurred at the deepest measurement locations. Since infragranular layers V and VI were not sampled, it remains unclear whether sensory-induced dilation initiated in layer IV (which has the highest metabolic load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sokoloff et al., 1977</xref>]) or below.</p><p>In the present study, we extended these measurements down to ~900 μm (layer VI) in the mouse SI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This was possible due to utilization of longer illumination wavelengths (see Materials and methods) and higher transparency of the mouse cortex compared to the rat; this is due to smaller diameter of the surface vessels attenuating light. The stimulus consisted of a 2-s train of electrical pulses (100 μs, 1 mA, 3 Hz) delivered to the contralateral forepaw. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran was injected intravenously to visualize the vasculature. Single-vessel diameter measurements were performed at 866 locations along 120 diving arterioles and their branches (n = 320 branch measurements) in 49 wild type subjects at depths from 20 to 850 μm. Consistent with our previous data, many of the measurements exhibited a biphasic arteriolar diameter change: dilation followed by constriction before returning to the baseline. To quantify the constriction amplitude, individual time-courses were temporally smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 0.5 s); the peak constriction was determined as the minimum value within 3–13 s after the stimulus onset. About half of the measurements showed constriction with the peak constriction amplitude exceeding 1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14315.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sensory stimulus-induced arteriolar response.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An example vascular image stack throughout the cortical depth.

We measured 93 diving arterioles within the forepaw area of SI at different depths: from 30 to 560 μm below the cortical surface; 217 measured locations in total. At some locations, lateral branches were captured in the same focal plane within &lt;200 μm lateral distance from the trunk; 88 branch measurements in total. Sensory stimulation – a 2-s train of electrical pulses (100 μs, 1 mA) delivered to a forepaw at 3 Hz – was presented at one or more measurement locations to control for normal functional hyperemia.</p><p>As with the sensory stimulus, the OG stimulus elicited a biphasic vascular response: dilation followed by constriction before returning to the baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). When measured at the same vessel location within the center of the forepaw area, the OG response featured a more pronounced constriction phase compared to the sensory one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The overall shape of the OG response was only weakly sensitive to variation in the light pulse duration (200–430 ms) and intensity (0.7–2.8 mW) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). Thereafter, unless indicated, the stimulus consisted of a pair of light pulses separated by 130 ms for 450-ms total stimulus duration. These stimulus parameters produced a robust response while allowing a measurement point in between the two pulses. Averaged within a subject, 16 out of 17 OG time courses exhibited a clear constriction phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Grouping dilation time-courses by depth revealed that the fastest dilation onset and time-to-peak occurred at the deepest measurement locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Indeed, the onset and time-to-peak gradually decreased with depth (p=1.2 × 10<sup>−3</sup> and 4 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The linear regression slope for the onset was consistent with dilation propagating upstream along diving arteriolar trunks at ~900 μm/s.</p><p>Next, we quantified the 'constriction onset' as the time of transition from the dilatory to constrictive phase for each measurement location. Constriction onset also gradually decreased with depth (p=6.4 × 10<sup>−6</sup>) indicating that deeper dilation had faster decay succeeded by constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Deeper measurements exhibited a trend towards higher peak amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This trend, however, was not statistically significant due to variation between individual measurements. Finally, presenting the same OG stimulus in wild type animals did not cause any detectable physiological changes (not shown), arguing against potential dilatory/constrictive effects of heat generated by the 473-nm laser within our range of the laser power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Christie et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results show that selective stimulation of INs was able to reproduce the biphasic dilation/constriction sequence characteristic of sensory-induced responses.

Hypothetically, however, indirect activation may be produced through disinhibition or generation of a 'rebound' action potential upon termination of the hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bean, 2007</xref>). This rebound mechanism is particularly relevant for deep PCs endowed with low threshold calcium conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de la Peña and Geijo-Barrientos, 1996</xref>). To control for these or any other unforeseen effects of the OG stimulation on PC activity, we performed extracellular recordings of the Local Field Potential (LFP) and Multi Unit Activity (MUA) in an additional 3 VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

This MUA response in the presence of LFP suppression suggests firing of INs rather than PCs.</p><p>To provide further evidence that OG stimulation did not engage PCs, we performed in vivo calcium imaging in an additional 3 VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). PCs and INs were identified using structural reference images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>, see Materials and methods). During spontaneous activity, the majority of imaged PCs exhibited characteristic calcium transients known to be associated with action potentials (AP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, left) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grewe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yaksi and Friedrich, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stosiek et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, calcium transients in INs had variable kinetics and/or small amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, right). Poor quality of calcium signals in INs is consistent with previous reports and is likely to reflect low density of voltage-gated calcium channels and/or higher calcium buffering capacity in INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Langer and Helmchen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kerlin et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, calcium imaging in INs may not provide enough sensitivity for the detection of single (or a few) APs generated by the 5-ms OG stimulus. Indeed, the stimulus produced no detectable calcium increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To ensure that this stimulus was sufficient to elicit firing, we recorded MUA activity right after acquisition of calcium imaging data. Despite the absence of a calcium increase, there was a robust MUA response to every light pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). While the calcium imaging experiments failed to detect firing of INs, they provided further evidence that PCs were not activated by OG stimulation. This is because no calcium increase was detected in PCs in response to the OG stimulus, although spontaneous calcium transients were readily detectable.</p><p>Taken together, these data demonstrate that indirect recruitment of PCs was unlikely to contribute to the OG-induced vascular responses. Furthermore, both the dilation and constriction phases of the response were present after blocking glutamatergic synaptic transmission with AP5 (NMDA receptor antagonist, 500 μM) and CNQX (AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, 200 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, see Materials and methods). These results are in agreement with a recent laser speckle contrast imaging study in the same VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP mouse line, which concluded that the effect of OG stimulation on CBF was independent on synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anenberg et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, arteriolar dilation and constriction in response to the OG stimulation was a consequence of direct activation of INs expressing ChR2 with no reliance on excitatory cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Neurovascular mechanism induced by the OG stimulation of INs requires spiking</title><p>At first glance, the finding that OG-induced dilation initiated below layer IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>) while the 473-nm light used to deliver the OG stimulus was practically confined to the top 200 μm is puzzling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aravanis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Foutz et al., 2012</xref>). However, a previous study using OG stimulation of layer V PCs has shown that stimulation at the cortical surface was effective in inducing firing of cell bodies located in layer V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beltramo et al., 2013</xref>). Similar to PCs, some subtypes of INs (with bipolar, bitufted, double-bouquet, Martinotti-like morphologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Markram et al., 2004</xref>]) span across the cortical depth with the top part of their dendritic and/or axonal arbor residing in the upper cortical layers.

Assuming that ChR2 was indeed present in the axons, we reasoned that depolarization of these axons could be sufficient for triggering antidromic APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schoenenberger et al., 2008</xref>) coupling the surface illumination to the release of vasoactive messengers in deep layers. In this case, we predicted that the vasoactive effect would be abolished by blocking APs and rescued by delivering the OG light stimulus directly to layer V (i.e., bypassing the need for antidromic APs as the means of communication). To test this hypothesis, we topically applied 50 μM of tetrodotoxin (TTX), a blocker of Na<sup>+</sup> channels required for generation and propagation of APs (n = 3 subjects). TTX abolished both the dilation and constriction response phase at all depths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we used a tapered optical fiber (see Materials and methods) positioned with the light-emitting tip ~600 μm below the surface (layer V). Under control conditions, OG stimulation through the fiber induced the characteristic biphasic arteriolar response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, black curve). In the presence of TTX, however, both the dilation and constriction phase were lost (n = 3 subjects) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, red curve).</p><p>The failure to rescue the response in the presence of TTX while delivering light directly to layer V argues against antidromic APs as the means of communication between the surface excitation and deep dilation onset. These results also imply that, in the absence of spikes, dendritic depolarization was insufficient to induce vascular responses arguing for release of vasoactive agents from axonal terminals rather than via dendritic exocytosis. In addition, these results indicate that the density of ChR2 in axonal terminals was insufficient to drive the release directly, i.e., due to the depolarization and calcium influx resulting from opening of ChR2 in these terminals. Thus, (1) spikes were required to enable release of vasoactive agents, and (2) the communication of the surface excitation to deep release likely occurred via propagation of depolarization along dendrites rather than axons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The dilation phase is likely to be mediated by bipolar INs with superficial dendrites and deep axons</title><p>In contrast to axons that support regenerative propagation of APs, dendritic depolarization decays with distance. Therefore, first we asked whether depolarization of superficial dendrites in INs could, in principle, drive the soma, located in layer V, above its firing threshold. To address this question, we computed membrane potential in morphologically reconstructed INs. Specifically, we chose bipolar INs positive for Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP). This choice was motivated by the desired orientation of the dendritic and axonal arbors in VIP-positive INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) as well as the known vasodilatory properties of VIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cauli et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2014</xref>).</p><p>Reconstructed VIP-positive neurons were obtained from the NeuroMorpho.Org (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ascoli et al., 2007</xref>) (see Materials and methods). We computed the membrane potential at the soma in response to a step depolarization ('voltage clamp') of the upper part of their dendritic tree. All computations were carried out in the Neuron simulation environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hines and Carnevale, 1997</xref>). We assumed passive membrane properties and clamped the voltage of the top 50-, 100- or 150-μm slab of the dendritic tree to 0 mV, which is the reversal potential of ChR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nagel et al., 2003</xref>). For all three conditions, we observed a strong depolarization of the soma that developed within ~50 ms. The steady state depolarization reached values between −40 to −50 mV, depending on the number of dendritic branches within the clamped region, comparable to the reported −43.7 mV average firing threshold for VIP-positive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Neske et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In reality, dendritic membranes of INs possess active ionic conductances (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cauli et al., 2014</xref>]) enhancing the coupling of dendritic excitation to generation of spikes. Therefore, our calculation underestimates the achievable somatic depolarization. Thus, we conclude that depolarization of the upper dendrites in bipolar INs can drive spikes in somas located as deep as layer V.</p><p>The need to overcome the decay of depolarization along the dendrite implies that OG stimulation delivered directly to layer V should be more effective in inducing the vascular response compared to stimulation from the surface. To test this hypothesis, we made paired measurements in response to stimulation through the objective and fiber (positioned with the light-emitting tip ~600 μm below the surface) at each measured location (n = 30 locations along 4 arterioles in an additional 3 subjects, within 50–500 μm depth range). The stimulus consisted of a single light pulse (330–430 ms duration). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> shows the vascular responses, averaged across subjects, for each condition and the corresponding laser power. Normalized by the laser power, the peak dilation in response to the fiber was roughly twice as large as that in response to stimulation through the objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, inset). Thus, initiation of dilation below layer IV in response to OG light at the cortical surface could be explained by depolarization of the superficial dendrites leading to firing of the soma (situated as deep as in layer V) and release of vasoactive agents from deep axons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The constriction phase is mediated by Y1 receptors for Neuropeptide Y</title><p>During the hemodynamic response to a sensory stimulus, the relative strength of arteriolar constriction in SI covaries with that of neuronal inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Devor et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2008</xref>). Thus, neurovascular mechanism(s) governing arteriolar constriction may be specific to activation of INs rather than excitatory neurons. To test this hypothesis, we employed Thy1-ChR2-YFP (line 18) mice where expression of ChR2 is limited to layer V PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arenkiel, 2007</xref>). Excitation of PCs can engage other cell types because glutamate released from PCs causes depolarization and firing of postsynaptic neurons. For that reason, we applied blockers of glutamatergic synaptic transmission (AP5 and CNQX, see Materials and methods) to avoid indirect activation of neuronal cell types other than PCs. Under control conditions, OG stimulation in Thy1-ChR2-YFP mice (using a single light pulse of 50–80 ms duration) elicited a biphasic arteriolar diameter change consisting of the initial dilation followed by constriction (n = 2 subjects, 28 measurement locations along 13 arterioles within 40–380 μm depth range; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, black). However, only dilation was observed in the presence of the glutamatergic blockers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, red). Thus, indirect activation of postsynaptic neurons accounted for the constriction phase. Taken together with the VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP data, these results indicate that both INs and PCs could drive dilation while constriction was selective to activation of INs.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14315.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Neurovascular mechanism of the constriction phase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Arteriolar response to OG stimulation of PCs in Thy1-ChR2-YFP subjects before (black) and after (red) application of AMPA/NMDA glutamatergic blockers (black and red, respectively).

Diving arterioles within the whisker pad representation of SI (i.e., Barrel cortex) displayed readily detectable biphasic arteriolar responses to the sensory stimuli consisting of dilation followed by a smaller amplitude constriction (n = 4 subjects, 11 measurement locations along 11 arterioles within 30–120 μm depth range; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> top, black).

In the present study, we used optogenetics to isolate the mechanisms originating from the inhibitory (GABAergic) population of cortical neurons. We demonstrate that OG stimulation elicited a biphasic diameter change composed of a combination of dilatory and constrictive phases. While dilation was also induced by OG stimulation of PCs, the constriction response was specific to activation of INs. Further, we identified the vasoconstrictive molecular agent as NPY acting on Y1 receptors and showed that the same NPY-Y1 pathway was responsible for the sensory stimulus-induced vasoconstriction. This finding supports previous observations in brain slices implicating NPY-positive INs as the primary mediators of vasoconstriction in cortical arterioles under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cauli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Perrenoud et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we reported the center-surround and contra-ipsilateral patterns of arteriolar diameter changes in SI in response to a sensory stimulus that were dominated by dilation within the receptive field and constriction in the surrounding region as well as in the ipsilateral to the stimulus hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Devor et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2008</xref>). The strength of constriction in these studies correlated with the strength of inhibition. In contrast to natural behavior of cortical circuits where specific types of INs play a differential role in 'local' and 'lateral' inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Helmstaedter et al., 2009</xref>), OG stimulation of INs in the present study produced indiscriminate activation across various inhibitory cell types. Therefore, arteriolar responses to the OG stimulation cannot be directly compared to the results from these previous studies. However, the finding of the NPY-Y1 pathway underlying constriction predicts that NPY-positive INs may be specifically involved in shaping the surround and ipsilateral neuronal inhibition.</p><p>OG stimulation in the VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP line produced a monophasic CBF increase in a recent laser speckle contrast imaging study by Anenberg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anenberg et al., 2015</xref>). Arteriolar constriction, however, would normally result in a CBF decrease, as we demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Devor et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2008</xref>). We speculate that the high-frequency stimulation protocol used by Anenberg and colleagues may have contributed to the lack of constriction and CBF decrease in their study. In contrast to other types of INs driving dilation, at least some NPY-positive neurons exhibit a pronounced spike latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Karagiannis et al., 2009</xref>) and thus may not respond well to short (5-ms duration) light pulses delivered at high frequency (100 Hz).</p><p>Prior studies on neuropeptides in different brain areas have demonstrated that the release could occur from axonal terminals as well as via dendritic exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Merighi et al., 2011</xref>). In the present study, OG stimulation of ChR2-expressing dendrites and somas under TTX was not effective in causing vascular responses while delivering the stimulating light either to the cortical surface or deep layers. These results suggest that the corresponding vasoactive agents, including NPY, were released from axons rather than via dendritic exocytosis, while spikes were required to drive the release. Yet, we cannot rule out a possibility of dendritic release induced by back-propagating APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stuart and Sakmann, 1994</xref>). Indeed, back-propagating APs have been reported in bipolar, bitufted and neurogliaform INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaiser et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cho et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The requirement for spiking during the OG response should not be interpreted in the context of the 'classical' question of whether it is the spiking or synaptic activity that correlates better with BOLD fMRI. Historically, this question was motivated by the idea of a metabolic feedback, postulating that CBF increase was mechanistically related to the accumulation of vasoactive energy metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Raichle and Mintun, 2006</xref>). The present results, on the other hand, demonstrate a feed forward mechanism where specific vasoactive signaling agents released by active neurons drive dilation and constriction, depending on neuronal cell type. Further, the initial dilation in our experiments occurred in infragranular layers and not in layer IV, which is the most metabolic layer in SI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sokoloff et al., 1977</xref>). These findings do not contradict the fact that some of the energy metabolites are vasoactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gordon et al., 2008</xref>). Rather, they suggest that, under healthy conditions in vivo it is the vasoactive messengers related to neuronal signaling and not energy metabolites that play the dominant role in CBF regulation.</p><p>The identity of vasodilatory mechanisms induced by OG stimulation of INs requires further investigation. Previous studies put forward a number of possibilities including release of VIP and NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cauli and Hamel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). The present results indicate that INs mediating dilation may have bipolar morphologies with dendrites extending to the surface and axons reaching to deep cortical layers. VIP-positive INs meet these morphological criteria, and some of them co-express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cauli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Perrenoud et al., 2012</xref>). These features as well as known vasodilatory properties of VIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cauli et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2014</xref>) put forward VIP-positive INs as a primary suspect initiating dilation in deep layers. Future experiments using restricted expression of OG actuators/inhibitors in sub-populations of INs with known repertoire of vasoactive signaling molecules would be required to comprehensively address this hypothesis.</p><p>It is well established that dilation and constriction can propagate along arteriolar walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Segal and Duling, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rosenblum et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jensen and Holstein-Rathlou, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Peppiatt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Welsh and Segal, 1998</xref>), and these conducted responses may have contributed to the spread of OG dilation and constriction throughout the cortical depth in our data. This possibility is consistent with the observed slowing down of dilation kinetics towards the cortical surface and the trend towards a gradual decrease in the peak amplitude – this type of behavior is expected for a decaying propagated response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Iadecola et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). These findings, however, do not imply that neurovascular coupling mechanisms reside exclusively in deep cortical layers and do not rule out local lamina-specific neurovascular communication at every depth. In the presence of both local and conducted signaling, the onset of dilation would be determined by the faster of the two processes. Therefore, substantial delays in the superficial arteriolar branches suggest that local neurovascular communication in the upper layers, if it exists, has slower kinetics.</p><p>The observed gradual decrease of the dilation latency and time-to-peak down to the infragranular layers is in agreement with laminar resolved functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Siero et al., 2011</xref>) but at odds with a recent high resolution fMRI in the rat that used a line-scanning method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). The apparent discrepancy with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yu et al. (2014)</xref> may reflect the complex nature of the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal that depends on the balance between O<sub>2</sub> delivery and consumption as well as on the measurement theory specific to the chosen data acquisition paradigm. Our present conclusions, on the other hand, rely on direct and assumption-free measurements of the physiological parameter of interest – the arteriolar diameter.</p><p>Astrocytic contribution to either dilation or constriction evoked by the OG stimulation of INs was not specifically addressed in the current study. A number of recent reports including our own have provided negative evidence for the involvement of calcium-dependent release of vasoactive gliotransmitters in normal regulation of cortical blood flow by local neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nizar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonder and McCarthy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Takata et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jego et al., 2014</xref>). However, we cannot rule out calcium-independent pathways. Expression of Y1 receptors has been documented in astrocytic cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abounader et al., 1999</xref>); although, more recent transcriptomic analyses of astrocytes isolated from adult mouse brains have revealed little or no expression of these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cahoy et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The present study has a number of limitations. As such, the pattern of OG stimulation in space and time did not mimic naturally occurring neuronal activity. In addition, the possible variation in the level of ChR2 expression could have resulted in bias towards specific INs cell types. The design of our OG study, however, did not rely on natural or balanced neuronal activity patterns. Instead, our major goal was to produce artificially selective activation of cortical INs as a single population for isolation of their vasoactive effects. Another potential pitfall is that OG stimulation of INs could lead to an indirect recruitment of PCs, which have been implicated in regulation of blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lecrux et al., 2011</xref>). However, our electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging data produced no evidence for PC recruitment. Finally, the majority of the experiments in our study were performed under anesthesia and in the presence of a paralytic agent that could have affected the vasoreactivity and neurovascular coupling. As such, the ketamine/xylazine anesthesia employed by Anenberg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anenberg et al., 2015</xref>) may provide an additional explanation for the discrepancy in our results regarding the constriction phase in response to OG stimulation of INs. Stepping away from anesthesia is an ongoing effort in many laboratories, including our own, but still remains a challenge for studies that require pharmacological manipulations, insertion of recording electrodes, and deep imaging. In the present study, we have confirmed the biphasic nature of the arteriolar diameter change in awake mice, both in response to a sensory stimulus and OG activation of INs.</p><p>The constrictive effect of INs demonstrated in the present study, taken together with previous theoretical calculations suggesting that inhibition has lower metabolic costs than excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2002</xref>), raises the possibility that paired CBF and cerebral metabolic rate of O<sub>2</sub> (CMRO<sub>2</sub>) measurements can provide information about the net respective contributions of excitatory and inhibitory activity within the ensemble neuronal network response, due to their differential vasoactive role and energetic costs. This possibility is of particular interest for the quantitative BOLD fMRI approach (a.k.a. the “calibrated BOLD”) that combines the BOLD and arterial spin labeling (ASL) methods to isolate the effects of CBF and CMRO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hoge, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pike, 2012</xref>). Thus, we are tempted to speculate that identifying the CBF and CMRO<sub>2</sub> effects induced by excitatory and inhibitory neurons could open a new direction in which quantitative fMRI may be able to provide information on the underlying neuronal activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal procedures for imaging under anesthesia</title><p>All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines established by the UCSD Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). We used 103 adult mice of either sex including 48 VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP and 2 Thy1-ChR2-YFP (using promoters from <italic>Slc32a1</italic> and <italic>Thy1</italic> genes, respectively; Jackson Stock Numbers 014548 and 007612, respectively; both heterozygous on a mixed C57Bl6/ICR background), and 53 wild type ICR. Surgical procedures in mice expressing ChR2 were performed in a dark room using a 515 nm longpass filter (Semrock FF01-515/LP-25) in the surgical microscope light source to avoid OG stimulation during installation of the cortical window. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane during surgical procedures (2% initially, 0.5–1% during all procedures). A cannula was inserted into the femoral artery. A metal holding bar was glued to the temporal bone for immobilization of the head during imaging. An area of skull overlying the forepaw region of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) contralateral to the holding bar was exposed and dura mater removed. A ~2 × 2 mm cranial window was centered on stereotactic coordinates: AP -0.5, ML 2.25.</p><p>In the majority of experiments, the red fluorescent dye sulforhodamine 101 (SR101, S7635, Sigma) in artificial CSF (ACSF) was applied topically for ~2 min to label astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nimmerjahn et al., 2004</xref>) providing a contrast in tissue that was used for visual assessment of potential damage due to experimental procedures. ACSF contained 142 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 3.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4. The excess dye was washed with ACSF. A drop of agarose (1% wt/vol, A9793, Sigma) in ACSF was applied on the brain surface, and the exposure was covered with a round glass coverslip (5 mm, WPI) and sealed with dental acrylic. To avoid herniation of the exposed brain due to excessive intracranial pressure, the dura mater over the IVth cerebral ventricle was punctured, thus allowing drainage of CSF. After the exposure was closed, the drainage hole was sealed with agarose.</p><p>In experiments involving pharmacological manipulations, calcium imaging, or insertion of an optical fiber, the round glass coverslip was cut straight on one side facing a gap in the dental acrylic seal. The agar was cut down along the cut side forming a vertical wall. The exposure was aligned with the agar wall such that ACSF under the objective was in direct contact with the cortical surface allowing drugs to penetrate into the cortical tissue.</p><p>After closing of the exposure, mice were left to rest under 1% isoflurane for 45 min. Then, isoflurane was discontinued and anesthesia maintained with α-chloralose (50 mg/kg/h IV, C0128, Sigma or 100459, MP Biochemicals). Mice were paralyzed with pancuronium bromide (0.4 mg/kg/h IV, P1918, Sigma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shin et al., 2007</xref>) and ventilated (~110 min<sup>-1</sup>) with 30% O<sub>2</sub> in air. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran (MW = 2 MDa, FD-2000S, Sigma) was injected IV (50–100 μl of 5% (w/v) solution in phosphate-buffered saline) to visualize the vasculature and control for the integrity of capillary bed. Expired CO<sub>2</sub> was measured continuously using a micro-capnometer (Cl240, Columbus instruments). Heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature were monitored continuously. Blood gas was analyzed to cross-validate the micro-capnometer measurements. Respiration was adjusted to achieve PaCO<sub>2</sub> between 30 and 40 mmHg and pH between 7.35 and 7.45. α-chloralose and pancuronium in 5% dextrose saline were supplied through the femoral line every 30 min for the duration of data acquisition. Waiting for 45 min between closing of the exposure and drug injections minimized leakage of the drugs onto the exposed cortical tissue through the cut dural blood vessels.</p><p>For calcium imaging experiments, calcium indicator Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 AM (OGB1) (O-6807, Invitrogen, 50 μg) was first dissolved in 4 μl of 20% pluronic in DMSO (F-127, Invitrogen); 80 μl of ACSF were added to the OGB1 solution to yield a final concentration of 0.5 mM OGB1. The microinjection pipette was guided under the glass coverslip and positioned ~ 200 μm below the cortical surface using a Luigs &amp; Neumann translation stage (380FM-U) and manipulation equipment integrated into the Ultima system. The red fluorescent dye Alexa 594 (A-10442, Alexa Fluor 594 hydrazide, sodium salt, Invitrogen) was added to the OGB1 solution in order to visualize the micropipette during manipulation and to provide visual feedback during pressure-microinjection into the cortical tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stosiek et al., 2003</xref>).

During the PoRTS procedure, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2% initially followed by 1% during the surgery); their body temperature was maintained at 37°C. A custom holding bar allowing repeated head immobilization was glued to the skull overlaying the left hemisphere. On the right side, a ~3 3 mm area of skull was thinned until translucent and polished with silicon carbide grit powder (Convington Engineering). The exposure was centered on the Barrel cortex region of SI using stereotactic coordinates: AP −1.5, ML 2. A glass coverslip was glued to the thinned skull and fixed along the perimeter with dental acrylic. Additional dental acrylic was applied around the holding bar joining to the perimeter of the coverslip in order to reinforce the overall assembly.</p><p>After surgical implantation of the bar and a full day recovery, mice were habituated in 1 session/day to accept increasingly longer periods of head restraint under the microscope objective (up to 2 hr). During the head restraint, the animal was placed on a suspended bed. A drop of sweetened condensed milk was offered every 15 min during the fixation as a reward. Habituated head-fixed mice consumed the reward milk. They were free to readjust their body position and from time to time displayed natural grooming behavior. A video camera (Lifecam Studio, Microsoft; IR filter removed) with an NIR longpass filter (Midwest Optical LP920-25.5) was used for continuous observation of the mouse. The IR illumination (M940L3 - IR (940 nm) LED, Thorlabs) was invisible for the PMT photodetectors and generated no imaging artifacts. The camera frames were synchronized with two-photon imaging and recorded.

Ten stimulus trials were averaged at each measurement location.</p><p>In awake mice, sensory stimulus consisted of a train of three air puffs onto the whiskers contralateral to the cortical window. We used three 100-ms puffs at 3 Hz delivered through a plastic tube (2 mm inner diameter). The tube was positioned behind the whiskers to minimize the eye blink reflex. Seven to nine stimulus trials were averaged at each measurement location.</p><p>Stimulation devices (A365 stimulus isolator or PV830 picopump, WPI) were triggered using a separate PC that also acquired timing signals for data acquisition ('trigger out' signals for each frame/line) and physiological readings using a National Instruments IO DAQ interface (PCI-6229) controlled by custom-written software in MATLAB (MathWorks Inc.).

Since ChR2 in the VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP line is fused with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>), we used EYFP fluorescence to identify INs.

Next, we loaded cells with OGB1 within the same volume and performed in vivo calcium imaging in cortical layer II/III. OGB1 has a strong spectral overlap with EYFP, and, in addition, ChR2-EYFP expression in the VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP line is relatively weak. As a result, EYFP was not detectable after addition of OGB1. Therefore, we used SR101 to coregister OGB1 images with the reference (EYFP/SR101) images. EYFP-positive cells were labeled as INs, and cells negative for EYFP and SR101 were labeled as PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The reported p-value is for the t statistic using the null hypothesis that the slope is equal to zero.</p><p>When multiple categories were defined (e.g., time-courses with and without constriction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we averaged measurements for each category within a subject prior to performing statistics across subjects. When peak normalization was applied, we first averaged all time courses acquired within a subject. Then, averaged time courses were normalized by the peak amplitude before calculating the average across subjects.</p><p>For analysis of calcium imaging data, acquired in line-scan mode, line segments corresponding to individual neuronal cell bodies were segmented based on their intensity profile (cell bodies were brighter than neuropil). For each sampled neuron, the calcium signal per time point (i.e., one line of the line-scan) was calculated as an average of all pixels within the corresponding line segment. This calculation was repeated for each line in the time series to generate a single-neuron time-course. The same procedure was performed separately for each neuron, resulting in a family of neuron-specific time-courses for each line-scan. After digital removal of the OG light artifact, data were downsampled by a factor of two along the time axis to provide a 20-ms time resolution.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge support from the NIH (NS057198, EB00790, U01NS094232, NS082097, EB003832 and S10RR029050), the Research Council of Norway, and the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (project CEITEC 2020 (LQ1601)).

The dissociation of dilation and constriction and the implication of NPY in this process are the strongest elements of the paper. Overall this is a very elegant and technically impressive study. While most studies in the field focused almost exclusively on the role of astrocytes, this group and others have recently challenged the contribution of this cell type in this process, and now provide compelling in vivo evidence for the importance of cortical neurons in neurovascular coupling. The finding that some subpopulations of cortical neurons are specialized for the control of the intracortical vasculature will have an important impact on the reliable interpretation on fMRI signals widely used to infer neuronal activity in health and disease.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are inadequately supported claims, the most important of which involve not having recorded from neural firing directly. For example, the first section, with its indirect ruminations about what happens when the VGAT line is driven, has many points where leaps in inference (from light density to likely firing patterns to absence of dendritic effects) make the case less compelling. The reviewers both thought that the paper would be strengthened by including unit recordings (perhaps in a preparation without simultaneous vascular recording), however both reviewers and the editors agreed that doing this well (e.g. identifying the relevant interneurons) would be challenging and that therefore this was not absolutely required for acceptance. In the event that recordings are not included care should be taken to revise the text to acknowledge this missing line of evidence.</p><p>2) The inferences that the time course of the arteriolar response dictates the focus of the response initiation-that because the first onset is deep it must only initiate there-is tenuous. It could of course be a multi-tiered response, in accordance with the fact that the authors likely drove interneurons throughout the depth. The authors tiptoe around this and need to just state clearly that there could (and, likely are) many lamina-specific drivers.</p><p>3) While the authors mention the Anenberg, Murphy (2015) study, they should dive deeper into the differences (for example, that study did not report flow decreases – is this difference a volume vs. diameter vs. flow calculation difference across speckle vs. 2-photon, or is it about the time course of measurement, or is it a real disagreement about findings?) Any of these interpretations is fine from the perspective of the contribution of the current data, but I do want to know their take on this in print.

We also greatly appreciate the reviewers’ understanding that providing such evidence in vivo would be a challenging task. We made all efforts to strengthen our line of evidence in the following 3 ways:</p><p>A) Since SI cortex was not specifically examined in the original paper describing generation of the VGAT line, we confirmed expression of the EYFP-ChR2 construct in GABAergic INs. This new result is now included:</p><p>“Double immunofluorescence of ChR2-EYFP and GABA-producing glutamate decarboxylase in this mouse line revealed a virtually complete overlap of staining in the SI confirming that the ChR2-EYFP protein was indeed present only in GABAergic INs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p>B) We have included Multiple Unit Activity (MUA) data corresponding to the Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. OG stimulation for the duration of 200 ms resulted in a sharp and transient increase in MUA timed to the stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). During prolonged OG stimulation for 1s, the initial transient response was followed by a desynchronized activity, starting ~200 ms after the stimulus onset and lasting for the duration of the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Since LFP during OG stimulus was largely suppressed, we speculate that this MUA response reflects firing of INs: initially, the OG stimulus depolarizes INs causing a synchronized MUA response. Then, synaptically connected INs inhibit each other; this is why the initial MUA response is transient. During persistent OG stimulation, synaptic connectivity between different types of INs in the absence of a closed circuit loop (no participation of excitatory neurons) eventually results in desynchronized IN firing reflecting a steady state balance between the ongoing OG stimulation and mutual inhibition. These new results are now described as follows:</p><p>“The MUA signal reflects spiking of all neurons, excitatory and inhibitory, within ~100 μm of the electrode tip (Buzsaki, 2004; Einevoll et al., 2013; Pettersen and Einevoll, 2008). […] This MUA response in the presence of LFP suppression suggests firing of INs rather than PCs.”</p><p>C) We performed in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging and combined calcium imaging with MUA recordings. Results of these experiments are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and described as follows:</p><p>“To provide further evidence that OG stimulation did not engage PCs, we performed in vivo calcium imaging in an additional 3 VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). […] This is because no calcium increase was detected in PCs in response to the OG stimulus, although spontaneous calcium transients were readily detectable.”</p><p>We also included a corresponding new section in the Methods:</p><p>“Identification of INs and PCs in vivo and combination of 2-photon calcium imaging and OG stimulation:</p><p>First, we acquired 2-photon Z-stacks of structural reference images. […] In this regime, we were in a good position to detect calcium transients that have a fast rise and slow decay (time constant ~1s (Lutcke et al., 2013)).”</p><p><italic>2) The inferences that the time course of the arteriolar response dictates the focus of the response initiation-that because the first onset is deep it must only initiate there-is tenuous. It could of course be a multi-tiered response, in accordance with the fact that the authors likely drove interneurons throughout the depth. The authors tiptoe around this and need to just state clearly that there could (and, likely are) many lamina-specific drivers.</italic></p><p>Yes, we agree that lamina-specific drivers are likely to be present and apologize for not clarifying this in the text. We have revised the relevant discussion as follows:</p><p>“It is well established that dilation and constriction can propagate along arteriolar walls (Liu et al., 2012; Perrenoud et al., 2012; Segal and Duling, 1986; Rosenblum, Weinbrecht and Nelson, 1990; Jensen and Holstein-Rathlou, 2013; Chen et al., 2014), and these conducted responses may have contributed to the spread of OG dilation and constriction throughout the cortical depth in our data. […] Therefore, substantial delays in the superficial arteriolar branches suggest that local neurovascular communication in the upper layers, if it exists, has slower kinetics.”</p><p><italic>3) While the authors mention the Anenberg, Murphy (2015) study, they should dive deeper into the differences (for example, that study did not report flow decreases – is this difference a volume vs. diameter vs. flow calculation difference across speckle vs. 2-photon, or is it about the time course of measurement, or is it a real disagreement about findings?) Any of these interpretations is fine from the perspective of the contribution of the current data, but I do want to know their take on this in print. Although a decrease in blood flow induced by OG stimulation of VGAT-ChR2 mice has not been reported per se in the Anenberg et al. 2015 study, looking closely at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> of this paper shows a positive fractional change of the speckle contrast (i.e. blood flow decrease) in the periphery of the activated region. This is particularly evident at 4s after the onset of stimulation. Given that the 1) &quot;Regions of interest selected for assessment of speckle contrast over time were 1mm<sup>2</sup> and centered at the site where the laser was targeted on the cortex&quot; and 2) that most of the positive fractional change of the speckle contrast does not occur in these ROI, this might explain why Anenberg and colleagues have not reported a decrease in blood flow. This should be indeed acknowledged.</italic></p><p>We think that this disagreement of findings may be due to differences in anesthesia and/or stimulation protocol. The Murphy group used ketamine/xylazine, while we used α-chloralose. We feel confident about the constriction phase in our anesthetized measurements because our awake measurements replicate the same biphasic response behavior. The Murphy’s group implemented OG stimulation at 100Hz while in our case light was applied in ~200-ms long pulses. We have added the following paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>“OG stimulation in the VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP line produced a monophasic CBF increase in a recent laser speckle contrast imaging study by Anenberg et al. (Anenberg et al., 2015). […] In contrast to other types of INs driving dilation, at least some NPY-positive neurons exhibit a pronounced spike latency (Karagiannis et al., 2009) and thus may not respond well to short (5-ms duration) light pulses delivered at high frequency (100 Hz).”</p><p>We also added the following sentence where we discuss limitations of anesthesia:</p><p>“As such, the ketamine/xylazine anesthesia employed by Anenberg et al. (Anenberg et al., 2015) may provide an additional explanation for the discrepancy in our results regarding the constriction phase in response to OG stimulation of INs.”</p><p>Regarding their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, a</xref> decrease in the periphery is present in the images taken at 2 and 4s after the stimulus onset but not in the middle image taken at 3s after the stimulus onset. This intermittent appearance of the negative signal suggests to us that it may be dominated by noise rather than representing a real physiological behavior.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>As you will see below, there remain some issues that will require your attention before the manuscript can be accepted.</italic> </p><p> <italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>In this revised version of the manuscript the authors have addressed most of my concerns.

Providing these recordings at a higher magnification and a better temporal resolution would allow better appreciation of spike shapes.</italic></p><p>The reviewer’s thought is that fast spiking inhibitory neurons produce extracellular signals that are narrower compared to PCs (Bartho, Buzsaki, J Neurophysiol 92: 600-608, 2004). Therefore, if we could resolve individual spikes during the OG stimulus, the expectation is that their average waveform would be narrower compared to that during spontaneous activity where PCs affect the signal duration. However, identification/isolation of individual spikes and spike sorting with extracellular MUA recordings in vivo is a difficult problem. Usually, it is addressed using electrode arrays (e.g., so called “tetrodes”) such that a spike from a given cell can be picked up by a number of recording contacts increasing the fidelity of isolation procedure. In our experiments, we used a single-contact electrode that has sensitivity to spikes within a ~100 μm sphere around the electrode tip, containing many neurons of different types with their relative signal amplitudes depending on the size of the soma and distance from the electrode tip. In addition, cerebral circuits in vivo (at least, under anesthesia), experience up and down states with bursts of spiking activity during the up state resulting in overlapping spike waveforms. Under these conditions, isolation of individual spikes is an inherently ambiguous problem.</p><p>Following the reviewer’s comment, we have attempted isolation of spikes during the spontaneous activity and during OG stimulation. After visual inspection of the data, we defined a range of event amplitudes that may correspond to single spikes and aligned these events by their troughs. Comparison of these putative single-spike events from the spontaneous and OG category shows no significant difference in the width of the wavelet, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>. However, we believe that this result cannot be interpreted in a meaningful way due to the following considerations, leading to smearing of differences:</p><p>a) We have no confidence that the events we chose for the analysis indeed correspond to single spikes. Some of them may be a number of spikes slightly shifted in time. Depending on the amount of shift, this can lead to either broadening or narrowing of the waveform;</p><p>b) Not all inhibitory neurons are fast spiking, leading to further smearing of potential differences when considered as a population;</p><p>c) Both PCs and INs participate in spontaneous circuit activity, therefore our sample of putative spontaneous spike events has a mixed origin.</p><p>Given these constraints and ambiguity, we believe that the results of our analysis are inconclusive and would not be helpful for the reader. Addressing the issue of spike identification and sorting comprehensively would require switching to a different type of electrodes (tetrodes) plus solving the problem of the insertion of these (thicker) electrodes under the cover glass into the brain tissue without damaging the optical conditions. This type of effort would require a significant investment and probably is outside the current scope. Miniaturization of electrode arrays is one of the ongoing efforts for the BRAIN Initiative here in the US, and is likely to largely facilitate this kind of studies in the near future.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14315.016</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14315.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14315.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-14315-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>They have also better discussed the discrepancy with the Anenberg et al. 2015 (e.g. differences in the anesthetics used and stimulation paradigms).

In addition, the sequence of images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> is inconsistent with the time-course shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. Specifically, the time-course in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> shows a monotonic decrease in CBF between 3 and 7s post-stimulus. However, careful inspection of the central part of the images (used for extraction of time-courses) suggests that CBF at 6s is higher than that at 5s. Furthermore, the entire image at 6s is yellow color-shifted (i.e., an increase in CBF) including the periphery. These spatially coherent fluctuations of the peripheral intensity from frame to frame suggest to us that this is not due to the measurement noise but incorrect procedure of image analysis. Since Anenberg et al. raw data are not available to us, and their image analysis procedure is not described in sufficient details, we can only speculate about what exactly went wrong with their analysis. Therefore, we prefer not to include specific comments about this peripheral signal in our manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
