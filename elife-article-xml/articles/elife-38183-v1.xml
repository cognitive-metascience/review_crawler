underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood, partly because of the vast variety of lipid species and complexity of synthetic and turnover pathways. From a genetic screen, we identify that mannosyl glucosylceramide (MacCer), a species of glycosphingolipid (GSL), promotes synaptic bouton formation at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Pharmacological and genetic analysis shows that the NMJ growth-promoting effect of MacCer depends on normal lipid rafts, which are known to be composed of sphingolipids, sterols and select proteins. MacCer positively regulates the synaptic level of Wnt1/Wingless (Wg) and facilitates presynaptic Wg signaling, whose activity is raft-dependent. Furthermore, a functional GSL-binding motif in Wg exhibiting a high affinity for MacCer is required for normal NMJ growth. These findings reveal a novel mechanism whereby the GSL MacCer promotes synaptic bouton formation via Wg signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Glycosphingolipid</kwd><kwd>synaptic growth</kwd><kwd>Wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>lipid-protein interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014CB942803</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yong Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFA0501002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yong Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31490590</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yong Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31500846</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multiple independent analyses reveal that a specific membrane lipid directly interacts with the signalling protein Wingless to promote synapse growth at the Drosophila neuromuscular junctions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are particularly abundant in the nervous system and are essential for brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fantini and Yahi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). Specific deletion of GSLs in mouse brain leads to severe neural defects or lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jennemann et al., 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, the molecular and cellular functions of GSLs in development are poorly understood, partially due to the complexity of GSL metabolism and the variety of GSL structures in vertebrates. Because of the comparatively simple metabolic pathways and the power of genetic studies in invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bellen and Yamamoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhu and Han, 2014</xref>), a mechanistic understanding of the role of GSLs in development and function of the nervous system is beginning to be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dahlgaard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kniazeva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yonamine et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>GSLs and sphingomyelins (SMs, another class of sphingolipids) assemble with sterol into detergent-resistant membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts, which are critical for signal transduction and membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</xref>). In neural development, multiple processes such as neuronal proliferation, recognition, migration, and synapse formation are regulated by lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aureli et al., 2015</xref>). For instance, disruption of rafts by depletion of sphingolipid or sterol leads to enlargement and gradually loss of synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hering et al., 2003</xref>). Many growth factors or their receptors are preferentially located within and functionally dependent on membrane rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Yu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Watanabe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhai et al., 2004</xref>). Specifically, GSLs interact with raft-associated signaling proteins, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Notch, thereby facilitating signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coskun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Yu, 2013</xref>). Our previous study uncovered that the GSL mannosyl glucosylceramide (MacCer) promotes NMJ overgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which GSLs mediate in vivo neural development remain elusive.</p><p>Normal brain function depends on proper formation of synaptic connections. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is an advantageous model for dissecting mechanisms underlying synaptic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khuong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khuong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korkut and Budnik, 2009</xref>). To uncover potential functions of lipids at synapses, we used the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ as a model synapse and performed a genetic screen targeting genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and turnover pathways. From this screen, we identified multiple genes involved in sphingolipid de novo synthesis affecting NMJ development. We further found that MacCer is both required and sufficient for promoting NMJ growth and bouton formation in presynaptic neurons. MacCer promotes NMJ growth in a raft-dependent manner. We revealed that MacCer positively regulates synaptic Wg level and the presynaptic activity of Wg signaling. Further multiple independent assays showed MacCer physically interacts with Wg via a previously unidentified GSL-binding motif in Wg. Mutations in this motif disrupt the MacCer-Wg binding and normal NMJ growth. These findings demonstrate that the GSL MacCer plays a crucial role in bouton formation and NMJ growth and uncover a novel regulatory mechanism of Wg signaling pathway by MacCer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutations in de novo sphingolipid synthetic enzymes affect NMJ growth</title><p>To gain novel insights into the role of lipids in regulating synaptic development, we carried out a genetic screen targeting genes involved in the biosynthesis and turnover of fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids. We tested over 60 candidate genes by examining NMJ morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and identified two enzymes, serine palmitoyltransferase 2 Lace and ceramide synthase Schlank, promoting NMJ bouton formation as mutations in either of the two proteins led to fewer and larger boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F,H,I,K</xref>). Mutations in <italic>lace</italic> and <italic>schlank</italic> disrupt the de novo synthesis of ceramides, the central intermediate in sphingolipid synthesis/metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi-Yamada et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fyrst et al., 2004</xref>). These data indicate that depletion in de novo synthesis of ceramides inhibits bouton formation. In addition to the de novo ceramide synthesis, the ceramide precursor sphingosines can be phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase 2 (Sk2) to produce phosphorylated sphingosines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In <italic>Sk2</italic> mutants, the level of phosphorylated sphingosines is reduced, while sphingosines accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fyrst et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yonamine et al., 2011</xref>).

We then determined if MβCD treatment suppresses NMJ growth via directly reducing the MacCer level. We found that MβCD completely suppressed the NMJ overgrowth without detectably reducing the synaptic MacCer level in wild-type and Egh-overexpressing larvae; similarly, Filipin treatment did not affect the synaptic level of MacCer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4, H–N</xref>).These data suggest that restriction of synaptic growth by MβCD may be due to defects of MacCer function by disrupting raft assembly rather than a reduction in the synaptic level of MacCer per se. This finding is consistent with a previous report that disrupting the formation of membrane rafts may compromise the function of raft-associated factors but not necessarily affecting their levels; more specifically, the localization of a raft protein LFA-1 was unaltered examined by confocal microscopy at subcellular level but altered by single-molecule near-field optical microscopy at molecular level upon raft disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Zanten et al., 2009</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the NMJ growth-promoting effect of MacCer depends on normal lipid rafts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>MacCer promotes NMJ bouton formation via Wg signaling</title><p>NMJ development is controlled in part by growth factors and pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harris and Littleton, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korkut and Budnik, 2009</xref>). Bone morphogenic protein (BMP) is an important growth promoting signaling in NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayat et al., 2011</xref>). However, we found that the NMJ growth-promoting effect of MacCer is not mediated through the BMP signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). Wnt1/Wingless (Wg) activates another signaling pathway promoting NMJ growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korkut and Budnik, 2009</xref>). Because Wg is a lipid raft-associated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhai et al., 2004</xref>), we further investigated if Wg signaling play roles in MacCer-mediated NMJ growth. Previous reports showed that loss-of-function mutations of Wg signaling components, including the ligand Wg, the receptor dFrizzled2 (Fz2), the co-receptor Arrow (Arr), and the Wg-binding protein Evenness Interrupted/Wntless (Evi/Wls), decrease synaptic bouton number, while overexpression of Wg in motor neurons results in synaptic overgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Korkut et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miech et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Packard et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, the proper secretion, binding with the receptor Frizzled, and activation of Wg requires lipidation at the conserved serine at amino acid 239 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Janda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takada et al., 2006</xref>). Specifically, the synaptic level of Wg and the downstream signaling are positively regulated by the acyltransferase Porcupine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Packard et al., 2002</xref>), which activates the lipidation and raft-association of Wg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhai et al., 2004</xref>). We hypothesized that the NMJ growth-promoting effect of Wg depends on its association with membrane rafts. Indeed, raft disruption by MβCD treatment which depletes sterol significantly reduced Wg staining intensity at NMJs and constrained NMJ overgrowth in Wg-overexpressing larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that normal Wg signaling at NMJs requires intact lipid rafts.</p><p>Next, we determined whether Wg signaling cooperates with MacCer in promoting NMJ growth.

The similarity of <italic>egh</italic> and <italic>brn</italic> mutant phenotypes suggests that both are caused by a lack of complex GSLs downstream of <italic>brn</italic>. A more recent study showed that <italic>egh</italic> mutations result in overgrowth of subperineurial glia through elevated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling; the glial phenotype is due to the accumulation of GlcCer, the substrate of Egh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dahlgaard et al., 2012</xref>).

How does MacCer function in synaptic growth? Consistent with previous findings that GSL/lipid rafts are enriched in recycling endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balasubramanian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gagescu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hortsch et al., 2010</xref>), we observed a substantial colocalization between MacCer and recycling endosomal marker Rab11 at NMJ synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We note, however, the impact of MacCer and Rab11 on NMJ growth is opposite. The NMJ bouton formation is positively regulated by MacCer but negatively regulated by Rab11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khodosh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; this study). The opposite effect on NMJ growth of the two might be caused by the fact that MacCer and Rab11 regulate different signaling pathways. For example, Rab11 inhibits BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>) while MacCer facilitates Wg signaling (this study) at NMJ terminals.</p><p>Our results showed that MacCer facilitates the presynaptic Wg signaling in promoting NMJ growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast to the abnormal microtubule cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), <italic>egh</italic> mutants showed normal postsynaptic differentiation with no increase in ghost bouton number as well as normal SSR ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting a specific regulation of presynaptic rather than postsynaptic Wg activity by MacCer. A recent study showed that at NMJs, Wg is secreted from glial cells as well as presynaptic motor neurons, and that this glia-derived Wg controls the assembly of postsynaptic machinery at NMJs without affecting the bouton number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kerr et al., 2014</xref>). The normal postsynaptic differentiation in <italic>egh</italic> mutants may be due to normal postsynaptic Wg signaling triggered by glia-derived Wg. This postulation is supported by the observation that manipulations of glial MacCer by genetic means did not affect NMJ growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>How does MacCer affect Wg signaling at the molecular and cellular levels? Wg associates with lipid rafts via its acylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhai et al., 2004</xref>), enabling its access to the raft-component MacCer. Upon lipid raft disruption by sterol depletion, Wg de-localizes from the lipid rafts (detergent-resistant, cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains) revealed by biochemical fractionation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhai et al., 2004</xref>). We envisage that delocalization of Wg does not allow its binding to MacCer, compromises its transport to the NMJ terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), and in turn restricts NMJ growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This notion is supported by colocalization of MacCer and Wg on specific membrane domains of presynaptic organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and direct MacCer-Wg binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). As MacCer is both required and sufficient for normal Wg expression at NMJ boutons, but not vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>), we propose that MacCer acts as an adaptor for Wg at the presynaptic recycling endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Our in silico data combined with biochemical and genetic analysis of GSL-Wg interaction further showed that the 233 – 247 domain of Wg, which is acylated at Ser-239, is a functional GBM that mediates high affinity binding to MacCer. Although we could not exclude the possibility that Wg GBM might have other function independent of MacCer binding, our in vivo data support that the GBM plays important roles in Wg-MacCer colocalization, Wg signaling and NMJ development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>The association of Wg with membrane rafts requires the acylation at Ser-239 mediated by Porcupine, a process conserved from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herr and Basler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhai et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, the acylation by Porcupine is essential for the recognition of Wg by Evi thereby affecting the transport and secretion of Wg through recycling endosomes and exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herr and Basler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koles et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Korkut et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, both Porcupine and Evi are known to regulate the synaptic level of Wg and the signaling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Korkut et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Packard et al., 2002</xref>). In the present study, we showed a reduction in Wg level at NMJ terminals but an increase in the neuropil of the ventral nerve cord of <italic>egh</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), similar to that in <italic>evi</italic> mutants with impaired Wg transport and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Korkut et al., 2009</xref>). These findings suggest that the transport and trafficking of Wg via endosomes may be compromised when MacCer is deficient. The detailed mechanism by which MacCer regulates Wg transport and trafficking remains to be further investigated. As Wnt signaling, which is widely involved in various developmental processes and diseases including neurological and psychological diseases, is evolutionally conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korkut and Budnik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salinas, 2012</xref>), our finding that MacCer facilitates Wg signaling transduction suggests a new target for intervening Wnt signaling associated pathogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>wg<sup>GBM</sup></td><td>this paper</td><td>NA</td><td>This allele carries the point mutation of K234E and M238R in Wg</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>wg<sup>1</sup></td><td>doi: 10.1523/Jneurosci.3714–13.2014</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_2978">BDSC_2978</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>wg<sup>CX4</sup>,wg<sup>l-17</sup></td><td>doi: 10.1016/S0092-8674 (02)01047–4</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_2980">BDSC_2980</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-Wg-HA(6C)</td><td>doi: 10.1016/S0092-8674 (02)01047–4</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_5918">BDSC_5918</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-Wg-HA(3C)</td><td>doi: 10.1016/S0092-8674 (02)01047–4</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/DGGR_108488">DGGR_108488</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>egh<sup>7</sup></td><td>PMID: 9012507</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_3902">BDSC_3902</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>egh<sup>62d18</sup></td><td>PMID: 9012507</td><td>NA</td><td rowspan="5">Dr. Stephen M.

For most antibody staining, specimens were dissected in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free HL3 saline, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and washed in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. For MacCer staining, specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 60 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in cold PBS, incubated with undiluted anti-MacCer hybridoma supernatants for 18 hr at 4°C and detected with Fluor 568 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (1:1000; Invitrogen). For GluRIIA staining, specimens were fixed in cold methanol for 5 min. We used the following antibodies: mouse anti-cysteine string protein (CSP) (1:300; 6D6 from DSHB), mouse anti-Wg (1:10; 4D4 from DSHB), mouse anti-Futsch (1:50; 22C10 from DSHB), mouse anti-Rab11 (1:50; BD Biosciences), mouse anti-DLG (1:500; 4F3 from DSHB), mouse anti-GluRIIA (1:200; 8B4D2 from DSHB), mouse anti-Fas II (1:50; 1D4 from DSHB), mouse anti-Syx1A (1:20; 8C3 from DSHB), mouse anti-dFz2 (1:5; 12A7 from DSHB), mouse anti-HA (1:1000; MBL International), mouse anti-Myc (1:300; CWBIO, MBL International), rat anti-GFP (1:200; MBL International), and fluorescence-conjugated anti-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch).

Briefly, 3rd instar larval brains were dissected in cold PBS and homogenized in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40) with proteinase inhibitors Set I (Calbiochemistry) on ice. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting according to standard procedures. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-Wg (1:50; 4D4 from DSHB), mouse anti-Syx1A (1:1000; 8C3 from DSHB), and mouse anti-actin (1:50000; Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents).

NMJ images were collected with an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope using a 40x/1.42 NA or 60 x/1.42 NA oil objective and FV10-ASW software, or with a Leica confocal microscope using a 40x/1.25 NA oil objective and LAS AF software. All images of muscle 4 or muscle 6/7 glutamatergic type Ib NMJ of abdominal segments A2 to A4 for a specific experiment were captured using identical settings for statistical comparison among different genotypes. High resolution confocal images were processed with the deconvolution software AutoQuant X2 (Media Cybernetics). Brightness, contrast, and color were adjusted using Photoshop CS5 (Adobe). NMJ morphological features were quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).</p><p>For quantification analysis of NMJ growth, individual boutons were defined according to the discrete staining signal of anti-CSP. Satellite boutons were defined as extensions of five or fewer small boutons emanating from the main branch of the NMJ terminals. For quantification of bouton sizes, synaptic areas (μm<sup>2</sup>) were measured by assessing HRP-positive boutons, and normalized to bouton numbers. Ghost boutons were defined as boutons positive for HRP staining but negative for DLG staining. NMJ bouton number and size of <italic>schlank</italic> mutants were normalized to muscle surface area. For quantification of protein levels at NMJ, staining intensities of each protein were measured within HRP-positive NMJs using ImageJ. For colocalization analysis, single slices were analyzed using WCIF-ImageJ ‘Colocalization Analysis’ within HRP-labeled synaptic boutons. Statistical comparisons were performed using GraphPad Prism 6. Data of NMJ features are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (s.e.m.). Statistical significance between each genotype and the controls was determined by two tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic> test, whereas multiple comparisons between genotypes were determined by one-way ANOVA with a Tukey <italic>post hoc</italic> test. Asterisks above a column indicate comparisons of a specific genotype to wild type (denoted WT) or genetic control (denoted CT), whereas asterisks above a bracket denote comparisons between two specific genotypes. ns denotes p&gt;0.05; * indicates p&lt;0.05; ** denotes p&lt;0.01; *** indicates p&lt;0.001.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Drug treatment of larvae</title><p>Larvae of different genotypes were raised on vehicle- or drug-containing media from egg hatching.

Myc-Wg was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc affinity resin (Millipore), eluted with a Myc-peptide solution (Sigma), and concentrated using a 30kD filter column (Amicon).</p><p>GSL–protein interactions were determined with the Langmuir-film balance technique as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Scala et al., 2014</xref>). It was monitored by surface pressure with a fully automated microtensiometer (μTrough SX; Kibron Inc.). All experiments were performed at 20 ± 1°C. Monomolecular films of GSLs were spread on pure water subphases (800 μl) from chloroform/methanol (1:1 vol/vol). The initial surface pressure of the monolayers was 12–15 mN/m. The accuracy of our experimental conditions was ±0.25 mN/m. Real-time measurements kinetically followed the increase in the surface pressure after injecting the peptide or protein (final concentration of 10 μM) into the aqueous phase underneath the GSL monolayer until equilibrium was reached.

The homogenate was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm and the supernatant was collected. This step was repeated with 1.5 ml solvent B (chloroform/methanol; 1:1 vol/vol), 1.5 ml solvent A, and finally 1.5 ml solvent B. The four solvent extracts were combined, evaporated under a nitrogen flux, and re-suspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1 vol/vol) at a lipid concentration of 1 mg/ml. The extracts were again evaporated, then re-suspended in 5 ml methanol containing 0.1 M NaOH, and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C under agitation to remove most glycerolipids. The samples were evaporated and re-extracted in chloroform/methanol (2:1 vol/vol). Neutral GSLs were finally purified on a column (DEAE-Sephadex A-25; Sigma-Aldrich) and eluted with chloroform/methanol/water (30:60:8 vol/vol/vol). GSL extracts were analyzed by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) using silica gel 60 HPTLC plates (Merck) in chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8 vol/vol/vol). The HPTLC plates were sprayed with orcinol and heated at 110°C for GSL detection.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Lloyd (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision.</p><p>We are concerned that the revisions required will take significantly more than two months. We are therefore turning down the manuscript. We, however, encourage re-submission when you feel you are able to address these substantive concerns.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Huang et al. show that glycosphigolipid (GSL) MacCer regulates <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction development by genetically manipulating enzymes in MacCer production. These results are internally consistent, and they show that reduction of MacCer correlates with fewer and larger synaptic boutons, a phenotype that is reminiscent of Wg mutants. The authors go on to show that the Wg and GSL pathways genetically interact and they provide some evidence that MacCer binds Wg via lipid rafts, although we found these results at the moment less compelling. As you will see, the reviewers have made a list of constructive comments that we believe you will be able to address; most issues are of technical in nature. There is, however, one point that surfaced during the discussion that the reviewers felt was not yet sufficiently supported. This is the issue of showing conclusively that Wg binds to MacCer in vivo. The reviewers would like to see a second methodology where you show this. Given this is a central point in your paper we would encourage you to pursue experiments to address this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript &quot;The glycosphingolipid MacCer promotes synaptic bouton formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by interacting with Wnt&quot; by Huang et al., describes that MacCer interacts with Wg via a GSL-binding motif in Wg. The idea that Wg binds directly to MacCer in vivo is intriguing, but the presented data are not strong enough to make this point. Moreover, one of their main findings is also that MacCer is enriched in recycling endosomes, but there are no experiments made to uncover the biological significance of this finding.</p><p>A larger concern of mine is that the idea that sphinolipids regulate synaptic growth is not new and was described by the authors in a previous manuscript: &quot;Acsl, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of intellectual-disability-related ACSL4, inhibits synaptic growth by altered lipids&quot; Huang et al., 2016. In that paper they showed that synaptic bouton formation is dependent on fatty acid membrane composition via Acsl function. Moreover, they showed that MacCer level were increased in Acsl mutant synapses. The authors are not properly placing the present paper in the context of their previous work are there is significant overlap with the current manuscript (e.g. in Figure 2 and Figure 3).</p><p>In summary, I think the current work shows potential new insights into lipid regulation at the synapse, but it clearly requires substantial additional experimental data to cover the consequence of MacCer function in recycling endosomes and in vivo data of MacCer binding to Wg and data showing what happens in wg GBM mutant animals especially in respect to MacCer.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- In the Materials and methods section, the authors stated that they used synapses form muscle 4 or 6/7 and abdominal segments A2 to A4. Synapses morphology vary significantly between these two muscle types and segments. It is important to separate out these data and show them per muscle and per segment.</p><p>- Figure 1: The authors used RNAi lines from the Vienna collection to screen for defects in NMJ morphology. There is no confirmation of knock down efficiency, target specify or off target effects. Two independent RNAi lines haven been used for each gene (schlank and lace), but the quantification of the phenotypes does not include both lines.</p><p>- Figure 2: The authors claim that egh function on NMJ growth is synapse specific. However, there are is no consistent quantification that could support this point regarding satellite boutons, bouton size and bouton nr.</p><p>- Figure 4: The authors did not show the effect of Filipin on MacCer levels.</p><p>- Figure 6 and Figure 6 supplements: The authors state that MacCer colocalize with Wg and Rab11 at the synapse, but they did not perform a Pearson Coefficient analysis to support these statements. The authors did not provide a co-localization analysis of MacCer with late endosomes, early endosomes and Golgi markers. Moreover, the authors should provide further evidence by using other more commonly used organelle markers. There is also no quantification of Western blot data to state that Wg levels in egh mutant brains are normal. Additional data on axonal transport would be more suitable to support the notion about Wg secretion into the synapse. Especially since it is known that egh and brn mutants show enlarged nerves (Dahlgaard et al., 2012). There are no representative images for MacCer and Fz2 fluorescent intensities in egh mutants and wild types in Figure 6—figure supplement 2C. Again, not all quantified genotypes show representative images in main Figure panel L.</p><p>- Figure 8: In silico predictions and physiochemical experiments suggest a direct binding of Wg to MacCer, but there is no evidence that this is also true in vivo. The authors made the wg GBM mutant and claim that this would affect lipid rafts via disrupted MacCer binding. However, the presented data are not very direct and the implication of MacCer levels and localization in wg GBM mutant animals is lacking.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors screen a number of different genetic lipid synthesis mutants and identify abnormal NMJ development in animals where mutations inhibit sphingolipid metabolism. They then identify that enzymes that act sequentially on MacCer production have opposing effects on NMJ development; loss of Egh (that produces MacCer) produces fewer and larger boutons, while loss of Brn (that metabolizes MacCer to GlcNac-MacCer) produces more boutons including satellite boutons. They also conclude (largely based on sterol depletion) that presynaptic MacCer is biologically active within lipid rafts. The final section of the paper addresses the mechanism by which MacCer promotes synaptic growth (putatively from presynaptic lipid rafts). They describe that Wg and Egh genetically interact at the level of NMJ bouton number and size. They show abnormal Wg-signalling markers in Egh boutons, including that Wg and Rab11 colocalize with anti-MacCer labelling, Wg levels vary with Egh genotype, and use the presence/ absence of Wg-sensitive Futsch-loops to further test if MacCer facilitates Wg signalling. Finally, molecular modelling and in vitro analysis is used to support a model where Wg directly binds to MacCer.</p><p>Overall, while the topic is interesting, several data sets are over-interpreted, and controls are missing. The paper tries to make many points, but the data is lacking for some parts of their model. This is particularly true for the claims on SL synthesis (like Figure 1), as well as the concept that MacCer is active in lipid rafts and/ or endosomes. On the other hand, there is considerable data on the point that Egh (MacCer) genetically interacts with Wg and affects presynaptic Wg signalling – though again the manuscript falls short of convincingly proving a direct physical interaction (Figure 8).</p><p>One issue is that the first half of the paper (Figures 1-5) is limited to bouton numbers and bouton sizes. However, many molecular pathways converge to affect these variables and it is not possible to confidently assign genes (or drug treatments) to a single common molecular pathway. The authors should add additional readouts of synaptic development to see if their conclusions on genetic interactions stand up. There may be parts of this in the final figures showing Wg-related defects in Egh lines, but these analyses were not conducted for the majority of genetic interactions shown in Figures 1-5.</p><p>Related is that there are several experiments that use constitutive hypomorphs/ knock-out lines of widely expressed genes but interpret data to conclude that genes act presynaptically. For example, Figure 1 shows synaptic defects in constitutive mutants of Schlank, lace and Sk2, without genetically rescuing to show that they operate presynaptically. The Figure 5 genetic interaction between Wg and Egh uses many constitutive mutants. The authors need to better establish that all phenotypes are cell autonomous to motor neurons (RNAi and re-expression in mutant backgrounds with motor neuron-specific drivers).</p><p>This problem is amplified with the pharmacological treatments. Drugs that deplete sterols or GSL from egg hatching likely broadly impair development rather than specifically affect lipids in synapses as the authors interpret. At the very least control data is needed on larval size, time to pupate, and general tissue development, etc. The conclusion that sterol and SL depletion data show MacCer operating in lipid rafts is overinterpreted given the drug treatments will affect all cells in the animal from egg hatching and have multiple impacts at the level of neuronal function (not just disrupting presynaptic lipid rafts).</p><p>The final parts of the paper contain the more convincing data on a genetic interaction between Egh and Wg, including multiple signs of abnormal Wg singling in Egh mutants.

By genetically modulating enzymes up- and downstream of MacCer production, the authors nicely show that reduction of MacCer correlates with fewer and larger synaptic boutons. This NMJ phenotype is reminiscent of Wg mutants, and indeed, Wg and GSL pathway mutants genetically interact, and overexpression of Wg presynaptically rescues the MacCer deficient phenotype. The authors provide evidence that MacCer directly binds Wg via lipid rafts, and this underlies the role of this GSL in NMJ bouton development. The data provided are of high quality, and the conclusions are compelling.</p><p>The generation of the GBM Wingless mutant via CRISPR is an excellent new tool for the investigators to further explore the role of Wg-GSL interactions in Wg function. While I acknowledge that extensive characterization of this new allele is beyond the scope of this study, a few more experiments are necessary to test their hypothesis. First, the authors should examine bouton size in Wg[GBM/1] animals as they have done in previous figures to determine if this phenocopies mutants that cause reduction of MacCer. Second, the authors should show that these phenotypes can be rescued by presynaptic expression of wildtype Wg. Finally, it would be of great interest to determine if the Wg[GBM/1] phenotype is modulated by egh and brn genetic manipulations as was performed in prior figures.

In Figure 2, which egh allele is used in the rescue experiments?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The Glycosphingolipid MacCer promotes synaptic bouton formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by interacting with Wnt&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Thomas Lloyd (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is much better and is nearly ready for acceptance. The data is now more convincing that presynaptic MacCer interacts with Wg and, in doing so, affects presynaptic Wg signaling and synaptic development. Figure 1 and Figure 2 now convincingly show that Egh and Brn act in motor neurons to oppositely affect synapse development. These data overlap partially with that in their 2016 Huang et al., publication. However, the extra genetics, in particular, that they analyze motor neuron-specific Egh and Brn expression and RNAi, do now establish the basal importance of MacCer that wasn't so clear before. The data also establish that Wg protein interacts directly with the MacCer lipid to complement the genetic interaction data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following essential revisions can be made by addressing them in the abstract, results and discussions. Many aspects, such as antibody specificity, are buried in the text for the reader to decipher as then go through. These and such concerns as given below should be addressed by re-writing in a more focused manner.</p><p>The data fails to convince on the lipid raft localized nature of this interaction, or precisely what this means. One issue is that we would expect that plasma membrane &quot;lipid raft&quot; domains also exist at these synapses, but yet the authors only detect internal signal with the MacCer antibody. The pharmacological approaches that disrupt sterols are broad and likely do much more than just affect lipid rafts. It feels like an over-interpretation to designate these to the same genetic pathway on the basis that the double manipulation is similar to sterol or MacCer loss alone; perhaps the phenotype is already as severe as it can be. Further, they interpret Figure 4 data to mean that lipid rafts have some impact on MacCer function, without further elucidating on what this might be. The most obvious functional impact is that lipid rafts concentrate MacCer to specific membrane domains, in turn facilitating binding to Wg protein. However, if so, why does MacCer staining remain punctate even after lipid rafts are disrupted by sterol depletion? If their model is correct, we would expect they see diffuse/ less intense/ less punctate MacCer labeling? A more detailed discussion of this should be added if it is indeed important or, ideally, they consider an in vitro system where lipid rafts +/- MacCer are easily detectable (for example on the surface of some mammalian cell lines).</p><p>The MacCer antibody is the only readout of MacCer levels (there is no direct analysis of lipid levels in the mutants). It would, therefore, be good if they provide data on antibody specificity. This could include ruling out the possibility that it detects a different molecule that also rises and falls with altered synaptic size; for example, whether MacCer staining remains normal with other manipulations that affect synapse structure (like in Wg mutants). Some of this may be already in the manuscript, but it would help if the issue is directly addressed given non-specific labeling would invalidate many of their conclusions. I also wonder about antibody accessibility when proteins interact with MacCer. Presumably, Wg and the antibody interact with the carbohydrate group of MacCer, so the MacCer antibody would detect less MacCer if it is already complexed with Wg (or other binding partners)? This seems like something to consider when interpreting colocalization data and when using the antibody to determine synaptic MacCer levels.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38183.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>The manuscript &quot;The glycosphingolipid MacCer promotes synaptic bouton formation in Drosophila by interacting with Wnt&quot; by Huang et al., describes that MacCer interacts with Wg via a GSL-binding motif in Wg. The idea that Wg binds directly to MacCer</italic> in vivo <italic>is intriguing, but the presented data are not strong enough to make this point. Moreover, one of their main findings is also that MacCer is enriched in recycling endosomes, but there are no experiments made to uncover the biological significance of this finding.</italic> </p><p>To further support the binding of Wg and MacCer, we have added two independent lines of evidence. First, wild-type but not GBM mutation-carrying Wg binds LacCer (the vertebrate analog of MacCer) (Figure 8). Second, <italic>wg<sup>GBM</sup></italic> mutation led to a decrease of co-localization between MacCer and Wg in NMJs (Figure 9; also see the response to the third point of this reviewer).</p><p>The biological function of MacCer in recycling endosomes is to facilitate membrane trafficking of Wg. MacCer enrichment in recycling endosomes is consistent with previous findings that lipid rafts/LacCer are enriched in recycling endosomes (Balasubramanian et al., 2007; Hortsch et al., 2010; Sabharanjak et al., 2002). The intracellular trafficking of lipid rafts from Golgi or early endosomes to plasma membrane via recycling endosomes is thought to impact trafficking of many raft-associated proteins (reviewed in Simons and Toomre, 2000). We have added these references on lipid rafts trafficking via recycling endosomes in in subsection “MacCer promotes NMJ bouton formation via Wg signaling” and subsection “MacCer promotes synaptic growth via presynaptic Wg signaling” in the revision (also see the response to the third point of this reviewer).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A larger concern of mine is that the idea that sphinolipids regulate synaptic growth is not new and was described by the authors in a previous manuscript: &quot;Acsl, the Drosophila ortholog of intellectual-disability-related ACSL4, inhibits synaptic growth by altered lipids&quot; Huang et al., 2016. In that paper they showed that synaptic bouton formation is dependent on fatty acid membrane composition via Acsl function. Moreover, they showed that MacCer level were increased in Acsl mutant synapses. The authors are not properly placing the present paper in the context of their previous work are there is significant overlap with the current manuscript (e.g. in Figure 2 and Figure 3).</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously reported that reducing MacCer level by <italic>egh<sup>62d18</sup></italic> mutation or <italic>brn</italic>-overexpression in neurons lead to fewer and larger boutons as well as restrict the NMJ overgrowth in <italic>Acsl</italic> mutants (Huang et al., 2016). However, in that study, we did not dissect the mechanism by which MacCer regulates synapse growth. In the current study, we far extended our previous study and systematically and mechanistically analyze the role of MacCer in promoting NMJ growth. Specifically, we defined a presynaptic function of MacCer by cell-type specific manipulation of MacCer level and revealed a new regulatory mechanism that MacCer promotes NMJ growth via Wg signaling. We have discussed the present data in the context of the previous study in subsection “GSL synthases Egh and Brn bi-directionally regulatesNMJ growth 104 presynaptically” and subsection “MacCer promotes NMJ bouton formation via Wg signaling”.</p><p> <italic>In summary, I think the current work shows potential new insights into lipid regulation at the synapse, but it clearly requires substantial additional experimental data to cover the consequence of MacCer function in recycling endosomes and</italic> in vivo <italic>data of MacCer binding to Wg and data showing what happens in wg GBM mutant animals especially in respect to MacCer.</italic> </p><p>We have provided experimental evidence supporting that MacCer acts as an adaptor for Wg to be localized to lipid rafts/recycling endosomes. As mentioned above, it has been well established that intracellular trafficking of LacCer/lipid rafts is mediated primarily via recycling endosomes. The lipid raft trafficking via recycling endosomes plays a crucial role in raft-associated signaling transduction (reviewed in Simons and Toomre, 2000). Our finding that MacCer enriched in Rab11-positive recycling endosomes implicates trafficking of Wg via recycling endosomes.</p><p>To further support the binding of Wg and MacCer, we have added new data by a second methodology showing that wild-type Wg binds LacCer-beads whereas Wg carrying mutated GBM does not. These new data, in combination with our previous physical binding data (Figure 8), support a direct binding between MacCer and Wg via GBM. Furthermore, we have added new data that <italic>wg<sup>GBM</sup></italic> mutation led to a decrease of co-localization between MacCer and Wg, without significantly affecting the synaptic level of MacCer (Figure 9). Our results together demonstrate that Wg GBM is critical for the interaction between Wg and MacCer, and that MacCer positively regulates Wg level, but not vice versa (also see the response to Figure 8 of this reviewer).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- In the Materials and methods section, the authors stated that they used synapses form muscle 4 or 6/7 and abdominal segments A2 to A4.

The change of MacCer intensity was indeed modest (Figure 3B).

Our study revealed a colocalization of MacCer and Wg at presynaptic NMJs (Figure 6A), consistent with direct physical binding of MacCer and Wg (Figure 8). We have added detailed discussion of the impact of lipid raft on MacCer-Wg interaction in the revision in subsection “MacCer promotes synaptic growth via presynaptic Wg signaling”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors only detect internal signal with the MacCer antibody to examine lipid rafts at NMJs.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to MacCer staining, we also stained NMJs with an antibody against Syx1A (Figure 4A), a protein marker of lipid rafts (Chamberlain et al., 2001). The Syntaxin 1A puncta substantially overlapped with MacCer puncta with or without colocalization with HRP-positive plasma membrane (Figure 4A), confirming the presence of lipid rafts at NMJs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It feels like an over-interpretation about the genetic results on the basis that the double manipulation is similar to sterol or MacCer loss alone.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to the observation that depleting sterol with MβCD could not exacerbate the NMJ undergrowth in MacCer-deficient larvae, we also showed that MβCD fully restrict the NMJ overgrowth in MacCer-excessive larvae to the level of MβCD-treated wild-type larvae (Figure 4G and Figure 4—figure supplement 1F). We have added these results in the revised text in subsection “MacCer promotes NMJ bouton formation in alipid raft-dependent manner”. We agree that pharmacological approaches may have other effects rather than just affect lipid rafts. Thus, we toned down the conclusion that sterol may modulate NMJ growth in a common genetic pathway with sphingolipids and MacCer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors suggest that lipid rafts have some impact on MacCer function, without further elucidating on what this might be.</p></disp-quote><p>The restriction of synaptic growth upon lipid rafts disruption may be due to Wg de-localization from lipid rafts rather than a reduction in the synaptic level of MacCer per se. Lipid raft disruption de-localizes Wg from the rafts evidenced by biochemical fractionation (Zhai et al., 2004); delocalization of Wg disrupts its accessibility and binding to MacCer, compromises its transport to the NMJ terminals (Figure 5—figure supplement 1 L-N), and in turn restricts NMJ growth. We have added these arguments in the revision (see subsection “MacCer promotes synaptic growth via presynaptic Wg signaling”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Why does MacCer staining remain punctate even after lipid rafts are disrupted by sterol depletion?</p></disp-quote><p>It is reasonable to expect that MacCer would diffuse or appear less punctate upon lipid raft disruption. The microscale MacCer puncta in our assays are not representing single nanoscale lipid raft assemblies. It is thus possible that the formation dynamics of the nanoscale lipid rafts could not be discerned by confocal microscopy, as the nanoscale microdomains are below the optical resolution limit set by the light diffraction (Eggeling et al., 2009; Simons and Gerl, 2010). This possibility is consistent with a previous finding that upon sterol depletion by MβCD, the localization of a raft protein LFA-1 was unaltered examined by confocal microscopy at subcellular level but altered by single-molecule near-field optical microscopy at molecular level (Van Zanten et al., 2009). This point has been added in the revised Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The MacCer antibody is the only readout of MacCer levels (there is no direct analysis of lipid levels in the mutants). It would, therefore, be good if they provide data on antibody specificity. This could include ruling out the possibility that it detects a different molecule that also rises and falls with altered synaptic size; for example, whether MacCer staining remains normal with other manipulations that affect synapse structure (like in Wg mutants). Some of this may be already in the manuscript, but it would help if the issue is directly addressed given non-specific labeling would invalidate many of their conclusions. I also wonder about antibody accessibility when proteins interact with MacCer. Presumably, Wg and the antibody interact with the carbohydrate group of MacCer, so the MacCer antibody would detect less MacCer if it is already complexed with Wg (or other binding partners)? This seems like something to consider when interpreting colocalization data and when using the antibody to determine synaptic MacCer levels.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to MacCer immunostaining, high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) analysis also showed that <italic>egh<sup>62d18</sup></italic> mutants lacked MacCer and <italic>brn<sup>1.6P6</sup></italic> mutants contained almost exclusively MacCer (Figure 8—figure supplement 1; Hamel et al., 2010; Wandall et al., 2005).
