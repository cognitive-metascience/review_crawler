Comparing the effects of asymmetric histone tail point mutants with those of symmetric double mutants revealed that a single methylated H3K36 per nucleosome was sufficient to silence cryptic transcription in vivo. We also demonstrate the utility of this system for analysis of histone modification crosstalk, using mass spectrometry to separately identify modifications on each H3 molecule within asymmetric nucleosomes.

In addition, the histone proteins are subject to a huge variety of covalent modifications, which affect genomic function in ways ranging from direct alterations in the biophysical nature of the chromatin fiber to recruitment or activation of various regulatory proteins.</p><p>The histone octamer is comprised of two copies of each of the four histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, organized with two H2A/H2B dimers associated with a central core tetramer of histone H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kornberg and Lorch, 1999</xref>). The symmetry inherent to the histone octamer has long been appreciated, and it has been suggested that chromatin function may be regulated at the level of histone modification symmetry – that K4me3/K4me0 and K4me3/K4me3 nucleosomes might serve distinct functions in vivo, for example. Indeed, increasing evidence supports the existence of asymmetrically-modified nucleosomes in vivo. In mammals, immunopurification and mass spectrometry of nucleosomes marked with H3K27me3 revealed a mixture of symmetrically-modified nucleosomes as well as asymmetric nucleosomes modified on only one H3 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Voigt et al., 2012</xref>). More recent single molecule studies of H3K4me3/K27me3-marked ‘bivalent’ nucleosomes reveal that the vast majority of these nucleosomes are asymmetrically modified, with each H3 tail bearing one of the two methylation marks, rather than both marks co-occurring on the same H3 molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shema et al., 2016</xref>). In budding yeast, ChIP-Exo and chemical mapping studies identified a subset of nucleosomes that exhibit asymmetric contacts with the underlying genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rhee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ramachandran et al., 2015</xref>), suggested to reflect histone octamers associated with an asymmetrically-localized DNA bulge.</p><p>While evidence therefore increasingly supports the hypothesis that nucleosomes across the genome – particularly at regulatory regions – can be modified asymmetrically, at present it is largely unknown whether nucleosome symmetry affects genomic functions such as transcription. For instance, do any chromatin regulators bind specifically to singly-modified nucleosomes, or to doubly-modified nucleosomes? A handful of studies in vitro have suggested that chromatin regulators can distinguish singly-modified from doubly-modified nucleosomes. For instance, Li <italic>et al</italic> assembled and purified asymmetric nucleosomes lacking a single H3 tail in vitro, subsequently showing that the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 exhibited cooperative binding to two histone tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li and Shogren-Knaak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li and Shogren-Knaak, 2009</xref>). Conversely, asymmetrically H3K4-methylated nucleosomes were, like unmodified nucleosomes, efficiently methylated at K27 by the PRC2 complex, whereas this methylation was inhibited by the presence of symmetric H3K4me3 marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Voigt et al., 2012</xref>). Although these in vitro studies generate hypotheses for how chromatin effectors might be affected by nucleosome symmetry in the cell, the inherent symmetry of the natural H3-H3 interface has made in vivo tests of these hypotheses impossible until now.</p><p>Here, we develop a novel system to enable analysis of the functional consequences of nucleosome symmetry in vivo. Using rational design, followed by in vivo optimization and selection, we developed a pair of H3 proteins – H3X and H3Y – that form heterodimers in vivo, yet cannot homodimerize. We validated this system genetically and biochemically in budding yeast, confirming that the vast majority of histone octamers in the cell contain a heterodimeric H3X/H3Y at their core. Furthermore, we confirm that the engineered specificities are recapitulated in vitro during biochemical reconstitution of histone octamers with recombinant subunits. We then used this system to probe several mechanistic aspects of nucleosome function in vivo, finding that a single copy of H3K36 is sufficient for stress resistance, and to silence cryptic transcription, in vivo. In addition, we show that disruption of H3S10 affects H3K9 acetylation only on the same tail, demonstrating the utility of this approach for interrogating histone ‘crosstalk’. This system thus represents a powerful approach to mechanistically probe the role of histone stoichiometry and symmetry in a variety of aspects of chromatin biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design and validation of obligate heterodimers</title><p>The histone octamer is built on a central core tetramer of histone H3 and H4, assembled around a central H3-H3 homodimeric interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). In order to develop a system to analyze the role of nucleosome symmetry in chromatin regulation in vivo, we set out to design a pair of H3 molecules – ‘H3X’ and ‘H3Y’ – which cannot form X/X or Y/Y homodimers, but will efficiently form H3X/H3Y heterodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We initially used protein design to develop six sets of H3 mutants that are predicted to have much higher affinity with a paired mutant protein than with wild-type H3. Each engineered variant has ‘bumps and holes’ that are also predicted to reduce the potential for homodimerization. We focused our efforts on the hydrophobic cluster formed by amino acids L109, A110, L126, and L130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) in the nucleosome structure (pdb 1KX3). At these positions, sequence and conformational space were enumerated using a rotamer description of side chain geometry and a molecular mechanics force-field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mayo et al., 1990</xref>) to generate a pairwise energy matrix. We used a previously described algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolon et al., 2005</xref>) to identify sequences that preferentially energetically partition as heterodimers.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28836.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design and testing of asymmetric nucleosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of asymmetric histone H3 design.

Transformants carrying the H3X* library alleles were plated on SC-Trp and replicated onto FOA plates. Strains that couldn’t survive on FOA with H3* alone were transformed with an H3Y-expressing plasmid, and then were tested on FOA media to assess the viability of the H3X*-H3Y combinations (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As an additional criterion, we tested whether the two plasmids expressing the new H3X/H3Y heterodimers were stable when cells were cultured in rich media in the absence of selection for either plasmid. Repeated rounds of streaking on rich (YPD) plates or culturing in YPD media yielded colonies that all maintained a Trp<sup>+</sup>Leu<sup>+</sup> phenotype, indicating that neither plasmid could be lost. Furthermore, resequencing of plasmids isolated after growth on YPD detected no reversion of the engineered H3X or H3Y in 96 independent isolates. Together, the genetic data strongly suggest that the H3X/H3Y combinations are obligate heterodimers, and that neither H3X nor H3Y can homodimerize at sufficient levels to support viability.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28836-fig1-figsupp1-v3"/></fig></fig-group><p>We then carried out genetic tests of six initial designs in vivo, reasoning that budding yeast carrying both H3X and H3Y should be viable, but yeast carrying H3X alone or H3Y alone would be inviable due to the failure of these H3 molecules to homodimerize. In our initial tests, one of the original six designs (H3X = L126V, L130V; H3Y = L109I, A110W, L130I) exhibited most of the expected growth behaviors. However, although yeast carrying H3Y alone exhibited no growth even after 21 days of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and not shown), H3X-only strains did grow even in the absence of H3Y, albeit poorly – colonies were only observed after nine or more days of growth of these strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), in contrast to the abundant colonies observed for H3X/H3Y strains after just two or three days. As homodimerization of H3X even at low levels could complicate interpretation of this system, we carried out a round of in vivo selection to optimize the H3X interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). We randomized each of the H3/H3 interface residues on the backbone of the initial H3X gene, generating libraries of yeast strains bearing these mutant ‘H3X*’ molecules paired with our previously-selected H3Y design. Strains that grew robustly with H3X*/H3Y pairs were then re-tested for growth in the absence of the H3Y. In this manner, we identified four final versions of H3X (named 126A, 130A, 130T, and 130Q for the additional substitutions on the original H3X backbone) that reproducibly conferred robust growth in the presence of H3Y but were completely inviable in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). We obtained multiple isolates encoding each of these amino acid substitutions (13, 5, 5, and 5, respectively), suggesting that we had adequately surveyed the possible codons. Consistent with our observation that these residues are sensitive points for H3/H3 dimeric interactions, L126A and L130A mutations cause lethality when present on symmetric H3 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dai et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Although these genetic tests suggest that H3X or H3Y alone do not homodimerize efficiently enough to support growth, the possibility remains that in the context of cells expressing both H3X and H3Y there could nonetheless exist a substantial fraction of inappropriate homodimeric interactions, which would complicate interpretation of downstream results. To quantitatively determine the extent of X/X or Y/Y homodimerization in vivo, a biotin-tagged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckett et al., 1999</xref>) H3X or Y variant was coexpressed in combination with two other H3s: the same variant with a different epitope tag, and the designed partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To analyze H3-H3 interactions within individual nucleosomes and avoid contamination from adjacent nucleosomes (as could arise from undigested dinucleosomes), we treated extracts from these cells with dimethyl suberimidate (DMS), a crosslinking agent that produces well-characterized crosslinks within histone octamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kornberg and Thomas, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomas, 1989</xref>). Crosslinked samples were then digested with micrococcal nuclease to generate a soluble population of mononucleosomes. This was followed by biotin-based affinity purification in the presence of high salt (2M NaCl) to remove DNA and adjacent nucleosomes, leaving only crosslinked protein complexes that were subsequently analyzed by Western blotting. The DMS crosslinking efficiency of the X-Y heterodimeric pairs was nearly identical to that observed in cells expressing tagged H3 variants with a wild-type, homodimeric interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28836.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Biochemical analysis of asymmetric nucleosome formation in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic for in vivo biochemical analysis of H3X dimerization.

These growth phenotypes correspond roughly to additive and recessive epistasis, respectively. Importantly, the stress sensitivity observed for these mutants was not specific to osmotic stress. Consistent with prior studies demonstrating that yeast lacking H3K36 methylation are hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jha and Strahl, 2014</xref>), we find that the K36Q double mutants – but neither of the single K36Q mutants – displayed increased sensitivity to both the DNA alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and the strand break-inducing agent phleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

We conclude that K36Q mutations confer sensitivity to osmotic, temperature and DNA damage stresses, but only when symmetrically present on nucleosomes. These data support the biochemical data indicating that we can separately manipulate single H3 molecules within nucleosomes in vivo, and provide an illustration of the types of biological regulation that can be discovered using these tools.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A single H3K36 suffices to silence cryptic internal promoters</title><p>Our growth data that a single copy of H3K36 per nucleosome is sufficient to support growth under stress conditions.

H3K36 is methylated by Set2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strahl et al., 2002</xref>), with the resulting modified residues serving to activate the RPD3S histone deacetylase complex via binding of the Eaf3 chromodomain-containing subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrozza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Keogh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joshi and Struhl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Govind et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drouin et al., 2010</xref>). As the major biological role served by H3K36 methylation is silencing of cryptic internal promoters via activation of the RPD3S complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrozza et al., 2005</xref>), and given that RPD3S can bind to nucleosomes with a single H3K36me3 modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huh et al., 2012</xref>), we sought to test whether a single methylated H3K36 per nucleosome would be sufficient to support robust silencing of such cryptic transcripts in vivo.</p><p>We first explored this idea with genetic tests, comparing the growth phenotypes of a P38V mutant series to K36Q mutants. The P38V mutants enable di- and tri-methylation of H3K36 to be distinguished – the wild-type proline residue at this position undergoes regulated isomerization, and P38V mutations that eliminate the possibility of proline isomerization block trimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nelson et al., 2006</xref>) but not dimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Youdell et al., 2008</xref>) of the nearby K36 residue, a finding that we confirm here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Consistent with this, we find that double P38V mutations, on either a wild-type H3 backbone or in the context of the XY system, did not cause the temperature sensitivity observed in K36Q mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Consistent with previous analyses of the effects of P38V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nelson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Youdell et al., 2008</xref>), immunoblotting confirms that these strains have one H3 tail (K36Q) that lacks K36 methylation entirely, and one tail (P38V) with a dimethylated K36 residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). We made strains with both possible configurations: H3XK36Q + H3YP38V and H3XP38V + H3YK36Q.

The ability to generate nucleosomes bearing either single mutations or symmetric double mutations to key regulatory residues will allow detailed mechanistic analyses of the roles for histone modifications in various aspects of chromosome biology. Here, we demonstrate two of many potential uses of this system, interrogating the role for H3K36 in control of cryptic transcription, and investigating ‘crosstalk’ between histone modifications.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Interpreting epistasis between the histone tails</title><p>To genetically interrogate interactions between the histone tails, we analyzed phenotypes in yeast strains carrying one of four nucleosomes: H3Xwt/H3Ywt – ‘pseudo-wild-type’ – and H3X<bold>mut</bold>/H3Ywt, H3Xwt/H3Y<bold>mut</bold>, and H3X<bold>mut</bold>/H3Y<bold>mut</bold>. In principle, we could expect to see a variety of classes of interactions between the mutations, including transgressive epistasis (not observed in this study), and a range from dominant epistasis, in which the single mutants exhibit the same phenotype observed in the double mutant, to recessive epistasis, in which a given phenotype is only observed in the double. For quantitative traits, these correspond to alleviating and aggravating epistasis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Segrè et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Measured in the context of obligate heterodimers, such genetic interactions can provide insights into the mechanistic basis for readout of histone modifications. As a simple example, a protein that binds cooperatively to both tails of a given nucleosome should give rise to dominant epistasis between the histone mutations that affect its binding (depending of course on the concentration of the factor in question and its Kd for a single tail), as loss of a single residue abrogates the cooperative binding. Conversely, if each histone tail recruits a binding protein independently of the other, then loss of a single tail could have a range of quantitative effects on local gene expression, depending on whether or not the binder is typically recruited in excess for some function. Downstream of initial binding interactions, many readouts of histone modification function, such as mRNA abundance, are several mechanistic steps removed from direct binding, and thus more complex models can readily be envisioned that would exhibit a range of distinct epistasis behaviors depending on the input/output relationships for the various intervening steps.</p><p>Here, we surveyed intra-tail epistasis for 12 sets of H3 point mutants, simply using growth rate as a phenotype. Even with this coarse resolution, we identified inter-tail interactions including dominant epistasis (for the enhanced low-salt growth seen in H3K18Q mutants, for example) to relatively unusual cases of recessive epistasis (for H3K36Q effects on growth in stress conditions). For followup studies we focused on H3K36Q, given that recessive epistasis makes more concrete mechanistic predictions, and given the well-understood role for H3K36 modification in gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A single H3K36me2 per nucleosome is sufficient for stress resistance and repression of cryptic transcripts</title><p>Although H3K36 is potentially subject to multiple distinct modification pathways – H3K36 is acetylated at a small fraction of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morris et al., 2007</xref>), for example – the majority of phenotypes of H3K36 mutants result from loss of H3K36 methylation-dependent activity of the RPD3S complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrozza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Keogh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joshi and Struhl, 2005</xref>).

First, we find that H3K36Q significantly affects growth rate – particularly under stress conditions – only when present in both H3 copies per nucleosome. Next, consistent with a primary function of H3K36 modification being to repress cryptic intragenic promoters, we show that a single wild-type K36 is sufficient to prevent transcription at such promoters. Third, extending prior studies, we find that growth rate and cryptic promoter silencing are both unaffected by double P38V mutants. P38V inhibits trimethylation but not dimethylation of K36 residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Youdell et al., 2008</xref>), and nucleosomes with two H3P38V tails are sufficient to prevent cryptic transcription either in natural, symmetric nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Youdell et al., 2008</xref>) or in our asymmetric nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lane 16). Finally, the K36Q/P38V trans strains indicate that a single dimethylated K36 residue is sufficient to prevent stress sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) and repress cryptic transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lanes 17–18). Together, these data indicate that a single K36-dimethylated H3 tail per nucleosome is sufficient to prevent cryptic transcription, and to promote stress resistance.</p><p>Notably, the RPD3S complex appears to be particularly well-suited to carrying out its regulatory functions even on chromatin that is less than fully methylated at H3K36. In vitro experiments show that RPD3S is able to bind to nucleosomal templates containing asymmetric H3K36me3 modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huh et al., 2012</xref>). Further, although RPD3S binds with higher affinity to dinucleosomes than monosomes, it binds with high affinity to templates with a dimethylated nucleosome adjacent to a fully unmethylated one. These data suggest that the methyl-K36/RPD3S system would be buffered against transient reductions in H3K36me2-3 density, for example during DNA repair or replication-mediated loss of modified histones. Our data extend these observations to indicate that the enzyme can function effectively in vivo even if it can only engage a single H3K36me2 or me3 per nucleosome.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>H3S10 mutants affect H3K9 acetylation in cis</title><p>As another demonstration of the utility of the H3X/H3Y system, we carried out mass spectrometry analysis of a histone ‘crosstalk’ pathway.

This method allows probing of histone crosstalk pathways in which one modification affects a second modification site. We show that H3S10A mutations decrease acetylation at the neighboring K9 residue, but only on the molecule in cis. This is consistent with a recent in vitro study demonstrating that S10 phosphorylation stimulates H3 tail acetylation by Gcn5 only in cis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liokatis et al., 2016</xref>).

First, we show here that the H3X/Y system assembles appropriately in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), providing a convenient method for generation of asymmetric nucleosomes for in vitro studies. This method should prove more generalizable than existing methods that rely on immunopurification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Voigt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li and Shogren-Knaak, 2008</xref>) or extensive chemical synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lechner et al., 2016</xref>). Such asymmetric nucleosomes could be used to generate single-tailed nucleosomes for structural studies of tail-dependent nucleosome-binding proteins, significantly reducing the conformational heterogeneity resulting from the many flexible, unstructured histone tails. Nucleosomes carrying either asymmetric point mutations or asymmetric modified residues (generated using peptide ligation, for example – [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shogren-Knaak et al., 2003</xref>]) will facilitate detailed biochemical analyses of chromatin regulators, or selection of asymmetry-specific binding partners. Such studies can also be envisioned using asymmetric nucleosomes purified from living cells – thus occupying a wide range of DNA sequences and carrying a multitude of covalent modifications – as affinity-tagged X and Y halves of the heterodimer allow for efficient and rapid purification of chromatin composed of asymmetric nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>In addition to improving on extant methods to generate asymmetric nucleosomes in vitro, our system uniquely allows genetically-encoded assembly of asymmetric nucleosomes across the genome in living cells. We describe here one example of in vivo analysis of the gene regulatory consequences resulting from single vs. double H3 mutations for H3K36Q, which can of course be extended to additional H3 mutations and to genome-wide or single-cell analyses. Although such studies are demonstrated here using the budding yeast system, the H3-H3 interface is generally highly conserved throughout evolution, and we expect that this system should function appropriately in other species – indeed, the biochemical reconstitution of asymmetric nucleosomes described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is carried out using human histone sequences. Although canonical histone genes are often encoded in many copies in large multi-gene genomic clusters and are therefore inconvenient for genetic studies, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model has been developed in which the histone genes have been relocated to an artificial locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKay et al., 2015</xref>). Along with <italic>S. pombe</italic>, these models should enable analysis of H3K9/HP1 and H3K27/Polycomb repression systems in vivo. In addition, even in other model organisms we expect that low copy number H3 molecules such as H3.3 and CENP-A should prove amenable to analysis using the H3X/Y system.</p><p>In any of these systems, the X/Y heterodimer will not just allow analysis of single vs. double mutations of the same residue, but will also enable cis and trans dissection of effects of combinatorial mutations (eg H3XK9R/H3YK14R vs. H3XK9RK14R/H3YWT). Fusing individual H3 molecules to labeling reagents such as BirA or Dam, or introduction of cysteine residues that can be used to create local nicks in the DNA, could potentially also be used to probe stereospecificity – facing from the promoter into a coding region, does a given nucleosome remodeler bind the left or the right H3 tail? – of nucleosome binding proteins. It is also possible to envision pulse-chase methods for investigation of H3/H4 dimer mixing during replication and replication-independent nucleosome replacement.</p><p>Together, our data describe a versatile system for investigation of nucleosome symmetry, and demonstrate the utility of in vivo analysis of asymmetric nucleosomes as a mechanistic probe for histone modification function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid constructions and mutagenesis</title><p>C-terminal mutations of <italic>HHT2</italic>, one of the yeast genes encoding histone H3, were generated according to QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

The full length PCR product was gel purified, self-ligated with T4 DNA ligase and transformed into competent E. coli Top10F’ cells. 1 ml LB was added after heat shock transformation and the cells recovered for 1.5 hr at 37°C. 100 μl cells were plated to check the colony number, and the rest of the transformation was put into culture tube with another 2 ml LB and antibiotic to grow O/N before plasmid DNA miniprep (Zymo).

Pseudo-wild type yeast are viable, but grow slowly relative to the parental strain in YPD at 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, they are temperature-sensitive and grow extremely poorly at 37°C. For this reason, temperature sensitivity in this system is assayed at 34°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, the temperature-sensitivity phenotypes observed at this temperature occur in the same sets of mutants that grow poorly in high salt or in the presence of DNA-damaging agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, although the X/Y histone interface provides a sensitized assay for some phenotypes, it nevertheless represents a useful and internally-consistent platform for exploring important and physiologically-relevant aspects of gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Dimethyl suberimidate-crosslinked nucleosomes</title><p>100 ml cell cultures were grown in synthetic dextrose media to maintain selection for the three histone-encoding plasmids, with 250 nM biotin added to favor biotinylation of the tagged H3. Cells were harvested in early log phase (A600 ~0.25), pelleted and transferred to 1.5 ml O-ring microcentrifuge tubes (Fisher #02-707-353). Cells were washed three times with 1 ml extraction (E) buffer (20 mM Na borate, pH 9.0, 0.35 M NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, plus 1 mM PMSF added freshly). Cells were resuspended in 900 μl E buffer, and 0.5 ml glass beads (0.5 mm, Biospec) were added to each tube. Cell walls were mechanically broken with three one-minute pulses in a Biospec beadbeater, with five-minute incubations on ice between pulses. The tube bottoms were punctured with a flame-heated 26 gauge needle, placed into a 12 × 75 mm plastic tube and centrifuged for 2 min at 1500 rpm in a tabletop clinical centrifuge at 4°C. The liquid extracts were resuspended and transferred to 1.5 ml microfuge tubes. 1/10 vol freshly dissolved 11 mg/ml dimethyl suberimidate (Pierce) in E buffer was added, and samples were incubated with rotation at room temperature 90 min. For time point aliquots to be analyzed directly on gels, proteins were precipitated by addition of 1/10 vol 100% TCA. For material to be MNase-digested and immunoprecipitated, the crosslinker was quenched by addition of 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5 and further rotation for 15 min. 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> were added and tubes were equilibrated at 37°C for 5 min. 20 μl MNase (Worthington, 20 U/μl in 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.4) were added, tubes were inverted five times and incubated at 37°C, 20 min.

The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 75,600 g for 20 min and the supernatant filtered using a 0.45 μm syringe filter (HPF Millex, Millipore). The sample was injected onto connected HiTrap Q HP (5 ml) and HiTrap SP HP (5 ml) columns (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer. Columns were washed with lysis buffer before removing the HiTrap Q column. Histone H3 was eluted from the HiTrap SP column with a 12 CV gradient into 60% elution buffer (lysis buffer with 1 M NaCl).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Song Tan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers all felt that the methods were clever and novel and the manuscript was discussed in depth by the reviewers and editors. There were significant concerns that the WT X/Y dimers had reduced growth and acetylation levels relative to real WT. Hence some of the experimental observations may be affected by the sickness of these strains. Another issue was that the amount of novel biological information was limited. These issues are described in some detail in the reviews below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is a very clever paper from the Kaufman and Rando lab that approaches very interesting issues in basic chromatin biology. The forced heterodimers of H3 mutants and their creation is very innovative and creative. The utility of this approach was illustrated by analyzing H3K36 methylation and Ser10 phosphorylation.</p><p>While the approach is very creative and innovative the biological discovery in the manuscript seems rather incremental for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have developed a system for studying nucleosomes containing asymmetrically positioned histone H3 mutations or modifications in vivo. Using structure-based design combined with genetic screening, they have designed two yeast histone H3 variants which form obligate heterodimers in vivo. The H3X and H3Y variants support growth when expressed together from low-copy number plasmids in yeast strains with the chromosomal H3 copies deleted, in contrast to when only H3X or H3Y variants are expressed. By positioning appropriate mutations on H3X or H3Y, the authors are able to show that a single copy of H3K36 per nucleosome is sufficient to silence cryptic internal promoter in vivo. They further show that the H3S10A mutation (which eliminates phosphorylation on H3S10) affects Gcn5 acetylation of H3K9 in cis in vivo.</p><p>The method described is novel and interesting. The impact on the chromatin biology field is tempered by the limitation that, as described, the method is only applicable to introducing asymmetry on histone H3 residues. Mutations on histone H2A, H2B or H4 apparently cannot be studied using the H3X/H3Y pair, nor can histone crosstalks between different histones (as the authors point out). Given this limitation, I suggest modifying the title to: &quot;A synthetic biology approach to probing nucleosome symmetry of histone H3 residues&quot;.</p><p>One aspect that was not discussed by the authors was the possibility of perturbation of nucleosome structure by the replacement of wild-type H3 protein with the H3X/H3Y pair. Such perturbations presumably might be subtle, and might affect only a subset of chromatin modification or remodeling enzymes. I do not believe this possibility affects the interpretation of the results they presented (with one possible exception), but I do recommend the authors acknowledge this possibility explicitly to make the reader aware of this potential complication. The possible exception is the lower fraction of K9ac for pseudo-wild type H3X/H3Y compared to wild type H3/H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This significant reduction in K9ac should be noted and possible interpretations/explanations provided.</p><p>The authors state that &quot;Consistent with prior reports, we found that the fraction of H3 molecules acetylated at K9 was lower in yeast strains carrying H3S10A symmetrically, […]&quot; Please provide the references for these prior reports. This might be my ignorance, but while I am aware of papers describing the H3S10 phosphorylation/H3K14 acetylation crosstalk, I am not aware of papers for H3S10 phosphorylation/H3K9 acetylation crosstalk. Why did the authors select the former crosstalk for study here instead of the latter?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the authors develop a nice system to allow specific tests of whether histone modifications are required to be symmetric or not. Using this system, they go on to test to interesting aspects of histone H3 function – the requirement for H3K36 methylation to repress cryptic promoters and whether a mutation, S10A, affects adjacent acetylation in cis and/or trans. The paper is clearly written and the results will be of general interest to the transcription community. In addition, they system itself will likely be of interest to other labs.</p><p>1) Subsection “Design and validation of obligate heterodimers”, third paragraph: – The text states that the genetic tests demonstrate that H3X or H3Y alone do not homodimerize. Please use another word in place of &quot;demonstrate&quot; such as &quot;suggests.&quot; A strong conclusion about dimerization cannot be made from solely from this genetic test as the 5FOA sensitivity could be due to some other reason than a failure to dimerize.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: – Why is H3-H3 the only crosslinked form of H3 that is observed? What about H3-H4 or higher-order crosslinks?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: – While these results support that heterodimerization is preferred over homodimerization, it is difficult to assess how well it occurs compared to dimerization of wild-type H3. This is particularly true because the level of crosslinking is low. Therefore, additional controls would be helpful.

There were significant concerns that the WT X/Y dimers had reduced growth and acetylation levels relative to real WT. Hence some of the experimental observations may be affected by the sickness of these strains. Another issue was that the amount of novel biological information was limited. These issues are described in some detail in the reviews below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a very clever paper from the Kaufman and Rando lab that approaches very interesting issues in basic chromatin biology. The forced heterodimers of H3 mutants and their creation is very innovative and creative. The utility of this approach was illustrated by analyzing H3K36 methylation and Ser10 phosphorylation.</p><p>While the approach is very creative and innovative the biological discovery in the manuscript seems rather incremental for publication in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments. We view the chief novelty of this work to be the generation of a unique toolset. This resource will be broadly useful to the chromatin community for the exploration of an unexplored level of genomic regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The method described is novel and interesting. The impact on the chromatin biology field is tempered by the limitation that, as described, the method is only applicable to introducing asymmetry on histone H3 residues. Mutations on histone H2A, H2B or H4 apparently cannot be studied using the H3X/H3Y pair, nor can histone crosstalks between different histones (as the authors point out). Given this limitation, I suggest modifying the title to: &quot;A synthetic biology approach to probing nucleosome symmetry of histone H3 residues&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we agree with this basic point, we found the suggested title problematic as it suggests that we are analyzing the symmetry of H3 amino acids, which might lead a reader to think we are analyzing D vs L amino acids. In addition, one can imagine eventual engineering efforts to make separable H3-H4 interfaces that, together with this H3-H3 interface, would enable broader probes of nucleosome symmetry. Given this, unless the reviewer finds this to be completely unacceptable, we felt the extant title was better than any alternative we could come up with.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One aspect that was not discussed by the authors was the possibility of perturbation of nucleosome structure by the replacement of wild-type H3 protein with the H3X/H3Y pair. Such perturbations presumably might be subtle, and might affect only a subset of chromatin modification or remodeling enzymes. I do not believe this possibility affects the interpretation of the results they presented (with one possible exception), but I do recommend the authors acknowledge this possibility explicitly to make the reader aware of this potential complication.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the pseudo-WT X/Y strains do not grow as robustly as strains with unaltered histones, although the growth rates in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> were measured robotically in suboptimal conditions – a poorly aerated 96-well format. We now present growth data for the XY system in well-aerated YPD cultures in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, confirming that the XY interface does cause a growth defect as expected from mutations affecting the H3/H3 interface. That noted, all experiments involve comparisons to the pseudo-WT strains – thus internally controlling for this unavoidable issue – and we also now include more explicit discussion of the possible effects of the X-Y interface at several places in the text, as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The possible exception is the lower fraction of K9ac for pseudo-wild type H3X/H3Y compared to wild type H3/H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This significant reduction in K9ac should be noted and possible interpretations/explanations provided.</p><p>The authors state that &quot;Consistent with prior reports, we found that the fraction of H3 molecules acetylated at K9 was lower in yeast strains carrying H3S10A symmetrically, […]&quot; Please provide the references for these prior reports. This might be my ignorance, but while I am aware of papers describing the H3S10 phosphorylation/H3K14 acetylation crosstalk, I am not aware of papers for H3S10 phosphorylation/H3K9 acetylation crosstalk. Why did the authors select the former crosstalk for study here instead of the latter?</p></disp-quote><p>The effect of S10A on K9ac was especially strong and clear in our mass spectroscopy data so we focused on it here. As for why we ignored K14ac, in contrast to published reports which are based mostly on antibody-mediated detection, we actually found minimal effects of S10A mutation on H3K14ac in our mass spec data. This was true for S10A mutants not just in the X/Y system, but also on the wild-type H3 background – in other words, we find that S10A mutants affect K9ac but we cannot replicate prior reports on K14ac. Whether this discrepancy is due to “strain background” or something like this we do not know, but we felt it was wiser to simply avoid bringing up K14ac since it is really peripheral to the manuscript. Our K9ac data are reproducible and robust, being observed in multiple MS experiments and confirmed independently by Western blotting.</p><p>Also, the reviewer is correct, there isn’t a prior report that specifically examined the effect S10A on K9ac; we had misquoted older literature where some ChIP experiments had used antibodies that would recognize both K9ac and K14ac. We have corrected this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) Subsection “Design and validation of obligate heterodimers”, third paragraph: The text states that the genetic tests demonstrate that H3X or H3Y alone do not homodimerize. Please use another word in place of &quot;demonstrate&quot; such as &quot;suggests.&quot; A strong conclusion about dimerization cannot be made from solely from this genetic test as the 5FOA sensitivity could be due to some other reason than a failure to dimerize.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: Why is H3-H3 the only crosslinked form of H3 that is observed? What about H3-H4 or higher-order crosslinks?</p></disp-quote><p>We have detected these species using anti-epitope tag antibodies, testing for crosslinks between the biotin-H3 molecules captured on streptavidin-agarose and either V5- or Myc-tagged H3 molecules in the same nucleosome. Biotin-H3 molecules crosslinked to H4 would not be recognized by the anti-epitope antibodies (which would only be present on another H3 besides the biotin-tagged H3).

This was shown in the original Figure 3—figure supplement 2. In an asymmetric XY background, the effect of the K36Q on temperature sensitivity is observed at 34C. Therefore, growth at 34C proved to be a convenient assay that accurately predicted the cryptic transcription phenotype of asymmetric histone strains. Notably, the cryptic transcription phenotype is not synthetic, as it is observed in strains expressing H3K36Q-wtC. In the revised manuscript we emphasize that although the XY histone interface provides a sensitized assay for some phenotypes, it nevertheless represents a useful platform for exploring important and physiologically relevant aspects of gene regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Kumar et al.
