stem/progenitor cells produce multiple pancreatic, gastrointestinal and hypothalamic peptides in addition to exosomes. Through cell sorting and selection according to insulin promoter activity, we generated a subpopulation(s) of these cells which formed 3D spherical structure with combined features of hypothalamic neurospheres and pancreatic islets. Through testing streptozotocin-induced pancreatic islet disruption and fatal diabetes, we found that peripheral implantation of these spheres in mice led to remarkable improvements in general health and survival in addition to a moderate antidiabetic effect, and notably these pro-survival versus metabolic effects were dissociable to a significant extent. Mechanistically, secretion of exosomes by these spheres was essential for enhancing survival while production of insulin was important for the antidiabetic effect. In summary, hypothalamic neural stem/progenitor cells comprise subpopulations with multifaceted secretion, and their derived hypothalamic islets can be implanted peripherally to enhance general health and survival together with an antidiabetic benefit.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>neural stem cell</kwd><kwd>implantation</kwd><kwd>exosome</kwd><kwd>insulin</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG031774</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Dongsheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK099136</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Dongsheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL147477</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Dongsheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK121435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Dongsheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A subpopulation of multi-secretory hypothalamic stem cells was developed to form 3D spheres for peripheral application against mortality and symptom of a severe diabetes model.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) are essential for brain development during the embryonic stage. On the other hand, some of NSCs continue to exist in a few brain regions of rodents including the sub-ventricular zone and the dentate gyrus which require adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gage, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gross, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morrison, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez-Buylla and Lim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emsley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Opendak and Gould, 2015</xref>).

We showed that the hypothalamus of adult mice contained Sox2-positive NSCs (referred to as htNSCs), residing predominantly in the hypothalamic third-ventricle wall and the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) parenchyma, which are capable of differentiation into three neural linages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2012</xref>). These cells can play a role in long-term metabolic control through the effects on hypothalamic neural plasticity, which could be suggested in the context of relevant literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pierce and Xu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McNay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scarlett et al., 2016</xref>). Also, some of these cells in the third-ventricle wall and median eminence which are known as tanycytes could influence metabolic physiology through the gate-keeping functions such as hormone transporting or affecting the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Langlet, 2014</xref>), but it remains unclear if these cells could have some endocrine action to directly regulate metabolic balance. Recently, we discovered that htNSCs have a key endocrine function through secreting exosomes and contribute to the hypothalamic control of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). This research progress points to htNSCs as a cell therapy model based on the endocrine feature of these cells; thus, it is scientifically demanding to gain in-depth understandings into the endocrinology of these cells. Moreover, since delivery of these cells into the brain is a hurdle for clinical application, we decided to explore alternative application approaches such as peripheral implantation. In this work, we discovered that a subpopulation(s) of htNSCs can form spherical structure with combined features of secreting multiple pancreatic/gustatory and hypothalamic factors, and peripheral implantation of these spheres leads to substantial improvements in general health and survival together with a moderate anti-diabetic effect in a fatal diabetic model, while the underlying endocrine mechanisms were comprehensively attributed to multifaceted secretion of these spheres.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Co-expression of multiple peptidyl hormones by some htNSCs</title><p>Using quantitative PCR, we found that cultured htNSCs expressed mRNAs of multiple hypothalamic and gastrointestinal hormones, evidently including pancreatic hormones such as insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin which led to our research interest of this study. In this background, we did immunostaining revealing that some subpopulations of htNSCs co-expressed insulin, glucagon and somatostatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These peptides could be localized in the same or different vesicles; for instance, insulin-positive vesicles were often distinct from the vesicles positive for glucagon and somatostatin, while the latter two peptides were often co-localized in the same vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). Using large dense-core vesicles (LDCV) and synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMV) markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), we revealed that insulin was present mostly in the LDCV while glucagon and somatostatin were often co-present predominantly in the SLMV.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Some htNSCs expressing pancreatic hormones and cell selection via insulin promoter.</title><p>(<bold>a–b</bold>) Representative immunostaining of single-cell confocal images.

To do so, we transfected primary htNSCs with Flp recombinase-dependent GFP reporter plasmid whose expression is driven by insulin, glucagon or somatostatin promoter (namely <italic>Ins</italic>-Flp, <italic>Gcg</italic>-Flp and <italic>Sst</italic>-Flp, respectively). The <italic>Ins</italic> promoter activity was found in ~7% of htNSCs, while the <italic>Gcg</italic> and <italic>Sst</italic> promoter activities were found in ~2% and~3% of htNSCs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), indicating that only small subpopulations of these cells significantly shared the genetic features of pancreatic islet cells.</p><p>We also examined if different pancreatic peptides are produced in same or different htNSCs. To do so, we constructed a Flp/Cre dual fluorescence reporter system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>), as this system allowed us to simultaneously detect the gene promoter activities of two different peptides in the same cells. The specificity of Flp- versus Cre-dependent fluorescence in this reporter system was evaluated in various cell models including an unrelated cell line HEK293T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>). Then, htNSCs were transfected with this reporter system together with Flp and Cre plasmids driven by different promoters, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>. We found that among htNSCs which displayed <italic>Ins</italic> promoter activation,~25% of them showed co-activation of <italic>Sst</italic> promoter, and 20% of them showed co-activation of <italic>Gcg</italic> promoter. We also found that ~44% of htNSCs with <italic>Gcg</italic> promoter activation showed co-activation of <italic>Sst</italic> promoter. Thus, multiple peptidyl hormones are co-expressed in subpopulations of htNSCs. According to the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Katsuta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Segerstolpe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enge et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Krijger et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van der Meulen and Huising, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jeon et al., 2009</xref>), co-existence of these pancreatic hormones in same cells could also be seen in some immature islets of Langerhans, indicating that there exists some developmental relationship between these htNSCs and the precursors of pancreatic islets.</p><p>In addition to pancreatic peptides, we observed that many of these htNSCs expressed gastrointestinal hormones such as galanin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), cholecystokinin (CCK) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) as well as hypothalamic peptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AgRP), alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and oxytocin in subcellular vesicles (some examples of these peptide immunostainings are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Notably, for any pairs of these peptides, they were always found to co-exist in some of htNSCs, and each of these peptides could be found present in insulin-positive htNSCs. Thus, htNSCs contain subpopulations that produce multiple peptides in bulk as well as single-cell levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Generation of insulin promoter-selected htNSC spheres</title><p>Because insulin is a predominant pancreatic hormone, we designed to employ insulin promoter activity as a target for isolating a subpopulation(s) of htNSCs. To do so, we infected htNSCs with a lentiviral system containing mCherry expression driven by rat insulin promoter (RIP) which fluorescently labeled such population(s) of htNSCs. In our initial trial, indeed some htNSCs were made mCherry-positive by this method; however, most likely because RIP activity was not strong, it was insufficient for fluorescent flow cytometry (FACS) sorting-based cell isolation. To address this limitation, we increased the RIP activity through temporarily introducing Ngn3, Pdx-1 and MafA transcription factor cocktail to the cells, as suggested by the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariyachet et al., 2016</xref>). After this cocktail was transiently applied to htNSCs via an adenoviral induction, RIP-driven mCherry fluorescence strikingly increased in many htNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, left panel). With this success, mCherry-positive cells were abundantly sorted out via FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> top vs. middle panel) and were subsequently established as a subpopulation(s) of insulin promoter-selected cells, as evaluated with microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> right panel) and also FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> bottom panel). After a few generations of cell passaging, through which the cocktail completely disappeared, we confirmed that RIP-driven mCherry remained strong in a majority of cells indicating that these cells were induced to persistently have an enhanced level of insulin promoter activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Multifaceted peptide secretion of insulin promoter-selected htNSC spheres</title><p>We assessed if these insulin promoter-selected htNSCs were able to release insulin. First, using a luminescent reporter which was known to sensitively report insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burns et al., 2015</xref>), we found that insulin secretion substantially increased in these insulin promoter-selected htNSCs compared to insulin secretion from htNSCs of pre-selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Using an ELISA which directly measured insulin, we found that these insulin promoter-selected htNSCs secreted insulin in a glucose-regulated manner. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, we designed a test in which these htNSCs were subjected to 3 cycles of low-level (2 mM) and high-level (20 mM) glucose incubation, 1 hr each step. We found that high-level glucose led to ~3 fold increase of insulin release, which dropped to the baseline after glucose returned to the low level. Subsequent two repeats of high-glucose stimulation were still able to increase insulin release but in a gradually declining manner. Moreover, we subjected these htNSCs to potassium chloride or arginine, since both are known to stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion; our results confirmed that these htNSCs released insulin in response to either stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The insulin-secreting activity of these htNSCs was preserved over at least 10 passages of cell culture which we monitored.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Secretion of multiple peptides by insulin promoter-selected htNSC spheres.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Insulin secretion from insulin promoter-selected htNSCs in monolayer assessed by means of luminescent reporter (au: arbitrary unit).

We then examined all these pancreatic peptides in these htNSC spheres. Given the heterogeneous sizes of htNSC spheres, we analyzed both large size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref>) and small size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which showed consistent results. For further information, we compared these htNSC spheres to mouse pancreatic islets under the same immunostaining conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). As expected, insulin was globally and widely present in these htNSC spheres, which were distributed both in the center and periphery, slightly differing from pancreatic islets in which insulin-positive cells were more in the center than the periphery. Also compared to pancreatic islets, these htNSC spheres contained higher percentages of somatostatin-positive cells but similar percentages of glucagon-positive cells. These cells were probably more established during the sphere development which led to increased promoter activities of these two peptides while insulin promoter activiy became weak and even faded out. Also, while glucagon- and somatostatin-positive cells were distributed typically in the periphery of pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a–b</xref>), it was the case for somatostatin but not for glucagon in these htNSC spheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>).

In addition, we examined pancreatic islet biomarkers including proprotein convertase 1 (PC1/3), glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel KIR6.2, and NKX2.2.

We hypothesized that that strategy of developing β cell therapy against diabetes might need to consider the importance of glucagon-producing and somatostatin-producing cells in 3D structure. In order to provide an insight into this idea, we determined the inter-relationships of insulin-, somatostatin- and glucagon-expressing cells in maintaining the 3D structure of insulin promoter-selected htNSC spheres. To do so, we employed promoter-driven diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor (DTR) which led to selective depletion of insulin-, somatostatin- or glucagon-positive cells in these htNSCs spheres after DT administration in the culture medium. Without surprise, htNSC spheres were completely damaged when either cell type was depleted. We then collected the dissociated cells from this DT treatment by which either of individual cell types was mostly eliminated, and examined if the remaining cells could eventually lead to spheres. Of interest, when insulin-positive cells were mostly missing, the remaining cells still effectively made spheres; in contrast, when either somatostatin- or glucagon-positive cells were mostly missing, despite that a lot of insulin-producing cells were present, these cells failed to form any spheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).

Given our focus on endocrine secretion as well as our interest in practical application, we designed to explore several peripheral locations which have often used for cell implantation in research, including subcapsular spaces in kidneys, subcutaneous and intrahepatic spaces. To help the in vivo survival of htNSCs as we established previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2012</xref>), these htNSC<sup>PGHM</sup> cells were engineered via lentiviral induction to stably contain a potent anti-inflammatory gene, dominant-negative IκBα (GFP-conjugated, controlled by CMV promoter). However, despite these efforts, none of these peripheral locations turned out to be successful for the implantation of htNSCs due to the poor survival when ectopically implanted. As we continued to try other peripheral locations, we found that the great omentum was a suitable choice of implantation, with &gt;50% implanted cell survival over a month. The great omentum is a peritoneum membrane of the abdominal cavity, which is mainly composed of fat and connective tissue and has abundant blood supply. In mice, the great omentum is mostly curled under the stomach’s greater curvature and can be spread up to provide a good physical support for implants. In our procedure, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, htNSC<sup>PGHM</sup> spheres were embedded into 3D collagen matrices while solidified collagen matrices were compressed into collagen sheets with tension and rigidity similar to in vivo tissues, and cell-embedded collagen sheets were placed and secured into the great omentum flap of mice.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Moderate antidiabetic effect of htNSCs<sup>PGHM</sup> spheres in STZ model.</title><p>(<bold>a–c</bold>) Implants of htNSC<sup>PGHM</sup> in the great omentum of STZ mice were extracted and sectioned for examining cell survival.

We adopted a protocol of single high-dose STZ injection to generate a severe diabetes and sickness model. Hyperglycemia (&gt;350 mg/dL) was induced in ~80% of mice within 5–7 days after STZ administration, and roughly 50% of these mice died within 30–40 days (which slightly varied among different experiments when involving different procedural stresses). As represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, these STZ-injected diabetic mice were implanted with htNSC<sup>PGHM</sup> spheres in the great omentum vs. sham implantation (a group of mice without STZ injection was also included as a normal reference).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, while overnight fasting blood glucose remained 350–500 mg/dL in majority of sham-operated STZ mice, blood glucose dropped below 300 mg/dL in a majority of mice with htNSC<sup>PGHM</sup> implantation shortly after implantation, and many of them were lower than 250 mg/dL. These therapeutic effects remained for weeks or throughout the follow-up. Although a portion of animals (~25% of experimental mice) did not show an appreciable hypoglycemic effect, it was revealed at the end of the experiment that cells in the implants survived poorly in these mice. However, these hypoglycemic effects were considered moderate since these treated mice were still diabetic. Because insulin is an important factor for lowering blood glucose, and our generation of htNSC<sup>PGHM</sup> was indeed based on insulin promoter for cell selection, we measured fasting plasma insulin levels of the implanted mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, average plasma insulin levels in cell-implanted STZ mice were in general higher than the levels in sham controls, although they were still much below the reference of normal mice. Because the primary target of STZ is pancreatic islets, a relevant question was whether htNSC<sup>PGHM</sup> spheres could induce regeneration of pancreatic islets. Through rigorous examination, we confirmed that pancreatic islets were similarly damaged between cell implantation and sham controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f,g</xref>), indicating that the effect of this treatment was not due to pancreatic islet protection in this STZ model. Despite that htNSC<sup>PGHM</sup> were much less potent than pancreatic islets in releasing insulin, we had the advantage of implanting a large number of spheres (&gt;100 times more than the number of pancreatic islets of a mouse), which should be significant for elevating plasma insulin and thus helped diabetic control in these STZ mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Remarkable pro-survival effect of htNSC<sup>PGHM</sup> islets in STZ model</title><p>As expected, STZ-administrated mice with the sham operation displayed weight loss and severe sickness such as hypothermia, hunched appearance and inertia leading to death in majority of these mice. In contrast, STZ mice with successful implantation of htNSC<sup>PGHM</sup> islets showed great resistance to all these sickness phenotypes. Because survival rate is an important indicator for the severity of fatal disease, we followed up a group of htNSC<sup>PGHM</sup>-treated mice for their survival over an 80 day duration. Our results showed that mouse survival rate remarkably increased by this treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). While the majority of death occurred within 40 days after STZ injection in the sham group, death was greatly avoided when htNSC<sup>PGHM</sup> islets were implanted. Improvement of general health by this treatment was also reflected by improved body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). For these mice over survival follow-up, we periodically measured blood glucose and insulin levels and examined if these metabolic profiles could be correlated with their survival. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, there was a lack of correlation between hyperglycemia and survival in sham STZ model, suggesting that death of STZ mice was not simply a result of hyperglycemia when blood glucose levels were very high. While the sphere-treated STZ mice had a moderate reduction in hyperglycemia (they were still diabetic) and a much greater improvement of survival, the correlation analysis revealed only a tendency of relationship between blood glucose and survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>), indicating that the limited benefit of blood glucose drop might not be most important for the improved survival of these mice.

Of course, the pancreatic islets have critical functions of secreting insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and several other peptides, and secretion of these hormones has often been investigated according to specific cell types in the islets. Similarities exist between the hypothalamus and pancreatic islets, for instance, the hypothalamus is the major site of insulin expression other than islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, suggesting that these organs have a particular relationship. In this study, we reported that htNSCs contain subpopulations that produce multiple secretory factors including a variety of pancreatic/gastrointestinal and hypothalamic peptides as well as miRNAs-containing exosomes. Although secretion of a particular peptide by htNSCs is much less strong compared to the committed mature cells such as endocrine neurons or pancreatic endocrine cells, multifaceted secretion of htNSCs represents a unique feature with potential wide-ranged functions which could be a biological basis for various applications. Using insulin promoter activity as a lead of selection, we established a subpopulation(s) of htNSCs and derived these cells into the spherical structure which contain combined features of hypothalamic neurospheres and pancreatic islets. We proved that the 3D spherical structure is critical for releasing multiple hormones including insulin, and in particular, the co-existence of somatostatin- and glucagon-positive cell subtypes is necessary to form and maintain these spheres. This finding could be suggestive to the research interest in attempt to generate functional β cells from stem cells, as spherical structure and heterogeneity of cell components seem to be important for this success.</p><p>Because our hypothalamic spheres impressively mimic the feature of pancreatic islets, we examined if they could provide a therapeutic effect against insulin-deficient diabetes. We successfully developed the approach of peripherally delivering these hypothalamic spheres in mice and applied them to an experimental model of STZ-induced fatal diabetes. Thus, when pancreatic islets were damaged in mice, we came up with a substitution through using hypothalamic islets. Surprisingly the treatment from this peripheral implantation led to dramatic improvements in general health and survival although the antidiabetic effect was moderate. We further revealed that this pro-survival benefit was dissociable from blood glucose control to a significant extent. Based on this observation, we suggest that diabetic management should require consideration over health-enhancing endocrine factors in addition to blood glucose control. Also, although the antidiabetic effect was relatively moderate in the experimental model of STZ-induced extreme diabetes, it is likely that this therapy could be more appreciable for etiological forms of diabetes which are generally much less severe. We further speculate that the antidiabetic effect of these cells might provide an explanation for the recently-appreciated central FGF treatment in leading to sustained diabetic remission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scarlett et al., 2016</xref>), given that htNSCs contain tanycytes which proliferate in response to FGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Robins et al., 2013</xref>), and indeed FGF was notably important for maintaining and growing the hypothalamic spheres in our study.</p><p>To summarize, a subpopulation(s) of multi-secretory htNSCs can be developed to generate 3D spheres with combined features of neurospheres and pancreatic islets, and when these hypothalamic islets are implanted peripherally, the treatment provides a wide range of benefits including the protection against mortality and diabetic symptom. In this context, we suggest that this therapeutic trial can be extended to other fatal health problems which might not necessarily be related to diabetes. Certainly there are many outstanding questions, for example, how this technology could be translated into human application, whether a practical source of cells such as iPS could be used for generating these spheres, and even if multifaceted secretion of this spherical model could be mimicked by an artificial system, all of which warrant future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA constructs and recombinant viruses</title><p>Plenti6.3TOV5DEST (Invitrogen) backbone was used to construct the dual Cre/Flp recombinase lentiviral reporter plasmid.

An Anymaze video-tracking system (Stoelting) equipped with a digital camera connected to a computer was used for the whole course of animal activities in training and experimental sessions of behavioral tests, including the following tests. (1) Grip test: Mouse was lifted by the tail and placed on a homemade square grid (1 cm mesh size), the grid was then inverted 30 cm over a soft pad, and the mouse was allowed to hang by paws for 2 to 10 min according to experimental conditions. The time that the mouse was able to hang was recorded during the test period. Three repeats were performed for each mouse with at least 10 min rest between each trial. (2) Rotarod: Mouse was trained on a rotarod (Columbus instruments) that was moving at a speed (4 to 6 r.p.m.) for a period of 1 to 2 min. After a 10 min rest, each mouse was given three trials, during which the rotarod started at 6 r.p.m. and accelerated by 2 to 3 r.p.m. per min until 10 min, and there was 30 min rest period between each trial. (3) Treadmill: Treadmill test was performed using a Treadmill Simplex II (Columbus Instruments), which has a capacity of exercising up to six mice simultaneously in individual lanes. Mouse was warmed up for protection against running injury and failure before experimental running. For acclimatization to the treadmill, mouse was placed on the treadmill running at a low speed (6–8 meter per min) for 2 to 5 min.

Since these 3D spheres were obtained through many different steps involving various vector expression and isolation, it is conceivable that there would be some random distributions in cell types expressing various peptides etc. From the available pictures, it appears that these 3D spheres are present in variable size. More thorough analysis on these 3D spheres to have a more complete picture on these 3D spheres as a whole is required.</p><p>2) There are inconsistencies in a lot of data presented. Figure 3E showed that STZ sham mice had 50% survival at day 40; however, in Figure 3C, data points at day 45 appears to be a few mice less than the starting point. The same is true for Figure 4A and 4C; and for Figure 5A and C.</p><p>3) Figure 4C showed that the STZ sham had a very low survival rate, most died with 6 days. If this is the case, how could the study be conducted? Also the survival rate is dramatically different from that shown in Figure 3E. These inconsistencies point to poor quality of the data presented.</p><p>4) Figure 1G showed that the 3D spheres had a 100 fold less capacity in releasing insulin compared to control islets. How can this low capacity in releasing insulin explain the significantly increase in insulin levels presented in Figure 3D?</p><p>5) Some key data presented were not adequately explained. For example, what is &quot;Disease activity index&quot; in Figure 5B? According to Figure 5C, close to 50% mice died after day 15, how the index remains stable from day 10 and beyond in Figure 5B? In Figure 6B, what is EAE &quot;clinical score&quot;? Again according to Figure 6K, 50% mice died at day 20 and beyond; however, the clinical score remained stable across that period. Is death an extreme mark of clinical score?</p><p>6) Data presented in Figures 5 and 6 are weak and superficial, lacking insights on underlying mechanism, and therefore are premature.</p><p>7) Given the perceived variation in 3D spheres, a detailed analysis in study subjects to correlate fasting glucose (Figure 3C), fasting insulin (Figure 3D) and animal survival (Figure 3E), if these studies used the same cohort of mice, would add more weights to the role of insulin secretion from 3D spheres in glucose and healthy state.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Multifaceted secretion of hypothalamic spheres provides pro-survival effects from peripheral implantation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>Both reviewers found that your revision addressed all major points and strengthened the conclusion of the study. You may wish to give some consideration to the one remaining point raised by the first reviewer prior to acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) This updated version has largely addressed the concerns raised in my previous review. Especially, new data were added to increase the level of confidence on the conclusion drawn about the effects on STZ-induced diabetic models, and new ways of data presentation have cleared the confusion in the previous version. However, the whole Supplementary Figure 7 should be eliminated as the evidence to support the beneficial effects in those two disease models is still lacking, and this Supplementary Figure 7 seems not to be logically relevant to the rest of the data presented. Importantly, the data and associated finding on the 3D spheres and effects on STZ-induced type 1 diabetes still remain significant without Figure 7.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52580.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While both reviewers agree that your findings are very interesting, reviewer 2 raises some important questions about reproducibility and the consistency and quality of some of the data that must be addressed.

While glucagon- and somatostatin-positive cells (known as α and δ cells) are distributed typically in the periphery of pancreatic islets (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-B), it was the case for somatostatin but not for glucagon in htNSC spheres (Figure 3A-B, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-B). Pancreatic islet biomarkers PC1/3, GLUT2, KIR6.2 and NKX2.2 were widely expressed in htNSC spheres (Figure 3A-B, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-B) in manners which were similar to pancreatic islets (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Unlike pancreatic islets which barely expressed NSC markers <italic>Sox2</italic> and nestin, both were strongly and universally expressed in htNSC spheres (Figure 3A-B, Figure 3—figure supplement 1–2). Regarding exosomes, we examined two exosomal biomarkers CD81 and TSG101, clearly showing that they were widely expressed in htNSC spheres but barely in pancreatic islets (Figure 4A-B). Altogether, all these data again indicate that these htNSC structures contained the mixed features of pancreatic islets and neurospheres.</p><p>Regarding neurosphere sizes, they are by nature variable (which is a general feature of these spheres). Since the reviewer mentioned this, we analyzed large-sized vs. small-sized spheres and in the same manner and presented large sizes in Figure 3A-B and small sizes in Figure 3— figure supplement 1A-B. These results confirmed that large and small spheres have the similar structure of cell subtypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There are inconsistencies in a lot of data presented. Figure 3E showed that STZ sham mice had 50% survival at day 40; however, in Figure 3C, data points at day 45 appears to be a few mice less than the starting point. The same is true for Figure 4A and 4C; and for Figure 5A and 5C.</p></disp-quote><p>Animal numbers between previous Figure 3C and 3E are indeed consistent (current Figure 5D and E). This misunderstanding was due to the overcrowded font of previous Figure 3C: because blood glucose levels of mice at the initial time points were very similar, as we plotted them according to the large scale of Y-axis, the dots of representing individual mice mostly overlapped. Now, we changed the font by using small-sized dots (currently Figure 5D) which helps although there are still overlapping points. To help solve this issue, we have now provided n number for each time point in its legend (Figure 5D) and also include these details in Author response table 1.

died with 6 days. If this is the case, how could the study be conducted? Also the survival rate is dramatically different from that shown in Figure 3E. These inconsistencies point to poor quality of the data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Most likely because the text font in X-axis of this figure was too small (apologize for this inconvenience), the reviewer misread this number. Our previous Figure 4C (current Figure 7C) shows that most mice died 60 days, not 6 days.

How can this low capacity in releasing insulin explain the significantly increase in insulin levels presented in Figure 3D?</p></disp-quote><p>This issue is due to our inadequate writing. Although 3D spheres were 100-fold less capable of releasing insulin compared to islets, we implanted 10<sup>7</sup> htNSC cells (which were around 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> spheres), while a mouse has only about 300 pancreatic islets. So the quantity advantage of spheres helped. We have now added this discussion in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Some key data presented were not adequately explained. For example, what is &quot;Disease activity index&quot; in Figure 5B? According to Figure 5C, close to 50% mice died after day 15, how the index remains stable from day 10 and beyond in Figure 5B? In Figure 6B, what is EAE &quot;clinical score&quot;? Again according to Figure 6K, 50% mice died at day 20 and beyond; however, the clinical score remained stable across that period. Is death an extreme mark of clinical score?</p></disp-quote><p>“Disease activity index” was based on surviving mice (currently moved to Figure 7—figure supplement 1C). This analysis has been well established in the literature (for example, PMID10759763), which cannot assess the involved physiological conditions of a dead mouse. Also, as well published, this pathological index is stable for a few weeks after the disease is established. “EAE clinical score” did include death as the worst score and we re-analyzed the data through adopting a published 0–6 scoring system which better reflects the contribution of death, as detailed in the Materials and methods (for example, PMID12023381). In our EAE without sphere treatment (current Figure 7—figure supplement 3B), this EAE clinical score peaked around Day 24 which agreed with the survival status (current Figure 7—figure supplement 3G), and afterwards these mice stopped to die while their health became improved and recovered, so our curve pattern agrees with these conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Data presented in Figures 5 and 6 are weak and superficial, lacking insights on underlying mechanism, and therefore are premature.</p></disp-quote><p>We did consider if we wanted to include these two unrelated disease models, but in the end, we think it should be helpful to include them, at least because they can provide additional information in the context of the interest in this paper. Given the reviewer’s comment, we agree that these two models probably should be presented as supplementary figures, and thus we have moved them to Figure 7—figure supplements 1-4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Given the perceived variation in 3D spheres, a detailed analysis in study subjects to correlate fasting glucose (Figure 3C), fasting insulin (Figure 3D) and animal survival (Figure 3E), if these studies used the same cohort of mice, would add more weights to the role of insulin secretion from 3D spheres in glucose and healthy state.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this insightful suggestion. Hence, we performed correlation analyses between blood glucose/insulin levels and survival in the STZ model. These analyses are shown in Figure 6C, D, E and F. As shown, there was a lack of correlation between hyperglycemia and survival in STZ model, suggesting that death was not simply a result of such hyperglycemia when blood glucose was high enough. The sphere-treated STZ mice had a modest reduction in hyperglycemia (they were still diabetic) and a much greater improvement of survival; our analysis revealed only a tendency of correlation between blood glucose and survival, indicating that this modest benefit of dropping blood glucose did not substantially contribute to the survival. In terms of blood inulin, there was also a lack of correlation between its level and the survival in STZ mice. In sphere-treated STZ mice, the correlation between insulin and survival just marginally become significant, suggesting that elevation in blood insulin can partially contribute to the improved survival of these diabetic mice.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Both reviewers found that your revision addressed all major points and strengthened the conclusion of the study. You may wish to give some consideration to the one remaining point raised by the first reviewer prior to acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) This updated version has largely addressed the concerns raised in my previous review. Especially, new data were added to increase the level of confidence on the conclusion drawn about the effects on STZ-induced diabetic models, and new ways of data presentation have cleared the confusion in the previous version. However, the whole Supplementary Figure 7 should be eliminated as the evidence to support the beneficial effects in those two disease models is still lacking, and this Supplementary Figure 7 seems not to be logically relevant to the rest of the data presented. Importantly, the data and associated finding on the 3D spheres and effects on STZ-induced type 1 diabetes still remain significant without Figure 7.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the reviewers for this suggestion. We thus have removed the whole Supplementary Figure 7, and accordingly removed/edited the relevant text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
