Action selection in the face of dynamic reward associations requires several cognitive processes: registering a change in value of the primary reinforcer, adjusting the value of secondary reinforcers to reflect the new value of the primary reinforcer, and guiding action selection to optimal choices. Flexible responding has been evaluated extensively using reinforcer devaluation tasks. Performance on this task relies upon amygdala, Areas 11 and 13 of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and mediodorsal thalamus (MD). Differential contributions of amygdala and Areas 11 and 13 of OFC to specific sub-processes have been established, but the role of MD in these sub-processes is unknown. Pharmacological inactivation of the macaque MD during specific phases of this task revealed that MD is required for reward valuation and action selection. This profile is unique, differing from both amygdala and subregions of the OFC.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37325.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most of us have experienced feeling full after a main course, only to discover that we somehow still have room for dessert. Eating a particular foodstuff to the point of satiety makes that item temporarily less appealing. This is an example of reward devaluation.

These include the amygdala, parts of the orbitofrontal cortex, and the mediodorsal thalamus. Wicker et al. have now explored the role of the mediodorsal thalamus by temporarily inactivating it in monkeys performing a task involving reward devaluation. The monkeys learned to associate one set of objects with peanuts and another with fruit. They were then given unlimited access to either peanuts or fruit. Finally, they were offered a choice between the two sets of objects. Like people who opt for dessert rather than another helping of a main course, the monkeys that had received peanuts chose the objects associated with fruit, and vice versa.</p><p>Temporarily inactivating the mediodorsal thalamus prevented this change in behavior. This occurred if the inactivation took place while the monkeys had unlimited access to the reward, or if it took place while they were choosing between the two objects. The mediodorsal thalamus is thus required both to update the value of a reward and to select the best course of action. This is in contrast to the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex, which each support only one of these processes.</p><p>Impaired behavioral flexibility is a hallmark of neuropsychiatric disorders, including addiction. Understanding the brain networks that support flexible responding may help improve the treatment of such disorders.

The ability to shift responses away from the previously valued action-outcome pair is a hallmark example of behavioral flexibility. Flexible responding (i.e., adapting behavior to reflect new reward contingencies or reward values) has been evaluated extensively through the use of reinforcer devaluation tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Málková et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hatfield et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>In these tasks, the value of secondary reinforcers or operanda (e.g., objects), and actions that were once favored decrease following an experimental reduction in the value of the associated primary reinforcer. Processes required for optimal performance in the reinforcer devaluation task include: [1] registering a change in value of the primary reinforcer, [2] integrating the new value of the primary reinforcer with the cognitive representation of the secondary reinforcers/operanda (e.g., objects that signal the reward), and [3] guiding action selection to target the now optimal choice.</p><p>In the standard version of this task used in macaques, animals are trained to associate sets of objects with one of two rewards (primary reinforcers; e.g., peanuts or fruit snacks). After the association between objects and particular rewards is established, subjects are presented with a forced choice between objects associated with each of the two foods. The proportion of choices between the objects rewarded with one type of food (e.g., peanuts) versus the other (e.g., fruit snacks) represents the baseline preference. An experimental reduction of reward value by selective satiation (i.e., providing one food to satiety) produces a devaluation effect, i.e., a decrease in the proportion of objects associated with the sated food that are selected.</p><p>These processes critically rely on an interactive network including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the amygdala, and the mediodorsal thalamus (MD). The amygdala projects directly to OFC, and indirectly to the OFC via the MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Timbie and Barbas, 2015</xref>). MD is reciprocally interconnected with two critical subregions of the OFC, Areas 11 and 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ray and Price, 1993</xref>). Lesions to each of these nodes impair the typical shift away from the objects that predict the sated food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Málková et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Izquierdo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Izquierdo and Murray, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pickens, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mitchell et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, crossed lesions of any two nodes of this circuit likewise impair performance. While lesions provide strong evidence that these brain regions are required for task performance, they do not have the temporal specificity needed to dissociate the contributions during discrete phases of task performance. By contrast, focal pharmacological manipulations, which can transiently suppress activity within a brain region, have revealed differential roles for the amygdala and the OFC in particular phases of this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wellman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">West et al., 2011</xref>). While neither the amygdala, nor the OFC are needed to register a change in value of the primary reinforcer, both structures play critical and differential roles in the subsequent processes. The amygdala is necessary for adjusting the object representations to reflect the new value of the primary reinforcer, but not necessary for optimal action selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wellman et al., 2005</xref>); a similar profile has also been observed for the OFC Area 13. By contrast, Area 11 is critical only for action selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Murray et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Because MD receives input from amygdala and is reciprocally connected with both Areas 11 and 13 of the OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Timbie and Barbas, 2015</xref>), it suggests that this structure may be central to the devaluation circuit. However, the role of the MD in specific phases of devaluation is unknown. Here, we considered two competing hypotheses regarding the role of the MD in this network: [1] it mirrors the function of the amygdala and Area 13 of the OFC, serving primarily as a ‘relay’ to process information regarding value updating between the amygdala, Area 11 and Area 13, and [2] it mirrors the function of Area 11 of the OFC, contributing primarily to action selection. To dissociate between these outcomes, we tested four adult male rhesus macaques on a reinforcer devaluation task while transiently inactivating the MD during various stages of the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Málková et al., 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Animals were first trained on a set of forty concurrent object discriminations; through repeated trials the animals learned the association between each object and a particular reward (see Materials and methods). Next, they were tested for preference on a baseline object probe test (baseline probe). In this test, two objects, each baited with one of the two foods, were pitted against each other. On another day, animals underwent selective satiation (pre-feeding with one of the two foods) and were again tested on an object probe test (sated probe), administered in a similar way as the baseline probe. This weekly sequence (baseline probe followed by sated probe) was repeated such that each food was sated for each experimental condition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for experimental timeline).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37325.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Weekly schedule of testing sessions.</title><p>Days 1–7 represent a sequence of daily behavioral training.

Thus, the objects were the cue used to guide action. We also tested animals in a ‘consummatory’ probe, in which they chose between two competing food rewards in the absence of objects; this served as a control to ensure successful devaluation of the primary reinforcer.</p><p>A shift in choices between the baseline and sated probe tests is reflected by a positive proportion shifted (see Materials and methods) and indicates successful devaluation. A value of 1 indicates a complete shift away from objects predicting the sated food, a value of 0 indicates no shift in preference. Thus, decreases in proportion shifted after experimental manipulations indicate impaired reinforcer devaluation.</p><p>On separate testing weeks, we microinjected the GABA<sc>a</sc> receptor agonist muscimol (MUS, 9 nmol), the glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (KYNA, 450 nmol), or saline into the MD, either prior to selective satiation or prior to the sated probe test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A1–4</xref>).

Similar studies have not been performed in primates, but these data are consistent with our prior observations of the duration of deficits following KYNA injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Forcelli et al., 2014</xref>). Based on the timing of our experiments (the probe session was conducted 45 min after drug infusion,~3 half-lives), less than 10% of drug is expected to remain during the probe session. However, to take a conservative approach, we selected the dose of 150 nmol to approximate two half-lives. The proportion shifted did not differ after injection of this lower dose of KYNA. These data support the timing of our experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and strongly suggest that KYNA infusion prior to satiation does not result in neuroactive levels of drug remaining by the time the probe test is initiated.

The only other primate study to employ inactivation methods in the reinforcer devaluation task used a different agent (THIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Murray et al., 2015</xref>) so we were unable to compare those data to experiments conducted using MUS. Moreover, all prior studies of the thalamus in the reinforcer devaluation task have used permanent lesions, rather than inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Izquierdo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Izquierdo and Murray, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Browning et al., 2015</xref>), and thus were not compared to the present study. Note that West and colleagues (2011) did not attempt to dissociate between the effects of inactivation of Area 11 and Area 13. Further, note that the Wellman study (2005) only found a deficit after injection before satiation, and not when MUS was injected prior to the probe. Thus, only data from the infusion before satiation condition are included. To compare across these studies, we normalized the proportion shifted after drug infusion to the proportion shifted after control infusions. Normalization was required, as the raw proportion shifted under saline conditions differed substantially across these studies. Proportion shifted values for drug-infused sessions were expressed as a percent of the value during the control session, thus, a value of 100% indicates no deficit. In all cases, a one-tailed, one sample T-test (against a test value of 100, i.e. no change from control) confirmed the presence of deficits compared to control conditions. [Wellman et al., Before Satiation: t = 3.8, df = 5, p=0.006; West et al., Before Satiation: t = 2.47, df = 3, p<italic>=</italic>0.045; Present Study, Before Satiation: t = 5.73, df = 3, p=0.005; West et al., Before Probe: t = 2.68, df = 3, p=0.0375; Present Study, Before Probe: t = 4.38, df = 3, p=0.011]. We next analyzed the normalized proportion shifted for the three studies when MUS was infused before satiation. Analysis of Variance did not reveal a significant treatment effect (F<sub>2,11</sub>=2.768, p=0.106), but consistent with visual observation of the data, there was a non-significant trend towards a difference between the effect in the present study and that reported in Wellman et al., p=0.084, Dunnett's test). We next compared the proportion shifted when MUS was infused prior to the probe test in West, et al., to that in the present study. Unpaired t-test showed that the magnitude of devaluation did not differ between these conditions (t=0.4691, df=6, <italic>p=</italic>0.6555). These data suggest that deficits caused by inactivation of any of these regions are similar in magnitude, although, in the case of infusion before satiation, there is a trend toward more severe deficits after inactivation of BLA. The symbols used for the present study follow the conventions in the other figures. Diamonds show individual animals for the other studies. In all cases, the deficits we observed fell within the range of deficits previously reported after inactivation of the BLA and OFC.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-37325-fig2-figsupp2-v2"/></fig></fig-group><p>Under baseline conditions, animals displayed a slight, but significant, preference for one type of reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This was evident in their choosing a larger proportion of objects predicting that reward (baseline preference ratio). This pattern is similar to what has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mitchell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">West et al., 2011</xref>). Under saline-infused condition, animals displayed robust devaluation following satiation; the devaluation effect was demonstrated by a shift away from choices of objects associated with the devalued food.</p><p>Microinjection of MUS either before satiation or before the sated probe test significantly disrupted the devaluation effect compared to sham/saline infusion; this was manifest as a decrease in the proportion shifted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This disruption was evident in all four subjects, resulting in a significant main effect of treatment (F<sub>1.1,3.4</sub>=13.3; p=0.029). Pairwise comparisons revealed a significant impairment in performance when MUS was infused either before satiation (p=0.032) or before the sated probe test (p=0.035). The magnitude of impairment did not differ between these conditions (p=0.13). In contrast to the object probe sessions, MUS injection failed to alter choices in the consummatory probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; F<sub>1.3,4.0</sub>=1.25; p=0.35). Because animals still displayed a typical shift away from sated primary reinforcers in the consummatory probe, the deficits seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> cannot be explained by impairment in satiety or valuation of primary reinforcers. Thus, the disruption in the devaluation effect was specific to adjusting the value of the objects to reflect the new value of the primary reinforcer (i.e., the sated food).</p><p>In prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Izquierdo and Murray, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mitchell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wellman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">West et al., 2011</xref>), it has been reported that after displacing objects and revealing a devalued food reward, monkeys will avoid consuming the devalued food. While we did not systematically record the consumption of food during the object probe tests, anecdotally, there were trials in which the animals did not eat the devalued food after displacing the object.</p><p>To determine if deficits in devaluation were secondary to impaired object recognition, we tested animals (on a separate test day) on the concurrent visual discrimination task following drug infusion. MUS injection was associated with a small, but significant impairment in concurrent visual discrimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; t = 4.09, df = 3, p=0.026). It is possible that this finding is due to a drug-related deficit in object recognition, reward associations, and/or appropriate action selection. Interestingly, this deficit also likely contributed to the significant decrease in baseline preference ratio (see Materials and methods) observed after MUS injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; t = 4.28, df = 3, p=0.023).

Thus, injection <italic>before</italic> satiation likely results in a suppression of the activity within MD both during satiation and the probe test. Because injections both before and after satiation disrupted devaluation, these data alone were unable to clarify what, if any, role the MD played during the period of selective satiation. To determine if the MD is required specifically during selective satiation, we next turned to microinjection of KYNA, which has a short duration of action (~30 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Forcelli et al., 2014</xref>) and short half-life within the brain (8–30 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Vécsei and Beal, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Turski and Schwarcz, 1988</xref>). Based on the timing of our experiments (the probe session was conducted 45 min after drug infusion,~3 half-lives), less than 10% of KYNA is expected to remain during the probe test. Thus, injection <italic>before</italic> satiation is expected to only disrupt activity during the period of satiation and not during the sated probe test. We confirmed, in two monkeys, that lower doses of KYNA infused immediately prior to the sated probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), did not impact performance. Thus the trace amounts of KYNA remaining when infused prior to satiation are unlikely to be sufficient to impact behavior during the probe test.</p><p>KYNA infusion either during satiation, or before the sated probe test, impaired the devaluation effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This pattern was evident in all three subjects, resulting in a significant main effect (F<sub>1.0,2.1</sub>=52.3; p=0.017) with both test conditions differing significantly from saline-infused control sessions (Infusion before satiation: p=0.021, Infusion before sated probe: p=0.021). Moreover, the impairment was of greater magnitude when KYNA was infused before the sated probe test (p=0.043).</p><p>Similar to MUS infusion, KYNA infusion did not disrupt performance in the consummatory task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; F<sub>1.1,2.1</sub>=1.11; p=0.40). In contrast to MUS infusion, KYNA infusion spared performance in concurrent visual discrimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>; identical values for all animals under all conditions precluded inferential statistical analysis across treatments). Similarly, KYNA infusion was without effect on baseline preference ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>; t = 0.277, d = 2, p=0.81). In conclusion, impaired devaluation, in the absence of other deficits, indicates that the MD is required both for adjusting the value of object representations and for appropriate action selection.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our present findings delineate the role of the MD in each of the cognitive processes needed for reinforcer devaluation. We conclude that: [1] Because the expected shift in primary reinforcer preference seen after satiation occurred under all experimental conditions, the MD is not necessary for registering a change in primary reinforcer value. This is consistent with prior studies in which the MD was lesioned. [2] Because inactivation of the MD during satiation impaired reinforcer devaluation, activity in the MD is necessary for adjusting the value of the objects to reflect the new value of primary reinforcers. This deficit is similar to that seen after inactivation of the amygdala or Area 13 of the OFC. [3] Because inactivation of the MD during the probe session (i.e., after satiation was completed) also impaired reinforcer devaluation, activity in the MD is required for appropriate action selection, a role also attributed to Area 11 of the OFC. Thus, we have demonstrated that the MD is required for both reward valuation and action selection; this represents a unique profile within the circuit supporting this behavior, differing from both the amygdala and subregions of the orbitofrontal cortex.</p><p>We found a dissociation between the effects of MUS and KYNA with respect to performance on concurrent visual discrimination. While in the case of MUS, at least a portion of the observed deficit in reinforcer devaluation may be due to impaired object discrimination, this is not so for KYNA. After KYNA infusion, concurrent visual discrimination performance was left intact, but deficits in reinforcer devaluation were still evident. In prior studies, large lesions to the MD resulted in deficits in visual recognition/concurrent visual discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gaffan and Parker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggleton and Mishkin, 1983</xref>) whereas lesions that damaged only the magnocellular portion of the MD (the region we targeted with our drug infusions), did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mitchell et al., 2007</xref>). Because of the differences in duration of action and timing of experimental manipulations, MUS likely spread to a larger area of the MD than did KYNA. While gadolinium is a reasonable proxy of drug spread, and prior functional data from our labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dybdal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Malkova et al., 2015</xref>) and others help to estimate the volume of drug spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Martin and Ghez, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Martin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2008</xref>), it is indeed a technical limitation of temporary pharmacological inactivation that we cannot directly document the spread of drug for each individual infusion. While speculative, broader inactivation of the MD with MUS may have caused the deficit in concurrent visual discrimination. The degree to which inactivation of the MD would impair performance in other tasks where lesions have produced deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Browning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakraborty et al., 2016</xref>) remains to be explored.</p><p>Inactivation of the MD during the probe test (KYNA infusion after satiation) resulted in a larger deficit than inactivation during satiation; we consider at least two explanations. [1] Amygdala neurons (necessary during satiation) project directly to the OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Timbie and Barbas, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Timbie and Barbas, 2014</xref>), and indirectly to the OFC via the MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Timbie and Barbas, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ray and Price, 1993</xref>). Thus, even in the absence of MD function, amygdalofrontal projections may partially support updating of the object values. [2] Because Areas 11 and 13 of the OFC support different components of this task, cross-talk between these regions may be critical. Both of these regions are reciprocally interconnected with the MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ray and Price, 1993</xref>), thus, the MD may modulate and facilitate transmission between these cortical regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> for a comparison across studies). Consistent with this notion, crossed lesions to the OFC and the MD impaired devaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Browning et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, recent studies in rodents have shown that optogenetic activation of the MD enhances cortico-cortical communication and improves performance on prefrontal cortex dependent tasks, whereas optogenetic silencing of the MD increases errors during prefrontal-dependent task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schmitt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolkan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our present findings, which provide novel temporal information regarding the role of MD in reinforcer devaluation, are in general agreement with prior studies. Lesions to the MD produced similar impairments to those that we observed. While the effect magnitude has varied slightly from study to study, the general pattern has been consistent. Given the similarity in the findings between lesion and pharmacological inactivation methodologies, neither compensatory circuit alterations after lesions, nor off-target effects after drug infusion are likely to account for the deficits observed. Thus, together, these data and those previously published underscore a critical role for processing within the MD in behavioral flexibility.</p><p>The present data delineate the role of the MD in each of the processes integral to reinforcer devaluation: [1] The MD is not necessary for registering a change in primary reinforcer value. [2] Activity in the MD is necessary for adjusting the value of the objects to reflect the new value of primary reinforcers. [3] The MD is required for appropriate action selection. Together, this pattern of deficits seen with inactivation of the MD is unique; unlike the amygdala, or individual subregions of OFC, the MD is required for multiple components of task performance. Rather than serving as a parallel pathway for information transfer between the amygdala and the OFC, these data instead suggest that the MD functions as a privileged and critical interface between other nodes of the devaluation circuitry.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Four adult, male, rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) were subjects in the present study.

The objects were placed over the food wells; the monkey could only see and retrieve the food by displacing an object. In each of the 40 object pairs, one object (S+) was baited with a food reinforcer and the other was unbaited (S−). Half of the S+ objects were baited with fruit snacks and the other half baited with peanuts, intermixed within a session. The S+ and S− assignment of the objects, the order of the object pairs, and the food reinforcer paired with particular objects remained constant across days; however, the left–right positions of the S+ object was pseudorandomized. The intertrial interval between the presentations of two consecutive pairs was 20 s. The monkeys were trained at a rate of one session per day, 5 d a week, until they reached criterion, which was set at a mean of 90% correct responses or better over five consecutive days (i.e., 180 or more correct responses of 200). During the course of this training animals learned, incidentally, the food-object association.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Probe sessions</title><p>Upon reaching criterion on the concurrent visual discrimination, the animals’ choices of objects were assessed in probe sessions, in which only baited objects (S+) were used. For each probe session, the 40 S+ objects were randomly assigned to create 20 pairs of probe trials, each offering a choice between an object baited with fruit snack and an object baited with peanut. The left-right position of the object-food pairs was randomized within a session and across days.</p><p>On each probe trial, the animal was allowed to select one of the two objects and retrieve the food reward. By repeating this for each of the 20 pairs of probe trials, this allowed for the assessment of baseline preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) for object-food pairs. Animals typically choose more objects baited with one type of food reward (e.g., Food 1) over those baited with the other type (e.g., Food 2).

Selective satiation sessions were conducted &gt;14 hr after the last feeding. During the satiation procedure, a food box attached to the monkey’s home cage was filled with one of the two food reinforcers (either food 1 or food 2) of a measured quantity. The monkey was allowed to eat the food for 15 min, at which point the experimenter re-entered the room and checked the amount of food eaten. If the monkey consumed all of the initially offered food, the experimenter gave the monkey more food. This was repeated until the animal did not take additional food over a five minute period. At that time, the remaining food was removed and measured. In all cases, 30 min was a sufficient time to complete this procedure. After selective satiation, animals were tested in the probe sessions as described above.</p><p>Typically-responding animals will shift behavior such that objects associated with the sated (devalued) food are rejected in favor of the objects associated with the non-sated (non-devalued) food. This results in a clear shift in the preference score toward the objects associated with the non-devalued food. Each object was presented only once during the probe session, so that the assessment was uncontaminated by new learning. Therefore, the rejection of an object associated with the sated food is an indication that the devaluation of the food was cognitively transferred to the object.</p><p>In a counterbalanced manner, this procedure was repeated for each of the two foods for each test condition.

The left-right positions of each reinforcer were pseudorandomized across the 20 trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Effect of drug infusion on baseline preference</title><p>Animals typically display a small, but significant preference for objects associated with one of the two food reinforcers.

For infusions performed before satiation, mixed effects analysis revealed no significant main effects of food type (F<sub>1,15</sub>=2.6, p=0.13) or treatment (F<sub>0.3,2.1</sub>=0.87, p=0.30) nor a food-by-treatment interaction (F<sub>1.9,14</sub>=0.34, p=0.71). Similarly, for either infusions performed before the probe test, no significant main effects of food type (F<sub>1,15</sub>=1.15, p=0.30) or treatment (F<sub>1.4,10.5</sub>=0.005, p=0.99) nor a food-by-treatment interaction (F<sub>0.3,2.4</sub>=0.07, p=0.52) were detected. Thus, differences in the degree of satiation across session types cannot contribute to the deficits we report. (B) Testing Order for Control Infusions. As described in the methods, to minimize penetrations of the brain, animals received one saline infusion and one sham infusion for each drug. Sham infusions were performed in the same manner as drug infusions except no cannula was inserted. A pair of tests, comprised of one sham infusion and one saline infusion, were performed for each drug (i.e., one pair was performed for MUS, one pair for KYNA). Each pair contained a manipulation performed before satiation and a manipulation performed before the probe session. Furthermore, each pair contained one control with each of the two foods. In the Table, SHAM indicates a sham infusion, SAL indicates a saline infusion. Boxes shaded blue are control infusions for MUS, while those shaded red are control infusions for KYNA. One animal (AN), received an additional control session for KYNA. Data across these two control sessions were summed for analysis. Since LO was not included in the KYNA experiments, this animal only received two control infusions (i.e., those for MUS). (C) Statistical Results for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom, Geoffrey Schoenbaum is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this experiment, the authors apply a standard version of a reinforcer devaluation used in primates to explore the role of MD thalamus. Monkeys were trained to discriminate a series of objects associated with two rewards, then they were given choices between objects after satiation on one of the foods. Critically food was delivered in the probe test. MD was inactivated by infusion of either muscimol or kynurenic acid prior to either the satiation or choice test. The authors report that inactivation at either time point, even by the shorter acting kynurenic acid, disrupted the normal effect of satiation on choice behavior. This was despite no effect on the devaluation of the food items and minimal or no effects on object discrimination and preference ratios. The authors conclude that MD is therefore necessary for both updating of the secondary reinforcers value as well as the use of that information to guide choices.</p><p>Overall the reviewers thought the study was excellent. The rationale was clearly presented, and the experiment was appropriate to address it. The authors did a great job of presenting the results in a clear and easy to understand manner. Generally, there were no major problems with the conclusions, which fit well with extant data, while extending it in potentially important ways.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There were only a few revisions judged to be essential. They are listed in the reviews but are emphasized here for clarity. One was to avoid the use of the term secondary reinforcer, since this is not formally shown. It was also felt that a deeper consideration of some caveats related to pharmacological inactivation in monkeys might be useful, and some additional discussion of the other data on the role of MD in the Discussion section.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this experiment, the authors apply a standard version of a reinforcer devaluation used in primates to explore the role of MD thalamus.

And I do not have major problems with their conclusions. It seems to me that they fit well with extant data, while extending it in potentially important ways.</p><p>I do have a couple of specific requests however.</p><p>1) Can the authors clarify that satiety affected consumption of the foods in the actual test? Since they were given, did the monkeys eat them? Was there any evidence that satiety affected this (actual consumption, latency?) when the monkeys did pick the object associated with the satiated food? And did the inactivation affect this?</p><p>2) Can the authors spend some additional time in the Discussion section on the prior studies? It seems to me that this is important, first since the effects here basically replicate that work and second, I think it mitigates concerns that acutely disrupting MD is having non-specific effects on these other areas. With acute inactivation, I would otherwise be concerned that shutting off such a huge source of inputs to OFC was having non-specific effects. That similar effects are obtained with lesions of MD (or crossed lesions) where compensation for this can occur I think bolsters the case that this is a specific effect – i.e. due to real processing in MD.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper interrogates the involvement of the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) in a test of goal-directed behavior, the reinforcer devaluation task, in rhesus monkeys. The authors use site-specific drug infusions targeted at the MD in order to test the relative involvement of this structure in adjusting the representation of the reinforcer after satiation, versus adapting choice behavior in response to the current value of the reward. These procedures have revealed different roles in choice behavior for amygdala and for subdivisions of orbital prefrontal cortex, but the MD has not been tested in this way. The authors find that MD is not necessary for satiation per se or adjusting behavior towards the rewards themselves but is involved both in updating the representation of the reward after satiation and for adjusting choice behavior based on the updated value of the reward (i.e., appropriate goal-directed behavior).</p><p>These are challenging experiments to carry out in monkeys and the findings provide new information about the involvement of the MD in this circuitry. Given the interest in neuromodulation of MD as a strategy for normalizing deficits in prefrontal function, these findings are an important piece of the puzzle of understanding how MD and prefrontal cortex interact in the service of behavior.</p><p>I find the characterization of the objects the monkeys are choosing as &quot;secondary reinforcers&quot; (Introduction, Results section and Discussion section) confusing. Although stimuli paired with reward may acquire reinforcing power, they need not do so. Indeed, the presence of devaluation effects in the object discrimination task implies that behavior is being guided by the representation of the reward rather than reinforcing power acquired by the objects themselves.</p><p>The authors might consider discussing some of the limitations of this technique, including precisely delineating the targeting and spread of the drug infusions. This is a challenge with all temporary inactivation methods. Some of the gadolinium infusions appear a bit laterally placed within the MD in Figure 2; the authors also speculate that the difference in findings on object discrimination and baseline choice between muscimol and kynurenic acid are due to differences in extent of diffusion and duration of action, but there is no direct investigation of this (although it would be very challenging to do so). The cleaner effects of the kynurenate infusions clearly support the authors' conclusions, so I have no problems with the inferences that are drawn, but I think the methodological limitations should be more explicitly addressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37325.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There were only a few revisions judged to be essential.
