nutrients. The human pathogen <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> grows in a glycogen-rich vacuole. How this large polymer accumulates there is unknown. We reveal that host glycogen stores shift to the vacuole through two pathways: bulk uptake from the cytoplasmic pool, and <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis. We provide evidence that bacterial glycogen metabolism enzymes are secreted into the vacuole lumen through type 3 secretion. Our data bring strong support to the following scenario: bacteria co-opt the host transporter SLC35D2 to import UDP-glucose into the vacuole, where it serves as substrate for <italic>de novo</italic> glycogen synthesis, through a remarkable adaptation of the bacterial glycogen synthase. Based on these findings we propose that parasitophorous vacuoles not only offer protection but also provide a microorganism-controlled metabolically active compartment essential for redirecting host resources to the pathogens.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12552.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12552.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12552.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> is the most common sexually transmitted bacteria that causes disease. Infections often do not produce any obvious symptoms, but can lead to infertility or other severe problems if left untreated. This microbe is also the leading cause of blindness by an infectious agent.The bacteria grow in the human body by infecting host cells. Inside these cells, the bacteria are found inside compartments known as inclusions, which protect them from the host’s defense responses and enable them to create a comfortable environment for themselves. However, this comes at a cost because the bacteria lose immediate access to the nutrients in the rest of the host cell. Thus, <italic>C.trachomatis</italic> has developed ways to import these nutrients into inclusions, and, more generally, to take the control of its interactions with the host cell.</p><p>The inclusions built up by <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> contain a high amount of glycogen, a carbohydrate that generally acts as an energy storage molecule. Although this observation was made many decades ago, the molecular mechanism by which such a large molecule accumulates in the inclusion has not been clarified. Gehre et al. have now used a variety of cell biology techniques to address this question.</p><p>The experiments show that there are two different pathways through which glycogen accumulates within the inclusion. Some glycogen is transported in bulk from the interior of the host cell into the inclusion. However, the bacteria also make new glycogen in the inclusion from a building block molecule called UDP-glucose. To do this, the bacteria recruit a host transport molecule to the membrane that surrounds the inclusion. This transport molecule brings UDP-glucose into the inclusion, where an enzyme called glycogen synthase – which is released by the bacteria – uses the UDP-glucose to make glycogen. The <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> glycogen synthase is unusual because most other bacteria can only make glycogen from another type of glucose.</p><p>By using both pathways, <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> is able to trap most of the glycogen stores of the infected cell within the inclusion so that they are inaccessible to the host but ready for the bacteria to use. Previous work has shown that <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> is much better at accumulating glycogen than other <italic>Chlamydia</italic> bacteria are. Therefore, a future challenge will be to find out exactly how this helps <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> survive inside human cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12552.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12552.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>chlamydia trachomatis</kwd><kwd>host-pathogen interactions</kwd><kwd>intracellular parasites</kwd><kwd>glycogen metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003762</institution-id><institution>Institut Pasteur</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gehre</surname><given-names>Lena</given-names></name><name><surname>Gorgette</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name><name><surname>Perrinet</surname><given-names>Stéphanie</given-names></name><name><surname>Prevost</surname><given-names>Marie-Christine</given-names></name><name><surname>Subtil</surname><given-names>Agathe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gehre</surname><given-names>Lena</given-names></name><name><surname>Ducatez</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name><name><surname>Ball</surname><given-names>Steven G</given-names></name><name><surname>Subtil</surname><given-names>Agathe</given-names></name><name><surname>Perrinet</surname><given-names>Stéphanie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Menage a trois ANR-12-BSV2-0009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gehre</surname><given-names>Lena</given-names></name><name><surname>Ducatez</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name><name><surname>Ball</surname><given-names>Steven G</given-names></name><name><surname>Subtil</surname><given-names>Agathe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NUChLEAR_282046</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gehre</surname><given-names>Lena</given-names></name><name><surname>Subtil</surname><given-names>Agathe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Expendo ANR-14-CE-0024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ducatez</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name><name><surname>Ball</surname><given-names>Steven G</given-names></name><name><surname>Subtil</surname><given-names>Agathe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The bacterium <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, a human pathogen, hijacks its host’s energy supplies by using the parasitophorous vacuole as a glycogen synthesis and storage compartment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many microorganisms develop inside eukaryotic cells, either free in the cytosol or enclosed in a vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Creasey and Isberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fredlund and Enninga, 2014</xref>). Each microorganism adapts its intracellular metabolism to the nutrient supply of the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abu Kwaik, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eisenreich et al., 2010</xref>). One recognized advantage of a vacuole is that it provides a shelter against cytosolic host defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar and Valdivia, 2009</xref>), to the cost of limited access to cytosolic nutrients. Acquisition of nutrients through this barrier is a crucial feature of host-microbe interaction.</p><p><italic>Chlamydiae</italic> are Gram-negative obligate intracellular bacteria found as symbionts and pathogens in a wide range of eukaryotes, including protists, invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horn, 2008</xref>). The developmental cycle of <italic>Chlamydiae</italic> involves two morphologically distinct forms. Infectious particles, called elementary bodies (EBs), are small and adapted to extracellular survival. After invasion of the host cell, they establish a parasitophorous vacuole called an inclusion, and convert within the first hours into larger organisms with higher metabolic activity, called reticulate bodies (RBs). RBs replicate several times within the inclusion, until they differentiate back into EBs, in a non synchronous manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AbdelRahman and Belland, 2005</xref>). The human adapted strain <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> is the leading cause of infectious blindness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>) as well as of sexually transmitted infections caused by bacteria. Infections of the urogenital mucosae often stay asymptomatic causing irreparable damage leading to ectopic pregnancies or tubal factor infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brunham and Rey-Ladino, 2005</xref>).</p><p>C. <italic>trachomatis</italic> displays a genome reduced to around one million base pairs and therefore highly relies on the host with regard to several essential metabolic pathways, such as nucleotide or amino acid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stephens et al., 1998</xref>). Lipid droplets and peroxisomes have been observed in the inclusion lumen, indicating that this compartment is able to engulf large particles to meet bacterial needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boncompain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>C. trachomatis,</italic> and the closely related mouse and hamster pathogen <italic>C. muridarum,</italic> are unique amongst <italic>Chlamydiae</italic> for their ability to accumulate glucose (Glc) under the form of glycogen in the inclusion lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordon and Quan, 1965</xref>). Glc deprivation leads to a complete loss of infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harper et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iliffe-Lee and McClarty, 2000</xref>). The <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> genome encodes for all the enzymes necessary for a functional glycogenesis and glycogenolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stephens et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Although they do not accumulate glycogen in the inclusion, other <italic>Chlamydia</italic> species also have a complete set of those enzymes, a surprising observation given that this pathway is absent in most intracellular bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henrissat et al., 2002</xref>). Intriguingly, pathogenic <italic>Chlamydiae</italic> lack a hexokinase, the enzyme phosphorylating Glc, and therefore rely on the import of phosphorylated sugars for glycolysis or glycogenesis. During bacterial glycogenesis, Glc-1-phosphate (Glc1P) serves as a substrate for the enzyme ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (GlgC) giving rise to ADP-Glc, which in turn is the building block for a linear chain of α1,4-linked Glc molecules. Branching of chains through α1,6-glucosidic bond is introduced by the branching enzyme GlgB, giving rise to glycogen. The glycogen phosphorylase GlgP, the debranching enzyme GlgX and the amylomaltase MalQ are involved in the degradation of the glycogen particle to Glc1P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colleoni et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seibold and Eikmanns, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, the very large majority of circulating <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> strains contain a 7.5 kb plasmid. Loss of this plasmid is associated with decreased GlgA expression and impaired glycogen accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12552.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Glycogen accumulation in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> inclusions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Glycogen metabolism in bacteria.

Large glycogen particles were detected in most non-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Twenty-four hours post infection (hpi), glycogen was still detected in the cytoplasm of some of the infected cells, and the inclusions only showed weak PAS staining. However, 48 hpi no glycogen particle was detected in the cytoplasm of infected cells, while inclusions heavily stained with PAS, indicating that the global increase in glycogen content is accompanied by a shift in its original cytosolic localization, in favor of the bacterial inclusion. We used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to determine more precisely its subcellular localization and detected the polysaccharide in two locations: in the inclusion lumen, and within EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Intraluminal glycogen deposits are physically larger than in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We did not observe glycogen in RBs, in contrast to an earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiappino et al., 1995</xref>). In that publication, the presence of glycogen in the inclusion lumen was interpreted as the result of glycogen release from lysed bacteria. Considering the abundance of glycogen in the inclusion lumen relative to its amount in bacteria we considered this hypothesis unlikely. We tested it by depriving the cells of Glc for 48 hr before infecting them. Under these conditions, the inclusions contained no glycogen 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Restoring Glc availability for 4 hr was sufficient to trigger the accumulation of glycogen in the inclusion lumen, but not in the bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This experiment demonstrates that glycogen in the inclusion lumen does not result from the release of bacterial stores. The kinetics of glycogen appearance in the inclusion was carefully examined next by TEM. Luminal glycogen first appeared between 16 and 20 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), and was abundant 24 hpi. Thus, luminal glycogen deposit took place at a time when RBs largely predominate over EBs. This observation suggests that, while glycogen accumulation in the inclusion is most obvious at later stages of infection, when EBs accumulate, the process is initiated by RBs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Part of luminal glycogen is translocated in bulk from the host cytoplasm</title><p>Our conclusion raised an obvious question: how could a large polymer appear in the inclusion lumen? Two mechanisms are conceivable: bulk translocation of host glycogen, or transport of monomeric substrates (such as nucleotide-sugars or hexose phosphates) across the inclusion membrane for <italic>de novo</italic> luminal polymerization. Gys1, the host glycogen synthase, produces linear chains of Glc and is tightly bound to glycogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luck, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stapleton et al., 2010</xref>). Gys1 staining with specific antibodies gave a patchy pattern in the cytoplasm, as expected since it mirrors the distribution of glycogen. In addition, we observed that the enzyme accumulated within the inclusion lumen. Staining was specific since it disappeared when Gys1 expression was knocked down using siRNA prior to infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Observation of cytoplasmic markers in the inclusion can result from post-fixation artifact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kokes and Valdivia, 2015</xref>). When we deprived the cells of Glc for two days before infection, and thus decreased cytoplasmic glycogen, Gys1 staining in the inclusion lumen was considerably reduced, while remaining abundant in the cytoplasm. This observation shows that Gys1 appearance in the inclusion lumen requires the presence of host glycogen, and is likely not the result of a post-fixation artifact. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement1</xref>). Altogether these data favored the scenario of bulk import of host glycogen and glycogen-bound Gys1 into the inclusion. TEM observations also came in support of this scenario, since we could observe one or more glycogen-filled vesicular structures in the inclusion lumen of about 20% of the glycogen-positive inclusions we examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Since in some cases several membranes were observed around luminal glycogen, we hypothesized that cytoplasmic glycogen might be entrapped by an autophagy-dependent process in the host cytoplasm, before delivery to the inclusion lumen. To test this hypothesis we used an <italic>Atg5-/-</italic> mutant mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line, which is deficient in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuma et al., 2004</xref>).

Cells were transfected with siRNA against Gys1 two days before infection. Silencing was efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and there was little glycogen left in the host cytoplasm at the time of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, top). However, knocking down Gys1 expression did not abolish glycogen accumulation in the inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, bottom). We measured the pixel intensity of the PAS staining in inclusions 48 hpi, and used inclusion staining of cells infected in the absence of Glc to determine the background level, which we subtracted. Inclusions of cells treated with siRNA against Gys1 contained 82% (s.e.m. 4.9) of the glycogen measured in cells treated with control siRNA. This experiment strongly suggested that bulk import of host glycogen was at least partially responsible for intraluminal glycogen accumulation. However, it did not appear to be the main contributor and indicated that <italic>de novo</italic> glycogen synthesis in the inclusion lumen also took place.</p><p>Synthesis of glycogen, and possibly its degradation into Glc monomers amenable to bacterial uptake, implies that glycogen synthesis and degradation enzymes are present in the inclusion lumen. While Gys1 import in the inclusion lumen might contribute, it cannot account for the glycogen accumulation observed in Gys1 depleted cells. We measured the expression profile of several proteins involved in glucose metabolism, together with control genes. For most proteins, RNA levels increased between 8 and 24 hpi, mirroring the known increase in bacterial metabolic activity in this time window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>glgA</italic> stood out, as its transcription was delayed until 16 hpi. <italic>glgA</italic> expression thus correlates very well with the timing of glycogen appearance in the inclusion lumen, between 16 and 20 hpi, implicating that the enzyme might be involved in luminal glycogen synthesis. Indeed, secretion of GlgA into the inclusion lumen, as well as into the host cytoplasm, has recently been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, a GlgB mutant strain shows massive precipitation of glycogen in the inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nguyen and Valdivia, 2012</xref>), due to accumulation of unbranched glycogen, implicating that GlgB normally functions in the inclusion lumen. These data strongly support the hypothesis that bacterial enzymes are at the origin of glycogen synthesis in the inclusion lumen. To determine if bacterial enzymes also take over glycogen depolymerization we obtained a specific antibody against the chlamydial debranching enzyme GlgX. We controlled the specificity of the staining by western blot and by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In cells infected for 24 hpi or 48 hpi, GlgX was found in the inclusion lumen, with mostly no overlap with bacteria, demonstrating secretion within the inclusion lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, GlgX was also detected on the inclusion membrane 24 hpi, but not 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Altogether, these data show that bacterial enzymes for glycogen synthesis and depolymerisation are present in the inclusion lumen, where they likely control glycogen polymerization/depolymerization.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12552.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Bacterial glycogen metabolism enzymes are secreted in the inclusion lumen.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HeLa cells were infected for 24 hr or 48 hr with GFP expressing L2 (GFP-Chlam, green) and stained with an anti-GlgX antibody (red) and Hoechst (blue).

We investigated what form of Glc the bacteria are able to take up by incubating purified EBs with radioactively labeled [C<sup>14</sup>]-Glc, [C<sup>14</sup>]-Glc1P or [C<sup>14</sup>]-Glc6P, in absence or presence of a 50-fold excess of non-radioactive Glc, Glc1P or Glc6P. Only [C<sup>14</sup>]-Glc6P was taken up by bacteria, and only Glc6P could compete it out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), demonstrating that the uptake was saturable, as expected for a transporter.

A sharp distinction between prokaryote and eukaryote glycogen synthases is that, almost without exception, bacterial glycogen synthases function on ADP-Glc while eukaryotic glycogen synthases use UDP-Glc as substrate. We reasoned that GlgA secretion into the host cytoplasm, which contains no ADP-Glc, might point to an unusual substrate specificity for this enzyme.

Briefly, serial dilutions of lysates of <italic>E. coli</italic> lacking their endogenous <italic>glgA</italic> and transformed with either <italic>E. coli glgA</italic> or <italic>C. trachomatis glgA</italic> were separated on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels that contained rabbit glycogen. The gels were subsequently incubated in buffer containing either UDP-Glc or ADP-Glc, and glycogen production was visualized by iodine staining. While <italic>E. coli</italic> GlgA showed activity exclusively upon incubation with ADP-Glc, as expected, the chlamydial GlgA showed activity with both substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>We next asked which Glc derivative might be translocated across the inclusion membrane for <italic>de novo</italic> glycogen synthesis. UDP-Glc stood as the best candidate: it is a substrate for GlgA, and its import would relieve the bacteria from the cost of nucleotide-sugar synthesis. In addition, GlgC (converting Glc1P into ADP-Glc) was the only glycogen metabolism enzyme that failed the <italic>Shigella</italic> T3S test, suggesting that this enzyme may not be present within the inclusion lumen. To test the requirement for UDP-Glc for luminal glycogen synthesis we silenced the expression of the host UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase UGP2 (UGP2 catalyzes the conversion of Glc1P into UDP-Glc) by siRNA for two days before infection. We measured the pixel intensity of the PAS staining in inclusions as described above. Glycogen accumulation within the inclusion lumen decreased to 57% (s.e.m. = 5.8) in cells treated with a siRNA against UGP2 compared to cells treated with control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). These data strongly argue for UDP-Glc being the substrate for sugar import into the inclusion. Note that while UGP2 silencing also impacted host glycogen stores, as expected, it did so to a lesser extent than Gys1 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus the greater impact of UGP2 silencing on luminal glycogen stores cannot be explained by its indirect effect on bulk glycogen import. Instead it very likely reflects the requirement for UDP-Glc for <italic>de novo</italic> luminal glycogen synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>C. <italic>trachomatis</italic> co-opts host transporter SLC35D2 to import UDP-Glc into the inclusion lumen</title><p>We have demonstrated that <italic>de novo</italic> glycogen synthesis takes place in the inclusion lumen, initiated by chlamydial glycogen synthase GlgA, using UDP-Glc as substrate. This implies that UDP-Glc is translocated from the host cytoplasm into the inclusion lumen. Among the large family of annotated human sugar transporters, only SLC35D2 was experimentally shown to be able to transport UDP-Glc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Suda et al., 2004</xref>). In cells infected with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, a construct of the transporter bearing a C-terminal HA-tag was enriched around the inclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). By TEM, we detected the presence of the transporter on the inclusion membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Staining was specific since we observed 0.96 gold particles per μm of inclusion membrane examined, against 0.12 gold particles per μm in non-transfected cells. The ability for SLC35D2 to reach the inclusion membrane indicates that it might play a role in UDP-Glc import. To test this hypothesis we silenced SLC35D2 expression using siRNA prior to infection. In these conditions, glycogen accumulation in the inclusion decreased to 43% (s.e.m. = 1.7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>), thus to a level similar to that when UGP2 had been silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). These data strongly suggest that <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> co-opts the host nucleotide-sugar transporter to favor UDP-Glc import into the inclusion lumen. Finally we wondered if by simultaneously impairing bulk glycogen import and UDP-Glc translocation we could further decrease luminal glycogen content. We depleted Gys1 and SLC35D2 for 48 hr before infecting the cells, and applied PAS staining 48 hr after infection. Additional Gys1 depletion did not decrease luminal glycogen content further than what SLC35D2 depletion did, confirming that in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infected cells bulk import of cytoplasmic glycogen plays only a minor part in intraluminal glycogen accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We measured the consequences on progeny 30 hpi to minimize the effect of SLC35D2 depletion on cell viability that we observed in some experiments. Decrease in progeny was never more than two-fold, indicating that even when both Gys1 and SLC35D2 were depleted simultaneously, there was no severe impact on bacterial development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12552.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>SLC35D2 imports UDP-Glc into the inclusion lumen.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Prior to infection cells were transfected with SLC35D2-HA, and fixed 24 hpi.

Most of the mutants obtained have a mutation in one of the enzymes for glycogen metabolism (Giebel et al, in preparation). We selected two clones, P2B10 and P3B4, which carry mutations in conserved residues of GlgA (H131Y for P2B10 and G386E for P3B4), suggesting that they may have a strong, if not complete, loss of function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Glycogen accumulation in P2B10 and P3B4 inclusions 48 hpi was reduced to 40 and 51% respectively of its level in the parental strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Impact on infectivity was assessed by collecting the bacteria 48 hpi, and re-infecting fresh HeLa cells. Progeny was reduced 7-fold and 3-fold in P2B10 and P3B4 respectively, demonstrating that a defect in GlgA results in an impaired infectivity in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). However, it is impossible to discriminate if the deficiency is related to the defect in luminal storage of glycogen, or in glycogen synthesis in the bacteria, or both. We hypothesized that import of host Gys1 may partially compensate for the deficiency in secreted GlgA. In that case, depletion of Gys1 might affect luminal glycogen stores, and possibly decrease infectivity even further. In the parental strain, depletion of Gys1 reduced glycogen accumulation by 29%, similar to <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In the mutants, depletion of Gys1 also decreased glycogen accumulation, demonstrating that part of the residual glycogen observed in the mutants is due to bulk glycogen import. The fact that glycogen stores were not fully depleted suggests that the mutants we selected show reduced GlgA activity rather than complete loss of function. Interestingly, decreasing luminal glycogen further by silencing Gys1 expression content did not have a higher impact on the progeny of the mutants than it had on the parental strain, rather less so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In particular, Gys1 depletion did not decrease progeny of the P2B10 mutant. This observation suggests that in this mutant, the defect in progeny is mostly due to a deficiency in bacterial glycogen synthesis rather than in luminal glycogen storage.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12552.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Mutations in GlgA result in defect in glycogen storage capacity and loss of infectivity.</title><p>Cells were treated with either siRNA control or siRNA against Gys1 48 hr and 4 hr prior to infection with <italic>glgA</italic> mutants P2B10, P3B4 or with the parental wild-type strain.

SLC35D2, and possibly other transporters, are recruited to the inclusion membrane and UDP-Glc is translocated into the inclusion lumen. The activity of chlamydial glycogen metabolism enzymes, secreted by RBs into the inclusion lumen, leads to the onset of luminal glycogen synthesis between 16 and 20 hpi. In addition, host glycogen is imported into the inclusion lumen through invagination of the inclusion membrane. In culture cells <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis predominates over bulk glycogen import. Later on (right), RBs start converting into EBs, which rely on Glc6P as energy source. EBs obtain Glc6P via the degradation of luminal glycogen into Glc1P, subsequently converted to Glc6P by the phosphoglucomutase (MrsA) and imported by UhpC. During RB to EB conversion T3S is turned off, allowing for intrabacterial activity of the glycogen metabolism enzymes, and glycogen accumulation in the bacteria.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12552.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12552.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-12552-fig8-v2"/></fig></p><p>Intraluminal glycogen accumulation had previously been thought to be due to bacterial lysis and to the release of chlamydial glycogen into the surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiappino et al., 1995</xref>). In the present work we observed that glycogen appears first in the inclusion lumen and only later in EBs. Thus, bacterial lysis is not the source of luminal glycogen.</p><p>We identified two mechanisms by which glycogen accumulates in the inclusion lumen. First, the host enzyme Gys1, which is known to bind to glycogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roach et al., 2012</xref>), is translocated into the vacuole, arguing for uptake of host glycogen in bulk. The observation of glycogen-filled vesicles in the inclusion lumen also strongly argues for this scenario. Finally, depleting cytoplasmic glycogen by silencing Gys1 partially reduced luminal glycogen content in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> and <italic>C. muridarum</italic>. Translocation of cytoplasmic glycogen confirms the ability for the inclusion to take up large particles from the host cytoplasm, already illustrated with the uptake of lipid droplets and peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boncompain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2006</xref>). This likely occurs through invagination of the inclusion membrane, but the underlying mechanisms remains to be investigated. While multi-layered glycogen-filled vesicles were observed, they still occurred in Atg5 deficient cells, implicating that they do not originate from an Atg5-dependent autophagic process.</p><p>The observation that depletion of host glycogen (through silencing of the host glycogen synthase Gys1) reduces luminal glycogen stores by no more than 20% demonstrates that bulk uptake is a minor pathway for glycogen accumulation in the inclusion lumen. It remains to be determined if this bulk import through a vesicular mechanism is glycogen-specific, or a general pathway used for the acquisition of a wide range of host components. We identified the second, and main, mechanism for luminal glycogen accumulation as <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis, through the action of chlamydial enzymes. Using a heterologous secretion assay, we have identified T3S signals in all but one (GlgC) glycogen metabolism enzymes of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>. We had previously demonstrated the robustness of this assay, with an estimated 5% of false positives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Subtil et al., 2005</xref>). Secretion of GlgA in the inclusion lumen and in the host cytoplasm was reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2013</xref>). GlgA mutants of <italic>C. muridarum</italic> accumulated less glycogen in the inclusion lumen than their parental strain, demonstrating further that GlgA was indeed present and active in the inclusion lumen. Evidence for the secretion of the branching enzyme GlgB was brought by the observation that a GlgB mutant strain shows precipitation of unbranched glycogen in the inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nguyen and Valdivia, 2012</xref>). Finally in this paper, we show the secretion of GlgX using specific antibodies. Secretion of GlgX, and of other enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism (except GlgA), was not detected by an earlier study using mouse antisera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2013</xref>). This study focused primarily on the detection of bacterial proteins in the host cytoplasm. Detection of the intraluminal pool, not overlapping with bacteria, might have been hindered by the signal coming from the pool of intra-bacterial enzymes. Finally, GlgX localizes not only to the inclusion lumen, but seems to be enriched at the inclusion membrane at 24 hpi. Interestingly, GlgP localization at the inclusion membrane was also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saka et al., 2011</xref>), indicating that the two enzymes might work in concert, degrading host glycogen in the vicinity of the inclusion membrane. Thus, altogether these data indicate that <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> uses T3S to transform the lumen of the inclusion into a glycogen storage compartment.</p><p>So far, T3S is mostly described as a mechanism for protein translocation across a eukaryotic membrane, either the plasma membrane or the membrane of a parasitophorous vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galan et al., 2014</xref>). The ability for chlamydial glycogen enzymes to reach the inclusion lumen is intriguing. Loose membrane-like structures can frequently be seen in the inclusion lumen, and might trigger the secretion of some effectors into the inclusion lumen, especially from bacteria not in contact with the inclusion membrane. Also, it has been demonstrated, in <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis,</italic> that T3S substrates can translocate first on the surface of the bacteria, without previous membrane contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akopyan et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, it may be that glycogen enzymes are first translocated into the cytoplasm, and transported back to the inclusion lumen directly or indirectly associated to glycogen, like Gys1. Clearly, more work is needed to understand how T3S is regulated in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, and what determines substrate translocation across the inclusion membrane.</p><p>Our transcription analysis, in agreement with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belland et al., 2003</xref>), indicates that <italic>glgA</italic> transcription most likely controls the onset of glycogen synthesis, as its initiation coincides with the onset of intraluminal glycogen accumulation (between 16 and 20 hpi). For all the other glycogen enzymes, transcription correlated with the known increase in bacterial metabolic activity between 8 and 24 hpi. The only other exception is <italic>glgB</italic>, which is one of the few early genes. It is not clear at this stage why the protein is made long before GlgA is present, when GlgA lies upstream of GlgB in the glycogen synthesis pathway. <italic>glgB</italic> is not in an operon, and its promoter region lies within a coding sequence, limiting the possibility of mutations in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albrecht et al., 2011</xref>). Early expression of <italic>glgB</italic> might thus be a remnant of a different regulation of expression of the glycogen metabolism enzymes during the evolution of Chlamydiales.</p><p>To test the need for bacterial glycogen synthase activity in vitro we obtained two independent mutants in conserved residues of GlgA. Because of the mutagenesis strategy used, the mutants carried additional mutations (the library has an average of 16 mutations/genome). However, their similar phenotypes in respect to glycogen storage and infectivity strongly support the hypothesis that those are due to the GlgA mutation and not to additional genetic defects. These mutants demonstrated that defects in GlgA activity result in a loss of infectivity in vitro. We have not yet been able to obtain a stable strain knocked-out for <italic>glgA</italic> expression, but this might be due to technical difficulties rather than essentiality of the gene, and the question as to whether glycogen synthesis is required for chlamydial development remains open.</p><p>The very few <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> isolates that do not have the plasmid accumulate only minor amounts of glycogen compared to the wild-type strain, and GlgA expression is strongly reduced in these strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>). When we ectopically expressed Flag-GlgA in cells infected with either the wild-type or the plasmid-less strain, we observed increased intraluminal glycogen accumulation for both strains. These data show that different levels of GlgA expression between the two strains account for their difference in terms of glycogen accumulation. When Flag-GlgA import into the inclusion took place, likely together with bulk glycogen uptake, the low level of endogenous GlgA in the plasmid-less inclusions was complemented, allowing for high glycogen accumulation. Presumably, in the plasmid-less strain, bulk import of host glycogen occurs normally, but remains below detection. The fact that this strain has no infectivity defect in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>) indicates that high luminal glycogen accumulation is not needed for chlamydial growth in vitro. Still, the observation that Gys1 depletion decreased progeny by about 30% in the wild-type <italic>C. muridarum</italic> strain suggests that bacterial development is somewhat sensitive to the amount of glycogen in the inclusion lumen, maybe at early times of infection, before <italic>glgA</italic> is highly expressed and glycogen accumulation peaks. Alternatively, disruption of the glycogen storage capacity in the host might have indirect effects on nutrient balance, and account for the small decrease in infectivity.</p><p>In vitro polymerization assays using <italic>E. coli</italic> expressing <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> GlgA, as well as transfection experiments in a eukaryotic background where only UDP-Glc is available, proved that <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> GlgA can use UDP-Glc as substrate. This was unexpected, because eubacterial glycogen synthases normally use ADP-Glc. Consistent with this finding, we observed a strong decrease in intraluminal glycogen accumulation when we knocked down the human enzyme responsible for the generation of UDP-Glc (UGP2). Decrease of host glycogen levels (and thus the reduction in the bulk import pathway) could not account for this result, as the Gys1 knockdown was a lot more efficient in depleting glycogen in the host cytoplasm than the UGP2 knockdown. This experiment points to UDP-Glc as being the substrate imported into the inclusion lumen. If, as we had initially hypothesized, Glc6P or Glc1P were that substrate, a UGP2 knockdown should not produce any difference in intraluminal glycogen accumulation because both Glc6P and Glc1P would remain available, as they lie upstream of UDP-Glc generation. Energetically speaking, it is beneficial to import UDP-Glc rather than Glc6P or Glc1P, as it relieves the bacteria from the costly reaction of transferring a nucleotide to the sugar molecule. It also fits perfectly with the absence of a T3S signal in GlgC, suggesting that this enzyme, which makes ADP-Glc out of Glc1P, remains restricted to the bacteria and only serves bacterial glycogen production. Secretion of GlgC into the inclusion lumen would be superfluous, with GlgA being able to produce unbranched glycogen out of UDP-Glc.</p><p>The identification of UDP-Glc as the sugar imported into the inclusion lumen was further comforted by our observation that knocking down the UDP-Glc transporter SLC35D2 led to a significant reduction of intraluminal glycogen staining. In addition, we observed that SLC35D2-HA accumulates at the periphery of the inclusion. Our data thus strongly indicate that SLC35D2 is at least partially responsible for the import of UDP-Glc. The fact that the reduction was only partial, and slightly less pronounced than after UGP2 silencing, might be due to residual SLC35D2 expression. In addition, other Golgi- or ER-based transporters from the SLC35-family of nucleotide-sugar transporters might transport UDP-Glc and be recruited to the inclusion membrane, accounting for the residual glycogen accumulation in the SLC35D2 knockdown.</p><p>We demonstrated that <italic>de novo</italic> glycogen synthesis takes place in the inclusion lumen, triggered by the presence of GlgA and GlgB. Glycogen storage in the inclusion lumen would only be of benefit for the bacteria if they were subsequently degraded into monomers amenable to bacterial uptake. The early observation that glycogen decreases at very late infection times, is consistent with a late consumption of the stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordon and Quan, 1965</xref>). Similarly to the glycogen synthesizing enzymes, the degrading enzymes GlgP, GlgX and MalQ possess T3S signals, and we demonstrated GlgX secretion using specific antibodies. We therefore hypothesize that these enzymes are active in the inclusion lumen, and generate free Glc1P. We could clearly demonstrate that <italic>Chlamydiae</italic> are not able to take up Glc nor Glc1P, but exclusively Glc6P. This is in agreement with data obtained on the homologous protein in <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic>, which transports Glc6P and not Glc1P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schwoppe et al., 2002</xref>). This apparent contradiction can be explained by the fact that the chlamydial phosphoglucomutase MrsA (interconverting Glc1P and Glc6P) also possesses a T3S signal, and is thus most likely secreted. We have attempted to demonstrate MrsA secretion using newly developed tools to transform <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). The C-terminal tagged MrsA was not expressed in transformed bacteria, neither with the endogenous promoter nor with a tetracyclin-inducible promoter (not shown). Thus, while we propose that intraluminal glycogen is degraded into Glc1P and is converted to Glc6P in the inclusion lumen, the involvement of bacterial MrsA in this conversion remains to be confirmed.</p><p>Altogether, our work reveals the origin of glycogen in the inclusion lumen and brings to light the complexity of the Glc flux in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, see legend for details). At a first glance, this complexity seems counter intuitive: why not import Glc6P directly from the host cell cytoplasm into the inclusion lumen and then directly into the bacteria? UDP-Glc import is initiated very early on, at a time when most bacteria are RBs, which, importantly, use ATP as an energy source, while EBs use Glc6P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Omsland et al., 2012</xref>). Uptake of Glc6P, before EBs appear, would dangerously increase the osmotic pressure in the inclusion. Stocking Glc in the shape of the osmotically inert glycogen brings an elegant solution. Why do <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, amongst all the <italic>Chlamydia</italic> species, accumulate these high amounts of glycogen within their parasitophorous vacuole? Clearly, as discussed earlier, glycogen accumulation is not necessary for growth in vitro. Plasmid-less strains, that do not accumulate glycogen, were highly attenuated in a genital model of mouse infection and in ocular infection of non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Russell et al., 2011</xref>). To date it is not known whether the lack of glycogen accumulation plays a role in this reduction in infectivity, or other traits associated with the absence of plasmid. Surprisingly, it was recently shown that the plasmid-less strain induced similar level of infection and pathologies as the wild-type strain in a model of genital infection in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qu et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, while, the ability for virtually all <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> clinical isolates to accumulate glycogen speaks for a selective advantage of doing so, we can only speculate on what this advantage might be. Many bacterial strains of the microflora of the female genital tract metabolize Glc as carbon source. Whether Glc can become limiting, especially during bacterial vaginosis, where the risk of becoming infected with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> is elevated, is not known. It is an attractive hypothesis to explain why the ability for <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> to store Glc could come to an advantage in such specific conditions, which the macaque model would not reveal. One independent advantage of re-routing the host energy stores towards the inclusion lumen is that it might overall 'weaken' the host cell in its fight against the intruder. Indeed, many autonomous host cell defense mechanism rely on processes that require energy (including host protein synthesis or phosphorylation cascades) and that might be compromised in cells enduring sustained hijacking of its energy stores.</p><p>This work demonstrates that a microbe can deplete the host from its energy stores, making them available only to themselves. We propose that such sequestration of host molecular complexes, or even organelles, inside the parasitophorous vacuole, could be broadly used by other intracellular parasites, to ensure nutrient access and/or to disrupt defensive signalling pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and bacteria</title><p>HeLa cells (ATCC), wild-type and <italic>Atg5</italic>-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) (generous gift from N.

They determined two parallel sources, which are differentiated by the timing of their requirement relative to the infectious cycle. At early stages of development, bulk import predominates, whilst later in infection with increasing differentiation to elementary bodies, de novo glycogen synthesis mediated by bacterial enzymes takes over. By defining the source the sugar species utilized – the translocation of the relevant enzymes by type III secretion – the report makes a significant contribution to chlamydial biology, and possibly pathogenesis in regards to nutritional immunity.</p><p>The present study is important as it highlights several unique and unappreciated phenomena:</p><p>1) Transport of a host biosynthetic enzyme into the inclusion.</p><p>2) de novo synthesis of glycogen in the inclusion through the secretion of bacterial biosynthetic enzymes.</p><p>3) Adaptation of a bacterial enzyme (GlgA) to use host-derived substrates (UDP glucose) for the synthesis of glycogen.</p><p>4) Recruitment of a host UDP glucose transporter to the inclusion and evidence that this transport activity is required for glycogen synthesis in the vacuole.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>If glycogen is an important source of glucose6P, which the authors assume is being generated by the bacterial MrsA from glucose1P, then one would expect a phenotype for the resulting EBs.

As it stands the study does not make full use of available technologies to move beyond correlation to causation, which are now feasible in Chlamydia. Mutants defective in glg genes are available – or can be generated readily by group II mediated retro-insertion (e.g. Targetron) to formally test the role of glycogen in Chlamydia growth and infectivity and glucose6p acquisition by EBs.</italic></p><p>The suggestion to use available technologies to generate mutants on some of the key enzymes of glycogen metabolism, and use those to “formally test the role of glycogen in Chlamydia growth and infectivity and glucose6p acquisition by EBs”, is at first thought quite attractive. However, obtaining such mutants is still notoriously laborious and could take several months, well in excess of the couple of months required for the revision procedure.</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewers that by using mutants we could ask whether a defect in bacterial glycogen synthase activity has any effect on infectivity. To respond as fast as possible to the reviewers’ concerns, we established a collaboration with David Nelson (Indiana, USA) who had obtained GlgA mutants in <italic>C. muridarum</italic> (unpublished). The two GlgA mutants we tested accumulated less glycogen in the inclusion lumen than their parental strain, bringing further evidence that GlgA was indeed active in the inclusion lumen. The mutants also showed a defect in infectivity in vitro(3 and 7-fold respectively), bringing the finale evidence that the capacity for <italic>Chlamydia</italic> to metabolise glucose into glycogen is important for the completion of their developmental cycle.</p><p>In addition, we addressed the effect of Gys1 depletion on <italic>C. muridarum</italic>, and on the GlgA mutants. For a comparison, these experiments were done in parallel with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infections, and thereby we obtained sufficient data for <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> to detect a small but significant 20% decrease in luminal glycogen stores when Gys 1 was depleted (and 30% decrease in <italic>C. muridarum</italic>). This result brings further support to the “bulk” import pathway and the manuscript has been slightly modified accordingly (in the initial submission our dataset was too small to make the 20% decrease significant).</p><p>All the results obtained with the GlgA mutants were included at the end of the Results section, and are shown in a novel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. The question as to whether GlgA is absolutely required for bacterial development, and the effect of the <italic>glgA</italic> mutations in an in vivo model of infection, will be addressed in a separate report (Giebel et al. in preparation).</p><p>We acknowledge the interest of investigating mutants affecting those enzymes that are part glycogen of metabolism per se (<italic>glgA, glgB, glgP, glgX, malQ, glgP</italic>) and have responded to the suggestion by investigating defects in the genes encoding the major player of our story: GlgA. However, it is not clear to us what could be concluded from looking at a mutant in the phosphoglucomutase activity (MrsA). Indeed, phosphoglucomutase activity is implicated in all biochemical steps that require Glc1P, since <italic>Chlamydiaceae</italic> lack a hexokinase and only import Glc6P. This will include synthesis of intrabacterial glycogen (G1P is the substrate of GlgC, MrsA activity in the bacteria is needed to make bacterial glycogen out of imported G6P, independently of its potential role in the inclusion lumen). It might also include synthesis of chlamydial lipooligosaccharide. Indeed, phosphoglucomutase activity is needed for LPS synthesis in a bacterial symbiont of plants (Lepeck Molecular Plant Microbe Interactions 2002 15 368). If this holds true in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, we can expect a very strong phenotype on progeny since LPS is required for RB to EB conversion (Nguyen PNAS 2011). Thus, pleiotropic effects of <italic>mrsA</italic> disruption would likely preclude testing our hypothesis that MrsA is involved in G1P to G6P conversion in the lumen of the inclusion. Although we agree that sophisticated schemes of complementation of a putative MrsA mutant could be attempted to test our hypothesis, we believe that obtaining mutants, and testing complementation experiments, need to be left to a follow-up study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
