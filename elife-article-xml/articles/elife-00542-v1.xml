These proteins, through inhibition of eIF4E and eIF4A, respectively, impair cap-dependent translation. Under stress conditions FOXO transcription factors activate 4E-BP expression amplifying the repression. Here we show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> FOXO binds the PDCD4 promoter and stimulates the transcription of PDCD4 in response to stress. We have shown previously that the 5′ UTR of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like receptor (dINR) supports cap-independent translation that is resistant to 4E-BP. Using hippuristanol, an eIF4A inhibitor, we find that translation of dINR UTR containing transcripts are also resistant to eIF4A inhibition. In addition, the murine insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptor 5′ UTRs support cap-independent translation and have a similar resistance to hippuristanol. This resistance to inhibition of eIF4E and eIF4A indicates a conserved strategy to allow translation of growth factor receptors under stress conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00542.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00542.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00542.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Protein synthesis in eukaryotes occurs in two stages: transcription of DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA) in the nucleus, and then translation of that mRNA into a protein by ribosomes in the cytoplasm. These processes are regulated by a complex network of signaling pathways that enables cells to tailor protein synthesis to match current conditions. This involves regulating the expression of the genes that code for these proteins.</p><p>When cells experience stressful events, such as a shortage of oxygen or nutrients, they reduce the synthesis of most proteins. This response is regulated, in part, by a signaling pathway known as the insulin and insulin-like receptor pathway. In particular, stressful events inhibit a protein complex called eIF4F, which normally initiates the translation of mRNA molecules by binding to a structure on one end of the mRNA called the 5′ cap. Despite this general inhibition, the production of certain other proteins—including the insulin receptor itself—is actually increased in response to stress.</p><p>Olson et al. have carried out a series of experiments to explore how inhibition of the eIF4F protein complex influences the translation of the mRNA for the insulin receptor. The eIF4F complex is made up of three proteins, including one that binds to the 5′ cap and a helicase that unwinds the RNA. Previous work in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> showed that translation of this mRNA can continue even if formation of the eIF4F complex is inhibited by targeting the cap binding protein. Olsen et al. now show that translation of this mRNA is also independent of the helicase. Instead, translation is maintained under these conditions because the insulin receptor mRNA contains a sequence called an internal ribosome entry site, which allows ribosomes to bind to the mRNA without the influence of the 5′ cap.</p><p>Olson et al. reveal the details of this regulatory pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and show that similar mechanisms are at work in mammalian cells, suggesting this pathway represents a crucial regulatory process that has been conserved during evolution. A key question for future research is whether other genes within the insulin and insulin-receptor like signaling pathway use this same trick to evade translational inhibitors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00542.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00542.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Foxo</kwd><kwd>IRES</kwd><kwd>Insulin receptor</kwd><kwd>PDCD4</kwd><kwd>eIF4A</kwd><kwd>IGFR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ellison Medical Foundation New Scholar in Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG-NS-0535-09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marr</surname><given-names>Michael T</given-names><suffix>II</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Utilizing a conserved mechanism, a ribosome can initiate translation from a site within the insulin receptor mRNA to maintain protein synthesis even when standard mechanisms of initiating translation have been inhibited by stress.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During times of stress the cell changes its gene expression profile to better manage the cause of the stress. Coordinate changes in both transcription and translation occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sengupta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spriggs et al., 2010</xref>). A central pathway that responds to stress stimuli by controlling both protein and RNA synthesis is the insulin and insulin-like receptor-signaling (IIS) pathway. The fundamental molecular architecture of the IIS pathway is conserved from flies to man (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oldham, 2011</xref>). When IIS signaling is high, the protein kinase AKT is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ruggero and Sonenberg, 2005</xref>). AKT directly phosphorylates the Foxo family of transcription factors and consequently prevents activated transcription of Foxo target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brunet et al., 1999</xref>). AKT also stimulates the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zoncu et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00542.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Simplified insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling diagram.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) When Insulin receptor or Insulin-like growth factor receptor is active signaling through AKT inhibits Foxo transcription factors and activates mTOR. mTOR in turn inhibits 4E-BP and activates S6K.

The eIF4F complex consists of eIF4E, the 7-methyl-Guanosine-cap (m7G) binding protein, eIF4A, an RNA helicase, and eIF4G, a large scaffolding protein. In addition, the RNA binding protein eIF4B can associate with eIF4F to stimulate the helicase activity of eIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ma and Blenis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zoncu et al., 2011</xref>). mTOR stimulates general translation in part by inactivating translational inhibitors. mTOR phosphorylates and inactivates the translation repressor eIF4E binding protein (4E-BP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gingras et al., 1999</xref>) allowing efficient formation of the eIF4F complex. In addition, mTOR activates ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sarbassov et al., 2005</xref>). S6K stimulates the helicase eIF4A by activating eIF4B and inhibiting programmed cell death protein 4 (Pdcd4), a known eIF4A inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Raught et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dorrello et al., 2006</xref>). Thus under conditions of high signaling through AKT and mTOR, cap-dependent translation is stimulated.</p><p>In times of stress, low levels of signaling through the IIS pathway lead to activated Foxo and 4E-BP in addition to inactive S6K. Foxo moves to the nucleus and controls the transcription of its target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Salih and Brunet, 2008</xref>). 4E-BP prevents formation of the translation initiation complex eIF4F, thereby inhibiting m7G-dependent translation, and S6K no longer stimulates eIF4A. This in turn leads to lower levels of global protein synthesis. Thus the IIS pathway controls gene expression with two different branches: transcription of Foxo target genes and m7G-cap-dependent translation through 4E-BP and S6K.</p><p>The IIS pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> contains a mechanism that functionally couples activated transcription to translation. A portion of the system includes a signaling and gene expression feedback loop for direct genetic targets of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Foxo. The insulin-like receptor (INR) and 4E-BP genes are conserved transcriptional targets of Foxo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Puig et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Puig and Tjian, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marr et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hu et al., 2008</xref>). Paradoxically, the insulin receptor protein, as well as mRNA, is being synthesized and accumulating under the same conditions when 4E-BP activity and expression is induced and S6K is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marr et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Foxo activates the transcription of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin receptor gene from three promoters. Each promoter produces a transcript with a distinct 5′ untranslated region (UTR) but identical coding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Casas-Tinto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marr et al., 2007</xref>). Transcripts derived from promoter 1 are by far the most abundant and ubiquitous form of INR transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Casas-Tinto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marr et al., 2007</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> INR 5′ UTRs contain an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that allows the message to escape 4E-BP inhibition of cap-dependent translation. This mechanism provides a functional coupling of transcription and translation in times of stress that allows amplification of insulin receptor expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marr et al., 2007</xref>). Because IRES containing transcripts can outcompete cap-dependent transcripts under these conditions their translation is actually stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Svitkin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marr et al., 2007</xref>). This leads to an effective switch of the cellular translation machinery to targets of the IIS pathway. Thus, Foxo targets impose a translational program by activation of genes that repress general translation while simultaneously activating targets that are immune to this translational control. This provides these targets with a competitive advantage allowing them to utilize the translation machinery that is freed by the general inhibition. Here we identify <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pdcd4 as an additional Foxo target further enhancing the coupling of transcription and translation regulation in the IIS pathway.</p><p>Since the IIS pathway targets translation initiation through control of both eIF4E and eIF4A, we wondered if the most abundant and ubiquitous <italic>Drosophila</italic> INR 5′ UTR would also provide resistance to inhibition of eIF4A activity. To answer this question we used both an in vitro translation system and a cell based assay to investigate the eIF4A requirements for efficient translation of reporters containing the INR 5′ UTR from <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Because mammalian systems show the same type of regulation, we also investigated the role of eIF4A inhibition in the murine insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptors. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giraud et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Spriggs et al., 2009b</xref>). We find, in both the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse systems, that the 5′ UTRs of the mRNAs for these receptors provide resistance to both eIF4E and eIF4A inhibition. Taken together, these results indicate that these cellular messages have some of the lowest requirement for eIF4F activity for translation identified to date.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Foxo activates Pdcd4 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells</title><p>A connection between Foxo activation and translation inhibition was identified when it was discovered that 4E-BP expression is controlled by Foxo in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Junger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Puig et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hu et al., 2008</xref>). Since the IIS pathway is also known to control eIF4A activity through Pdcd4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we tested if this gene is under direct Foxo control in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Blast analysis of human Pdcd4 with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome identifies a single homologous protein encoded by CG10990. Alignment of human PDCD4 and CG10990 indicate that important regions of the protein are conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cash and Andrews, 2012</xref>). The two MA3 domains, including the acidic residues shown to be important for the interaction with eIF4A are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Waters et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the Akt and S6K phosphorylation sites are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Palamarchuk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dorrello et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>To determine if the interaction with eIF4A is conserved, we immunoprecipitated <italic>Drosophila</italic> eIF4A from cytoplasmic extracts derived from a saturated culture of <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. Associated Pdcd4 was detected by immunoblot. Pdcd4 is co-precipitated with antisera against eIF4A but not with preimmune serum indicating that Pdcd4 and eIF4A interact in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We next created Myc-tagged expression constructs for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pdcd4, one wildtype construct and a construct containing mutations in conserved residues in the first MA3 domain (E282A, D286A). The analogous mutations in human PDCD4 destabilize the interaction with eIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Waters et al., 2011</xref>). The constructs were transfected into growing <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. Subsequent immunoprecipitation of eIF4A from these cells reveals a decreased association of the mutant Pdcd4 with eIF4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This indicates the mutations induce the same destabilization of the eIF4A–Pdcd4 interaction in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. Interestingly under these conditions we detect multiple forms of Pdcd4 by western blot, most likely phosphorylated forms of Pdcd4, and only the fastest migrating species associates with eIF4A.</p><p>To determine if <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pdcd4 can interact directly with eIF4A we used an affinity chromatography assay using recombinant proteins purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. A GST fusion to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pdcd4 was immobilized on glutathione agarose and recombinant <italic>Drosophila</italic> eIF4A was passed over the column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As a control GST was also immobilized on glutathione agarose. The eIF4A bound to the immobilized GST-Pdcd4 but not to GST alone indicating that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pdcd4 can interact directly with <italic>Drosophila</italic> eIF4A. Taken together these data are consistent with the notion that CG10990 is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of human PDCD4.</p><p>There are hints in the literature, based on microarray experiments, indicating this gene is induced in response to nutrient stress and might be controlled by Foxo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gershman et al., 2007</xref>). In an effort to determine if Foxo binds to the Pdcd4 gene in nutrient stressed animals we reanalyzed the only publically available Foxo ChIP (Chromatin immunoprecipitation) dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Teleman et al., 2008</xref>). These experiments were performed on starved larva. We find Foxo binds the Pdcd4 gene in both the promoter and intronic regions with enrichment values as high as 16-fold over background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To corroborate this finding, we performed ChIP on genomic DNA from a cell line with an inducible Foxo cDNA gene that has been modified so the Foxo protein produced is constitutively active because it is immune to the negative regulation by insulin signaling (Foxo<sup>CA</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Puig et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gershman et al., 2007</xref>). This allows us to induce Foxo under conditions of high nutrient signaling and remove possible crosstalk from upstream signaling pathways. We tested the enrichment of genomic sequences by qPCR using primers to the Pdcd4 promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) compared to a region in the first intron of CG15414, a gene just downstream of 4E-BP. We find Foxo<sup>CA</sup> binds to the promoter region of Pdcd4 at levels comparable to a well-defined direct target, 4E-BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Junger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Puig et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marr et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To determine the effect on mRNA production under these conditions we performed quantitative RT-qPCR on induced cells. We find that the steady-state level of Pdcd4 mRNA is increased about threefold in cells expressing active Foxo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To determine if the effect is due to mRNA stability changes or new transcription we assayed intron-containing pre-mRNAs by RT-qPCR. Since most splicing is co-transcriptional in <italic>Drosophila</italic> this is a good assay for new RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Khodor et al., 2011</xref>). We find that Pdcd4 pre-mRNA is increased, indicating an increase in transcription of the gene. The increased mRNA also leads to increased protein synthesis as determined by immuno-blot with antibodies directed against <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pdcd4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This is likely an underestimate of the effect since these experiments are all done under high serum and insulin conditions that should result in the rapid turnover of Pdcd4 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dorrello et al., 2006</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00542.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Foxo activates Pdcd4 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Reanalysis of ChIP-chip data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Teleman et al.

We find that GstD1 is still responsive indicating that the effects at Pdcd4 and 4E-BP are Foxo-specific and not due to a loss of responsiveness in the mutant flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results are consistent with the idea that in addition to controlling the cap-binding complex through 4E-BP, active Foxo can influence eIF4A through activation of the Pdcd4 gene in response to stress. Given that Foxo is activating transcription of the INR gene while Pdcd4 is also active, we hypothesized that since the INR mRNA is translated efficiently under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marr et al., 2007</xref>) it must be at least partially immune to diminished eIF4A activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Translation dependent on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin receptor 5′ UTR is stimulated by Pdcd4</title><p>To determine the effect of increased Pdcd4 on the translation of insulin receptor UTR containing RNAs we modified a dicistronic mRNA assay which we previously used to investigate the effects of 4E-BP on insulin receptor translation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marr et al., 2007</xref>).

While the control RNA is inhibited by excess cap, translation from the 5′ UTR of mINR and IGFR is not only resistant to excess m7G cap but the activity actually increases in the presence of excess m7G cap.

These processes are coordinated to ensure proper expression of the downstream targets. Under the same low IIS signaling conditions that activate 4E-BP, Pdcd4 is stabilized resulting in the inhibition of the DEAD box helicase eIF4A. Thus, under these conditions the eIF4F complex is repressed by two mechanisms. At the same time, the Foxo family of transcription factors is active and increasing the synthesis of certain mRNAs, one of which is the INR transcript itself.</p><p>Previously we identified a connection between 4E-BP mediated inhibition of the cap-binding complex and INR mRNA translation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marr et al., 2007</xref>). The INR message is immune to the 4E-BP translational repression and thus is preferentially translated under low signaling conditions coupling the increase in mRNA expression to an increase in protein synthesis.</p><p>In the work presented here we extend this observation of gene expression coordination of INR mRNA to the eIF4A branch of the IIS signaling pathway. First, we show that active Foxo is capable of directly stimulating the transcription of Pdcd4, analogous to the activation of 4E-BP seen previously under these same conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Junger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Puig et al., 2003</xref>). This provides a mechanism for the pathways controlling Foxo to enhance the inhibition of eIF4A when stressed or when nutrients are low. Second we show that the 5′ UTR of the most abundant <italic>Drosophila</italic> INR transcript provides resistance to eIF4A inhibition comparable to the resistance seen with the HCV IRES that does not require eIF4A. A similar finding has been seen for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> reaper 5′ UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hernandez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Iwasaki et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The data presented above also support the conservation of the cap-independent mechanism of translation initiation of the insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptor mRNAs in mammals. The mouse transcripts show resistance to hippuristanol under conditions that almost completely inhibit a control RNA indicating that the resistance to eIF4A inhibition is also conserved. There are no easily recognizable conserved sequence elements between the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse UTRs, but the mode of regulation is conserved suggesting an important role for this type of translational control. This defines a functional characteristic of the insulin receptor and IGF receptor transcripts that is conserved across hundreds of millions of years of evolution (from flies to mammals).</p><p>Taken together with previous work, these data indicate that the coupling of transcription to translation of insulin receptor mRNA mediated by Foxo targets can culminate in an activated translational response. Our findings highlight a unique characteristic of the insulin receptor and IGF receptor UTRs that differentiates them from other cellular transcripts. In addition to being immune to 4E-BP, these IRESes are resistant to eIF4A inhibition. While viral IRESes are fairly common, cellular IRESes are rare and relatively unexplored. Where it has been explored, most cellular IRESes have a strong requirement for eIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thoma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spriggs et al., 2009a</xref>). The INR and IGFR UTRs seem to require neither eIF4E nor eIF4A. In fact, these UTRs have the lowest identified requirement for eIF4F activity of any cellular transcript thus far. In addition, they are immune to two of the most important types of translational control, namely 4E-BP control and eIF4A inhibition. Both of these features make sense given the cellular environment when these mRNAs are to be translated. The conserved resistance to eIF4E and eIF4A inhibition of the insulin receptor transcripts should make them capable of out-competing other cellular transcripts with greater need for eIF4A or eIF4E. Using these exceptional characteristics, the insulin receptor mRNA could out-compete more abundant transcripts under times of stress or when nutrients are limiting and 4E-BP and Pdcd4 are active.</p><p>We focused on the insulin receptor UTRs as a mechanism for continued translation under conditions of general inhibition of protein synthesis as this is one of the initial components of the pathway identified as a direct Foxo target. In more recent work other components of the pathway have been identified as transcriptionally controlled by Foxo. If these targets are to be translated when Foxo is active they should also require mechanisms to escape 4E-BP and Pdcd4 inhibition. It remains to be seen if they will use the same mechanism as the INR mRNA or another mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly lines</title><p>Wildtype Canton S flies are from the Bloomingtion Stock Center. <italic>foxO<sup>Δ94</sup></italic> has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Slack et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Analysis of Foxo genomewide data</title><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation using Foxo antibodies followed by tiling array analysis was performed previously on starved larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Teleman et al., 2008</xref>).
