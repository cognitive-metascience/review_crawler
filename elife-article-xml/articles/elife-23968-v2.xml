signalling. TACE is a major shedding protease, responsible for the liberation of the inflammatory cytokine TNFα and ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor. iRhoms, catalytically inactive members of the rhomboid-like superfamily, have been shown to control the ER-to-Golgi transport and maturation of TACE. Here, we reveal that iRhom2 remains associated with TACE throughout the secretory pathway, and is stabilised at the cell surface by this interaction. At the plasma membrane, ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation and 14-3-3 protein binding of the cytoplasmic amino-terminus of iRhom2 alter its interaction with mature TACE, thereby licensing its proteolytic activity. We show that this molecular mechanism is responsible for triggering inflammatory responses in primary mouse macrophages. Overall, iRhom2 binds to TACE throughout its lifecycle, implying that iRhom2 is a primary regulator of stimulated cytokine and growth factor signalling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23968.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23968.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23968.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Injury or infection can cause tissues in the body to become inflamed. The immune system triggers this inflammation to help repair the injury or fight the infection. A signal molecule known as TNF – which is produced by immune cells called macrophages – triggers inflammation. This protein is normally attached to the surface of the macrophage, and it only activates inflammation once it has been cut free.</p><p>An enzyme called TACE cuts and releases TNF from the surface of macrophages. This enzyme is made inside the cell and is then transported to the surface. On the way, TACE matures from an inactive form to a fully functional enzyme. Previous work revealed that a protein called iRhom2 controls TACE maturation, but it has been unclear whether iRhom2 affects TACE in any additional ways.</p><p>Grieve et al. studied the relationship between iRhom2 and TACE in more detail. The experiments show two new roles for iRhom2: in protecting TACE from being destroyed at the cell surface, and prompting TACE to release TNF to trigger inflammation. Injury or infection causes small molecules called phosphate groups to be attached to iRhom2 in macrophages, which causes TACE to release TNF.</p><p>The findings of Grieve et al. provide the first evidence that iRhom2 influences the activity of TACE throughout the enzyme’s lifetime. Excessive inflammation, often triggered by the uncontrolled release of TNF, can lead to rheumatoid arthritis, cancer and many other diseases. Therefore, iRhom2 could be a promising new target for anti-inflammatory drugs that may help to treat these conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23968.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23968.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>rhomboid</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>growth factors</kwd><kwd>signalling</kwd><kwd>iRhom</kwd><kwd>TACE</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101035/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grieve</surname><given-names>Adam Graham</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Hongmei</given-names></name><name><surname>Künzel</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name><name><surname>Bambrough</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Sieber</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name><name><surname>Freeman</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Künzel</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Künzel</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name><name><surname>Sieber</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31640023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Hongmei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement 659166</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grieve</surname><given-names>Adam Graham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The iRhom2 protein, a catalytically inactive relative of rhomboid proteases, controls inflammation and growth factor signalling by acting as an essential multifunctional regulatory subunit of the cell surface shedding protease TACE (ADAM17).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Signalling ligands are often synthesised as transmembrane domain (TMD) containing precursors. Upon their delivery to the plasma membrane, protease activity is required to shed the bioactive extracellular domain to allow signal release and subsequent binding to receptors on signal-receiving cells. TACE (also known as ADAM17) is a primary shedding enzyme and as such regulates multiple signalling pathways through its ability to cleave and release numerous membrane-tethered signalling ligands and receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peschon et al., 1998</xref>). Of particular interest, it controls the shedding of TNFα, the principal inflammatory cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Black et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moss et al., 1997</xref>), amphiregulin, TGFα and most other ligands of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sunnarborg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sahin et al., 2004</xref>). Disturbances in these cytokine and growth factor signalling pathways are hallmarks of inflammation and cancer, respectively, as well as other diseases. This illustrates the potentially dangerous consequence of unregulated TACE activity and explains the tight post-translational regulation to which TACE is subject.</p><p>TACE is first synthesised in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as an immature form containing an inhibitory pro-domain that prevents its proteolytic activity. We and others identified the iRhom proteins, catalytically inactive members of the rhomboid-like superfamily, as essential regulators of TACE maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McIlwain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Siggs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Issuree et al., 2013</xref>). We reported that iRhoms control transport of TACE from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where removal of its pro-domain by pro-protein convertases such as furin occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Endres et al., 2003</xref>). In this way, iRhoms regulate the conversion of TACE from an inactive immature form to a mature proteolytically competent shedding enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrain and Freeman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Freeman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lemberg and Adrain, 2016</xref>). Without iRhoms there is no TACE maturation and therefore no TACE activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Of the two mammalian iRhoms, iRhom1 is broadly expressed, whereas macrophages express only iRhom2. Since macrophages are the major TNFα-releasing cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parameswaran and Patial, 2010</xref>), this makes iRhom2 an important regulator of inflammation. Accordingly iRhom2 knock-out mice have profound inflammatory defects, are sensitive to bacterial infection and are resistant to LPS-induced toxic shock and the development of inflammatory arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McIlwain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Issuree et al., 2013</xref>). More recently iRhom2 was shown to modulate innate immunity to DNA viruses by regulating the ER-to-Golgi transport and the stability of the immune adaptor STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2016</xref>). Although there are also hints that iRhom2 might regulate TACE protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maney et al., 2015</xref>), this has not been explored in detail.</p><p>iRhoms comprise a seven transmembrane rhomboid-like domain, with a short luminal C-terminus, a well conserved loop between TMDs 1 and 2 (termed the iRhom homology domain, IRHD), and a long cytoplasmic N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lemberg and Freeman, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2016</xref>). There is accumulating physiological and cell biological evidence that mutation or deletion of the cytoplasmic N-terminus of iRhoms leads to alterations in TACE function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blaydon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saarinen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hosur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Siggs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maney et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, iRhoms act downstream of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling in the transactivation of EGFR signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, these observations indicate that the cytosolic N-terminal domain of iRhoms regulates TACE, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Importantly, TACE-induced ligand shedding is rapid: it is activated within ten minutes by physiological and pharmacological stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Le Gall et al., 2010</xref>), and this is compatible with the timescale on which iRhoms have been reported to influence TACE substrate selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maretzky et al., 2013</xref>). However, this speed of TACE activation is not easily reconciled with its relatively slow ER-to-Golgi trafficking and maturation (3–6 hr, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schlöndorff et al., 2000</xref>]), the process by which iRhoms are known to control TACE.</p><p>Here we resolve this apparent paradox by demonstrating that iRhom2-mediated TACE maturation represents just the first step in the relationship between them. Once mature TACE has been trafficked to the cell surface, it requires a further iRhom2-dependent activation step, mediated by phosphorylation of the iRhom2 cytoplasmic domain. We reveal two unanticipated molecular roles for iRhom2 beyond its described function in TACE maturation. First, iRhom2 interacts with mature TACE at the plasma membrane, simultaneously stabilising TACE from lysosomal degradation and limiting its proteolytic activity. Second, iRhom2 acts as a signalling hub whereby phosphorylation of its N-terminus and subsequent 14-3-3 protein binding controls stimulated TACE proteolytic activity and ligand shedding. We show that this regulation of mature TACE activity occurs not only in immortalised cell models but also regulates inflammatory TNFα release from primary macrophages. Overall, we conclude that iRhom2 binds to TACE and controls its function at multiple stages, indicating that iRhom2 can be treated as a multifunctional regulatory subunit of TACE.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TACE activity, but not TACE maturation, is regulated by iRhom2 phosphorylation</title><p>iRhom2 is an essential regulator of TACE maturation and therefore TACE-dependent inflammatory and growth factor signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McIlwain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Siggs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Issuree et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Accumulating data about the significance of the iRhom2 N-terminus led us to hypothesise that iRhom2 control over TACE was subject to further regulation. We discovered that treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), a common activator of TACE-dependent signalling, leads to serine phosphorylation of mouse iRhom2 within 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Furthermore, even without stimulation, mass spectrometric analysis revealed multiple phosphorylated serines within the human iRhom2 cytoplasmic N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1 a-b</xref>.

Therefore iRhom2 phosphorylation is not essential for the maturation of TACE, suggesting that any phosphorylation-dependent function is restricted to an unknown post-TACE maturation role of iRhom2. Notably, a form of iRhom2 C-terminally tagged with a KDEL motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Munro and Pelham, 1987</xref>), which enhances ER retrieval from the cis-Golgi, did not support TACE maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2 a-c</xref>, implying that iRhom2 itself must be trafficked beyond the ER to promote TACE maturation. In support of the conclusion that iRhom2 phosphorylation does not control ER-to-Golgi trafficking of TACE, iRhom2<sup>WT</sup> and iRhom2<sup>pDEAD</sup>, but not iRhom2<sup>KDEL</sup>, were both detected in the Golgi apparatus, co-localising with the cis-Golgi marker GM130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Finally, consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maney et al., 2015</xref>), we found that iRhom2 can reach the cell surface: using cell surface biotinylation we detected both iRhom2<sup>WT</sup> and iRhom2<sup>pDEAD</sup> at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Overall, this demonstrates that iRhom2 is not limited to the early secretory pathway, but also reaches the plasma membrane, and that the ER-to-Golgi traffic of iRhom2 and TACE is independent of iRhom2 N-terminal phosphorylation.</p><p>The independence of TACE maturation from iRhom2 phosphorylation – combined with the plasma membrane localisation of iRhom2 – hinted that phosphorylation might regulate an as yet unknown post-Golgi iRhom2 function. We therefore tested whether iRhom2 phosphorylation was required for TACE shedding activity. We found that iRhom2<sup>pDEAD</sup> was greatly impaired in its ability to promote TACE-dependent shedding of EGF-like ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g–h</xref>) and TNFα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>) in response to PMA activation. The requirement for iRhom2 phosphorylation was specific to TACE substrates since the shedding of EGF or betacellulin, which depends on the related protease ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sahin et al., 2004</xref>), was unaffected by absence of iRhom2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). We conclude that phosphorylation of the iRhom2 N-terminus does not regulate its role of controlling ER-to-Golgi trafficking and maturation of TACE, but instead specifically controls the proteolytic activity of mature TACE at the cell surface.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mature TACE activity is dependent upon iRhom2 phosphorylation at three distinct sites, which co-ordinate binding to 14-3-3 family proteins</title><p>These data demonstrate that phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic N-terminus of iRhom2 specifically regulates the ability of mature TACE to release growth factors and cytokines from the cell surface. To further investigate this newly identified function we performed individual and combined alanine-scanning of the putative phosphorylation sites in iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>, and data not shown for non-contributing residues). This revealed three distinct sites that strongly contribute to PMA-induced TACE-dependent shedding: Site1 comprises S58 and S60; Site2 comprises S83, S85, and S87; and Site3 comprises S357, S359, S360 and T361 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> - highlighted in red text, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

Using both iRhom2<sup>pDEAD</sup> and iRhom2<sup>Site1-3</sup>, we found that 14-3-3 proteins strongly bind to the N-terminus of iRhom2 upon PMA stimulation, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). Of the seven 14-3-3 isoforms, we could confirm by western blot that all bound phosphorylated iRhom2 apart from 14-3-3α/β, although binding to 14-3-3ζ was weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d–f</xref>; 14-3-3σ antibody failed, data not shown).

Using PMA stimulated TACE-dependent shedding of amphiregulin as a readout, we examined the role of these kinases. We screened the activity of RSK3 with the well described inhibitor, BI-D1870 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sapkota et al., 2007</xref>); ERK1/2 activity was screened with a potent inhibitor of upstream activator kinases MEK1/2, U0126 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Favata et al., 1998</xref>). As PMA stimulation is a known activator of protein kinase C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ryves et al., 1991</xref>), the PKC inhibitors Go6976 and Go6983 were used as positive controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martiny-Baron et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gschwendt et al., 1996</xref>). This experiment demonstrated that PMA stimulated amphiregulin release is insensitive to RSK inhibition, but reduced upon MEK1/2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), in line with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). We also tested more physiological stimulation by the GPCR agonist histamine. In this case, too, stimulated release of amphiregulin by TACE was inhibited by U0126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Importantly, we showed that both PMA and histamine treatments indeed do cause upregulated ERK1/2 activity, monitored through enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–f</xref>). These results are consistent with iRhom2 phosphorylation being downstream of ERK1/2, and this was confirmed by the observation that stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation is unaffected in DKO MEFs expressing the iRhom2<sup>Site1-3</sup> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e–f</xref>). Since TACE itself is phosphorylated downstream of ERK1/2 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Soond et al., 2005</xref>), it is possible that the observed inhibition of TACE-dependent shedding was independent of iRhom2 phosphorylation. We therefore assessed the effects of U0126 directly on serine phosphorylation of iRhom2 and the subsequent recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins. First, we show that phosphorylation of iRhom2 is dependent on MEK1/2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Second, PMA and histamine induced recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins to iRhom2 is abrogated by MEK1/2 inhibition with U0126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–f</xref>). We conclude from these data that iRhom2 is phosphorylated downstream of activated ERK signalling, and that the activity of these kinases is required for 14-3-3 recruitment to the N-terminus of iRhom2 and TACE-dependent shedding.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23968.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>iRhom2 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding is dependent on active ERK signalling.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Lysates from cells overexpressing HA tagged human iRhom2<sup>WT</sup> and iRhom2<sup>∆N</sup> (lacking aa 1–382) and unc93B1 were subjected to HA immunoprecipitation and analysed by semi-quantitative label-free mass spectrometry.

The fact that we did not observe mature TACE could also be explained by degradation of the mature form. To test this, we blocked the two major protein degradation pathways: lysosomal and proteasomal degradation were inhibited with Bafilomycin A1 and MG132, respectively. This showed that iRhom2<sup>∆NT</sup> can in fact support TACE maturation, but in the absence of the iRhom2 cytoplasmic domain, mature TACE is unstable and degraded in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, compare lanes 7 and 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). This result uncovers an unanticipated molecular function for iRhom2, regulating the post-Golgi stability of mature TACE.

This implies that, unlike the N-terminus, the iRhom2 IRHD is essential for the ER-to-Golgi traffic and maturation of TACE, further distinguishing the newly discovered post-Golgi function of iRhom2 from its previously reported ER-to-Golgi trafficking role.</p><p>Collectively, these results show that the iRhom2 cytoplasmic N-terminus is not needed for ER-to-Golgi trafficking and maturation of TACE, but instead mediates its binding to mature TACE at the plasma membrane.

How does this affect proteolytic activation of TACE? We hypothesised that this might be the step that depends on the N-terminal phosphorylation of iRhom2 and subsequent 14-3-3 protein binding that we had discovered. To test this, we first questioned whether 14-3-3 recruitment to iRhom2 is sufficient to promote TACE activity. The phosphorylation Sites 1 and 2 in iRhom2 were replaced with the R18 peptide sequence that constitutively binds 14-3-3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 1999</xref>) (iRhom2<sup>R18</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). iRhom2<sup>R18</sup> not only showed constitutive recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) but also constitutively elevated TACE activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), indicating that 14-3-3 recruitment to the iRhom2 cytoplasmic domain is indeed sufficient to activate the shedding activity of TACE. Elevated levels of mature TACE did not cause this increase in shedding, as iRhom2<sup>R18</sup> supported TACE maturation to the same extent as iRhom2<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Furthermore, the insertion of two R18 peptides in iRhom2 did not affect its plasma membrane levels, assessed by surface biotinylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Significantly, we found that this constitutive 14-3-3 binding form binds mature TACE less well than iRhom2<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Reduction of binding was not caused simply by the loss of the Site 1 and 2 phosphorylation sites in iRhom2<sup>R18</sup>, as iRhom2<sup>Site1-2</sup> could still bind to mature TACE normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>).

Furthermore, iRhom2<sup>WT</sup>, iRhom2<sup>pDEAD</sup> and iRhom2<sup>Site1-3</sup> appeared to bind mature TACE equally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). We hypothesised that any alteration in binding might be hard to detect if it were limited to the physiologically active TACE and iRhom complex at the plasma membrane, which represents only a small fraction of total protein. To test this, we investigated the interaction between iRhom2 and TACE specifically at the cell surface. Intact cells on ice were incubated with an antibody that recognises the extracellular epitope of iRhom2 so that we could specifically isolate plasma membrane iRhom2 before and after (5 min) PMA stimulation. This showed that iRhom2 and mature TACE do indeed form a complex at the plasma membrane, and that this interaction is reduced upon PMA stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, compare the reduction in TACE co-immunoprecipitation in lanes 3 and 4, and in lanes 5 and 6; relative to total surface levels of mature TACE in lanes 9–12). Furthermore, the complex is more stable with the non-phosphorylatable mutant, iRhom2<sup>Site1-3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, see graph for quantification). These data also make the converse point: a more stable iRhom2-TACE complex leads to less TACE activity.</p><p>Overall, these results lead us to propose a new signalling mechanism that governs TACE activity. iRhom2 binds to and stabilises mature TACE at the plasma membrane but this complex inhibits TACE activity. Phosphorylation of the iRhom2 cytoplasmic domain drives the recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins, weakening the interaction between iRhom2 and TACE, an essential requirement for TACE proteolytic activity as a shedding enzyme.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Acute regulation of TACE by iRhom2 phosphorylation controls TNFα release in primary macrophages</title><p>TACE and its cytokine and growth factor substrates are profoundly implicated in pathophysiology.

We therefore investigated whether the phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanism we have discovered participates in regulating inflammation in vivo. We reconstituted primary bone marrow-derived macrophages from iRhom2 KO mice with iRhom2<sup>WT</sup> and iRhom2<sup>Site1-3</sup> transgenes. TACE maturation was rescued by both constructs, indicating that, as in MEFs, phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of iRhom2 is not needed for TACE trafficking and maturation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Furthermore, in response to PMA activation or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment (which mimics bacterial infection), we observed both iRhom2 serine phosphorylation, and 14-3-3 binding in primary macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>).

Because of its ability to trigger both cytokine and growth factor signalling, TACE activity is potentially dangerous, so it is unsurprising that it is itself subject to multiple layers of control. What is more unexpected is that iRhom2, a catalytically inactive relative of rhomboid intramembrane proteases, should be so intimately involved in TACE regulation throughout its lifecycle. We and others have already reported that iRhom2 is responsible for the first step of generating mature TACE, controlling its ER to Golgi trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McIlwain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Siggs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Issuree et al., 2013</xref>); we now show that this was only the first of several stages at which iRhom2 controls TACE. Once TACE has been exported from the ER under the influence of iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>), and its inhibitory pro-domain is removed in the trans-Golgi network, interaction with iRhom2 is essential to stabilise it at the plasma membrane, preventing its lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Stimulation of TACE proteolytic activity is then also mediated by iRhom2: the cytoplasmic N-terminus of iRhom2 is phosphorylated in response to, for example, GPCR signalling, leading to 14-3-3 binding. Our data support a model in which phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding elicit a change in the interaction between iRhom2 and mature TACE that licenses TACE activity to shed substrates from the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23968.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>iRhom2 regulates TACE at multiple steps in its lifecycle to control growth factor and cytokine signalling.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) iRhom2 and immature TACE must move together from the ER through the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>) also shown by iRhom2<sup>KDEL</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), the site of furin cleavage of the TACE prodomain (in yellow), and therefore production of mature TACE.

The iRhom2 N-terminus stabilises mature TACE levels at the cell surface; in its absence mature TACE is degraded in lysosomes. (<bold>c</bold>) Upon delivery and maintenance of mature TACE at the plasma membrane, GPCR stimulation or macrophage activation with LPS leads to iRhom2 phosphorylation and recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins.

Endocytic clearance of mature TACE from the cell surface has been previously demonstrated after stimulation with PMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doedens and Black, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lorenzen et al., 2016</xref>), although more physiological stimuli do not alter the plasma membrane abundance of the protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lorenzen et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that this is not a primary control point of TACE-dependent shedding. Instead, as with many cell surface proteins, there appears to be a constitutive endocytic recycling of mature TACE, mediated by PACS-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dombernowsky et al., 2015</xref>). The loss of PACS-2 triggers activation-independent mature TACE lysosomal degradation, and it will be interesting to investigate further whether there is a mechanistic link between iRhom2 and PACS-2 in the stabilisation of mature TACE. Interestingly, this resonates with a recent report that iRhom2 maintains the stability of another client protein, the innate immune response adaptor protein, STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2016</xref>), although in this case, STING is degraded by the proteasome.</p><p>Signals that lead to the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of iRhom2 cause 14-3-3 binding to iRhom2. The consequence of this signal-dependent 14-3-3 binding is a detectable alteration of the interaction between mature TACE and iRhom2 at the plasma membrane, and activation of TACE-dependent shedding of substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Importantly, we have confirmed that this control of stimulated shedding occurs not only in embryonic fibroblasts, but is also an essential regulator of TNFα production in primary macrophages. Furthermore, we find that iRhom2 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding is dependent on ERK1/2 signalling, which is itself essential for TACE-dependent TNFα release in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dumitru et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eliopoulos et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with the physiological significance of iRhom2 phosphorylation as a signalling mechanism, Chanthaphavong et al. reported its phosphorylation in primary hepatocytes in response to nitric oxide signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chanthaphavong et al., 2012</xref>). It is significant that stimulated TACE activity does not depend on its own cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reddy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horiuchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Le Gall et al., 2010</xref>). Instead, the TACE TMD is required for its rapid activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Le Gall et al., 2010</xref>), but the molecular mechanism underlying this observation has been mechanistically obscure. iRhoms have evolved from rhomboid intramembrane proteases, which are polytopic membrane proteins that recognise and cleave transmembrane domains, and it is therefore probable that TMD interaction remains a core function of iRhoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freeman, 2016</xref>). It is possible that the iRhom2-TACE interaction resembles a rhomboid-substrate complex, but that instead of then cleaving the TACE TMD, iRhom2 binding and phosphorylation alters the state of TACE, licensing its activation. Another possible mechanism that reflects the presumed TMD binding role of iRhom2 would be that the phosphorylation of the iRhom2 N-terminus may regulate its binding to TMD-containing TACE substrates, such as TNFα; in other words, that iRhom2 provides a substrate presentation or selection mechanism for TACE.</p><p>It will be important to understand how this newly identified phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanism relates to other previously identified modes of acute TACE regulation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Le Gall et al. (2010)</xref> reported that stimulation rapidly alters the accessibility of the TACE active site to a tight binding inhibitor, suggesting conformational changes in TACE itself. It has also been observed that iRhom2 controls substrate selectivity of mature TACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maretzky et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, Sommer et al. provided another model for acute TACE activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sommer et al., 2016</xref>). A variety of external signals cause the translocation of the lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner to outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. It has been shown that positive amino-acids in the extracellular membrane-proximal domain of TACE interact with the anionic head groups of exposed of PS, and it was proposed that this supports the positioning of TACE to cleave its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sommer et al., 2016</xref>). Another model for TACE activation is its conversion from dimers to monomers, which is associated with decreased TIMP3 association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Again, this model has significant overlap with our findings, as it is dependent on p38 MAPK and ERK signalling. The challenge is now to unify these earlier data with our discovery that phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding of the iRhom2 cytoplasmic domain is necessary and sufficient to trigger TACE-dependent shedding of its substrates. A possible unifying model is that iRhom2 phosphorylation and subsequent conformational change in the iRhom2/TACE complex is necessary to allow mature TACE to engage with the above events of PS exposure, monomerisation, conformational change of the active site, and substrate selection. It must be stressed that this sequence of events is entirely speculative, but it is consistent with all published data, and does highlight the extraordinarily complex and tight regulation of TACE. Further study of the structure of iRhom2 and TACE should yield further insight into the enzymatic activation process.</p><p>Overall, we propose that iRhoms have evolved as long-term molecular partners of TACE: first escorting and controlling TACE secretion and maturation; then stabilising it at the cell surface; and subsequently acting as a signalling hub at the plasma membrane that licenses stimulated TACE activity upon receipt of appropriate signals. These results greatly strengthen the relationship between iRhom2 and TACE, leading us to propose that iRhom2 should perhaps be considered as a multifunctional cofactor or regulatory subunit of TACE.</p><p>The incidence of inflammatory diseases is increasing, and there is a need for new anti-inflammatory therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Myasoedova et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2010b</xref>). TNFα blocking antibodies are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis, and this therapy is one of the biggest-selling pharmaceuticals in the world. It is, however, unsuccessful for approximately a third of patients, requires injection, and is expensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palladino et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scott and Kingsley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Esposito and Cuzzocrea, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Monaco et al., 2015</xref>). By expanding substantially the scope of the relationship between iRhom2 and TACE, the work we report here strengthens the case for the therapeutic potential of targeting iRhom2. Its previously reported role in regulating TNFα signalling by the ER-to-Golgi trafficking and maturation of TACE makes iRhom2 conceptually a valuable target, but that function will be hard to target pharmaceutically as it depends on a TMD-based interaction in the ER (our unpublished observation). In contrast, the regulatory mechanism between iRhom2 and mature TACE at the plasma membrane described here is cytoplasmic and thus perhaps more targetable. Moreover, the molecular components such as 14-3-3 proteins and the kinases that directly phosphorylate iRhom2 are more conventional, and therefore accessible, pharmaceutical targets. Finally, beyond targeting inflammatory cytokine signalling, pharmaceutical manipulation of the iRhoms-TACE interface could also influence growth factor signalling through the EGF receptor family, which is heavily implicated in a variety of diseases, most notably cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kenny and Bissell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>LPS, PMA, Bafilomycin A1, MG132 were all purchased through either Sigma-Aldrich or Roche.

For macrophages, experiments were performed when levels of GFP in pM6P.blast-GFP transduced macrophages had reached detectable levels using a tissue culture fluorescence microscope (FLoid Cell Imaging Station; Life Technologies) (on average, 3–4 days post-transduction).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunofluorescence and microscopy</title><p>DKO MEFs (3 × 10<sup>5</sup>) transduced with indicated constructs were plated on 13 mm glass coverslips in six well dishes. Cells were washed 3x in room temperature PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min. Fixative was quenched with 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl for 5 min. Cells were permeabilised in 0.2% TX-100 in PBS for 30 min and epitopes blocked with 1% fish-skin gelatin (Sigma) in PBS for 1 hr. Coverslips were then incubated overnight with rabbit anti-HA and mouse anti-GM130 in 1% fish-skin gelatin/PBS. After 3x PBS washes, coverslips were incubated with fluorescently-coupled secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for 45min. Cells were subsequently washed 3x with PBS and 1x with H<sub>2</sub>O, prior to mounting on glass slides with mounting medium containing DAPI (ProLong Gold; ThermoFisher Scientific). Images were acquired with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Fluoview FV1000; Olympus) with a 60 × 1.4 NA oil objective, and processed using Fiji (Image J).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>AP-shedding assay</title><p>To test amphiregulin (Areg), transforming growth factor (TGFα), tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), betacellulin (BTC) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) shedding, MEFs were plated at a density of 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> in a 24 well plate followed by transfection 16 hr later with alkaline phosphatase (AP) conjugated Areg, TGFα, EGF (kind gifts from Prof. Carl Blobel) or TNFα (a kind gift from Dr Stefan Düsterhöft). For transfection, 200 ng DNA and 0.8 µl of Fugene-6 (Promega) were used, following standard protocols. For GPCR stimulations, MEFs were co-transfected with a construct expressing histamine HA1 receptor (kindly provided by Dr. Stefan Düsterhöft) (400 ng per 24 well). Two days later a stimulation assay was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christova et al., 2013</xref>). In short, cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated in 300 µl Opti-MEM with or without indicated concentrations of PMA (200 nM), or histamine (300 µM) for stated times (Invitrogen). For kinase screening experiments, cells were pretreated with indicated kinase inhibitors for 1 hr in 300 µl Opti-MEM. 100 µl Opti-MEM containing 80 nM PMA or 1.2 mM histamine (4x) was then added for 1 hr, in the continued presence of kinase inhibitors. AP activity was detected in stimulated and un-stimulated supernatant or in cell lysates (using Triton-X100 buffer) by adding equal volumes of PNPP buffer (Pierce) and incubating at 37°C followed by measurement of absorbance at 405 nm. The percentage of the total material shed from each well (i.e. signal from supernatant divided by total signal from lysate and supernatant) was then used to calculate the percentage-stimulated release. In the kinase screens, the percentage induction above treatment with 100 µl control Opti-MEM is plotted. The kinase inhibitors Go6973, Go6983, U0126 and BI-D1870 were used at a final concentration of 20 µM. Error bars represent standard deviations, and all two-tailed student <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed comparing indicated mutants with iRhom2<sup>WT</sup>. In the case of kinase screen experiments, two-tailed student <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed comparing stimulated AP release in the presence of kinase inhibitors with DMSO treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>ELISA</title><p>3–4 days post infection, macrophages were stimulated with 200 nm PMA (Invitrogen) or 100 ng/ml LPS (Sigma) in OPTIMEM supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA for indicated times.

For detection of phosphorylation, or plasma membrane IPs, 24 hr before stimulation, cells were cultured overnight in OPTIMEM. Cells were then stimulated with or without 200 nM PMA in OPTIMEM for indicated times. For plasma membrane immunoprecipitations, after treatment for 5 min, DKO MEFs were placed on ice and washed 3x with ice-cold PBS. Intact cells were then incubated on ice with mouse anti-HA antibody diluted in PBS for 1 hr. Cells were then washed 4x in ice-cold PBS. After all treatments, cells were washed 3x with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in 1 ml TX-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 10 mM 1,10-phenanthroline and PhosSTOP (Roche). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C. Protein concentrations were measured by a BCA assay kit (Pierce). The lysates were then immunoprecipitated for 2–3 hr with 15 μl pre-washed HA antibody-coupled beads (conventional IPs), or 25 μl ProteinA-coupled agarose beads (Pierce/Thermo) at 4°C on a rotor. After 4–5 washes with lysis buffer, the immunocomplexes were incubated at 65°C for 15 min in 1x LDS sample buffer. Typically, 25% of the immunoprecipitates and 1% of lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels for subsequent western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>ConA enrichment</title><p>As stated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Siggs et al.

Cells/lysates were then scraped and centrifuged at 20,000 x g. Protein concentration was then measured using by a BCA assay (Life Technogies). Lysates were then mixed with washed 50 μl ConA beads (washed in lysis buffer) and incubated for 2–3 hr at 4°C on a rotor. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and glycoproteins were eluted with 1 x sample buffer supplemented with 15% sucrose, by incubation at 65°C for 15 min in a thermomixer. 20% of the ConA preparations and 1% of lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels for subsequent Western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Cell surface biotinylation</title><p>After any indicated treatments, cells were placed on ice and washed 3x with PBS. Surface proteins were labelled on ice with 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin diluted in PBS (Thermo Scientific, catalogue number 21335) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells then underwent 1x PBS wash, 1 × 10 min incubation in 100 mM glycine/PBS to quench and remove excess biotin, and 3x PBS washes. Cells were lysed in TX-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 10 mM 1,10-phenanthroline. After pelleting at 20,000g, clarified supernatants were incubated with 30 μl high-capacity neutravidin agarose beads for 2–3 hr to capture labelled proteins (Thermo Scientific, catalogue number 29204).

The cells were stained on ice with anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz rabbit polyclonal (sc-805); 0.5 µg per 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells) diluted in FACS buffer for 45 min. After two washing steps with ice-cold FACS buffer, the cells were incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific donkey polyclonal (A21206), 1:1000) on ice for 30 min. Cells stained only with the secondary antibody served as control.

A centrifugation step (10,000 g, 10 min, 4°C) was performed to precipitate nuclei and insoluble cell fragments. Cell lysates were pre-cleared by incubation with mouse IgG (Sigma) for 1 hr at 4°C. Magnetic anti-HA beads (Pierce) were then added to the supernatant and incubated for 1 hr at 4°C. Beads were washed with DDM RIPA lysis buffer containing 300 mM NaCl, and once with PBS before bound peptides were eluted three times by incubation with HA peptide (1 mg/ml) for 15 min at 37°C. The eluates were pooled and concentrated with a vivaspin concentrator 500 (10,000 kDa MWCO, Sartorius). The spin filter was washed five times with PBS by centrifugation at 12,000 g, RT. Proteins samples were prepared for mass spectrometry using filter-aided sample preparation, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wiśniewski et al., 2011</xref>). Peptides were eluted from the filter with 0.1% formic acid, 0.1% formic acid in 50% acetonitrile (ACN) and finally with 0.1% formic acid in 80% ACN. The eluate was concentrated and peptides were loaded on PepClean C18 spin columns (Pierce) to remove salt. Peptides were eluted with 0.1% formic acid in 50% ACN and with 0.1% formic acid in 80% ACN and concentrated. Peptides were resolved in 0.1% triflouroacidic acid in 5% ACN and injected into the Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC (Dionex) – tandem mass spectrometry Q Exactive Orbitrap machine.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Grieve et al. investigates how phosphorylation of the rhomboid pseudoprotease iRhom2 controls the activity of the sheddase TACE, which serves as the key activator of TNFalpha and growth factor signaling. The authors add to a flurry of papers published in 2012 revealing an unanticipated role of iRhom2 in regulating ER-to-Golgi-trafficking and subsequent maturation of TACE. In this manuscript, Grieve et al. further elaborate their previous trafficking model, now providing strong evidence that iRhom2 and TACE remain associated throughout the entire secretion route to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, phosphorylation of the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and subsequent binding of 14-3-3 proteins appears to weaken this interaction thereby increasing TACE shedding activity. Although the molecular mechanism of how TACE activity is controlled in this complex still remains unclear, data presented in this manuscript support an interesting new model that iRhom2 serves as multifunctional subunit of TACE, which simultaneously limits shedding activity and protects TACE from lysosomal degradation. The paper is well written and the experiments are sufficiently explained, but two major conceptual issues and several technical concerns need to be resolved in a revision:</p><p>1) An important conceptual gap is the identity of the kinase(s) and how they are controlled. At least the identity of the kinase(s) need to be clarified or narrowed down using well described kinase inhibitors or/and sets of siRNA after physiological (not PMA) stimulation. Without this information the underlying mechanism is not sufficiently developed to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>2) The manuscript falls short in defining the role of iRhom2 phosphorylation on complex formation with TACE. From the data presented in the current manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), the claim that upon PMA stimulation &quot;the complex is more stable with the non-phosphorylatable mutant&quot; (referred to as Site 1-3 mutant) is not convincingly supported, and serious concerns exist regarding the reliability of this data set. Since x-ray films used for ECL detection of western blots hardly provide a linear readout, the authors need an independent experimental approach to support this biotinylation/co-IP experiment (e.g. proximity ligation assays, or split GFP approach to demonstrate direct physical interaction between TACE and the iRhom2 N-terminal domain). The surface interaction of TACE and iRhom2 should be determined after physiological stimulation (not after PMA treatment). The authors also need to determine whether phosphorylation can also occur in the secretory route or only at the cell surface.</p><p>Technical comments:</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>In order to prevent confusion, the authors need to indicate that TACE also is known as ADAM17.</p><p>&quot;[…] with the relatively slow process of ER-to-Golgi trafficking[…]&quot; Define what is meant by relatively slow.

We show that PMA and histamine, both of which stimulate iRhom2 phosphorylation-mediated TACE activation, activate ERK1/2. Interestingly, our findings are consistent with previous reports that LPS stimulates ERK1/2, which is required for TNF release in macrophages (Dumitru CD et al., 2000, Cell; Eliopoulos AG et al., 2003, EMBO J). This suggests that ERK1/2 dependent iRhom2 phosphorylation may be a conserved mechanism for TACE activation in macrophages, now mentioned in the discussion.</p><p>There is also overlap with another study of TACE activation (Xu P, et al. 2012, Science Signalling), where it was shown that ERK and p38 MAPK signalling lead to TACE activation that coincide with TACE monomerisation and changes in surface presentation. The overlap between this study and ours is covered in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) The manuscript falls short in defining the role of iRhom2 phosphorylation on complex formation with TACE. From the data presented in the current manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), the claim that upon PMA stimulation &quot;the complex is more stable with the non-phosphorylatable mutant&quot; (referred to as Site 1-3 mutant) is not convincingly supported, and serious concerns exist regarding the reliability of this data set. Since x-ray films used for ECL detection of western blots hardly provide a linear readout, the authors need an independent experimental approach to support this biotinylation/co-IP experiment (e.g. proximity ligation assays, or split GFP approach to demonstrate direct physical interaction between TACE and the iRhom2 N-terminal domain). The surface interaction of TACE and iRhom2 should be determined after physiological stimulation (not after PMA treatment). The authors also need to determine whether phosphorylation can also occur in the secretory route or only at the cell surface.</italic> </p><p>Actually, our work does not demonstrate a direct interaction between the iRhom2 N-terminus and the cytoplasmic domain of TACE. Instead, we favour a model in which N-terminal phosphorylation and 14-3-3 recruitment to iRhom2 leads to a change in the TMD-based interaction between iRhom2 and TACE at the cell surface (see Discussion). As iRhom2 and both the pro and mature forms of TACE interact throughout the entire secretory pathway, a selective approach is required to assess the interaction at the cell surface. This is quite difficult, as the cell surface pool is only a small fraction of the total, but it is what we showed in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>.</p><p>We do accept the reviewers’ point that it would be good to provide a different type of experimental evidence to support the conclusion that there is a change in the interaction upon 14-3-3 binding and we have worked hard to address it.</p><p>A split GFP approach will not work because the lifetime interaction between iRhom2 and TACE would mean that the fluorescent GFP signal would be detected at all subcellular sites and is not specific to the small proportion at the plasma membrane.</p><p>PLA with unpermeabilised cells, using antibodies that recognise extracellular epitopes of iRhom2 and TACE, is a good idea and should be able to detect only the plasma membrane interaction. Following this suggestion, we have attempted PLA with iRhom2 and TACE, using the extracellular epitope of iRhom2-HA and an antibody that detects the TACE extracellular epitope. However, these experiments were unsuccessful, even in permeabilised cells. We then generated a cell line that expresses iRhom2-HA and TACE-FLAG, with a FLAG epitope placed just before the furin cleavage site- thus allowing us to detect the FLAG epitope at the cell surface. PLA using antibodies against HA and FLAG with this also failed. We therefore conclude that this approach does not work, and suggest that, as in some other cases, steric issues in the complex between iRhom2 and TACE prevent PLA from working – at least with these epitopes.</p><p>It is worth restating here that the quantification in the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) represent three separate experiments, giving us confidence that the reduction of interaction between iRhom2 and TACE that we detect at the cell surface is robust and reproducible.</p><p>Further supporting our interpretation, constitutive 14-3-3 recruitment leads to a loss of interaction between mature TACE and iRhom2. This leads to elevated TACE activity even without PMA treatment. This is fully consistent with the idea that 14-3-3 binding alters the interaction between iRhom2 and mature TACE, thereby stimulating TACE activity.</p><p>Nevertheless, we fully accept that without a completely independent experimental approach to this difficult problem, we need to word this conclusion more cautiously, and we have now done this in both the Results and Discussion.</p><p>We have additionally addressed the final sentence of this point, about the cellular location of iRhom2 phosphorylation. We performed an experiment with iRhom2-KDEL, to assess whether this mutant of iRhom2, which is restricted to the early secretory pathway and does not support TACE-dependent shedding, could recruit 14-3-3 upon PMA stimulation. We found that iRhom2-KDEL recruited 14-3-3 in a similar fashion to iRhom2-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1g</xref>). We therefore believe that iRhom2 is phosphorylated throughout the secretory pathway, but the only effect of iRhom2 phosphorylation on TACE that we can detect is at the cell surface.</p><p><italic>Technical comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>Introduction:</italic> </p><p><italic>In order to prevent confusion, the authors need to indicate that TACE also is known as ADAM17.</italic> </p><p>In the earliest description of TACE in the Introduction, we now state that it is also known as ADAM17 (first paragraph).</p><p> <italic>&quot;[…] with the relatively slow process of ER-to-Golgi trafficking[…]&quot; Define what is meant by relatively slow. Can the authors provide any numbers here? Why do the authors describe this as an &quot;apparent paradox&quot;? Trans-Golgi derived vesicles could also rapidly fuse with the plasma membrane.</italic> </p><p>Until now, the only known function of iRhom2 in TACE regulation is the ability to promote ER to Golgi transport and maturation of TACE. Although it is formally possible that the TACE activation mechanism could be through gating of trans Golgi derived vesicles, this is shown not to be the case, as phosphorylation-defective mutants of iRhom2 do not affect its own surface presentation, nor the ability of mature TACE to reach the cell surface. The maturation of TACE is already well studied and occurs within a time frame of 3-6 hours (Schlondorff et al., 2000), which is not on the timescale of TACE activation (within 10 mins). We have made a comment to this effect in the manuscript (Introduction, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>The recent paper by Luo et al. describing iRhom2 as an essential factor for STING activity should be mentioned (not only in the Discussion section) suggesting role(s) of iRhom2 next to the regulation of TACE.</italic> </p><p>The Luo et al. publication has now been mentioned in the Introduction, in the context of iRhom2 regulation of protein stability (second paragraph).</p><p><italic>Results:</italic> </p><p><italic>Do the authors also detect other post translational modifications next to phosphorylation?

We have correctly reworded this sentence, to make clear the statement is with reference to TACE (subsection “TACE activity, but not TACE maturation, is regulated by iRhom2 phosphorylation”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>Subsection “TACE activity, but not TACE maturation, is regulated by iRhom2 phosphorylation”, second paragraph: Steady state analysis of mature TACE level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5a</xref>) and cellular localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and F</xref>) do not allow precisely measuring trafficking rates and therefore the conclusion that &quot;any phosphorylation-dependent function must be restricted to an unknown post-TACE maturation role of iRhom2&quot; and &quot;trafficking is phosphorylation independent&quot; need to be toned down.</italic> </p><p>We have toned down the first statement to a hypothesis. We have rephrased the final conclusion to make a more specific statement that the ER-to-Golgi traffic of iRhom2 and TACE is independent of phosphorylation, which is supported by our data (TACE still undergoes ER-to-Golgi transport and maturation in iRhom2 phosphorylation mutant cell lines; iRhom2 pDEAD reaches the plasma membrane to a similar level as its wild type counterpart, therefore there is no block in ER-to-Golgi traffic).</p><p><italic>How do the authors explain the higher molecular weight in the iR2Pdead mutant?</italic> </p><p>There are a large number of mutations in iRhom2 pDEAD that are likely to affect its overall charge in a manner likely unrelated to phosphorylation. For this reason we performed the screen in the manuscript to create iRhom2 with the site1-3 mutant, which is more minimal that the full pDEAD mutant, and in which this upward shift in molecular weight is not apparent. Depending on the duration of the SDS-PAGE gel that is run, an expected faster migration in the iRhom2 site 1-3 phosphorylation mutants can be observed e.g. HA lysates <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>/3F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>.</p><p><italic>It is very surprising that a significant fraction of the ER-retention mutant is also found in GM130 positive compartments similar to the WT and pDead mutants?

We have reworded the text to make this clearer. Both biotinylation experiments and cell surface FACS analysis show a significant reduction in surface levels of iRhom2-KDEL.

We have avoided gross over-expression to the best of our ability, by ensuring low expression by infection with low titres of virus (aiming for an M.O.I. of 1 virus particle per cell). We provide evidence of an effect of iRhom2 phosphorylation on TACE-dependent release of endogenous TNF in macrophages, by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).</p><p><italic>Is there any effect of the mutant without induction using PMA?

This is also demonstrated with LPS-stimulated TACE activity in primary macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the Results section where we first introduce the use of histamine, we have stated that “PMA is not a physiological trigger for TACE activity”.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> (and in part also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) there is no major differences in TACE activation towards the TGF-α substrate and the authors´ conclusion that this revealed the three distinct sites that contribute to PMA-induced stimulation is unclear. Is the mass spectroscopy analysis performed earlier not a more reliable methodology here?</italic> </p><p>We demonstrate that sites 1, 2 and 3 independently and significantly affect TACE-dependent shedding in an additive fashion.

For this reason, we typically use commercially available pre-conjugated HA beads for all immunoprecipitation experiments, that have undergone rigorous in-house testing. Nonetheless, first, we performed a repeat IP with control beads without HA antibody, to demonstrate the specificity of our co-immunoprecipitation of TACE with iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Second, the beads used in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> are for enrichment of glycoproteins, not immunoprecipitations. All lysates are treated equally and, given the new control provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref> with beads only, we do not believe there is a need for bead only controls in this ConA experiment (empty beads do not concentrate glycoproteins, such as TACE). Third, we include the whole western blot in these immunoprecipitation experiments so that the respective size of each mutant is clearly demonstrated. The lower molecular weight bands have not been well characterized, but are reproducible and presumably represent degradation products. Fourth, we provide a cell surface biotinylation assay of these mutants to demonstrate their ability to reach the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Fifth, to demonstrate that MG132 has worked, we include a new figure that shows increased ubiquitin levels specifically upon treatment with MG132, demonstrating that the rescue of mature TACE levels is dependent on lysosomal degradation, with no influence from the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Sixth, in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we include a panel for ADAM10, which is known to undergo endocytosis and degradation from the cell surface (Marcello E et al., 2013, JCI), showing that bafilomycin treatment leads to an increase in ADAM10 levels. We agree that bafilomycin does not only inhibit endocytic degradation but since it is a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase on lysosomes, we prefer to keep to our current wording that mature TACE is degraded in lysosomes.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: improve the labelling of all subpanels.</italic> </p><p>We have changed the western blot subpanel labelling from white to black, for clarity.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Phosphorylation and 14-3-3 protein recruitment uncouples the interaction between iRhom2 and mature TACE to drive its activity at the cell surface”, first paragraph: Does the R18 peptide sequence inserted in the N-terminus of iRhom2 affect its subcellular trafficking?</italic> </p><p>We now provide a blot from a surface biotinylation assay that demonstrates R18-iRhom2 reaches the plasma membrane in a similar fashion to both iRhom2 WT and Site 1-3, relative to their expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Why is the complex of iRhom2 and TACE less stable after expression of iR2Site1-3 mutant and 5 min PMA treatment?</italic> </p><p>Quantification from three independent experiments shows that the iRhom2-mTACE complex is less stable after 5 min PMA treatment; however, there is no statistically significant difference in the stability of the iRhom2-mTACE complex in the iR2 site 1-3 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
