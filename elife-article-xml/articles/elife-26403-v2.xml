Regulation of nutrient storage can occur by the ubiquitination of certain transporters that are then sorted into the lysosome lumen for degradation. To better understand the underlying mechanism of this process, we performed genetic screens to identify components of the sorting machinery required for vacuole membrane protein degradation. These screens uncovered genes that encode a ubiquitin ligase complex, components of the PtdIns 3-kinase complex, and the ESCRT machinery. We developed a novel ubiquitination system, <italic>Rap</italic>amycin<italic>-I</italic>nduced <italic>Deg</italic>radation (RapiDeg), to test the sorting defects caused by these mutants. These tests revealed that ubiquitinated vacuole membrane proteins recruit ESCRTs to the vacuole surface, where they mediate cargo sorting and direct cargo delivery into the vacuole lumen. Our findings demonstrate that the ESCRTs can function at both the late endosome and the vacuole membrane to mediate cargo sorting and intra-luminal vesicle formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26403.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26403.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ESCRT</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>lysosomal membrane protein</kwd><kwd>membrane protein regulation</kwd><kwd>cargo sorting</kwd><kwd>protein degradation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007231</institution-id><institution>Cornell University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant CU3704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Emr</surname><given-names>Scott D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The lysosome membrane is a new functional location for the ESCRTs in yeast.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lysosome is best known as a degradative organelle, but it also plays an important role in maintaining ion and nutrient homeostasis in the cell. Similar to the plasma membrane (PM), the lysosomal membrane contains various transporters that mediate the efflux and influx of ions and nutrients across the lysosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu and Ren, 2015</xref>). Dysregulation of lysosomal transporters underlies the pathogenesis of many inherited metabolic disorders in humans termed lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), such as Niemann-Pick disease, Salla disease, Cystinosis, and mucolipidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gahl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parkinson-Lawrence et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schulze and Sandhoff, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vitner et al., 2010</xref>). The precise regulation of lysosomal membrane proteins is therefore crucial to maintain nutrient and ion balance in the cell.</p><p>Lysosomes serve as the terminal destination for the delivery of cellular proteins targeted for degradation, but how lysosomes turnover their own resident membrane proteins remains poorly understood. Using the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, our lab recently found that resident transporters on the vacuole membrane (analogous to the lysosomal membrane in higher eukaryotes) are sorted to the vacuole lumen and degraded upon specific stimuli. Specifically, we found that the vacuole membrane lysine transporter Ypq1 is ubiquitinated after lysine withdrawal by Rsp5, a Nedd4 family HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. Rsp5 is recruited to the vacuole membrane by Ssh4, a PY-motif containing type-I transmembrane protein. After ubiquitination, Ypq1 is sorted into the vacuole lumen for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015b</xref>). We also reported that the zinc transporter Cot1 is ubiquitinated by Tul1, a RING-type E3 ligase, and is sorted into the vacuole lumen for degradation upon the depletion of zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2015a</xref>). Despite using different ubiquitination complexes, these cargoes likely use the same downstream sorting machineries. The trafficking pathway for the degradation of these vacuolar membrane proteins, however, has not yet been elucidated.</p><p>Our lab proposed two models for the sorting of ubiquitinated Ypq1. In the first model, Ypq1 is recycled from the vacuole membrane to an intermediate compartment (the late endosome) where the ESCRTs would sort it into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) before delivery into the vacuole lumen. In the second model, Ypq1 is internalized directly into the vacuole lumen by the ESCRT machinery. Initially, we favored the recycling model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015b</xref>) because some Ypq1-GFP puncta detached from vacuole membrane were detected after lysine withdrawal. The recycling model was also consistent with the previously characterized functional location of the ESCRT complexes at the late endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babst et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheever et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Katzmann et al., 2003</xref>), and ESCRT function directly on the vacuole membrane has never been reported.</p><p>To better understand the sorting and trafficking steps for Ypq1 degradation, we performed a genetic selection as well as a genome-wide screen for mutants defective for Ypq1 degradation. Through multiple genetic approaches, we hoped to reveal genes and trafficking pathways required for Ypq1 sorting and degradation. Here, we demonstrate that endosome-vacuole fusion is not required for Ypq1 sorting and degradation, which is inconsistent with the recycling model. Instead, we show that ESCRT complexes function directly on the vacuole surface to facilitate Ypq1 degradation, extending the role for ESCRTs in yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genetic selection for mutants defective in vacuole membrane protein degradation pathway</title><p>We have previously shown that Ypq1 sorting from the vacuole membrane into the vacuole lumen after lysine withdrawal is ubiquitin dependent. However, the machinery required for downstream Ypq1 sorting steps remained elusive. To better understand the vacuole membrane protein sorting pathway, we developed genetic approaches to identify new machinery required for this process.</p><p>Serendipitously, we found that the insertion of a 38 amino acid streptavidin-binding-peptide (SBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Terpe, 2003</xref>) between Ypq1 and GFP (Ypq1-SBP-GFP) results in constitutive sorting of Ypq1 into the vacuole lumen, even in the presence of lysine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Importantly, Ypq1-SBP-GFP sorting is blocked on the vacuole membrane in a mutant lacking the vacuolar ubiquitin E3 ligase adaptor Ssh4(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that Ypq1-SBP-GFP is degraded through the same vacuole membrane protein degradation pathway as Ypq1-GFP. This new fusion protein allowed us to design a robust screening platform to reveal cellular pathways necessary for Ypq1 sorting.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26403.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genetic selection for mutations that block the Ypq1 sorting pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescent microscopy analysis of cells expressing Ypq1-SBP-GFP and vacuole membrane marker Vph1-mCherry in wild-type and (<bold>B</bold>) <italic>ssh4</italic>Δ cells grown to mid-log phase at 30°C.

To accomplish this, we fused Ypq1-SBP to pHluorin, a pH-sensitive GFP variant that is quenched at low pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miesenböck et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prosser et al., 2010</xref>). Since the vacuole lumen is acidic, Ypq1-SBP-pHluorin is quenched once sorted into the vacuole lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This makes Ypq1 sorting mutants fluorescent, such as <italic>ssh4</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), whereas WT cells are quenched. We expressed Ypq1-SBP-pHluorin in each of the ~4600 yeast nonessential knock-out collection mutants and quantified their fluorescence using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplemental file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), then validated the hits using light microscopy.</p><p>Using these complementary genetic approaches, as shown in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplemental file 2</xref>, we identified the ESCRTs, the E3 ligase <italic>RSP5</italic> and its vacuole membrane adaptor <italic>SSH4</italic>, and the endosome-vacuole fusion machinery(HOPS/CORVET/SNAREs).

In the ESCRT mutant <italic>vps27</italic>Δ, however, Ssh4 is blocked at aberrant endosomes and co-localizes with the v-ATPase component Vph1, which is trafficked to the vacuole via the VPS pathway and accumulates at aberrant endosomes in ESCRT mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerrard et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piper et al., 1995</xref>).

We co-expressed Ypq1-GFP and myc-Ub in <italic>doa4</italic>Δ cells. Doa4 is a major deubiquitinase of the endomembrane system, and its deletion stabilizes ubiquitinated forms of Ypq1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amerik et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015b</xref>). We immunoprecipitated Ypq1-GFP before and after lysine withdrawal, and probed the precipitates for myc-Ub. In WT cells after 2 hr lysine withdrawal, there was a high-molecular-weight myc-ub signal, indicating that after lysine withdrawal Ypq1 becomes polyubiquitinated. In <italic>vps27</italic>Δ, however, this polyubiquitination did not occur. Taken together, these data demonstrate that in ESCRT mutants, Ypq1 cannot be ubiquitinated because Ssh4 delivery to the vacuole is blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>We previously observed that Ypq1 is blocked at the vacuole membrane after lysine withdrawal in the endosome-vacuole fusion mutants <italic>vam3ts</italic> (SNARE) and <italic>vps18ts</italic> (HOPS) at non-permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015b</xref>). Since Ssh4 delivery requires these fusion machineries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we hypothesized that the delivery of newly synthesized Ssh4 may be required and that the pre-existing vacuole membrane pool of Ssh4 may not be sufficient to ubiquitinate Ypq1 after temperature shift. We then tested whether these mutants block Ypq1 ubiquitination. As can be seen in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, these mutants block the ubiquitination of Ypq1-GFP after lysine withdrawal.</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest that proper delivery of Ssh4 to the vacuole membrane is required for the normal ubiquitination of Ypq1-GFP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Rapamycin-induced degradation (RapiDeg) system</title><p>The Ypq1 ubiquitination defect in ESCRT mutants and endosome-vacuole fusion mutants make it difficult to study whether these components are involved in the downstream sorting steps of ubiquitinated Ypq1.

In the RapiDeg yeast strain, which is resistant to rapamycin (see ‘Materials and methods’), we fused tandem FKBP motifs to Ypq1-GFP, creating Ypq1-GFP-2xFKBP (in short: Ypq1-FKBP). This strain also expresses the FRB domain fused to the N-terminus of a chain of three head-to-tail ubiquitins, which has been proposed to mimic the K63 ubiquitin linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Komander et al., 2009</xref>), creating FRB-3xUb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The addition of rapamycin induces the rapid heterodimerization between FRB-3xUb and Ypq1-FKBP, essentially ubiquitinating Ypq1.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>, the addition of rapamycin induces rapid sorting of Ypq1-FKBP from the vacuole membrane into the vacuole lumen where it is degraded within 30 min. This is much faster than the degradation kinetics after lysine withdrawal, which takes 4–6 hr, presumably because cells consume their intracellular lysine stores before ubiquitinating Ypq1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015b</xref>). As expected, in the absence of FRB-3xUb, rapamycin treatment does not induce Ypq1-FKBP degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Importantly, the RapiDeg system bypasses the requirement of Ssh4 for Ypq1 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>To test the specificity of the RapiDeg system, we added rapamycin to cells co-expressing Ypq1-mCherry and Ypq1-FKBP.

After lysine withdrawal, both Ypq1-FKBP and Ypq1-mCherry were sorted into the vacuole lumen in a Ssh4-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>). These results suggest that the addition of the FKBP motif does not affect the ability of Ypq1 to respond to lysine withdrawal.</p><p>Therefore, by using the RapiDeg system, we can induce the rapid degradation of Ypq1 in the vacuole lumen and thereby study Ypq1 sorting in mutants that would otherwise interfere with the delivery or activity of the Ssh4/Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase complex.

To avoid contamination of ILVs containing endogenous proteins, we expressed the Hse1DUB to block ILV formation by rapidly deubiquitinating cargoes and thereby preventing ESCRT assembly.

This vacuole membrane protein degradation pathway is critical for the regulation of the quantity and quality of lysosomal membrane proteins in response to intracellular or extracellular cues.</p><p>In this study, we applied two genetic approaches to identify the components required for Ypq1 sorting and degradation. We identified an E3 ligase complex (Rsp5/Ssh4), the PtdIns 3-kinase complex (Vps15/Vps34), the ESCRT complexes, and the endosome-vacuole fusion machinery (HOPS/CORVET/SNAREs). After further characterization, we found that Ypq1 cargo ubiquitination is blocked in ESCRT and endosome-vacuole fusion mutants due to missorting of Ssh4, the ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein normally found on the vacuole. We therefore developed the RapiDeg system to bypass the Ssh4 requirement for Ypq1 ubiquitination by conjugating ubiquitin to Ypq1 in a rapamycin-dependent manner. Using this system, we have shown that fusion between the vacuole and an intermediate compartment (endosome) is not required for Ypq1 delivery to the vacuole lumen. The ESCRT complexes, however, are absolutely required for Ypq1 sorting. Moreover, the ESCRTs can be recruited to the vacuole membrane to mediate the sorting of Ypq1 upon Ypq1 ubiquitination. We therefore propose that ubiquitinated vacuole membrane proteins are sorted directly on the vacuole membrane by the ESCRTs, which then internalize the cargo into ILVs that bud into the vacuole lumen.</p><p>This model is in contrast with our previously proposed model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015b</xref>) in which we proposed that Ypq1 is sorted from the vacuole membrane to an intermediate compartment (endosome) before being delivered to the vacuole lumen. The previous model was based on observations that Ypq1-GFP formed puncta in ~13% of cells after 2 hr lysine starvation, and a small number of the Ypq1-GFP puncta (9 Ypq1-GFP puncta per ~500 cells were detected) were detached from the vacuole membrane after lysine withdrawal. Based on our current study, we now believe that all the puncta, which were attached to the vacuole membrane, represent sorting intermediates on the vacuole membrane destined for direct internalization into the vacuole lumen.</p><p>While we cannot rule out the possibility that some Ypq1 is first sorted from the vacuole membrane to an intermediate compartment, the development of the RapiDeg system has allowed us to better test the requirements of this sorting pathway. We have shown that Ypq1 sorting does not require an intermediate compartment, and it appears that the vast majority of protein is sorted directly from the vacuole membrane into the vacuole lumen.</p><p>Recently, a new model for selective sorting and degradation of vacuole membrane proteins has been proposed, the intralumenal fragment (ILF) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McNally et al., 2017</xref>). In this model, vacuolar membrane proteins are sorted into the interface of two opposing vacuoles and are internalized after vacuole fusion in an ESCRT-independent manner. We do not think that this pathway plays a significant role in ubiquitin-dependent sorting of Ypq1, because Ypq1 sorting is ESCRT dependent, and does not require Sec18(NSF), Vps18(HOPS) and Vam7(Vacuole SNARE), which are required for vacuole-vacuole fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wickner, 2010</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>RapiDeg system</title><p>While we developed the RapiDeg system to study ubiquitin-dependent sorting of Ypq1, we have also shown that this system provides a simple and efficient method to induce ubiquitin conjugation to other membrane proteins. RapiDeg can be used to induce the trafficking and degradation (inactivation) of membrane proteins in the secretory (Golgi) and endocytic (PM and endosome) pathways. The two ER membrane proteins we tested were not degraded using the RapiDeg system (Erd2, Heh2).</p><p>What Lys-linkage does the head-to-tail FRB-3xUb fusion used in the RapiDeg system resemble—K48 or K63? It was previously reported that K63-linked and linear head-to-tail ubiquitins adopt equivalent open conformations, in which the ubiquitins do not form inter-molecular interactions like K48-linked ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Komander et al., 2009</xref>). It was also found that ESCRT-0 complexes preferably bind to K63-linked ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nathan et al., 2013</xref>). This may explain why the conjugates of head-to-tail FRB-3xUb fused to PM, endosome, vacuole, or Golgi membrane proteins results in their sorting, via the ESCRT machinery, into the vacuole lumen.</p><p>Therefore, the RapiDeg system provides a tractable method for the specific inactivation (degradation) of membrane proteins in the secretory and endocytic pathways. It will also be useful for studying ubiquitin dependent sorting of membrane proteins into the vacuole lumen. Importantly, RapiDeg should be adaptable for use in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Recruitment of ESCRTs to the vacuole membrane</title><p>ESCRT recruitment to the vacuole membrane uses the same components as ESCRT recruitment to the late endosome membrane, PtdIns(3)P and ubiquitinated cargo. While these environments may be similar to ESCRTs, the exact composition of vacuole membrane derived ILVs is of particular interest. The vacuole membrane is inherently resistant to its luminal lipases and proteases, while ILVs derived from this membrane, must be lysed in order to degrade their protein cargoes. We are currently investigating the specific vulnerabilities of vacuole membrane-derived ILVs, specifically: whether certain lipids are included or excluded from ILVs; whether protein concentration de-stabilizes ILVs; and whether the high curvature of ILVs allows vacuolar lipases to lyse them.</p><p>While we have shown that the ESCRTs function on the vacuole membrane, we could not detect a vacuolar ESCRT pool using fluorescent microscopy under normal conditions. We think the reason for this is twofold. First, the endosome is the major site for ILV formation due to the high concentration of ubiquitinated cargo arriving from the PM and the Golgi. Second, the large surface area of the vacuole reduces local ESCRT concentrations below our present detection limits.</p><p>How could ATP depletion allow us to visualize Ypq1 sorting puncta, and ESCRT recruitment to the vacuole membrane after rapamycin treatment? Primarily, we reason that these puncta represent ESCRT sorting complexes which have stalled at an intermediate step due to loss of function of Vps4, an ATP-dependent and essential ESCRT component. Further, these sorting intermediates may be stabilized because ubiquitination of RapiDeg cargo cannot be removed by deubiquintinases, causing early ESCRTs to remain engaged with cargo. Moreover, it is possible that stalled sorting complexes can cluster together, this may be due to the ability of the ESCRT-0 complex to form oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mayers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wollert and Hurley, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Multiple sites and roles for the ESCRT machinery</title><p>The ESCRTs were first characterized as cargo sorting machinery required for ILV formation at the endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Odorizzi et al., 1998</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Randy Schekman as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Randy Schekman (Reviewer #1) and Alexey J. Merz (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Zhu et al., present compelling evidence that vacuolar transporters, particularly the Lys transporter Ypq1, are turned over by internalization directly into the vacuole mediated by the ESCRT machinery. To make this claim, they devised growth and fluorescent reporters to screen the non-essential yeast gene library to identify candidates for this turnover pathway. Among the genes turned up, ESCRT, PI3kinase and vacuole-endosome fusion proteins were identified. Importantly, they also devised a clever test of the direct or indirect role of these genes by creating a rapamycin-induced ubiquitylation tag that bypasses the requirement for upstream functions that may be necessary to localize Ssh4, the Rsp5 ubiqitin ligase receptor, to the vacuole membrane. Using this RapiDeg approach, the authors show that the vacuole-endosome fusion functions act upstream of the ESCRT machinery, which they argue acts directly on ubiquitylated Ypq1 to promote internalization into the vacuole. These results are extended to demonstrate that ESCRT proteins can be recruited directly to the vacuole surface dependent on the action of the PI3 kinase and that ESCRT punctae can be observed to form on the vacuole surface in situations where the internalization process is delayed in cells incubated with energy poisons.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Emr group published a different conclusion two years ago with the claim that Ypq1 is withdrawn from the vacuole surface to an endosome-like organelle into which ubiquitylated Ypq1 is internalized followed by fusion of the MVB back to the vacuole (Li et al., 2015).</p><p>To be fair, the previous work established many of the basic facts upon which the current work has relied for more incisive analysis. However at least some of the work in that previous paper would appear to be contradicted by results in the current manuscript. For example:</p><p>&quot;To directly test if the recycling hypothesis is correct, we used a strain (YYR36, Table S1) co-expressing Ypq1-GFP and Vph1-mCherry from the chromosome to investigate if lysine withdrawal can trigger a selective sorting of Ypq1-GFP. Indeed, after lysine withdrawal, we observed selective sorting of Ypq1-GFP into a compartment that did not co-localize with Vph1-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Many of these vacuole membrane-attached compartments appeared to be tethered by the HOPS complex, as indicated by the colocalization of Ypq1-GFP with Vps18-mCherry and their movement together on the vacuole surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C and 5D</xref> and Movie S1). This was consistent with the essential role of Vps18 for Ypq1 degradation and further suggested that tethering the Ypq1-GFP compartment to the vacuole is a critical intermediate step.&quot;</p><p>How can this previous observation be reconciled with the current results of a direct internalization into the vacuole? I appreciate that the lysine withdrawal approach used previously results in a much slower degradation of Ypq1 than the RapiDeg trick developed here affords, and that may be explained by a more indirect effect that progresses over the prolonged incubation necessary to observe the lysine withdrawal effect. However, one could argue that lysine deprivation is the more natural path for Ypq1 degradation.</p><p>Nonetheless, the current results are highly original and persuasive and certainly merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, but the authors must do a better job in placing the new results in the context of their previous publication. As it stands, the authors offered no explanation of the discrepancy with their previous paper. They owe the readers who are knowledgeable in this area a more thorough treatment of the subject.

Did the Brett group use different vacuolar membrane proteins in their investigation? If not, then how might the two results be reconciled?</italic> </p><p>Brett’s group has characterized a pathway in which vacuole membrane proteins are sorted into the interface of two opposing vacuoles, and are internalized after vacuole fusion in an ESCRT independent manor. They did not use Ypq1 when characterizing this pathway. Further, since Ypq1 degradation requires ESCRTs, and does not require the vacuole-vacuole fusion machinery, it appears that ubiquitin dependent turnover of vacuole membrane proteins uses a distinct pathway from the “Intra-Luminal Fragment pathway”. We have discussed the ILF pathway and its relation to Ypq1 sorting in the Discussion.</p><p> <italic>3) Subsection “ESCRT and endosome-vacuole fusion mutants block Ypq1 ubiquitination”, &quot;Ssh4 delivery appeared to require this fusion machinery&quot;. This statement lacks data support. Furthermore, the ts mutants of the fusion machinery are supposed to not affect Ssh4 molecules that have already reached vacuole before temperature shift. Are there explanations for why preexisting Ssh4 on the vacuole membrane is not sufficient to support Ypq1 ubiquitination after temperature shift?</italic> </p><p>We have included imaging data that shows that Ssh4 accumulates in pre-vacuolar compartments in both <italic>vam3ts</italic> and <italic>vps18ts</italic> cells at non-permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Our data suggest that biosynthetic Ssh4 is required, and that the pre-existing pool of Ssh4 may be insufficient for Ypq1 ubiquitination (subsection “ESCRT and endosome-vacuole fusion mutants block Ypq1 ubiquitination“). In addition, since Ssh4 localizes to both the vacuole membrane and lumen, Ssh4 appears to be constitutively turned over, which will deplete the pre-existing Ssh4 pool.</p><p> <italic>4) The strongest line of evidence against the direct invagination hypothesis in Li et al. Molecular Cell 2015 is the fact that upon lysine withdraw, Ypq1 was observed on structures detached from the vacuole, including: Ypq1-GFP punctae detached from the vacuole surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and Figure S5B in Li et al.), Ypq1-nGFP and Vps23-cGFP split-GFP punctae detached from the vacuole surface (Figure S4 in Li et al.), and Ypq1-nGFP and cGFP-Ub split-GFP punctae detached from the vacuole surface (Figure S6D in Li et al.). The authors should discuss possible explanations of these earlier observations. Is it possible that Ypq1-SBP internalization and RapiDeg-induced Ypq1 internalization mainly go through the direct invagination route, whereas lysine withdrawal-induced Ypq1 internalization at least partially goes through an intermediate compartment?</italic> </p><p>We have addressed these experiments in the Discussion. While we cannot rule out that some Ypq1 can be sorted to an intermediate compartment, we have shown that ubiquitinated Ypq1 readily sorts into the vacuole lumen in mutants that block vacuole delivery (<italic>sec18ts, vam7ts, vps18ts</italic>). We believe our data demonstrate that the trafficking of Ypq1-GFP, Ypq1-SBP and Ypq1 in the RapiDeg system are all mediated by the same pathway, since the recognition of the ub-cargo by ESCRTs can occur directly at the vacuole membrane as both signals for ESCRT binding — ub and PI3P are present on the vacuole.</p><p> <italic>5) The authors show persuasively that brief shift to nonpermissive temperature for vps18 and vam3 tsf mutants prevents Ypq1 ubiquitination upon lysine withdrawal. They argue (Results section) that this is due to the absence of Ssh4 on the vacuole, but that key inference is not tested by looking at Ssh4 localization. It should be.</italic> </p><p>We have included imaging data that shows that Ssh4 accumulates in pre-vacuolar compartments in both <italic>vam3ts</italic> and <italic>vps18ts</italic> cells at non-permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We do not say that Ssh4 is absent from the vacuole membrane in these conditions, but that the pre-existing pool is not sufficient for ubiquitination.</p><p> <italic>6) As a control for the blocks imposed by docking and fusion tsf mutants, Mup1 traffic through the MVB to the vacuole is examined. This is a good control but it involves a heterotypic rather than homotypic vacuole fusion event. Adding to this concern, it's a bit surprising to see wt/class A non-fragmented vacuole morphologies in the vps18tsf and vam7 tsf mutants after 45' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) or 75' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) at nonpermissive temperature.</italic> </p><p>We do not see significant vacuole fragmentation in our experiments since they are done in relatively short time periods. Signiant vacuole fragmentation is seen after 6hrs of inactivation of these mutants, indicating that they block homotypic vacuole fusion.</p><p> <italic>7) Since rapamycin treatment shuts off TORC1 with a cascade of effects on protein synthesis degradation, and stress signaling, more controls are critical. Missing controls include: monitoring of substrate reporters with mutant rapamycin non-binding FKBP domain; absence of FRB-Ub3; and/or the use of rapamycin-insensitive TOR1 alleles.</italic></p><p>We have clarified that the RapiDeg strain is rapamycin resistant in the Results section. The Material and methods previously described the construction of this strain: “WT strains (SEY6210 or SEY6210.1) were made rapamycin-resistant by transforming a PCR fragment encoding the dominant <italic>TOR1</italic> mutant (S1972I) and selected for growth on YPD plates (supplemented with 1μg/ml rapamycin). <italic>FPR1 (FKBP-12</italic>) was knocked out using homologous recombination”. We have included a control experiment showing rapamycin treatment does not induce Ypq1-FKBP degradation in the absence of FRB-3xUb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
