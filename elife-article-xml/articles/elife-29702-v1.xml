We now show these si/shRNAs kill cancer cells through canonical RNAi by targeting the 3’UTR of critical survival genes in a unique form of off-target effect we call DISE (death induced by survival gene elimination). Drosha and Dicer-deficient cells, devoid of most miRNAs, are hypersensitive to DISE, suggesting cellular miRNAs protect cells from this form of cell death. By testing 4666 shRNAs derived from the CD95 and CD95L mRNA sequences and an unrelated control gene, Venus, we have identified many toxic sequences - most of them located in the open reading frame of CD95L. We propose that specific toxic RNAi-active sequences present in the genome can kill cancer cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29702.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells store their genetic code within molecules of DNA. Some of this information will be copied into chemically similar molecules called RNAs, from which the sequence of letters in the genetic code can be translated to build proteins. However, these messenger RNAs are not the only RNA molecules that cells can make. MicroRNAs are other short pieces of RNA that closely match sequences in parts of certain messenger RNAs. The messenger RNAs targeted by microRNAs are broken down inside the cell, which reduces how much protein can be produced from them.

Putzbach, Gao, Patel et al. have now analyzed all of the siRNAs that can be made from the messenger RNAs for CD95 and CD95L to mediate RNAi in cancer cells. This revealed that several messenger RNAs, other than those for CD95 and CD95L, were unintentionally being targeted, including many that code for proteins that cells need to survive. Further examination of the messenger RNA for CD95 and CD95L showed that they contain short sequences that are similar to those in the messenger RNAs of the genes that encode these survival proteins.

RNAi has been used in several studies to identify genes critical for the survival of human cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hadji et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morgens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). During RNAi, gene expression is inhibited by small interfering (si)RNAs, small hairpin (sh)RNAs or micro (mi)RNAs. miRNAs are generated as primary transcripts in the nucleus where they undergo processing to pre-miRNAs by the Drosha-DGCR8 complex before being exported to the cytosol by exportin 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ha and Kim, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krol et al., 2010</xref>). Once in the cytosol, pre-miRNAs and shRNAs are cleaved by Dicer, a type III RNase that functions in complex with TRBP, generating 21–23 nucleotide long fragments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that have two nucleotide 3' overhangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zamore et al., 2000</xref>). DsRNA fragments or chemically synthesized double-stranded siRNAs are loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) as single-stranded RNAs (the guide RNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Siomi and Siomi, 2009</xref>). A near-perfect complementarity between the guide strand of the si/miRNA and the target mRNA sequence results in cleavage of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pratt and MacRae, 2009</xref>). Incomplete complementarity results in inhibition of protein translation and contributes to mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2010</xref>). mRNA targeting is mostly determined by the seed sequence, positions 2-7/8 of the guide strand, which is fully complementary to the seed match in the 3'UTR of targeted mRNAs. Similar to miRNAs, although not fully explored, siRNAs and shRNAs also target multiple mRNAs besides the mRNAs they were designed to silence—a phenomenon commonly referred to as off-target effect (OTE)—that is generally sought to be avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birmingham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jackson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The death receptor CD95 (Fas/APO-1) mediates induction of apoptosis when bound by its cognate ligand CD95L, most prominently in the context of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krammer, 2000</xref>). However, more recently, it has become apparent that the CD95/CD95L system has multiple tumor-promoting activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peter et al., 2007</xref>). CD95 signaling promotes cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2010</xref>), increases motility and invasiveness of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnhart et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kleber et al., 2008</xref>), and promotes cancer stemness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ceppi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drachsler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qadir et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, we reported tumors barely grew <italic>in vivo</italic> when the CD95 gene was deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hadji et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it appeared consistent that multiple shRNAs and siRNAs targeting either CD95 or CD95L slowed down cancer cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) and engaged a distinct form of cell death characterized by the activation of multiple cell death pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hadji et al., 2014</xref>). This unique form of cell death cannot be inhibited by conventional cell death or signaling pathway inhibitors or by knockdown of any single gene in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hadji et al., 2014</xref>); it preferentially affects transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hadji et al., 2014</xref>) including cancer stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ceppi et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we report that loading of CD95 and CD95L-derived sequences (si/shRNAs targeting CD95 or CD95L) into the RISC elicits a distinct form of cell death that results from the targeting of multiple survival genes in a unique form of OTE.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>si/shRNAs kill cells in the absence of the targeted site</title><p>More than 80% of multiple-tested shRNAs or siRNAs designed to target either CD95 or CD95L were toxic to multiple cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hadji et al., 2014</xref>). We have now extended this analysis to Dicer substrate 27mer DsiRNAs designed to target CD95L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2005</xref>]). All five DsiRNAs displayed toxicity when introduced into HeyA8 cells at 5 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) reinforcing our previous observation that the majority of CD95 and CD95L targeting si/shRNAs are toxic to cancer cells. We also analyzed a data set of a genome-wide analysis of 216 cells infected with a pooled library of the TRC shRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowley et al., 2014</xref>). Most of the shRNAs we have tested were found to be depleted in the infected cell lines included in this study. The following shRNAs were found to be depleted in the listed percentage of the 216 cell lines tested: shL4 (99.5%), shL1 (96.8%), shR6 (88.9%), shR7 (75%), shR3 (71.8%), shL2 (67.1%), shR5 (38.4%), shL5 (26.4%), and shR8 (21.3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistent with our data, shL1 and shR6 were found to be two of the most toxic shRNAs. Again in this independent analysis, the majority of tested shRNAs (67%) targeting either CD95 or CD95L killed more than half of all tested cancer cell lines.</p><p>Interestingly, a more recent RNAi screen did not report toxicity after expressing shRNAs against CD95 or CD95L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morgens et al., 2016</xref>). The authors of this study used a second-generation shRNA platform based on a miR-30 backbone. To determine the source of the discrepancy in the data, we generated miR-30-based Tet-inducible versions of some of our most toxic shRNAs (shL1, shL3, shL4, shR5, shR6, and shR7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and found none of them to be highly toxic to HeyA8 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). To determine their knockdown efficiency, we induced their expression in cells carrying sensor plasmids in which the fluorophore Venus was linked to either the CD95L or CD95 open reading frame (ORF). Expression of most of these miR-30-based shRNAs also did not efficiently silence Venus expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In contrast, two of our most toxic shRNAs shL3 and shR6 when expressed in the Tet-inducible pTIP vector not only killed HeyA8 cells, but also very efficiently suppressed Venus fluorescence in cells expressing the targeted Venus sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These data suggest that the levels of shRNAs produced from the miR-30-based vector may not be sufficient to be toxic to the cancer cells. Because expression levels of shRNAs are difficult to titer, we used siRNAs to determine the concentration of the toxic CD95L-derived siL3 required to kill HeyA8 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Growth was effectively blocked (and cells died, data not shown) when siL3 was transfected at 1 nM—a concentration well below the commonly used and recommended siRNA concentration of 5–50 nM)—but not at 0.1 nM. These data suggest that this form of toxicity does not require high amounts of si- or shRNAs; however, the low expression we achieved from the miR-30 based shRNA vectors was not enough to effectively induce the toxicity. Because these miR-30-based shRNA vectors were developed to reduce off-target effects, the toxicity of CD95 and CD95L-targeting si/shRNAs described by us and others could be due to an OTE. While this was a plausible explanation, the high percentage of toxic si/shRNAs derived from CD95 and CD95L seemed to exclude a standard OTE and pointed at a survival activity of CD95 and CD95L.</p><p>We therefore tested whether exogenously added recombinant CD95L protein could protect cells from the toxicity of CD95L-derived shRNAs. When NB7 cells were incubated with different concentrations of a soluble form of CD95L (S2), toxicity exerted by shL1 was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel). NB7 neuroblastoma cells were chosen for these experiments because they lack expression of caspase-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Teitz et al., 2000</xref>) and hence are completely resistant to the apoptosis-inducing effects of CD95L. An ostensible moderate and dose-dependent protection was detected when cells were treated with a highly active leucine-zipper tagged CD95L (LzCD95L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, center panel). However, this effect is likely due to the growth-promoting activities of soluble CD95L, which also significantly affected the growth of the cells expressing a scrambled control shRNA (seen for both S2 and LzCD95L). The recombinant LzCD95L protein was active, as demonstrated by its apoptosis-inducing capacity in CD95 apoptosis-sensitive MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29702.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Exogenous CD95L or CD95 proteins do not protect cells from toxicity of CD95L/CD95-derived shRNAs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Left:</italic> Percent cell confluence over time of NB7 cells after infection with either pLKO-shScr or pLKO-shL1 and concurrent treatment with different concentrations of soluble CD95L protein (S2).

We first introduced eight silent mutations into the sites targeted by either shL1 or shL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and expressed these proteins in NB7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Both mutant constructs were highly resistant to knockdown by their cognate shRNA but still sensitive to knockdown by the other targeting shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Overexpression of these shRNA-resistant versions of the CD95L ORF did not protect the cells from shL1 or shL3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, expression of full length CD95L slowed down the growth of the NB7 cells right after infection with the lentivirus despite the absence of caspase-8 (data not shown). Infection with shRNAs was therefore performed 9 days after introducing CD95L when the cells had recovered and expressed significant CD95L protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We then mutated the CD95 mRNA in the targeted site of shR6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Neither expression of wild-type (wt) nor mutated (MUT) CD95 in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) reduced the toxicity when cells were infected with the pLKO-shR6 or another toxic lentiviral shRNA, pLKO-shR7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These data suggested that neither exogenously added recombinant CD95L or exogenously expressed CD95L or CD95 protein can protect cells from toxic shRNAs derived from these genes.</p><p>To determine whether we could prevent cancer cells from dying by this form of cell death by deleting the endogenous targeted sites, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing to excise sites targeted by different shRNAs and siRNAs in both alleles of the CD95 and CD95L genes. We first deleted a 41 nt piece of the CD95L gene in 293T cells, that contained the target site for shL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). While internal primers could not detect CD95L mRNA in three tested clones, primers outside of the deleted area did detect CD95L mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, and data not shown). Three clones with this shL3 Δ41 deletion were pooled and tested for toxicity by shL3 expressed from a Tet-inducible plasmid (pTIP-shL3). Compared to a pool of control cells transfected only with the Cas9 plasmid, the 293T shL3 Δ41 cells were equally sensitive to the toxic shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

In all cases, homozygous deletions were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To confirm the deletion of the shR6 target site, we infected HeyA8 cells treated with the Cas9 plasmid only and HeyA8 with a homozygous deletion of the shR6 site with shR6 and, as positive controls, with shR2 (targeting the CD95 ORF) and shR6' (targeting the CD95 3'UTR). Five days after infection, CD95 mRNA was quantified by real time PCR using a primer located outside the 227 bp deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The mutated CD95 mRNA was still detectable in the shR6 Δ227 cells. While shR2 and shR6' (both targeting outside the deleted region) caused knockdown of CD95 mRNA in both the Cas9 control and the shR6 Δ227 cells, shR6 could only reduce mRNA expression in the Cas9 control cells. These data document that HeyA8 CD95 shR6 Δ227 cells no longer harbor the sequence targeted by shR6.</p><p>Now having HeyA8 cells lacking one of three RNAi-targeted sites in either CD95 or CD95L, we could test the role of the CD95 and CD95L gene products in protecting HeyA8 cells from the death induced by either shRNA (shL3 and shR6, two different vectors: pLKO or the Tet inducible pTIP) or the siRNA siL3. In all cases, the shRNA or siRNA that targeted the deleted region was still fully toxic to the target-site deleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>). We saw efficient growth reduction and cell death in siL3 site-deleted cells transfected with as little as 1 nM siL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, and data not shown). These data firmly establish that cells were not dying due to the knockdown of either CD95 or CD95L.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Involvement of canonical RNAi</title><p>shRNAs and early generation naked siRNAs showed general toxicity when introduced in large amounts, presumably by eliciting an interferon (IFN) response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marques and Williams, 2005</xref>) or by saturating the RISC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grimm et al., 2006</xref>). However, both chemically modified siRNAs at very low concentrations and lentiviral shRNAs at an MOI &lt;1 were still toxic (data not shown). We therefore decided to test whether the observed toxicity involved canonical RNAi and activity of the RISC. To test shRNAs or siRNAs targeting CD95L, we introduced the Venus-CD95L sensor (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel) into HeyA8 CD95 protein k.o. cells we had generated in the process of deleting the shR6 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, clone #2 was used for the following studies; see figure legend for strategy and characterization of the clones). While double-stranded (ds)-siL3 effectively silenced Venus expression and induced toxicity, neither the sense nor the antisense single-stranded (ss)RNAs significantly decreased Venus expression or induced toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition, no activity was found when ds-siL3, synthesized as deoxyribo-oligonucleotides, was transfected into the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Using this type of analysis, we tested a number of modified siRNAs for RNAi activity and toxicity. For siRNAs to be fully active, they require 3' overhangs on both strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernstein et al., 2001</xref>). Converting siL3 to a blunt-end duplex resulted in substantial loss of RNAi activity and toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Due to the topology of the RISC, siRNA activity is decreased by modification of the 5’ end of the antisense/guide strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiu and Rana, 2003</xref>). To test whether cell death induced by siL3 would be affected by a bulky modification, we placed a Cy5 moiety at any of the four possible ends of the siL3 duplex. Only when the siL3 duplex carried a 5’ modification in the guide strand did it prevent RNAi activity and toxicity; modifications in the three other positions had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This was confirmed for another siRNA, siL2. To test whether the toxicity of siL3 required association with a macromolecular complex, which would be consistent with RISC involvement, we performed a competition experiment. HeyA8 cells were transfected with 10 nM of siL3, and a mutated nontoxic oligonucleotide, siL3MUT, was titered in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). siL3MUT reduced the growth inhibitory activity of siL3 in a dose-dependent fashion suggesting that siL3 and siL3MUT compete for the same binding site in the cells, pointing at involvement of the RISC.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29702.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Toxicity of CD95L-derived siRNAs involves canonical RNAi activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Percent cell confluence (<italic>left</italic>) and total green object integrated intensity (<italic>right</italic>) over time of a HeyA8 CD95 knockout clone (ΔR6 cl#2) expressing the Venus-CD95L sensor either untreated (Ctr) or after transfection with 25 nM of single-stranded sense, single-stranded antisense, or double-stranded (ds) siScr or siL3 siRNAs.

Growth of parental HCT116 cells was impaired after infection with shL3 or shR6 viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, left panel). Consistent with the requirement of Dicer to process shRNAs, Dicer<sup>-/-</sup> cells were completely resistant to the toxic shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, center panel). This was also supported by the inability of shR6 to silence CD95 protein expression in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Dicer<sup>-/-</sup> cells were not resistant to toxic siRNAs as these cells died when transfected with siL3, which is consistent with mature siRNAs not needing further processing by Dicer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, center panel). Interestingly, Drosha<sup>-/-</sup> cells were hypersensitive to the two toxic shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, right panel, p&lt;0.0001, according to a polynomial fitting model), and shR6 efficiently knocked down CD95 expression in Drosha<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

The hypersensitivity of the Drosha<sup>-/-</sup> cells to toxic si/shRNAs and of Dicer<sup>-/-</sup> cells to toxic siRNAs can be explained by Drosha<sup>-/-</sup> and Dicer<sup>-/-</sup> cells allowing much more efficient uptake of mature toxic RNAi-active species into the RISC because they are almost completely devoid of competing endogenous miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To determine the contribution of the siRNA seed sequence to their toxicity, we generated a set of chimeric siRNAs in which we systematically replaced nucleotides of the toxic siL3 siRNA with nucleotides of a nontoxic scrambled siRNA.

HeyA8 cells expressing both the Venus-CD95L sensor (to monitor level of knockdown) and a Nuc-Red plasmid to fluorescently label nuclei (to monitor the effects on cell growth) were transfected with 5 nM of the chimeric siRNAs; total green fluorescence and the number of red fluorescent nuclei were quantified over time. The siL3 control transfected cells showed an almost complete suppression of the green fluorescence and high toxicity. In the top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, the data are summarized in which siL3 nucleotides were stepwise replaced with siScr nucleotides from the seed sequence end. Both RNAi and toxicity were profoundly reduced when three of the terminal siL3 nucleotides were replaced with the siScr nucleotides in those positions, suggesting the seed region (6mer highlighted in blue) is critical for both activities. Consistently, as shown in the bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, when siL3 nucleotides were replaced with siScr nucleotides from the non-seed end, neither RNAi nor the toxicity was diminished until replacements affected residues in the seed region. These data suggest the 6mer seed sequence of siL3 was critical for both RNAi activity and its toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Toxic si/shRNAs cause downregulation of survival genes</title><p>A general OTE by RNAi has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birmingham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jackson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2005</xref>). However, this was been reported to cause toxicity in most cases, and the targeted mRNAs were difficult to predict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birmingham et al., 2006</xref>). The fact that 22 of the tested CD95 and CD95L-targeting sh- and si/DsiRNAs were toxic to many cancer cells evoking similar morphological and biological responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hadji et al., 2014</xref>) generated a conundrum: Could an OTE trigger a specific biology? To test this, we expressed two toxic shRNAs - one targeting CD95L (shL3) and one targeting CD95 (shR6) - in cells lacking their respective target sequences and subjected the RNA isolated from these cells to an RNA-Seq analysis. In order to detect effects that were independent of cell type, delivery method of the shRNA, or targeted gene, we expressed shL3 in 293T (ΔshL3) cells using the Tet-inducible vector pTIP and shR6 in HeyA8 (ΔshR6) cells using the pLKO vector. In each case, changes in RNA abundance were compared to cells expressing a non-targeting shRNA in matching vectors. Total RNA was harvested in all cases at either the 50 hr time point (before the onset of cell death) or at the 100 hr time point (during cell death) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To achieve high stringency, the data were then analyzed in two ways: first, using a conventional alignment-based analysis to identify genes for which the mRNA changed more than 1.5-fold (and an adjusted p-value of less than 0.05) and second, by a read-based method, in which we first identified all reads that changed &gt;1.5 fold and then subjected each read to a BLAST search to identify the gene it was derived from. Only RNAs that were detected by both methods were considered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The combination of the analyses resulted in one mRNA that was upregulated and 11 mRNAs that were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Using an arrayed qPCR approach, most of these detected mRNA changes were validated for both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, for nine of the eleven genes, published data suggest they are either highly upregulated in cancer and/or critical for the survival of cancer cells, as their inhibition or knockdown resulted in either growth reduction or induction of various forms of cell death (see legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> for details). Significantly, six of these eleven downregulated genes were recently identified in two independent genome-wide lethality screens to be critical for cancer cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blomen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Considering these two screens only identified 6.6% of human genes to be critical for cell survival, we found a significant enrichment (54.5%, p-value=3×10<sup>−6</sup> according to binomial distribution) of these survival genes among the genes downregulated during the cell death induced by either shL3 or shR6. All six survival genes are either highly amplified or mutated in human cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In addition to these six genes, GNB1 and HIST1H1C were reported to be required fitness genes in a recent high-resolution CRISPR-based screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hart et al., 2015</xref>). A kinetic analysis showed most of the deregulated mRNAs were downregulated early with a significant effect already at 14 hr, more than two days before the onset of cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref> and data not shown). This suggested the cells were dying because of the silencing of multiple critical survival genes, providing an explanation for why multiple cell death pathways were activated. We therefore call this type of cell death DISE (for Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29702.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Toxic shRNAs derived from CD95 and CD95L cause downregulation of critical survival genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of RNA-Seq work flow for total RNA sample prepared both before (50 hr) and during (100 hr) DISE after expressing either shR6 or shL3 from different vector systems (i.e. pLKO-shR6 and pTIP-shL3) in different cells (HeyA8 shR6 Δ227 cells and 293T shL3 Δ41 cells).

The following describes the 11 genes that were significantly downregulated after introducing the toxic shRNAs shL3 or shR6 into cancer cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and some of their cancer relevant activities. (1) CAPZA1 (capping actin protein of muscle Z-line alpha subunit 1) is an actin capping protein. CAPZA1 knockdown has been reported to cause disassembly of autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mi et al., 2015</xref>). It is overexpressed in malignant melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). (2) CCT3 (chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 3) is part of a chaperone complex that folds various proteins including actin and tubulin. CCT3 is required for proper mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). (3) FSTL1 (follistatin-like 1) is a putative activin-binding protein. Knockdown of FSTL1 in lung cancer cells resulted in mitotic arrest followed by apoptosis promoted by the activation of caspase-3 and −9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2016</xref>). FSTL1 is downregulated during cellular senescence of human mesenchymal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yoo et al., 2013</xref>). (4) FUBP1 (far upstream element binding protein 1). A lack of FUBP1 causes a cell-autonomous defect in the maintenance of fetal and adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). FUBP1-deficient adult HSCs exhibit significant transcriptional changes, including upregulation of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21 and the pro-apoptotic Noxa molecule, suggesting they undergo apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rabenhorst et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, FUBP1 binds to an upstream element of the c-myc promoter and regulates c-myc mRNA level, thus regulating proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jang et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, FUBP1 is upregulated in many tumors and acts as an oncoprotein by stimulating proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumgarten et al., 2014</xref>). (5) GNB1 (G-protein beta submit 1) is tumor-promoting in breast cancer. Data suggest that GNB1 plays an important role in the mTOR-related anti-apoptosis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wazir et al., 2013</xref>). (6) HIST1H1C. A specific role of this particular histone in cancer cell survival has not yet been described. (Knockdown causes cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sancho et al., 2008</xref>). (7) NAA50 (N(alpha)-acetyltransferase 50, NatE catalytic subunit) is required for sister chromatid separation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hou et al., 2007</xref>). (8) NUCKS1 (nuclear casein kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase substrate 1) is a chromatin-associated protein with a role in the DNA damage response. Knocking down NUCKS1 causes chromosomal breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parplys et al., 2015</xref>). (9) PRELID3B (PRELI domain containing 3B) is an inner mitochondrial protein. Knocking down PRELID3B decreases cell viability (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PRELID3B">http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PRELID3B</ext-link>). (10) SNRPE (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide E). siRNA-mediated depletion of SNRPE stimulated autophagy and led to a marked reduction of cell viability in breast, lung, and melanoma cancer cell lines, whereas it had little effect on the survival of the nonmalignant MCF-10A breast epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Quidville et al., 2013</xref>). (11) TFRC (transferrin receptor). Blocking TFRC function with a neutralizing antibody inhibits cell proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pham et al., 2014</xref>). Suppression of TFRC led to apoptosis of renal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gui et al., 2013</xref>) and cell cycle arrest in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2014</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29702-fig4-figsupp1-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig4s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29702.011</object-id><label>Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Characterization of the six genes downregulated in shL3 and shR6-treated cells and found to be critical survival genes in lethality screens.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29702-fig4-figsupp2-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig4s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29702.012</object-id><label>Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>Histones are downregulated in all forms of DISE but are not the most highly expressed genes in cells.</title><p>MA plots comparing the expression level (counts per million, CPM) and fold change in the four RNA Seq data sets in this study.

Individual knockdown of seven of the targeted genes resulted in reduced cell growth when compared to cells transfected with a pool of scrambled siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To mimic the effect of the CD95 and CD95L-derived shRNAs, we treated HeyA8 cells with a combination of siRNA pools targeting these seven genes. Remarkably, 1 nM of this siRNA mixture (35.7 pM of each individual siRNA) was sufficient to effectively reduce growth of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and also cause substantial cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>), suggesting it is possible to kill cancer cells with very small amounts of siRNAs targeting a network of these survival genes.</p><p>To test the generality of this phenomenon, we inducibly expressed another CD95L derived shRNA, shL1, in 293T cells using the pTIP vector, and transfected HeyA8 cells with 25 nM siL3. We subjected the cells to RNA-Seq analysis 100 hrs and 48 hrs after addition of Dox or after transfection, respectively. To determine whether survival genes were downregulated in all cases of sh/siRNA-induced cell death, we used a list of 1882 survival genes and 423 genes not required for survival (nonsurvival genes) recently identified in a CRISPR lethality screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We subjected the four ranked RNA-Seq data sets to a gene set enrichment analysis using the two gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In all cases, survival genes were significantly enriched towards the top of the ranked lists (most downregulated). In contrast, nonsurvival genes were not enriched. One interesting feature of DISE that emerged was the substantial loss of histones. Of the 16 genes that were significantly downregulated in cells treated with any of the four sh/siRNAs, 12 were histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). While it might be expected that dying cells would downregulate highly expressed genes such as histones, we believe that losing histones is a specific aspect of DISE because a detailed analysis revealed the downregulated histones were not the most highly expressed genes in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition, almost as many genes with similarly high expression were found to be upregulated in cells after DISE induction.</p><p>A Metascape analysis revealed genes involved in mitotic cell cycle, DNA conformation change, and macromolecular complex assembly were among the most significantly downregulated across all cells in which DISE was induced by any of the four sh/siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

RNA-Seq analysis performed for the small RNA fraction confirmed in all cases (shScr and shL3 in pTIP, and shScr and shR6 in pLKO), the shRNAs in the cells were cleaved in a way resulting in the predominant formation of an siRNA shifted one nucleotide away from the shRNA loop region (black arrow heads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This allowed us to design toxic mature siRNAs based on the sequences of shL3 and shR6. These shRNA-to-siRNA converts were toxic to HeyA8 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) confirming that the observed toxicity was not limited to the TRC shRNA platform, but based on a sequence-specific activity of the si/shRNAs.</p><p>The generalizability of the Sylamer results for shL3 and shR6 was tested with cells treated with either shL1 or siL3. In both cases, when the ranked RNA Seq data were subjected to a Sylamer analysis, the seed matches of the si/shRNA introduced were again significantly enriched in the 3'UTR of downregulated RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In none of the Sylamer analyses of the four data sets, did we see enrichment of seed matches in the 3'UTRs of downregulated RNAs that matched the passenger strand. In all cases, the only significantly enriched sequences matched the seed sequences in the guide strand of the si/shRNAs we introduced.</p><p>Our data suggested that DISE inducing si/shRNAs caused an early loss of survival genes, and at the same time downregulated RNAs through canonical RNAi targeting their 3'UTR. However, it was not clear whether the most highly downregulated survival genes were targeted in their 3'UTR by RNAi-active sequences. We determined as little as six nucleotides dictated whether an siRNA killed cancer cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). 10 of the 11 downregulated genes identified in the RNA-Seq analysis described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref> contained multiple 6mer seed matches for either shL3 and/or shR6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). It is therefore likely the two shRNAs, shL3 and shR6, killed cells by targeting a network of genes enriched in critical survival genes through RNAi. The only gene without an shL3 or shR6 seed match was HIST1H1C. Interestingly, only four of the histones downregulated in cells after treatment with any of the four tested si/shRNAs had a 3'UTR (underlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) suggesting that most histones were not directly targeted by the si/shRNAs.</p><p>Using arrayed qPCR, we tested whether other toxic shRNAs targeting either CD95 or CD95L also caused downregulation of some of the 11 genes silenced by shL3 and shR6. HeyA8 cells were transfected with the toxic siRNA siL3 (RNA harvested at 80 hrs) or the toxic shRNAs shL1, shL3 or shR7 (RNA harvested at 100 hrs). While shL1 did not have much of an effect on the expression of these genes, shR7 caused downregulation of 7 of 11 of the same genes targeted by shL3 even though the 6mer seed matches of the two shRNAs are very different (CTTTGT for shL3 and GGAGGA for shR7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether preferential targeting of survival genes was responsible for the death of the cells, we tested whether there was an association between the presence or absence of a predicted seed match in the 3'UTR for the si/shRNA introduced and whether a gene would be downregulated (&gt;1.5 fold downregulated, p&lt;0.05) among survival genes using the Fisher's Exact test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In almost all cases, this analysis revealed that survival genes containing a predicted seed match in their 3'UTR were statistically more likely to be downregulated than survival genes without such a motif. The analysis with shL1 treated cells did not reach statistical significance, likely due to the fact that this shRNA was found to be very toxic and the 100 hr time point may have been too late to observe evidence of significant targeting. This interpretation is supported by the observation that the significance for both shL3 and shR6 to target survival genes was higher at 50 hrs when compared to the 100 hr time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and that the Sylamer analysis of the shL1 treated cells was less significant after 100 hrs of treatment than any of the other Sylamer analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Now that we had established that the toxicity of the studied shRNAs involved targeting of survival genes rather than CD95 or CD95L, we had to assume that when studying a larger set of shRNAs that the level of knockdown of the targeted genes and the toxicity were not strictly correlated. This was confirmed for the TRC shRNAs targeting the ORF or 3'UTR of CD95 in CD95 high expressing HeyA8 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). While some of the toxic shRNAs efficiently silenced CD95 (i.e. shR6 and shR2) few did not (i.e. shR5). In summary, our analyses suggest that cells die by DISE due to an early and selective silencing of survival genes through targeting seed matches in their 3'UTR followed by the downregulation of histones.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Identification of toxic shRNAs in the CD95L and CD95 mRNAs</title><p>The majority of commercially available si-, Dsi-, and shRNAs targeting either CD95 or CD95L were highly toxic to cancer cells. We therefore asked whether these two genes contained additional sequences with similar activity. To test all shRNAs derived from either CD95L or CD95, we synthesized all possible shRNAs, 21 nucleotides long, present in the ORF or the 3'UTR of either CD95L or CD95 starting with the first 21 nucleotides after the start codon, and then shifting the sequence by one nucleotide along the entire ORF and 3'UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We also included shRNAs from a gene not expressed in mammalian cells and not expected to contain toxic sequences, Venus. All 4666 oligonucleotides (700 Venus, 825 CD95L ORF, 837 CD95L 3'UTR, 987 CD95 ORF, and 1317 CD95 3'UTR shRNAs) were cloned into the Tet-inducible pTIP vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) as five individual pools. We first tested the activity of each individual pool to be toxic and to target the Venus sensor protein (fused to either the ORF of CD95 or CD95L). NB7 cells were again used because of their resistance to the Venus-CD95L sensor, which was found to be slightly toxic to CD95 apoptosis competent cells. NB7-Venus-CD95L cells infected with the Venus-targeting shRNA pool showed some reduction in fluorescence when Dox was added, however, the shRNA pool derived from the CD95L ORF was much more active in knocking down Venus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). No significant green fluorescence reduction was detected in cells after infection with the shRNA pool derived from the CD95L 3'UTR since the targeted sequences were not part of the sensor. Similar results were obtained when NB7-Venus-CD95 cells were infected with the Venus, CD95 ORF, and CD95 3'UTR targeting shRNA pools. To determine their ability to reduce cell growth (as a surrogate marker for toxicity), we infected NB7 parental cells with each of the five pools (parental cells were used for this experiment to avoid a possible sponge effect by expressing either CD95L or CD95 sequences that were part of the Venus sensors). Interestingly, the pool of 700 shRNAs derived from Venus did not cause any toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, the pool of the shRNAs derived from CD95L significantly slowed down growth, while no toxicity was observed when cells were infected with the pool of shRNAs derived from the CD95L 3'UTR. In the case of CD95, both the shRNAs derived from the ORF and the 3'UTR showed some toxicity. However, the shRNAs derived from the 3'UTR caused greater toxicity compared to those derived from the ORF. The data suggest that overall the shRNAs derived from the CD95L ORF and the CD95 3'UTR contain the most toxic sequences.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29702.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Identifying all toxic shRNAs derived from CD95L and CD95.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the cloned shRNAs covering the ORF of Venus and the ORFs and 3'UTRs of CD95L and CD95.

Cells were cultured for 9 days with and without Dox to allow for cell death to occur. To identify depleted shRNAs, shRNA barcodes were detected through next generation sequencing of PCR products to determine the relative abundance of each shRNA in three pools: 1) the cloned plasmid libraries, 2) cells after infection and culture for 9 days without Dox, and 3) cells infected and cultured with Dox for 9 days. A total of 71,168,032 reads were detected containing a complete sequence of one of the cloned shRNAs. Virtually all shRNAs were substantially represented in the cloned plasmids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The shRNAs in the CD95L pool (comprised of the Venus, CD95L ORF, and CD95L 3’UTR subpools) and the CD95 pool (comprised of the Venus, CD95 ORF, and CD95 3’UTR subpools) were ranked from highest (most toxic) to lowest underrepresentation. During this and subsequent analyses, we noticed in many cases, Dox addition did cause a reduction of shRNAs, indicating an increase in toxicity; however, in other instances, infection alone and without the addition of Dox was toxic. This effect was likely due to the well-described leakiness of the Tet-on system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pham et al., 2008</xref>), which we confirmed for shR6 in NB7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To capture all toxic shRNAs, we therefore decided to split the analysis into two halves: 1) the changes in abundance after infection compared to the composition in the plasmid pool (infection -Dox) and 2) the changes in abundance after Dox addition compared to the infected –Dox cells (infection +Dox). In subsequent analyses, shRNAs underrepresented after infection are either boxed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) or shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>) in blue and the ones underrepresented after Dox addition are either boxed or shown in orange.

Grey dots represent all shRNAs and red dots represent only the ones that were significantly underrepresented at least 5-fold. Interestingly, the highest abundance of downregulated shRNAs was found in the CD95L ORF and the CD95 3'UTR pools of shRNAs, which is consistent with the increased toxicity observed when NB7 cells were infected with either of these two pools individually (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The shRNAs of these two toxic pools were highly enriched in the underrepresented shRNAs in the two pooled experiments (CD95L and CD95).

Therefore, we wondered how many 8mer seed sequences derived from these toxic shRNAs would have corresponding seed matches in the 3'UTR of critical survival genes in the human genome. Would it be possible to predict with some certainty in an <italic>in silico</italic> analysis what shRNAs would be toxic to cells? To calculate such a hypothetical toxicity index, we used the ranked CRISPR data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) with 1882 survival genes (SGs) and 423 nonSGs. Based on our RNA-Seq analyses, we hypothesized the survival genes contained more putative seed matches for toxic shRNAs in their 3'UTRs than the nonsurvival genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, left) and that the number of seed matches in the 3'UTRs of survival genes divided by the number of seed matches in the 3'UTR of nonsurvival genes would, to some extent, predict toxicity of an si/shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, right).</p><p>To establish a Toxicity Index (TI) for each shRNA, we first gathered 3’UTR sequences for 1846 of the survival genes and 416 of the nonsurvival genes. We then generated a list containing a normalized ratio of occurrences of every possible 8mer seed match in the 3'UTRs of the survival and non-survival gene groups. This resulted in a ratio for each of the 65,536 possible 8mer combinations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), the TI. We then assigned to each of the 4666 shRNAs in our screen its TI, and ranked each pool within the two experiments of our screen according to the highest TI (red stippled lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We then further separated the shRNAs into two groups: those that were toxic just after infection and those toxic after addition of Dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). In each ranked list, we could now assess whether the experimentally determined toxicity of shRNAs correlated with the <italic>in silico</italic> predicted TI. Remarkably, the highest enrichment of toxic shRNAs was found amongst those with higher TI for the subpool of shRNAs targeting the CD95L ORF followed by shRNAs in the subpool targeting the CD95 3'UTR. To confirm the significance of this finding, we repeated the analysis 10,000 times by randomly assigning 8mers and their associated TIs to the two shRNA pools and again sorted the data from highest to lowest TI. The reported p-values were calculated based on these permutated datasets using Mann-Whitney U tests.</p><p>We noticed that survival genes tend to be more highly expressed than nonsurvival genes (data not shown). To address the question whether toxic si/shRNAs only target survival genes or all genes that are highly expressed, we recalculated the TI based on a set of 850 highly expressed and expression matched survival and nonsurvival genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This alternative TI tracked slightly less well with the toxic shRNAs we identified, but the enrichment of toxic shRNAs towards the top of the list ranked according to the new TI was still statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This analysis demonstrates survival genes contain more seed matches for toxic shRNAs in their 3'UTR than nonsurvival genes regardless of the expression level. This suggests, to a certain extent, it is possible to predict the experimental toxicity of shRNAs based on the <italic>in silico</italic> calculated TI.</p><p>Our data suggest DISE results from a sequence-specific off-target activity that depends on the presence of certain seed matches in the 3'UTR of survival genes. Thus, DISE inducing RISC associated small RNAs behave in manner similar to miRNAs. This raised the question whether these seed matches have special properties. While we did not find a sequence motif that was present in all toxic si/shRNAs, we did find that sequence composition, specifically GC content, which has been reported to affect the specificity of shRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ui-Tei et al., 2004</xref>), correlated with the toxicity of shRNAs. When the GC content of the 6mer seed sequences of all underrepresented shRNAs detected in the shRNA screen across the CD95L ORF was plotted, we found a significant correlation between the GC content and higher toxicity (indicated by underrepresentation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). This correlation was even more pronounced when plotting GC content versus the 6mer toxicity index (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). While not an absolute requirement, higher GC content made shRNAs more toxic, consistent with reports demonstrating that shRNAs with high GC content in the seed region showed decreased on-target and increased off-target activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ui-Tei et al., 2004</xref>). In summary, our data suggest that si- and/or shRNAs with certain seed sequences are toxic to cancer cells by targeting critical survival genes through an RNAi mechanism independent of both Drosha and Dicer. Furthermore, the data suggest high miRNA content, presumably through competing for occupancy in the RISC, might render cells less sensitive to DISE.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Most current uses of RNAi are aimed toward highly specific silencing with little OTE. In fact, OTEs represent one of the largest impediments to the use of RNAi in phenotypic screening applications. We now demonstrate DISE is a unique form of OTE that results in the simultaneous activation of multiple cell death pathways in cancer cells. The discovery that DISE involves loss of multiple survival genes now provides an explanation for the unique properties we described for this form of cell death, especially the observation that cancer cells have a hard time developing resistance to this cell death mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hadji et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murmann et al., 2017</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>DISE represents a specific form of RNAi OTE</title><p>There are a number of rules that have been elucidated for designing si/shRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bramsen et al., 2009</xref>) to avoid undesired effects such as OTE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Petri and Meister, 2013</xref>), general toxicity due to the presence of toxic sequence motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fedorov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Petri and Meister, 2013</xref>), poisoning/saturating of the RISC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grimm et al., 2006</xref>), or evocation of an IFN response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marques and Williams, 2005</xref>). The following arguments and evidence support our prediction that DISE is a manifestation of a novel, functionally important, conserved mechanism of genome regulation, and not the result of one of the above-mentioned effects:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The sheer number of toxic shRNAs embedded in CD95L or CD95. A number of genome-wide shRNA and siRNA lethality screens have revealed that 2–5% of shRNAs targeting human genes are toxic to cells. We recently reported in 12 independent arrayed shRNA lethality screens the identification of 651 genes out of about 18,000 targeted genes that are critical for the survival of 8 different cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hadji et al., 2014</xref>). Many of the genes targeted by these shRNAs were actually established survival genes (as discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hadji et al., 2014</xref>]). That means that the number of shRNAs that are toxic due to a possible OTE or general toxicity would be expected to be very small. In contrast, we found that &gt;80% of the shRNAs and siRNAs that were designed to target either CD95 or CD95L exhibited toxicity in multiple cell lines. Consistent with our data analysis, a parallel genome-scale loss of function screen confirmed that the majority of the tested shRNAs derived from either CD95L and CD95 were toxic to a majority of the tested 216 cell lines when used as a pooled library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowley et al., 2014</xref>). These also included a number of hematopoietic cell lines suggesting that the DISE effect is not limited to solid cancers. Interestingly, in this study the authors did not consider the data on most of the CD95L and CD95 targeting shRNAs to be significant as they received a low consistency score. A high consistency score predicts the observed phenotype (cell death or growth reduction in this case) is caused by knocking down the targeted gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shao et al., 2013</xref>). However, we have demonstrated here that the toxicity of an shRNA is solely dependent on its seed and the transcriptome of the treated cells. Therefore, the results of every shRNA should be considered individually as far as the DISE inducing effect is concerned.</p></list-item><list-item><p>High concentrations of siRNAs can saturate the RISC, preventing the access of crucial endogenous miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khan et al., 2009</xref>). We have demonstrated that, in general, 5 nM of CD95L-derived siRNAs are sufficient to kill cancer cells. We have even seen very efficient cell death with as little as 1 nM of siRNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). It is therefore unlikely we are poisoning the RISC. It has been reported that in siRNA overexpression experiments, changes in mRNA expression can be caused by blocked access of endogenous miRNAs to the RISC, such as the highly expressed miRNA family, let-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khan et al., 2009</xref>). However, we can exclude such an effect in our analysis, as there was no significant enrichment (or depletion) of the let-7 seed match motif (or that of any other miRNA) in our analyses (black lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>No IFN response was observed.

We did find a correlation between the toxicity of shRNAs (both predicted by the TI and experimentally determined in the shRNA screen) and the GC content in their seed region. While this correlation was significant, it was not a requirement as some of the most toxic si- and shRNAs had a low 8mer seed GC content (shL3, 25%; shR6, 25%; siL3, 37.5%). Our data suggest that survival genes may contain different types of seed matches (based on base composition or sequence) when compared to nonsurvival genes. Such a distinction has indeed been described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stark et al., 2005</xref>). In a study in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it was determined that survival genes are depleted of seed matches targeted by highly expressed miRNAs. These authors concluded that evolution must have selected against the presence of seed matches for highly expressed miRNAs in the 3'UTR of survival genes. It is therefore not surprising that a gene ontology (GO) analysis of all miRNA targets (the ‘targets’) in this study described these genes as being involved in development and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stark et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, genes not targeted by miRNAs (the ‘antitargets’) grouped in GO clusters that were consistent with cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stark et al., 2005</xref>). A similar phenomenon was also shown in mammalian cells; genes with fewer miRNA target sites, as predicted by Targetscan, contained distinct enriched GO terms from those enriched in genes with many predicted target sites. The genes with fewer sites were enriched in GO terms like ribosomal subunits and respiratory chain, whereas target-heavy genes were more enriched in regulatory-related GO terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zare et al., 2014</xref>). It is possible the DISE-inducing si/shRNAs carry seed sequences that preferentially target seed matches present in the 3’UTRs of the ‘anti-targets’. However, as our data on the miR-30 based shRNAs suggest, DISE-inducing shRNAs must be expressed at a certain level to be toxic.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>DISE is caused by loading of the guide strand of toxic si/shRNAs into the RISC</title><p>Part of our data was generated using a widely used first generation stem loop shRNA platform, the TRC library. The TRC shRNAs have recently been found to be prone to cause OTE. Gu <italic>et al.</italic> showed that the loop design of this system results in imprecise Dicer cleavage and, consequently, the production of different mature small-RNA species that increase passenger loading, one major source of OTE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gu et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, it was reported that most guide RNAs derived from the TRC hairpin were shifted by 4 nt 3' of the expected 5' start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Watanabe et al., 2016</xref>). While we did see a shift in processing of these stem loop shRNAs, we did not see such a high level of imprecision in the cleavage of our toxic shRNAs. In fact, 99.4% of the shR6 guide RNAs started at the same nucleotide position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The majority of the processing of both our pTIP and pLKO-based shRNAs was shifted by one nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This shift was consistent with the defined seed matches that were detected in the Sylamer analyses. In general, one major seed match was detected with one other minor species (this was less obvious for shL1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, all four Sylamer analyses only detected enrichments in the 3'UTR of downregulated mRNAs that were consistent with only the guide strand targeting the mRNA and not the passenger strand. In all cases, including in cells transfected with the siRNA siL3, the primary enriched sequence motifs were either 7, or 8mers present in the 3'UTR of the targeted mRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>DISE has features of the RNAi OTE previously reported</title><p>Our data on DISE are consistent with a number of properties of RNAi OTE that have previously been reported. Similar to DISE, OTE-mediated silencing requires a 6/7nt seed sequence of complementarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birmingham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jackson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2005</xref>) and it targets mRNAs in the 3'UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birmingham et al., 2006</xref>). Our data on shRNAs, siRNAs, and DsiRNAs suggest that DISE is not limited to one platform and requires sequence-specific targeting. This conclusion is also consistent with a previous report that suggested that sequence-dependent off-target transcript regulation is independent of the delivery method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jackson et al., 2006</xref>). The authors found the same enrichment of 6mers and 7mers in 3'UTRs of targeted mRNAs for siRNAs and shRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jackson et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>The role of Dicer in DISE</title><p>We previously reported that Dicer<sup>Exo5-/-</sup> HCT116 cells (with deleted Exon 5) were at least as sensitive to induction of DISE (by either shL3 or shR6) than wt cells suggesting that Dicer deficient cells could be killed by DISE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hadji et al., 2014</xref>). It has been reported that these Dicer deficient cells are hypomorphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ting et al., 2008</xref>) and indeed, we detected low residual Dicer expression by western blotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hadji et al., 2014</xref>). We have now revisited this issue with HCT116 cells rendered completely deficient for Dicer using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). The fact that these Dicer<sup>-/-</sup> cells were now completely resistant to the toxic effects of shL3 or shR6 demonstrates the complete absence of Dicer protein and activity. Similar to the Drosha<sup>-/-</sup> cells, in the absence of mature miRNAs, which seem to attenuate DISE, Dicer<sup>-/-</sup> cells are hypersensitive to DISE induced by siRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Open questions regarding the relevance of DISE</title><p>We are proposing an entirely new concept of killing cancer cells that is based on the toxicity of CD95 and CD95L derived small RNAs. Naturally, there are many open questions such as:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Is DISE part of an anti-cancer mechanism? We are proposing that DISE kills cancer cells in a way that they usually cannot escape from. We have not found a way to block cancer cells from dying by DISE. We provide strong evidence to suggest this is due to the simultaneous targeting of multiple survival genes that result in the activation of multiple cell death pathways. It will be difficult to prove cells are dying due to the preferential targeting of survival genes. It may never be possible to express multiple siRNA resistant survival genes at the same time at physiological levels to render cancer cells resistant to the action of countless small RNAs. This prediction alone makes DISE a promising new strategy to kill cancer cells.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Does CD95L induce DISE <italic>in vivo</italic>? We recently found that overexpression of the CD95L ORF is toxic to cancer cells and that this kills cancer cells in a manner very similar to DISE induction (unpublished data). We and others have noticed upregulation of CD95L in multiple stress-related conditions such as treatment with chemotherapy ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friesen et al., 1999</xref>] and data not shown). While the amount of CD95L RNA and the level of upregulation alone may not be enough to induce DISE, it could result from the combined expression of multiple RNAs that when generated kill cells by DISE. We view CD95L as just one of many RNAs that have this activity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Are there other genes in the human genome containing toxic seed sequences? We recently identified other genes in the genome that contain DISE-inducing shRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patel and Peter, 2017</xref>). It is therefore possible that when cells are subjected to genotoxic or oncogenic stress that they generate numerous small RNAs that can be taken up by the RISC and in combination execute DISE. Hence, our analysis of CD95/CD95L will likely be applicable to other genes.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>A model for why DISE preferentially kills cancer cells</title><p>We interpret the hypersensitivity of both Drosha<sup>-/-</sup> and Dicer<sup>-/-</sup> cells to DISE in the following way: Most of the small RNAs in the cells that are loaded into the RISC are miRNAs. Using AGO pull-down experiments, we determined 98.4% of AGO- associated RNAs in HCT116 cells to be miRNAs (99.3% in HeyA8 cells, data not shown). It was recently reported that Drosha<sup>-/-</sup> cells showed a reduction of miRNA content from roughly 70–80% to 5–6%, and Dicer<sup>-/-</sup> cells showed a reduction down to 14–21% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Since neither Drosha<sup>-/-</sup> nor Dicer<sup>-/-</sup> cells express reduced AGO2 protein levels (see inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), it is reasonable to assume that their RISC can take up many more of the toxic DISE inducing RNAs than the RISC in wt cells explaining the super toxicity of both DISE inducing si/shRNAs and CD95L mRNAs in these cells.</p><p>We previously showed expression of either shL3 and shR6 induced DISE in immortalized normal ovarian fibroblasts much more efficiently than in matching nonimmortalized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hadji et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that this form of cell death preferentially affects transformed cells. Our data now provide an interesting model to explain the higher sensitivity of cancer cells to DISE when compared to normal cells. It is well documented that cancer cells in general have global downregulation of miRNAs when compared to normal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 2005</xref>). This might free up the RISC for DISE-inducing RNAs and would imply that miRNAs may protect normal cells from DISE.</p><p>Overall, our data allow us to predict that any small RNA with DISE-inducing RNAi activity that does not require Dicer processing can kill cancer cells regardless of Dicer or Drosha status. In fact, in an accompanying manuscript, we demonstrate that DISE can be triggered <italic>in vivo</italic> to treat ovarian cancer in mouse xenografts by delivering CD95L-derived siRNAs using nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murmann et al., 2017</xref>). No toxicity was observed in the treated mice. These data suggest that it might be possible to develop a novel form of cancer therapy based on the DISE OTE mechanism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

HeyA8 ΔshR6 clone #11 cells were infected with pLKO-shScr or pLKO-shR6. A pool of three 293T ΔshL3 clones was infected with either pTIP-shScr or pTIP-shL3. After selection with puromycin for 2 days, the pTIP-infected 293T cells were plated with Dox in duplicate at 500,000 cells per T175 flask. The pLKO-infected HeyA8 cells were plated at 500,000 cells per flask. Total RNA was harvested 50 hrs and 100 hrs after plating. In addition, 293T cells were infected with either pLKO-shScr or pLKO-shL1 and RNA was isolated (100 hrs after plating) as described above for the infection with shR6. Finally, HeyA8 cells were transfected with RNAiMAX in 6-wells with siScr (NT2) or siL3 oligonucleotides (Dharmacon) at 25 nM. The transfection mix was removed after 9 hrs and RNA harvested 48 hrs after transfection.</p><p>Total RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat.No. 74004) following the manufacturer’s instructions. An on-column digestion step using the RNAse-free DNAse Set (Qiagen, Cat.No.: 79254) was included for all RNA-Seq samples.</p><p>RNA libraries were generated and sequenced (Genomics Core facility at the University of Chicago). The quality and quantity of the RNA samples were checked using an Agilent bio-analyzer. Paired end RNA-SEQ libraries were generated using Illumina TruSEQ TotalRNA kits using the Illumina provided protocol (including a RiboZero rRNA removal step). Small RNA-SEQ libraries were generated using Illumina small RNA SEQ kits using the Illumina provided protocol. Two types of small RNA-SEQ sub-libraries were generated: one containing library fragments 140–150 bp in size and one containing library fragments 150–200 bp in size (both including the sequencing adaptor of about 130 bp). All three types of libraries (one RNA-SEQ and two small RNA-SEQ) were sequenced on an Illumina HiSEQ4000 using Illumina provided reagents and protocols. Adaptor sequences were removed from sequenced reads using TrimGalore (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore</ext-link>), and the trimmed reads were mapped to the hg38 assembly of the human genome with Tophat and bowtie2. Raw read counts were then assigned to genes using HTSeq. Differential gene expression was analyzed with the R Bioconductor DESeq2 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Love et al., 2014</xref>) using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. P values and adjusted P values were calculated using the DESeq2 package.</p><p>To identify differentially abundant RNAs in cells expressing either shL3 or shR6, using a method unbiased by genome annotation, we also analyzed the raw 100 bp reads for differential abundance. First, the second end in each paired end read was reverse complemented, so that both reads were on the same strand. Reads were then sorted and counted using the core UNIX utilities sort and uniq. Reads with fewer than 128 counts across all 16 samples were discarded. A table with all of the remaining reads was then compiled, summing counts from each sequence file corresponding to the same sample. This table contained a little over 100,000 reads. The R package edgeR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/1/139">http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/1/139</ext-link>) was used to identify differentially abundant reads, and then these reads were mapped to the human genome using blat (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/12/4/656.abstract">http://genome.cshlp.org/content/12/4/656.abstract</ext-link>) to determine chromosomal location whenever possible. Homer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://homer.salk.edu/homer/">http://homer.salk.edu/homer/</ext-link>) was used to annotate chromosomal locations with overlapping genomic elements (such as genes). Raw read counts in each sequence file were normalized by the total number of unique reads in the file.</p><p>To identify the most significant changes in expression of RNAs both methods of RNAs-Seq analyses (alignment and read based) were used to reach high stringency. All samples were prepared in duplicate and for each RNA the average of the two duplicates was used for further analysis. In the alignment-based analysis, only RNAs that had a base mean of &gt;2000 reads and were significantly deregulated between the groups (adjusted p-value&lt;0.05) were considered for further analysis. RNAs were scored as deregulated when they were more than 1.5 fold changed in the shL3 expressing cells at both time points and in the shR6 expressing cells at either time points (each compared to shScr expressing cells) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This was done because we found that the pLKO-driven expression of shR6 was a lot lower than the pTIP-driven expression of shL3 (see the quantification of the two shRNAs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This likely was a result of the reduced cellular responses in the shR6 expressing cells. In the read-based analysis, reads were only considered if they had both normalized read numbers of &gt;10 across the samples in each treatment, as well as less than two fold variation between duplicates and &gt;1.5 fold change between treatment groups at both time points and both cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). After filtering, reads were mapped to the genome and associated with genes based on chromosomal localization. Finally, all RNAs were counted that showed deregulation in the same direction with both methods. This resulted in the identification of 11 RNAs that were down and 1 that was upregulated in cells exposed to the shRNAs shL3 and shR6. To determine the number of seed matches in the 3'UTR of downregulated genes, the 3'UTRs of the 11 mRNAs were extracted from the Homo sapiens gene (GRCh38.p7) dataset of the Ensembl 86 database using the Ensembl Biomart data mining tool. For each gene, only the longest deposited 3'UTR was considered. Seed matches were counted in all 3'UTRs using in-house Perl scripts.</p><p>GSEA used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> was performed using the GSEA v2.2.4 software from the Broad Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea">http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea</ext-link>); 1000 permutations were used. The Sabatini gene lists (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) were set as custom gene sets to determine enrichment of survival genes versus the nonsurvival control genes in downregulated genes from the RNA seq data; Adjusted p-values below 0.05 were considered significantly enriched. The GO enrichment analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> was performed using all genes that after alignment and normalization were found to be at least 1.5 fold downregulated with an adjusted p values of &lt; 0.05, using the software available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.Metascape.org">www.Metascape.org</ext-link> and default running parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Conversion of shL3 and shR6 to siRNAs</title><p>From the RNA-Seq analysis with HeyA8 ΔshR6 infected with pLKO-shR6 and 293T ΔshL3 clones infected pTIP-shL3, we analyzed the mature double-stranded RNAs derived from pLKO-shR6 and pTIP-shL3 and found that the most abundant RNA forms were both shifted by one nucleotide. Based on these most abundant species observed after cellular processing, we converted shL3 and shR6 sequences to siRNAs. The genomic target sequence in shL3 (21nt) is 5’-ACUGGGCUGUACUUUGUAUAU-3’. For the shL3 =&gt; siL3 sense strand, one G was added before the A on the 5’ end while the last U on the 3’ end was deleted, and second and third to the last ribonucleotides on the 3’ end (UA) were replaced with deoxyribonucleotides for stabilization. For shL3 =&gt; siL3 antisense strand, the last three nucleotides on the 5’ end (AUA) were deleted and one U and two dTs (UdTdT) were added after the last U on the 3’end. The shL3 =&gt; siL3 sense strand is 5’- GACUGGGCUGUACUUUGUAdTdA-3’ and antisense strand is 5’-/5Phos/UACAAAGUACAGCCCAGUUdTdT-3’. The shR6 =&gt; siRNA was designed in a similar fashion except that two Gs instead of one G were added to the 5’ end of the sense strand while UUdTdT instead of UdTdT was added to the 3’ end of the antisense strand. The genomic target sequence in shR6 (21nt) is 5’-GUGCAGAUGUAAACCAAACUU-3’. The shR6 =&gt; siR6 sense strand is 5’-GGGUGCAGAUGUAAACCAAAdCdT-3’ and antisense strand is 5’-/5Phos/UUUGGUUUACAUCUGCACUUdTdT-3’. Both shL3 =&gt; siL3 and ShR6 =&gt; siR6 siRNA duplexes were purchased from Dharmacon.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Construction of pTIP-shRNA libraries</title><p>The pTIP-shRNA libraries were constructed by subcloning libraries of 143nt PCR inserts of the form 5’-<italic>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXATAGAGATCGNNNNNNNNN NNNNNNNNNNNNCTCGAGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNTTTTTGTACCGAGCTCGGATCCACTAGTCCAGTGTGGGCATGCTGCGTTGACATTGATT</italic>-3’ into the pTIP-shR6 vector after excising the shR6 insert. The poly-N region represents the 21-mer sense and antisense shRNA hairpin. The intervening CTCGAG is the loop region of the shRNA. The 5 libraries targeting Venus, CD95L ORF, CD95L 3’UTR, CD95 ORF, or CD95 3’UTR were composed of every possible 21-mer shRNA (i.e. each nearest neighbor shRNA was shifted by 1 nucleotide). These libraries were synthesized together on a chip as 143 bp single-stranded DNA oligos (CustomArray Inc, Custom 12K oligo pool). Each shRNA pool had its own unique 5’ end represented by the poly-<italic>X</italic> region. This allowed selective amplification of a particular pool using 1 of 5 unique Fr primers (CD95L ORF: 5’-<italic>TGGCTTTATATATCTCCCTATCAGTG</italic>-3’, CD95L 3’ UTR: 5’-<italic>GGTCGTCCTATCTATTATTATTCACG</italic>-3’, CD95 ORF: 5’-<italic>TCTTGTGTCCAGACCAATTTATTTCG</italic>-3’, CD95 3’UTR: 5’-<italic>CTCATTGACTATCGTTTTAGCTACTG</italic>-3’, Venus: 5’-<italic>TATCATCTTTCATGATGACTTTCCGG</italic>-3’) and the common reverse primer 5’-<italic>AATCAATGTCAACGCAGCAT</italic>-3’. Phusion High Fidelity Polymerase (NEB #M0530) was used to amplify each library pool; standard PCR conditions were used with an annealing temperature of 61°C and 15 cycles. PCR reactions were purified using PCR Cleanup kit (QIAGEN). The pTIP-shR6 vector and each of the amplified libraries were digested with SphI-HF and BsaBI. Digested PCR products were run on either a 2% Agarose gel or a 20% polyacrylamide (29:1) gel made with 0.5 x TBE buffer. PCR products were extracted using either Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN) for extraction from Agarose gels or via electro-elution using D-Tube Dialyzer Mini columns (Novagen #71504). Purified PCR inserts were then ligated to the linearized pTIP vector with T4 DNA ligase for 24 hr at 16°C. The ligation mixtures were transformed via electroporation in MegaX DH10B T1 cells (Invitrogen #C6400) and plated on 24 cm ampicillin dishes. At least 10 colonies per pool were picked and sequenced to verify successful library construction. After verification, all colonies per library were pooled together and plasmid DNA extracted using the MaxiPrep kit (QIAGEN). The 5 pTIP-shRNA library DNA preps were used to produce virus in 293T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Lethality screen with pTIP-shRNA libraries</title><p>NB7 cells were seeded at 1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> per 145 cm<sup>2</sup> dish. Two dishes were infected with each of the 5 libraries with a transduction efficiency of about 10% to 20%. Media was replaced next day. Infected cells were selected with 1.5 μg/ml puromycin. Cells infected with the Venus, CD95L ORF, and CD95L 3’UTR-targeting libraries were pooled in a 1:1:1 ratio to make the CD95L cell pool. Likewise, cells infected with the Venus, CD95 ORF, and CD95 3’UTR-targeting libraries were pooled to make the CD95 receptor cell pool. The CD95 and the CD95L cell pools were plated separately each in 2 sets of duplicates seeded at 600,000 cells per 145 cm<sup>2</sup> dish. One set received 100 ng/ml Dox, and the other one was left untreated (total of 4 dishes per combined pool; 2 received no treatment and 2 received Dox). Cells infected with the different libraries were also plated individually in triplicate with or without Dox on a 96-well plate to assess the overall toxicity of each pool. DNA was collected from each 145 cm<sup>2</sup> dish 9 days after Dox addition.</p><p>The shRNA barcodes were amplified from the harvested DNA template using NEB Phusion Polymerase with 4 different pairs of primers (referred to as N, N + 1, N + 2, and N + 3) in separate reactions per DNA sample. The N pair consisted of the primers originally used to amplify the CD95L ORF library (Fr: 5’-<italic>TGGCTTTATATATCTCCCTATCAGTG</italic>-3’ and Rev: 5’-<italic>AATCAATGTCAACGCAGCAT</italic>-3’). The N + 1 primers had a single nucleotide extension at each 5’ end of the N primers corresponding to the pTIP vector sequence (Fr: 5’-<italic>TTGGCTTTATATATCTCCCTATCAGTG</italic>-3’ and Rev: 5’-<italic>TAATCAATGTCAACGCAGCAT</italic>-3’). The N + 2 primers had 2 nucleotide extensions (Fr: 5’-<italic>CTTGGCTTTATATATCTCCCTATCAGTG</italic>-3’ and Rev: 5’-<italic>ATAATCAATGTCAACGCAGCAT</italic>-3’), and the N + 3 primers had 3 nucleotide extensions (Fr: 5’-<italic>TCTTGGCTTTATATATCTCCCTATCAGTG</italic>-3’ and Rev: 5’-<italic>AATAATCAATGTCAACGCAGCAT</italic>-3’). The barcodes from the pTIP-shRNA library plasmid preparations were also amplified using Phusion Polymerase with the N, N + 1, N + 2, and N + 3 primer pairs. The shRNA barcode PCR products were purified from a 2% Agarose gel and submitted for 100 bp paired-end deep sequencing (Genomics Core facility at the University of Chicago). DNA was quantitated using the Qubit. The 4 separate PCR products amplified using N, N + 1, N + 2, and N + 3 were combined in equimolar amounts for each sample. Libraries were generated using the Illumina TruSeq PCR-free kit using the Illumina provided protocol. The libraries were sequenced using the HiSEQ4000 with Illumina provided reagents and protocols. Raw sequence counts for DNAs were calculated by HTSeq. shRNA sequences in the PCR pieces of genomic DNA were identified by searching all reads for the sense sequence of the mature shRNA plus the loop sequence CTCGAG. To avoid a division by zero problem during the subsequent analyses all counts of zero in the raw data were replaced with 1. A few sequences with a total read number &lt;10 across all plasmids reads were not further considered. In the CD95L pool this was only one shRNA (out of 2362 shRNAs) (L792') and in the CD95 20 shRNAs (out of 3004 shRNAs) were not represented (R88, R295, R493, R494, R496, R497, R498, R499, R213', R215', R216', R217', R220', R221', R222', R223', R225', R226', R258', R946', R1197', R423'). While most shRNAs in both pools had a unique sequence two sequences occurred 6 times (L605', L607', L609', L611', L613', L615', and L604', L606', L608', L610', L612', L614'). In these cases, read counts were divided by 6. Two shRNAs could not be evaluated: 1) shR6 in the CD95 pool. It had a significant background due to the fact that pTIP-shR6 was used as a starting point to clone all other shRNAs. 2) shL3 was found to be a minor but significant contaminant during the infection of some of the samples. For each condition, two technical duplicates and two biological duplicates were available. To normalize reads to determine the change in relative representation of shRNAs between conditions, the counts of each shRNA in a subpool (all replicates and all conditions) was divided by the total number of shRNAs in each subpool (%). First, the mean of the technical replicates (R1 and R2) was taken. To analyze the biological replicates and to determine the changes between conditions, two analyses were performed: 1) The change in shRNA representation between the cloned plasmid library and cells infected with the library and then cultured for 9 days without Dox (infection -Dox). Fold downregulation was calculated for each subpool as [(plasmid %/-Dox1 %+plasmid %/-Dox2 %)/2]. 2) The difference in shRNA composition between the infected cells cultured with (infection +Dox) and without Dox. Fold downregulation was calculated for each subpool as [(-Dox1 %/+Dox1%)+(-Dox1 %/+Dox2%)+(-Dox2 %/+Dox1%)+(-Dox2 %/+Dox2%)/4]. Only shRNAs were considered that were at least 5-fold underrepresented in either of the two analyses (data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>The toxicity index (TI) and GC content analysis</title><p>The TI in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> is defined by the sum of the counts of a 6mer or 8mer seed match in the 3'UTRs of critical survival genes divided by the seed match counts in the 3'UTRs of nonsurvival genes. We used the 1882 survival genes recently described in a CRISPR/Cas9 lethality screen by Wang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The survival genes were defined by having a CRISPR score of &lt;−0.1 and an adjusted p-value of &lt;0.05. We chose as a control group to these top essential genes the bottom essential genes using inverse criteria (CRISPR score of &gt;0.1 and adjusted p-value of &lt;0.05) and are referring to them as the ‘nonsurvival genes’. Both counts were normalized for the numbers of genes in each gene set. 3'UTRs were retrieved as described above. For the survival genes 1846 and for the nonsurvival genes 416 3'UTRs were found. For each gene, only seed matches in the longest 3'UTR were counted. The TI was calculated for each of the 4096 possible 6mer combinations and each of the 65536 possible 8mer combinations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). These numbers were then assigned to the results of the shRNA screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

For short stretches of RNA (in this case length 6, 7, and 8 in length corresponding to the lengths of the determinants of seed region binding in RNAi-type binding events), Sylamer tests for all possible motifs of this length whether the motif occurrences are shifted in sequences associated with the list under consideration, typically 3'UTRs when analyzing RNAi-type binding events. A shift or enrichment of such a motif towards the down-regulated end of the gene list is consistent with upregulation of a small RNA that has the motif as the seed region. Sylamer tests in small increments along the list of genes, using a hypergeometric test on the counts of a given word, comparing the leading part of the gene list to the universe of all genes in the list. For full details, refer to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Dongen et al., 2008</xref>). Enriched motifs stand out from the back-ground of all motifs tested, as visible in the Sylamer plot. The plot consist of many different lines, each line representing the outcomes of a series of tests for a single word, performed along regularly spaced intervals (increments of 200 genes) of the gene list. Each test yields the log-transformed P-value arising from a hypergeometric test as indicated above. If the word is enriched in the leading interval, the log-transformed value has its value plotted on the positive y-axis (sign changed), if the word is depleted the log-transformed value is plotted on the negative y-axis. 3'UTRs were used from Ensembl, version 76. As required by Sylamer, they were cleaned of low-complexity sequences and repetitive fragments using respectively Dust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morgulis et al., 2006</xref>) with default parameters and the RSAT interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Medina-Rivera et al., 2015</xref>) to the Vmatch program, also run with default parameters.

Continuous data were compared using t-tests for two independent groups and one-way ANOVA for 3 or more groups. For evaluation of continuous outcomes over time, two-way ANOVA was used with one factor for the treatment conditions of primary interest and a second factor for time treated as a categorical variable to allow for non-linearity. Comparisons of single proportions to hypothesized null values were evaluated using binomial tests. Statistical tests of two independent proportions were used to compare dichotomous observations across groups.</p><p>The effects of treatment on wild-type versus either Dicer<sup>-/-</sup> or Drosha<sup>-/-</sup> cells were statistically assessed by fitting regression models that included linear and quadratic terms for value over time, main effects for treatment and cell type, and two- and three-way interactions for treatment, cell-type and time. The three-way interaction on the polynomial terms with treatment and cell type was evaluated for statistical significance since this represents the difference in treatment effects over the course of the experiment for the varying cell types.</p><p>To test if higher TI is enriched in shRNAs that were highly downregulated, p-values were calculated based on permutated datasets using Mann-Whitney U tests. The ranking of TI was randomly shuffled 10,000 times and the W statistic from our dataset was compared to the distribution of the W statistic of the permuted datasets. Test of enrichment was based on the filtered data of at least 5-fold difference, which we define as a biologically meaningful. Fisher Exact Tests were performed to assess enrichment of downregulated genes (i.e. &gt;1.5 downregulated with adjusted p-value&lt;0.05) amongst genes with at least one si/shRNA seed match.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;CD95L derived si- and shRNAs and the CD95L mRNA kill cancer cells through an RNAi mechanism by targeting survival genes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Charles Sawyers as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: John G Doench (Reviewer #1); Gregory J Hannon (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Previously, the authors conducted a study that described DICE (&quot;Death induced by CD95R/L elimination&quot;), in which they show that depletion of these genes by RNAi results in cell death across a dozen cancer cell lines (Hadji et al., 2014). Here, they follow-up on this observation by fine-mapping the cause of DICE and show that the viability effect triggered by these RNAi reagents is actually not dependent on the target genes, but rather on a seed-based (i.e. microRNA-like) off-target effect of the RNAi reagents, leading to a new acronym, DISE (death induced by survival gene elimination).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The consensus view among reviewers is that the emphasis in the manuscript is misplaced. It is largely about off-target effects of RNAi reagents, and has little to do with CD95 or CD95L. If the conclusion of this manuscript is that some seeds are more likely to have viability effects than others, then the focus should be on that conclusion. As written, the manuscript is very CD95-centric, which implies that there is something special about this gene.</p><p>2) Since this manuscript is really about generic off-target effects, then there are additional resources that could be used to better analyze this phenomenon. For example, the TRC library has been screened against hundreds of cell lines and those data are available (Cowley et al., Sci. Data, 2014), and it would be important to thoroughly analyze those data to see if these observations here generalize well.</p><p>3) Additionally, as mentioned in the last paragraph of the subsection “DISE is caused by loading of the guide strand of toxic si/shRNAs into the RISC”, the inactivity of miR-30 backbone shRNAs to produce this response deserves much more treatment than a &quot;data not shown.&quot; If the off-target effects arise because of something specific to the TRC shRNAs used, that mechanism needs to be characterized. If it is purely an expression-level difference, that needs to be documented. One potential experimental approach could use transient transfection of siRNAs – which can be used at different doses, or with pools of siRNAs to represent the different Dicer products of TRC shRNAs.</p><p>4) The authors produced 3 different target deletions (ΔsiL3, ΔshL3 and ΔshR6) in 293T or HeyA8 cells to show that expression of the si or shRNAs, even in the absence of the target, is still lethal. The deletions seem to produce frame-shift mutations in the coding sequence (as the nt deleted are not a multiple of 3). The authors indeed show that ΔshR6 produces a protein knockout, which they use for a different experiment (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). This provokes the question of whether this is also the case for ΔsiL3 and ΔshL3 and whether it is appropriate to call them &quot;target site&quot; mutants if they are indeed functional knockouts. The authors state in their Introduction &quot;after deleting the CD95 gene tumors barely grew in vivo (Chen et al., 2010; Hadji et al., 2014)&quot; so maybe they could comment on the fact that HeyA8 ΔshR6, being a functional knockout and not exclusively a target site mutant grows similar to the parental cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> enforced expression of the CD95L mRNA is toxic in HeyA8 cells. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, the CD95L-WT ORF is expressed (together with a scramble shRNA) and there is no observable increase in% subG1 compared to expression of vector only (together with a scramble shRNA) in either NB7 cells (panel D) or MCF-7 (panel G). Could the authors please comment on whether there are any other variables we should take into account or whether this is a cell type-specific phenotype. It is difficult to understand that NB7 lack caspase-8 but if they show the toxicity phenotype upon expression of the si/shRNAs and if over-expression of the CD95L is mediating the same phenotype, the model would predict CD95L would still cause lethality of this cell line.</p><p>6) The authors perform a pooled screen to identify the most toxic sequences in the CD95 and CD95L genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The pool screen analysis is performed comparing the final time points to the plasmid pool. This is concerning as virus production and infection could also lead to biases in the shRNA representation. As it stands, it could very well be that many of the &quot;depleted&quot; shRNAs were never present in the cells to begin with. This leads to particular concern about the results in the absence of doxycycline. The authors state that the depletion observed without adding dox is most likely due to leakiness in the Tet-on system (subsection “Identification of toxic shRNAs in the CD95L and CD95 mRNAs”, second paragraph). However, in their initial experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) they expressed the highly toxic shRNA shL3 in 293T without any evidence of toxicity for at least 4 days. Thus, it would be very important to show the depletions observed in this pooled screen are indeed biological. Since the authors do not seem to have an initial post-infection time point to compare to, they could produce virus following the same set up and show that plasmid representation roughly corresponds to the shRNAs cloned from cells right after infection.</p><p>7) Regarding the analysis of AGO-bound small RNAs that align to the CD95L, does the analysis take into account the possibility of PCR duplicates? Also, strand information is essential if the model is that this CD95L derived small RNAs are mediating knockdown of survival genes. The analysis text does not specify whether BLAST was run with any strand specificity so it would be essential for the authors to clarify.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29702.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The consensus view among reviewers is that the emphasis in the manuscript is misplaced. It is largely about off-target effects of RNAi reagents, and has little to do with CD95 or CD95L. If the conclusion of this manuscript is that some seeds are more likely to have viability effects than others, then the focus should be on that conclusion. As written, the manuscript is very CD95-centric, which implies that there is something special about this gene.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that what started out as a CD95 project has turned into an RNAi toxicity project. However, the starting point was indeed CD95 centric, as it developed from the observation that &gt;80% of all tested si/shRNAs designed to target either CD95 or CD95L were toxic to all cancer cell lines, even in the absence of the targets. Based on these data we were faced with the question: in general are 80% of all commercially designed si/shRNAs toxic to cells via an off-target effect or is there something special about CD95 and CD95L? It was unlikely that the majority of all si/shRNAs targeting a gene would be toxic. If that were the case, RNAi would not have become such a widely-used tool. As this manuscript contains mostly data on si/shRNAs derived from CD95 or CD95L, we must discuss aspects of this work in the context of CD95/CD95L. However, we have now modified the manuscript to make clear that CD95 and CD95L serve as a model to study the toxic effects of si/shRNAs containing certain seed sequences. We have restructured the Introduction and whenever possible, in the context of a section, we are now referring to toxic seed containing si/shRNAs rather than to CD95/CD95L derived si/shRNAs. In fact, in a review that will be published shortly (title: &quot;DISE – An RNAi Off-Target Effect that Kills Cancer Cells&quot;) that was made available to the reviewers, we do discuss the DISE effect in more general terms not directly related to CD95. Most importantly, following the consensus advice of the reviewers, we have changed the title of the manuscript to reflect the scope of our work that goes beyond CD95 and CD95L. Finally, we have moved data on the toxic activity of the CD95L ORF into a future manuscript to maintain the focus on toxic si/shRNAs in this one.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers in that CD95 or CD95L are not unique. We assume there must be many other coding and also noncoding genes that can contain sequences that when expressed as si/shRNAs will be toxic.</p><p>In another recent manuscript, we explored the question of whether other genes contain such toxic sequences (Patel and Peter, 2017, Cell Cycle, in press). We focused on a set of tumor suppressors (since they were least likely to be cancer survival genes) among a list of 651 survival genes that came out of our genome-wide shRNA survival screen (Hadji et al., 2014, Cell Rep. 10:208). By focusing strictly on morphological and biochemical changes typical for cells undergoing DISE as described by us before (Hadji et al., 2014, Cell Rep. 10:208), we identified five other genes (all putative tumor suppressors) for which at least two of the commercially available shRNAs killed multiple cancer cells in a way consistent with DISE. We also demonstrate in Patel and Peter that this is not a general phenomenon associated with use of TRC library shRNAs. None of the 9 available shRNAs targeting the tumor suppressors p53 or PTEN were toxic (Patel and Peter, 2017, Cell Cycle, in press). In summary, we have clarified in the revised manuscript that what we report for CD95/CD95L is likely not unique to these two genes, and that it is more likely that multiple genes in the genome contain sequences that can give rise to toxic seeds. As a result, we have refocused the manuscript away from CD95/CD95L as much as possible and now place more focus on the activities of toxic seeds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Since this manuscript is really about generic off-target effects, then there are additional resources that could be used to better analyze this phenomenon. For example, the TRC library has been screened against hundreds of cell lines and those data are available (Cowley et al., Sci. Data, 2014), and it would be important to thoroughly analyze those data to see if these observations here generalize well.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for directing us to this published work. We have carefully examined the cited analysis and identified the data associated with shRNAs from their screen that we also tested. We have added the result of this analysis as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>. The shRNAs we have tested here were found in this study to kill the following percentage of the 216 tested cells in their screen: shL4 (99.5%), shL1 (96.8%), shR6 (88.9%), shR7 (75%), shL2 (67.1%), shR5 (38.4%, shL5 (26.4%), and shR8 (21.3%). In addition to the shRNAs tested by us, these authors also tested an additional CD95 targeting sequence (we now call shR3). It was found to be toxic to 71.8% of the 216 cell lines. Their screen did not include shL3 but consistent with our data, shL1 and shR6 were found to be two of the most toxic shRNAs. Interestingly, the authors did not consider the data on any of the CD95L targeting shRNAs and half of the ones targeting CD95 to be significant as they received a low consistency score. A high consistency score predicts that the observed phenotype (cell death or growth reduction in this case) is caused by knocking down the targeted gene (on-target activity) (Shao et al., 2013, Genome Res, 23:665). Assuming each shRNA only targets one gene, that approach made sense. However, in our case, we know it is only the seed region and the targeted transcriptome that determines toxicity, resulting in an off-target effect. Thus, their exclusion of CD95L shRNAs only supports our conclusions.</p><p>Ours and their analysis agree that the majority of tested shRNAs targeting either CD95 or CD95L (67%) were toxic to the majority of all tested solid and hematopoietic cancer cell lines most likely through the offtarget effect we describe. The reason we identified a somewhat higher percentage of toxic shRNAs targeting CD95 and CD95L might be due to the fact that the shRNAs in our screen and in our experiments were tested individually, whereas the Cowley study used pooled libraries.</p><p>Also in agreement with our data, overall, CD95L-derived shRNAs are more toxic than CD95-derived shRNAs. Clearly the CD95L targeting shRNAs depleted in the largest percentage of the cell lines in their screen among the 9 we also tested are shL1 and shL4 (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistent with this higher underrepresentation of CD95L-derived shRNAs, our data on the shRNA screen which identified the highest number of underrepresented and toxic shRNAs in the ORF of CD95L. We have added this result and discussion to the revised manuscript.</p><p>Finally, we would like to reiterate that the toxicity we describe is not limited to shRNAs of the TRC library. We observed similar toxicities using independent sets of siRNAs, Dsi-RNAs and also by inducible expression of shRNAs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, (Hadji et al., 2014, Cell Rep. 10:208)). We even successfully generated toxic siRNAs based on the processing (determined by RNA-Seq) of two of our most toxic shRNAs (shL3 and shR6) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data support the conclusion that it is not the platform or the delivery that determines toxicity but, as recognized by the reviewers, the seed sequence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Additionally, as mentioned in the last paragraph of the subsection “DISE is caused by loading of the guide strand of toxic si/shRNAs into the RISC”, the inactivity of miR-30 backbone shRNAs to produce this response deserves much more treatment than a &quot;data not shown.&quot; If the off-target effects arise because of something specific to the TRC shRNAs used, that mechanism needs to be characterized. If it is purely an expression-level difference, that needs to be documented. One potential experimental approach could use transient transfection of siRNAs – which can be used at different doses, or with pools of siRNAs to represent the different Dicer products of TRC shRNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>To support our statement on the activity of miR-30 based shRNAs, we have added the results of the miR-30 based shRNAs to the revised manuscript as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. Our most toxic TRC based shRNA sequences (shL1, shL3, shL4, shR5, shR6, and shR7) were converted into miR-30 based hairpins and cloned into the Tet-inducible LT3REPIR vector by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Gene Editing and Screening Core (Dow et al., 2012, Nature Prot. 2:374). In contrast to the TRC equivalents, none of these 6 viruses affected cell growth of HeyA8 cells in a major way (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The conclusion that the expression of these shRNAs was too low to be toxic was based on our findings that expression of these shRNAs did not even result in a major silencing of the respective venus sensors (linked to either CD95 or the CD95L mRNA) (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In contrast, the toxic shRNAs shL3 and shR6 expressed from our inducible vector pTIP shut down Venus expression completely (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>There certainly could be other reasons for the lack in shRNA activity from these vectors outside our control. We have revised the section in the Discussion. In general, we are not concerned about the discrepancy between our data and other screens using miR-30-based shRNAs given that not only shRNAs but also siRNAs, DsiRNAs, and shRNA-based siRNAs are all effective DISE inducers. Thus, the DISE inducing activity seems to be independent of the delivery vehicle.</p><p>In response to the second part of the reviewers’ comment, we did titer siL3 to very low concentrations and the DISE inducing activity is indeed dose dependent (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). siL3 transfected at 0.1 nM was no longer toxic. In another manuscript in preparation we determined the IC50 for siL3 to kill cells to be 0.8 nM (Murmann et al. in preparation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors produced 3 different target deletions (ΔsiL3, ΔshL3 and ΔshR6) in 293T or HeyA8 cells to show that expression of the si or shRNAs, even in the absence of the target, is still lethal. The deletions seem to produce frame-shift mutations in the coding sequence (as the nt deleted are not a multiple of 3). The authors indeed show that ΔshR6 produces a protein knockout, which they use for a different experiment (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). This provokes the question of whether this is also the case for ΔsiL3 and ΔshL3 and whether it is appropriate to call them &quot;target site&quot; mutants if they are indeed functional knockouts. The authors state in their Introduction &quot;after deleting the CD95 gene tumors barely grew in vivo (Chen et al., 2010; Hadji et al., 2014)&quot; so maybe they could comment on the fact that HeyA8 ΔshR6, being a functional knockout and not exclusively a target site mutant grows similar to the parental cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p></disp-quote><p>All deletions were purposely designed to both delete the targeted site and to produce frame-shift mutations. In the chosen cell lines, CD95L protein and mRNA are virtually undetectable to begin with. So demonstrating functional knock-outs is only feasible for the deletion of CD95. Because the goal was to eliminate the target sites of our si/shRNAs (which we accomplished), whether the cells are true functional knock-outs (meaning, no functional protein being produced) was secondary to the question that needed to be addressed. Having functional knock-outs was an added benefit.</p><p>The reviewers are correct. Based on our in vivo mouse model data we expected cancer cell lines to not grow well after deletion of CD95. When generating the single cell clones with the target site deletion (or the complete deletion of CD95, now in future manuscript) we consistently observed that cells indeed initially grew slower than wt cells but because the effect was reduced with prolonged culture and because this effect could have been caused by clonal differences, we decided to not include this observation in the manuscript. This requires further work.</p><p>Overall, we believe we are looking at two different phenomena. Firstly, sequences derived from CD95L for instance are toxic to cancer cells regardless of the expression of the target. Secondly, as pointed out by the reviewers, we have shown in different genetically engineered mouse tumor models that the CD95 gene/protein is required for cancer cells to form tumors in vivo. We and others have shown that CD95 is involved in the maintenance of cancer stem cells (Ceppi et al., 2014, Nature Com. 5:5238; Drachsler et al., 2016, Cell Death Dis, 7:e2209; Teodoczyk et al., 2015, Cell Death Differ, 22:1192). We recently demonstrated that this occurs by activating a type I interferon/STAT1 pathway (Qadir et al., 2017, Cell Rep, 10:2373). In addition, CD95L does promote cell growth. This is apparent from the experiment in which we added either soluble CD95L (S2) (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel) or highly active leucine zipper tagged CD95L to the cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, center panel). In both cases, there was a small but reproducible and dose dependent increase in growth. We are currently testing whether these activities of CD95 are required for cancer cells to grow in syngeneic immune competent mouse models, which would explain the previous observations in the genetically engineered mouse tumor models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> enforced expression of the CD95L mRNA is toxic in HeyA8 cells. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, the CD95L-WT ORF is expressed (together with a scramble shRNA) and there is no observable increase in% subG1 compared to expression of vector only (together with a scramble shRNA) in either NB7 cells (panel D) or MCF-7 (panel G). Could the authors please comment on whether there are any other variables we should take into account or whether this is a cell type-specific phenotype. It is difficult to understand that NB7 lack caspase-8 but if they show the toxicity phenotype upon expression of the si/shRNAs and if over-expression of the CD95L is mediating the same phenotype, the model would predict CD95L would still cause lethality of this cell line.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct. These data seem to contradict our finding on the toxicity of the CD95L ORF. DISE kills all cancer cells and caspase-8 deficiency has no effect on this form of cell death. The reason that the cells did not seem to die in this rescue experiment is the way it was performed. In the experiments shown in former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> acute effects of CD95L ORF were monitored. Two days after infection with CD95L lentivirus, infected cells were selected for by treatment. After 24 hours in puromycin, cells were immediately plated for experiments. In contrast, in the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, NB7 cells were infected with the CD95L lentivirus, selected for two days with puromycin and then cultured in the presence of puromycin for another 7 days. We made two observations: First, NB7 cells seem to be less susceptible to the cell death induced by CD95L ORF and second, after 9 days in culture enough cells had recovered and expressed the siRNA resistant protein to perform the experiment. Interestingly, these CD95L expressing cells were still sensitive to DISE induction by either shL1 or shL3. We have added a sentence to the manuscript to properly describe this observation. The data on expressing CD95 in MCF-7 cells formerly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref> are not affected by this discussion as CD95 expression was not found to be toxic to any cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors perform a pooled screen to identify the most toxic sequences in the CD95 and CD95L genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The pool screen analysis is performed comparing the final time points to the plasmid pool. This is concerning as virus production and infection could also lead to biases in the shRNA representation. As it stands, it could very well be that many of the &quot;depleted&quot; shRNAs were never present in the cells to begin with. This leads to particular concern about the results in the absence of doxycycline. The authors state that the depletion observed without adding dox is most likely due to leakiness in the Tet-on system (subsection “Identification of toxic shRNAs in the CD95L and CD95 mRNAs”, second paragraph). However, in their initial experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) they expressed the highly toxic shRNA shL3 in 293T without any evidence of toxicity for at least 4 days. Thus, it would be very important to show the depletions observed in this pooled screen are indeed biological. Since the authors do not seem to have an initial post-infection time point to compare to, they could produce virus following the same set up and show that plasmid representation roughly corresponds to the shRNAs cloned from cells right after infection.</p></disp-quote><p>We discussed the design of this experiment in length during the planning of the shRNA screen and did many pilot experiments. First of all, the leakiness is not observed in all cells and not for all shRNAs, for reasons that are unclear. We found most effects of leakiness of the Tet inducible vector in HeyA8 and NB7 cells. 293T cells tolerate the vector expressing shL3 quite well and in these cells we do not see any effect on growth by just infecting them with the pTIP-shL3 vector in the absence of Dox, as seen in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>. This cell specific sensitivity to vector leakiness is the reason we documented the leakiness in NB7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>) as this was most relevant to the actual screen which was performed in NB7 cells. As information for the reviewers, we chose NB7 cells for the screen because we had established the CD95L ORF venus sensor in this cell line, which allowed us to confirm shRNA knockdown activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We found the CD95L Venus sensor vector to express very small amounts of active CD95L killing CD95 apoptosis sensitive cells. To avoid any interference by this activity, we chose the caspase-8 deficient NB7 cells for the screen.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that it would have been preferable to have a true infection control. However, due to the high variance in toxicity caused by different degrees of leakage by different shRNAs we realized that such a control was not possible. Certain shRNAs would have already been underrepresented 48 hours after infection (the time we determined that was required in NB7 cells to complete infection and virus integration). We therefore decided to compare the three conditions: 1. Plasmid pool (as a control of sequence representation in the library). 2. Cells 12 days after infection and no Dox addition (this served as the infection control the reviewers asked for, however only for shRNAs that do not show leakiness) and 3. Cells 12 days after infection in the presence of Dox (this would reveal the underrepresented/toxic shRNAs that were highly induced by Dox, both for shRNAs with and without leakiness). So, while we share the concern raised by the reviewers, we would like to point out that the data plus Dox further depleted many shRNAs when compared to the cells minus Dox. Minus Dox in this case serves as an expression control. As a side remark, we noticed that in the comprehensive cell line analysis recommended to us by the reviewers above (Cowley et al., Sci. Data, 2014) the authors also did not include an expression control but – similar to what we did – they compared the abundance of the shRNAs to the initial plasmid pool. We assume this was done for the same reason, that one cannot be certain that even at early times after infection highly active shRNAs already are not being selected against. A true infection control is therefore not possible.</p><p>The individual expression levels of the shRNAs are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. While a very small number of shRNAs were not well expressed, the vast majority were and comparing the plus Dox with the minus Dox data we do have a relative presentation of each shRNA that takes into account infectious yield of many shRNAs. Importantly, underrepresented shRNAs identified in the comparison between library and no Dox treatment and between minus and plus Dox treatment mapped to similar regions in both CD95 and CD95L (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> blue with orange ticks) suggesting that the depletion is biological.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Regarding the analysis of AGO-bound small RNAs that align to the CD95L, does the analysis take into account the possibility of PCR duplicates? Also, strand information is essential if the model is that this CD95L derived small RNAs are mediating knockdown of survival genes. The analysis text does not specify whether BLAST was run with any strand specificity so it would be essential for the authors to clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved this analysis to a manuscript to be published in the future. However, we would still like to answer the questions raised by the reviewers as we take them seriously. In addition, this will also explain why we felt that all these new data would be outside the focus recommended to us by the reviewers, and they would have further increased the size of this manuscript.</p><p>While PCR duplicates are always a concern, during the analysis we made sure that the PCR amplification was in the exponential phase. We actually performed extensive pilot PCRs. When done properly, PCR duplicates are of little concern and the biases in the library are stemming mainly from the 3’ and 5’ adapter ligation steps. Unfortunately, those cannot really be avoided entirely. We have previously published a careful study on biases in small RNA library preparations (Hafner et al., 2011, RNA, 17:1697).</p><p>The analysis was done in a strand specific fashion. All reads aligned are derived from the plus strand. Very few antisense reads were detected. We are aware that this raises the question of how these sequences can target survival genes through RNAi. We have generated new data to be published soon. These new data provide the first hint on how this might work. In the original manuscript, we showed in the highly DISE sensitive Drosha k.o. cells many more of the CD95L-derived reads are bound to AGO proteins when compared to wt cells. We have now performed an analysis of the total small RNAs in Drosha k.o. cells before they bind to AGO proteins. Overall, we find reads aligned to roughly to the same 22 regions in CD95L. However, overall reads in the cytosol tend to be longer than the ones bound to AGOs. In addition, we now have data on an RNA secondary structure prediction analysis for the CD95L ORF. According to this analysis the CD95L ORF RNA forms a tightly folded structure with many of the reads in the 22 regions juxtaposing each other in stem-like structures creating regions of significant complementarity. These may provide the duplexes needed to be processed and loaded into the RISC but this requires further work. We do not know yet what mRNA degrading system generated the small RNAs that are bound by AGO proteins. However, we see similar read locations when analyzing small CD95L derived RNAs in HeyA8 cells, both from total RNA as well as AGO bound (unpublished data) which could point at a general degradation mechanism. These new data will be part of the new manuscript we are now finalizing.</p></body></sub-article></article>
