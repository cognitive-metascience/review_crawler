However, their developmental relationships remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that different MSC populations in the developing marrow of long bones have distinct functions. Proliferative mesoderm-derived nestin<sup>−</sup> MSCs participate in fetal skeletogenesis and lose MSC activity soon after birth. In contrast, quiescent neural crest-derived nestin<sup>+</sup> cells preserve MSC activity, but do not generate fetal chondrocytes. Instead, they differentiate into HSC niche-forming MSCs, helping to establish the HSC niche by secreting Cxcl12. Perineural migration of these cells to the bone marrow requires the ErbB3 receptor. The neonatal Nestin-GFP<sup>+</sup> Pdgfrα<sup>−</sup> cell population also contains Schwann cell precursors, but does not comprise mature Schwann cells. Thus, in the developing bone marrow HSC niche-forming MSCs share a common origin with sympathetic peripheral neurons and glial cells, and ontogenically distinct MSCs have non-overlapping functions in endochondrogenesis and HSC niche formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03696.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03696.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03696.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>During the earliest phases of development, the embryo is formed by groups of stem cells that can develop into all the different types of tissue in the body—from bones to brain tissue. Later in life, small stockpiles of adult stem cells are found in various tissues and provide a reservoir of new cells available for replacing old or damaged cells. The most important source of blood stem cells is the bone marrow, which produces and stores cells that are capable of developing into blood and immune system cells. These processes are assisted by different bone marrow cells called stromal cells, which create a specialized local environment or ‘niche’.</p><p>But are the stromal stem cells that form the skeleton the same ones that form this niche during development? Or do the various types of stromal stem cells develop from distinct groups of cells in the embryo? Furthermore, it is unclear which cells guide blood stem cells towards the forming bones.</p><p>Other types of cells, including some of the cells of the nervous system, can communicate with the stem cells in the adult marrow and influence their behavior. This led scientists to wonder whether the stem cells in the bone marrow niche and the cells that communicate with them developed from the same type of embryonic stem cell.</p><p>Isern et al. tracked down the developmental origins of different types of bone marrow stromal stem cells by examining the bone marrow from the long bones (for example, the bones in the leg) of unborn and infant mice. It turns out that not all stromal stem cells in the developing bone marrow are alike. In fact, one pool of stromal stem cells forms the skeleton and loses stem cell activity in the process. In contrast, a different population of stromal stem cells develops from the same group of embryonic cells that gives rise to the cells of the nervous system. The stromal stem cells in this second group function as a niche to recruit and store the incoming blood stem cells and retain their stem cell activity throughout life.</p><p>The findings of Isern et al. help to explain why the nervous system is able to communicate with stem cells in the adult marrow, and provide a model for understanding how stem cell niches in organs that contain nerve tissue are established.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03696.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03696.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

heterogeneous population. The different mesenchymal cell types might either arise from a variety of resident progenitors or might ultimately be derived from a single population of rare MSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caplan, 1991</xref>). In adult mammals, a multiple origin of skeletal MSCs is suggested by the distinct germ layer derivation of different bone structures, with craniofacial bones generated by the neuroectoderm, whereas the axial and appendicular bones are respectively derived from paraxial and lateral mesoderm. Mesoderm generates chondrocytes, which are progressively replaced by osteoblasts through the process of endochondral ossification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Olsen et al., 2000</xref>). MSCs share cell-surface markers and localization with pericytes, suggesting that some pericytes might be MSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crisan et al., 2008</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether the bone marrow hosts ontogenically distinct MSCs in the same bones and whether they are endowed with specific functions.</p><p>In adult bone marrow, a variety of mesenchymal cells regulate HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calvi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sacchetti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Naveiras et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mendez-Ferrer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Omatsu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Raaijmakers et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, the specialized functions and developmental origin of these cells are largely unknown. Adult HSCs are also regulated by certain other non-hematopoietic lineages, including endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avecilla et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kiel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ding et al., 2012</xref>), sympathetic neurons and associated non-myelinating Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Katayama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spiegel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mendez-Ferrer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yamazaki et al., 2011</xref>), perivascular cells expressing the leptin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ding et al., 2012</xref>) and mesodermal derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greenbaum et al., 2013</xref>). However, the relationships and potential overlap among these populations remain unclear. It is also not known whether MSCs that form the HSC niche also generate other stromal cells or are a specialized population that arises earlier in embryogenesis and persists into adulthood.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the developmental origin and functions of MSCs in the primordial marrow of long bones. We show that, like peripheral neural and glial cells, HSC niche-forming MSCs in perinatal bone marrow arise from the trunk neural crest and make only a modest contribution to endochondrogenesis. Thus, whereas mesoderm-derived MSCs are mostly involved in endochondral ossification, neural crest-derived cells have a specialized function in establishing the HSC niche in the developing marrow of the same bones. These results provide compelling evidence for functional segregation of MSCs derived from different germ layers. The data also show that three HSC niche components—peripheral sympathetic neurons, Schwann cells, and MSCs—share a common origin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fetal bone marrow nestin<sup>+</sup> cells are quiescent and distinct from osteochondral cells</title><p>In adult mouse bone marrow, stromal cells expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by the regulatory elements of nestin promoter (Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup>) display features of both MSCs and HSC niche cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mendez-Ferrer et al., 2010</xref>). This finding prompted us to characterize Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells during marrow development in limb bones. GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were already present in E16.5 bone marrow, associated preferentially with blood vessels infiltrating the cartilage scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). At E18.5 Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were frequently associated with arterioles and sprouting endothelial cells within the osteochondral junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Fetal bone marrow Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were heterogeneous, composed of a majority of BMSCs but also including a small subset of CD31<sup>+</sup> putative endothelial cells that increased during the postnatal period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Compared with Nes-GFP<sup>-</sup> BMSCs, the Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cell population was enriched in endogenous <italic>Nestin</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Arterioles were associated with an intense fluorescence microscopy signal, due to the presence of several concentric GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, including an outer layer that expressed smooth muscle actin and an inner layer of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). Fetal bone marrow Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were distinct from S100-expressing chondrocytes and osteoblastic cells genetically labeled with the 2.3-kilobase proximal fragment of the α1(I)-collagen promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dacquin et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref>). Contrasting the marked proliferation of Nes-GFP<sup>-</sup> BMSCs in perinatal life, Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells remained mostly quiescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). As a result, whereas Nes-GFP<sup>-</sup> BMSCs steadily expanded, Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> BMSC number did not change significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Fetal bone marrow Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells thus include a small subset (&lt;10%) of endothelial cells and a large population of non-endothelial stromal cells (&gt;90%). Unlike Nes-GFP<sup>-</sup> stromal cells, Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells proliferate slowly and do not express osteochondral protein cell markers.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03696.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fetal bone marrow nestin<sup>+</sup> cells proliferate slowly and are distinct from osteochondral cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in fetal bones undergoing endochondral ossification.

Unbiased hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) revealed that Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> Pdgfrα<sup>+</sup> cells were more similar to adult primitive BMSCs and distinct from more differentiated osteoblastic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nakamura et al., 2010</xref>). Pdgfrα<sup>+</sup> Nes-GFP<sup>+/−</sup> cells clustered nearby, consistent with the increasing restriction of Pdgfrα to Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in postnatal bone marrow. In addition, Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> Pdgfrα <sup>+</sup> cells clustered far from Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> Pdgfrα<sup>−</sup> cells, whose genomic profile was closest to that of E12.5 Schwann cell precursors. MSC-like and neural crest stem-cell-like derived clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wislet-Gendebien et al., 2012</xref>) were markedly different, probably because these were cultured cells. Intriguingly, we noted a maturation hierarchy of Schwann and osteolineage cells, from undifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, lower corners) to more mature lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, contralateral upper corners). At the intersection of these differentiation waves, adult bone marrow CD45<sup>−</sup> Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mendez-Ferrer et al., 2010</xref>) converged with bone marrow HSC niche cells identified by the expression of stem cell factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ding et al., 2012</xref>). These results suggest the existence of two nestin<sup>+</sup> populations with non-overlapping MSC and Schwann cell precursor features. To test this hypothesis functionally, we cultured neonatal Nes-GFP<sup>+/−</sup> Pdgfrα<sup>+/−</sup> BMSCs in differentiation medium, finding that mesenchymal and glial differentiation was segregated in Pdgfrα<sup>+</sup> and Pdgfrα<sup>−</sup> cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>).

In addition, human bone marrow-derived mesenspheres secrete factors that can expand human cord blood HSCs through secreted factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Isern et al., 2013</xref>). These findings and the results presented so far together suggest that neural crest-derived MSCs might have a specialized function in establishing the HSC niche in the developing bone marrow. We further studied the role of neural crest-derived cells in this process using a loss-of-function model. Perineural migration of neural crest-derived cells requires the interaction of the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase ErbB3 with the ligand neuregulin-1, produced by developing nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jessen and Mirsky, 2005</xref>). <italic>Erbb3</italic>-deficient mice initially show normal development of peripheral nerves but later display impaired perineural migration of neural crest-derived cells and die at perinatal stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Riethmacher et al., 1997</xref>). Hematopoietic progenitors were increased in fetal liver of KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, expression of the MSC marker CD90, enriched in Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>), was reduced two-fold in <italic>Erbb3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> limb bone marrow, associated with 5-fold drop in the number of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,G</xref>). To further dissect the contribution of neural crest to fetal hematopoiesis, we performed a similar analysis in mice conditionally lacking ErbB3 in Schwann-committed cells. To label Schwann cells, we intercrossed <italic>R26-Tomato</italic> reporter mice intercrossed with a line expressing Cre recombinase under the regulatory elements of desert hedgehog (<italic>Dhh</italic>) promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jaegle et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). These <italic>Dhh-Cre</italic> mice were then intercrossed with the ErbB3 conditional KO.

Together, these results suggest that neural crest cells not yet committed to the Schwann cell lineage migrate along developing nerves to the bone marrow, giving rise to HSC niche-forming MSCs.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03696.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Perineural migration of neural crest-derived cells to long bones generates nestin<sup>+</sup> MSCs with specialized HSC niche function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) E17.5-E18.5 fetal liver (FL) sections from wild-type (wt) and <italic>Erbb3</italic>-null embryos stained with antibodies for mature hematopoietic lineage (blue) and c-Kit (red).

Cxcl12 is produced by several stromal cells and is required for developmental bone marrow colonization by HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ara et al., 2003</xref>). It has been argued that Cxcl12 produced by endothelial cells and nestin<sup>−</sup> mesenchymal progenitors—but not by nestin<sup>+</sup> cells—is necessary for adult HSC maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding and Morrison, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greenbaum et al., 2013</xref>). We found that, one week after birth, <italic>Cxcl12</italic> mRNA levels in Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> BMSCs were &gt;20-fold higher than in bone marrow endothelial cells and 80-fold higher than in Nes-GFP<sup>-</sup> BMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).

This was associated with an ∼30% reduction of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors and HSCs measured by long-term competitive repopulation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N,O</xref>). These results demonstrate that Cxcl12 production by nestin<sup>+</sup> MSCs contributes to the HSC niche formation in the developing bone marrow.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the ontogeny and specific functions of mesenchymal progenitors in the fetal bone marrow. We show that the developing bone marrow in axial and appendicular skeleton harbors different MSC populations with distinct origins and specialized roles. While mesoderm-derived nestin<sup>−</sup> MSCs give rise to bone and cartilage, the neuroectoderm provides an additional source of MSCs, marked by nestin expression, that are endowed with specific HSC niche functions. We therefore conclude that osteochondroprogenitor and stem cell niche functions are separate and non-overlapping during bone marrow ontogenesis. The neural crest thus gives rise to three regulators of adult HSC activity: sympathetic neurons, associated Schwann cells, and nestin<sup>+</sup> MSCs.</p><p>Although it is accepted that mammalian connective tissues, such as bone or skeletal muscle, are derived mainly from mesoderm, the precise origin of BMSCs has remained unclear. While the neural crest contributes to the craniofacial skeleton, the trunk neural crest is thought to generate mostly non-ectomesenchymal derivatives, including melanocytes, neurons, and glia of the peripheral nervous system. In the trunk skeleton, mesenchymal cells have thus been considered to be derived mostly from the mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Olsen et al., 2000</xref>), but the neural crest is also a source of pericytes, mural cells, and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergwerff et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Etchevers et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Joseph et al., 2004</xref>) that can differentiate into mesenchymal lineages in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morikawa et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glejzer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">John et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Komada et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, mature endothelial cells can generate mesenchymal cells through endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Genetic fate-mapping studies using the neuroepithelial marker <italic>Sox1</italic> identified a neuroectodermal origin of the earliest trunk MSCs, but other MSCs are recruited from undefined sources at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takashima et al., 2007</xref>). This picture raised the question of whether several MSCs might transiently coexist in the developing bone marrow and whether neural-crest-derived MSCs with specific functions might persist in the postnatal bone marrow.</p><p>In this study, we show that most mesenchymal activity and chondrogenic capacity in the fetal bone marrow is associated with nestin<sup>−</sup> MSCs, but that these rapidly differentiate towards committed osteochondral lineages early in postnatal life. In contrast, slow-proliferating neural crest-derived nestin<sup>+</sup> MSCs do not contribute to fetal endochondrogenesis but are instead required to establish the HSC niche in the same bones. Interestingly, we also found that nestin<sup>+</sup> cells retained most of their steady-state MSC activity after the second postnatal week. Future studies will determine the potential contribution of this MSC population to adult skeletal turnover.</p><p>Very recent data showed that <italic>Osterix-Cre</italic>-labeled cells in neonatal bone give rise to Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> MSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mizoguchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ono et al., 2014</xref>); however, the <italic>Osterix-Cre</italic> lines used in these studies have been shown previously to mark not only osteolineage cells but also a large variety of non-osteolineage cells, including adventitial reticular cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, adipocytes, and perineural cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). It therefore remains possible that some Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, which highly express <italic>Osterix</italic> mRNA (but not the protein, as we show here), also express the <italic>Osterix-Cre</italic> transgene; however, this might not necessarily reflect a lineage relationship or osteoblastic commitment. Moreover, it is unclear whether this <italic>Osterix-Cre</italic>-traced population is uniformly mesodermal or neural crest-derived. We did not find Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells within cartilage, but some GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were associated with the innermost part of the perichondrium, a region that contains MSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zaidi and Mendez-Ferrer, 2013</xref>). Moreover, we found perichondrial <italic>Wnt1-Cre2</italic>-traced cells and neural crest-derived chondrocytes in the most superficial layers of articular cartilage, suggesting that the neural crest also contributes to these mesenchymal cells outside the marrow. Neural crest-derived skeletal embryonic precursors might be Pdgfrα<sup>+</sup> Nes-GFP<sup>-</sup> BMSCs, since we have shown that most neural crest cells traced by <italic>Wnt1-Cre2</italic> are Pdgfrα<sup>+</sup> Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, which do not seem to contribute to fetal osteochondral lineages.</p><p>Previous studies suggested that only endochondral cells can form a hematopoietic microenvironment when implanted beneath the kidney capsule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2013</xref>), although bones formed by intramembranous ossification, such as the skull, can also form hematopoietic marrow without progressing through a cartilage intermediate. Notably, two surface markers used to isolate osteochondrogenic precursors in these studies, CD105 and CD90/Thy1, are particularly enriched in bone marrow Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells. Our genetic studies clearly show that neural crest-derived cells that are not yet committed to the Schwann cell lineage migrate to bone in association with developing nerve fibers and give rise to bone marrow nestin<sup>+</sup> MSCs with specialized HSC niche functions. Constitutive deletion of the neuregulin-1 receptor ErbB3<italic>,</italic> which does not directly affect the peripheral nerves but impairs perineural migration of neural crest-derived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Riethmacher et al., 1997</xref>), reduces BMSC number and impairs developmental HSC migration from liver to bone marrow. In contrast, conditional deletion of <italic>ErbB3</italic> in committed glial precursors severely reduced Schwann cell numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sheean et al., 2014</xref>) but did not affect bone marrow HSCs in our study. HSC maintenance genes are highly enriched and progressively upregulated in Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> Pdgfrα<sup>+</sup> MSCs, coincident with HSC bone marrow colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christensen et al., 2004</xref>). Perinatal deletion of nestin<sup>+</sup> cells or blockade of their Cxcl12 production prevented HSC bone marrow seeding. Therefore, we are confident that neural crest-derived nestin<sup>+</sup> MSCs are indeed required for developmental HSC migration and formation of the bone marrow HSC niche.</p><p>Uncertainties remain about the possible overlap among different adult bone marrow mesenchymal cells with proposed HSC niche functions, which might also differ in fetal and adult bone marrow. Two populations of adult bone marrow Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells can be separated by fluorescence intensity by microscopy. Nes-GFP<sup>bright</sup> peri-arteriolar cells, unlike Nes-GFP<sup>dim</sup> peri-sinusoidal cells, were found highly enriched in CFU-F activity and expression of HSC maintenance genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kunisaki et al., 2013</xref>). However, these features have been previously attributed to peri-sinusoidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kiel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sacchetti et al., 2007</xref>), which, unlike arteriolar cells, express both Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> and leptin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ding et al., 2012</xref>). Alternatively, an intermediate type of vessel that connects arterioles with sinusoids near the bone surface might be highly enriched in nestin<sup>+</sup> MSCs. These vessels, different from arterioles and sinusoids, contain CD31<sup>hi</sup> Endomucin<sup>hi</sup> endothelial cells and have been associated with osteoprogenitor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kusumbe et al., 2014</xref>). We initially reported that adult bone marrow Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were CD31<sup>−</sup> after using an intensive enzymatic digestion protocol to isolate the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mendez-Ferrer et al., 2010</xref>). In the present study, we have used milder conditions that better preserve antigen expression. In these conditions, we detect Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> CD31<sup>+</sup> putative bone marrow endothelial cells progressively increasing in number with age, as reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ono et al., 2014</xref>). We also find that multiple layers of Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> endothelial and perivascular cells likely make the arteriolar GFP signal appear brighter for GFP under the microscope. This raises the possibility that arteriolar Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kunisaki et al., 2013</xref>) might not completely coincide with the brightest cells isolated by FACS. However, we also found that <italic>Cxcl12</italic> is more abundantly produced by Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> BMSCs than by endothelial cells, and that <italic>Cxcl12</italic> deletion in <italic>Nes-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> mice impairs developmental HSC migration by preferentially targeting BMSCs.</p><p>Different bone marrow cells have been proposed as the main producers of Cxcl12 for HSCs. One report has argued that the only relevant source of Cxcl12 for adult HSC maintenance is nestin<sup>–</sup>leptin receptor<sup>–</sup>mesenchymal progenitors targeted by the <italic>Prx1-Cre</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greenbaum et al., 2013</xref>). This conclusion is based on the stronger HSC depletion when <italic>Cxcl12</italic> was deleted using the <italic>Prx1-Cre</italic> line—which targets somatic lateral plate mesoderm and its derivatives, including chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages—compared to deletion in more specific stromal populations. Also, the HSC defect was specifically attributed to CD45<sup>-</sup> Lin<sup>−</sup> Pdgfrα<sup>+</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> <italic>Prx1-cre</italic>-tdtomato<sup>hi</sup> cells which were not enriched in the expression of nestin or leptin receptor but also showed no marked enrichment in the expression of <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, <italic>Kitl</italic> or other mesenchymal markers. An alternate model is that endothelial cells are needed for Cxcl12-mediated adult HSC maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding and Morrison, 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, the <italic>Tek</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic> system used would also target endothelial cells in fetal hematopoietic organs, so some of the effects might have been exported to the bone marrow during development. The study, in essence, proposed that nestin-negative leptin receptor (<italic>Lepr</italic>)-<italic>Cre</italic>-traced mesenchymal progenitors are another key source of Cxcl12 for HSC maintenance. These studies, however, analyzed the adult bone marrow, whereas the focus of our study has been the fetal and perinatal period. Differences may also have arisen from distinct experimental settings, Cre drivers (constitutive/inducible), Cre induction regimes and reporters used. It is also likely that constitutive <italic>Prx1-Cre</italic> and <italic>Lepr-Cre</italic> lines target multiple mesenchymal derivatives and that combined deletion of <italic>Cxcl12</italic> in these populations would have a more pronounced effect than deletion in specific cell types; however, the responsible cell populations might not be clear yet. Conversely, the lower excision in <italic>Nes-Cre</italic> mice and inefficient bone marrow recombination in adult <italic>Nes-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> mice might not target all MSCs, or might result in compensatory actions by other Cxcl12-producing cells. In the present study, recombination efficiency in Nes-GFP<sup>+</sup> MSCs was higher when tamoxifen was administered in neonatal <italic>Nes-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> mice than in adults. It has also been proposed that <italic>Nes</italic>-G<italic>fp</italic> and <italic>Nes-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> lines might target different populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ding et al., 2012</xref>). To directly address this, we generated <italic>Nes</italic>-G<italic>fp</italic>;<italic>Nes-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup><italic>;R26-Tomato</italic> triple transgenic mice that demonstrate consistent labeling using a different induction protocol. Bone marrow endothelial <italic>Cxcl12</italic> expression levels are significantly lower in this model, and seem unaffected by <italic>Nes-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>-driven excision, contrasting with the reduction in BMSCs, which was associated with decreased HSPC numbers in perinatal bone marrow. Our results thus clearly show that Cxcl12 produced by nestin<sup>+</sup> MSCs is required for developmental HSC migration to bone marrow.</p><p>We recently reported that sympathetic neuropathy of the HSC niche is required for the manifestation of myeloproliferative neoplasms, disorders previously considered to be autonomously driven by mutated HSCs and typically associated with excessive fibroblasts and osteoblasts in the bone marrow. During this pathogenesis, bone marrow nestin<sup>+</sup> cells do not seem to differentiate into fibroblasts or osteoblasts, but instead activate the Schwann cell program as a consequence of the neuroglial damage caused in the bone marrow by mutated HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4"><italic>Arranz et al., 2014</italic></xref>). These changes could be explained by a neural crest contribution found for HSC niche-forming MSCs and suggest the possible re-programming of these cells towards the closest ontogenically-related linages during the pathogenesis of these disorders.</p><p>In summary, this study designates separate biologic functions to ontogenically distinct populations of MSCs, and demonstrates that not all MSCs are alike. In the appendicular skeleton, nestin<sup>−</sup> MSCs derived from the mesoderm have a primarily osteochondroprogenitor function. In contrast, a distinct population of neural crest-derived nestin<sup>+</sup> MSCs contributes to directed HSC migration through the secretion of the chemokine Cxcl12 to ultimately establish the HSC niche in the neonatal bone marrow. These niche-forming MSCs share a common origin with sympathetic neurons and Schwann cells, an ontogenic relationship that underscores our earlier observations on the sympathetic control of HSC niche function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mendez-Ferrer et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arranz et al., 2014</xref>). Future studies will also determine whether tight regulation of other peripheral adult stem cell niches by the nervous system also builds upon an ontogenic relationship of their components.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mouse lines used in this study (please see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> for a detailed list of mouse strains used in this study) included <italic>Nes-Gfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mignone et al., 2004</xref>), <italic>Nes-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balordi and Fishell, 2007</xref>), <italic>Sox10-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matsuoka et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>Col2.3-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dacquin et al., 2002</xref>), <italic>Dhh-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jaegle et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>RCE-loxP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sousa et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>LSL-KFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dieguez-Hurtado et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>R26-DTA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brockschnieder et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>Cxcl12</italic><sup>floxed</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tzeng et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>Erbb3</italic><sup>floxed</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sheean et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Erbb3</italic>-null (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Riethmacher et al., 1997</xref>), and <italic>129S4.Cg-Tg(Wnt1-cre)2Sor/J</italic>, <italic>C57BL/6-Gt(ROSA)26Sor</italic><sup><italic>tm1(HBEGF)Awai</italic></sup><italic>/J</italic>, <italic>B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sor</italic><sup><italic>tm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</italic></sup><italic>/J</italic>, wild-type CD1 and wild-type C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratories).

In a lineage tracing study this is a crucial requirement since, at low magnification, as all the images are, it is very difficult if not impossible to demonstrate co-localisation of the tracer with the tissue specific antigen under observation. Confocal, high magnification analysis would be required to substantiate the results in virtually all the figures presented. Moreover, even at low magnification there are clear inconsistencies: for example expression of CD31 is not known to occur in non-endothelial cells and thus a double staining should have been performed. Also, while Osterix appears not to be expressed in lateral plate derived cells (but very few cells are shown), the co-expression with Wnt1 labeled neural crest is partial and doubtful, making the main conclusion of the whole work particularly weak.</p><p>In addition all reviewers found the manuscript difficult to read and practically inaccessible to a non-specialised audience. The reviews are included below to assist with your revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>This manuscript reports an interesting and potentially important finding on functional heterogeneity and developmental origin of bone marrow stromal cells.</p><p>However the main and potentially ground breaking finding, i.e. that Nestin+ MSC are derived from neural crest and support hematopoiesis rather than building the bone itself, is not supported by the data presented, that are of poor quality and do not allow to draw final conclusions on the developmental origin of these cells.</p><p>Moreover, the manuscript is poorly written, difficult to follow and would greatly benefit from careful editing and, at least in some parts, re-writing.</p><p>1) Authors report that a small but increasing fraction of GFP+ also express CD31 and that this fraction increases with age. Since Nestin is not known to be expressed in endothelial cells, a co-staining with also anti-nestin antibody should be performed and co-localization investigated at confocal level, since this bears important implications on the fidelity of the GFP transgene.</p><p>2) The text describing data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> is particularly confusing and almost impossible to interpret: “These mice and newborn Nes-gfp embryos were analyzed for osterix protein expression, which marks cells committed to the osteoblastic lineage. In contrast, cells genetically traced by the regulatory elements of Osterix gene do not only comprise osteoblastic cells, but also adventitial reticular cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, adipocytes and perineural cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Unlike cells derived from lateral plate mesoderm, fetal limb bone marrow Nes-GFP+ cells did not express osterix protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-B</xref>) and therefore could not be considered osteoblast precursors.”</p><p>After describing the Hoxb6-CreERT mice (labelling lateral mesoderm derived cells) the Authors show no co-localization of Nes-GFP and Osterix, and then “presumed” co-localization of Hoxb6 (i.e. lateral plated) derived cells and Osterix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). They conclude that because Nestin-GFP+ cells do not co-localize with Hoxb6 labelled cells they cannot be of lateral plate origin. This is a crucial point and particularly weak. First of all, at the magnification shown it is impossible to draw any conclusion. In A', very few GFP+ cells are visible and in an area where they are quite distant from Osx+ cells.</p><p>On the other hand, in B' only a very small minority of HoxB6 derived cells express Osx (and at that magnification it is hard to be sure): in most case the colour overlap seems partial, as it may originate from two cells one above the other. Even assuming that there is co-localization in few cells, what about all the others Osx+ cells? Even though recombination is never 100% efficient, one would conclude that the very large majority of Osx expressing cells do not derive from lateral mesoderm. Maybe they originate from paraxial mesoderm, but then another Cre would be required or the origin of Osx expressing cells remains largely unidentified in this work.</p><p>3) The overlap between Nestin-GFP and Nestin-Cre derived cells is only minor and, again, at that magnification it is impossible to draw solid conclusions. It is possible that Nestin-Cre derived cells have turned off the expression of Nestin gene, but then what have they become? Conversely, many Nestin-GFP+ do not seem to have originated from cells previously expressing Nestin. Even the example at “high” magnification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) shows one cell (**) that is clearly double labelled and another example (*) where there are two neighbouring but clearly distinct cells. These data are not convincing at all of a reliable lineage tracing.</p><p>4) Data on Wnt1-Cre appear more convincing, but again, a high magnification of a double-labelled cell at the confocal level would be necessary, especially for osteocytes (Cartilage staining is quite convincing even at low mag). However, FACS analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> has problems. The Wnt1-Cre/Tomato clearly shows a dim (continuous with background) and a very bright population, both gated together to show that 62% of these are Nes-GFP+. I would have liked to see whether the Nes-GFP+ cells are equally represented in the bright and the dim populations. This is critical because the results are highly dependent on the specific gating. Most importantly, the IF shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> is highly unconvincing and does not support the claim that Nes-GFP+ are derived from Wnt1 expressing cells. The very few Tomato+ cells do not really co-localize with GFP+ cells and the examples shown in D look like at most closely located cells. Finally, the FACS analysis for Sox10-Cre also shows that gating has included both bright cells, clearly separated from the negative peak and the shoulder of this. I would like to see whether the bright cells only are GFP+.</p><p>5) The final sections of the Results, though also suffering of the poor quality of the images, are more convincing but less original. Furthermore DTR experiments are tricky, first because killing Nestin expressing cells may have also consequences in other tissue and possibly systemic effects. In addition, and this criticism applies to all of these studies, developmental biologists seem to be unaware of the “bystander effect”, well studied by gene therapists, where killing a specific cell, often causes the death of the nearest cells, thus mudding the results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>The manuscript by Isern et al describes the results of experiments examining the developmental origins (fetal, neonatal and adult) of the mesenchymal cells that are osteogenic and that support the hematopoietic system in the bone marrow. The experiments mainly utilize the nestin-gfp reporter mouse model in addition to other mouse models in which induced recombination mediated reporter expression defines specific neural crest derived populations. The manuscript is filled with information but it is sometimes difficult to understand how it is related to the main question. For example, it is not explained why CD31 immunostaining is performed on nestin gfp tissues; what cell types does it mark? Convention is the endothelial and hematopoietic cells express CD31, not MSC. The Discussion provides some information about levels of CD31 expression but this comes rather late in the manuscript.</p><p>In the Results section that describes BM nestin+ cells do not contribute to fetal endochondrogenesis, the RCE reporter is used, what is this? No definition is provided. Also, later in this paragraph, the sentence beginning with “In contrast, cells…” seems misplaced and confusing, making this text and results hard to follow. Similarly, it is not understood why a Wnt Cre line was used. What is the rationale? I seem to miss the connection. It would be helpful to reorganize and perhaps move some information from the main text to the Discussion or leave it out if it is not directly related to the question. It would be helpful to the reader if the manuscript could be more direct in describing the experimental rationale.</p><p>Altogether, the authors have done a large amount of work to show that there are different component populations of mesenchymal cells that contribute to the development of the long bones, bone marrow and the supportive hematopoietic microenvironment. This is an important set of results that supports a new conceptual model for the development of the hematopoietic supportive microenvironment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>This manuscript identifies the ontological source of an important bone marrow (BM) niche cells previously identified by the senior author. These cells are the Nestin-GFP+ (Nes-GFP+) cells in the adult BM that are a source of MSC and niche support. The Mendez-Ferrer group has extended this work to the developing fetal and early postnatal bone and observed exciting and enlightening results. They demonstrate that trunk neural crest cells are the developmental source for Nes-GFP+ MSC in the BM, in addition to their known contributions to peripheral sympathetic neurons and Schwann cells. Interestingly, all three of these cells types are important BM niche components. As such they share an ontological relationship that could theoretically extend to other niche components elsewhere in the body. Nes-GFP+ cells were characterized in the developing bone (E17.5), at P0 and at P7 with a variety of lineage tracing and Cre deletion transgenics in addition to cell surface IHC and flow cytometry. From a wide array of models they show:</p><p>1) Nes-GFP+ cells do not exhibit osteochondral progenitor activity. Nes-GFP- cells that derive from lateral plate mesoderm possess this activity in fetal bone.</p><p>2) Neural crest contribution to postnatal BM-MSCs was definitively demonstrated by genetic fate mapping with Wnt1-Cre2 and Sox10-CreERT2.</p><p>3) Cell surface and mRNA-seq studies of PDGFRa+/- and Nes-GFP+/- cells revealed that there are two Nes-GFP+ neural crest derived cells in postnatal BM. Schwann cell precursors are in the PDGFRa- fraction while PDGFRa+ cells contain the MSCs.</p><p>4) Neural crest cells migrate along developing nerves to the fetal bone before commitment to the Schwann cell lineage and give rise to niche forming MSCs.</p><p>5) Cxcl12 expression was shown to be 80 and 20-fold higher in Nes-GFP+ cells compared to Nes-GFP- and endothelial cells respectively.</p><p>6) Conditional deletion of Cxcl12 in Nes-GFP+ cells led to a significant 30% reduction in CFU and a non-significant decrease in repopulating HSC.</p><p>The experiments are well performed and described. With minor exceptions the figures are clear and well presented. I have only minor suggestions and comments about the paper. The reviewer appreciates the very thoughtful and extensive discussion that attempts to resolve some apparent controversies in the field. I believe the manuscript is a significant contribution the HSC niche field. So many different transgenic strains of mice, here at least 12 gets confusing with all the acronyms and the lack of good explanations, here a table would have helped.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03696.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>This manuscript reports an interesting and potentially important finding on functional heterogeneity and developmental origin of bone marrow stromal cells</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for finding our study interesting and potentially important, and for the suggestions that have helped to improve the paper.</p><p><italic>However the main and potentially ground breaking finding, i.e. that Nestin+ MSC are derived from neural crest and support hematopoiesis rather than building the bone itself, is not supported by the data presented, that are of poor quality and do not allow to draw final conclusions on the developmental origin of these cells</italic>.</p><p>We apologize if the quality of the images examined was suboptimal.

This has been clearly shown in a study cited in our manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). This is likely explained by the fact that different stem cells (including MSCs) actively transcribe differentiation factors which are not translated into proteins, which that does not imply lineage commitment but allows them to rapidly differentiate in response to stimuli. This explains some contradictions in the field. We have reworded the corresponding section to reduce confusion. Unlike mesodermal derivatives, <italic>Nes-</italic>GFP+ did not express highly osterix protein and they did not contribute significantly to fetal osteocytes. We therefore conclude that these cells were not osteoblast precursors (even though they might show <italic>Osterix</italic> mRNA expression).</p><p><italic>After describing the Hoxb6-CreERT mice (labelling lateral mesoderm derived cells) the Authors show no co-localization of Nes-GFP and Osterix, and then “presumed” co-localization of Hoxb6 (i.e. lateral plated) derived cells and Osterix (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref><italic>).

Together with limited recombination efficiency, this might explain why few GFP+ cells were observed using this mouse line and induction regimen. However, most of these cells labeled with cytoplasmic GFP also had nuclear osterix protein (please be aware of the different location of the fluorescent signal; new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> in the revised manuscript, also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref> below).

This might underestimate the real contribution of lateral mesoderm to osterix+ cells. Although it is possible, as suggested by the reviewer, that other mesodermal sources contribute to osteoprogenitor cells, this possibility would not affect the conclusions of our paper and also falls outside its current and already wide scope. We have taken the advantage of this genetic system to visualize mesodermal derivatives (in this case, lateral plate) and have demonstrated that this population, unlike <italic>Nestin-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>-traced cells, overlaps with embryonic skeletal precursors expressing osterix protein (an accepted marker of osteoprogenitor cells). We have also shown an abundant contribution of mesoderm to mature skeletal cells in long bones.

Furthermore DTR experiments are tricky, first because killing Nestin expressing cells may have also consequences in other tissue and possibly systemic effects. In addition, and this criticism applies to all of these studies, developmental biologists seem to be unaware of the “bystander effect”, well studied by gene therapists, where killing a specific cell, often causes the death of the nearest cells, thus mudding the results</italic>.</p><p>We hope that the revised images show the quality level expected by the reviewer and us. We agree that selective cell depletion experiments might have some bystander effects; for this reason we already showed in our manuscript the normal bone marrow histology and blood vessel architecture of experimental <italic>Nes-creERT2;iDTA</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1B</xref>) as a proof of the absence of noticeable bystander effects.

The experiments mainly utilize the nestin-gfp reporter mouse model in addition to other mouse models in which induced recombination mediated reporter expression defines specific neural crest derived populations. The manuscript is filled with information but it is sometimes difficult to understand how it is related to the main question. For example, it is not explained why CD31 immunostaining is performed on nestin gfp tissues; what cell types does it mark? Convention is the endothelial and hematopoietic cells express CD31, not MSC. The Discussion provides some information about levels of CD31 expression but this comes rather late in the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We are currently lacking robust and specific MSC markers for immunofluorescence. We have used CD31 marker for two reasons: 1) To mark blood vessels, since <italic>Nes-</italic>GFP+ cells are closely associated with them. 2) To distinguish the small fraction of perinatal bone marrow <italic>Nes-</italic>GFP+ CD31+ cells from the majority of <italic>Nes-</italic>GFP+ CD31- cells, which contain the population of interest in our study.

No definition is provided</italic>.</p><p>The RCE acronym stands for <italic><underline>R</underline>osa26 <underline>C</underline>AG <underline>E</underline>GFP</italic>, an <italic>EGFP</italic> reporter allele which is expressed upon <italic>Cre</italic>-mediated recombination from the hybrid CAG promoter in the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus (Sousa et al. Characterization of Nkx6-2-Derived Neocortical Interneuron Lineages. Cerebral Cortex (2009) vol. 19 (Supplement 1) pp. i1-i10).

It would be helpful to reorganize and perhaps move some information from the main text to the Discussion or leave it out if it is not directly related to the question.

We have rewritten the manuscript to better explain the rationale of each single experiment and have made an effort to better link contiguous sections.</p><p><italic>Altogether, the authors have done a large amount of work to show that there are different component populations of mesenchymal cells that contribute to the development of the long bones, bone marrow and the supportive hematopoietic microenvironment. This is an important set of results that supports a new conceptual model for the development of the hematopoietic supportive microenvironment</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for considering that our results importantly support a new conceptual model for the establishment of stem cell niches.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>This manuscript identifies the ontological source of an important bone marrow (BM) niche cells previously identified by the senior author. These cells are the Nestin-GFP+ (Nes-GFP+) cells in the adult BM that are a source of MSC and niche support. The Mendez-Ferrer group has extended this work to the developing fetal and early postnatal bone and observed exciting and enlightening results. They demonstrate that trunk neural crest cells are the developmental source for Nes-GFP+ MSC in the BM, in addition to their known contributions to peripheral sympathetic neurons and Schwann cells. Interestingly, all three of these cells types are important BM niche components. As such they share an ontological relationship that could theoretically extend to other niche components elsewhere in the body. Nes-GFP+ cells were characterized in the developing bone (E17.5), at P0 and at P7 with a variety of lineage tracing and Cre deletion transgenics in addition to cell surface IHC and flow cytometry. From a wide array of models they show</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) Nes-GFP+ cells do not exhibit osteochondral progenitor activity. Nes-GFP- cells that derive from lateral plate mesoderm possess this activity in fetal bone</italic>.</p><p><italic>2) Neural crest contribution to postnatal BM-MSCs was definitively demonstrated by genetic fate mapping with Wnt1-Cre2 and Sox10-CreERT2</italic>.</p><p><italic>3) Cell surface and mRNA-seq studies of PDGFRa+/- and Nes-GFP+/- cells revealed that there are two Nes-GFP+ neural crest derived cells in postnatal BM. Schwann cell precursors are in the PDGFRa- fraction while PDGFRa+ cells contain the MSCs</italic>.</p><p><italic>4) Neural crest cells migrate along developing nerves to the fetal bone before commitment to the Schwann cell lineage and give rise to niche forming MSCs</italic>.</p><p><italic>5) Cxcl12 expression was shown to be 80 and 20-fold higher in Nes-GFP+ cells compared to Nes-GFP- and endothelial cells respectively</italic>.</p><p><italic>6) Conditional deletion of Cxcl12 in Nes-GFP+ cells led to a significant 30% reduction in CFU and a non-significant decrease in repopulating HSC</italic>.</p><p><italic>The experiments are well performed and described. With minor exceptions the figures are clear and well presented. I have only minor suggestions and comments about the paper. The reviewer appreciates the very thoughtful and extensive discussion that attempts to resolve some apparent controversies in the field. I believe the manuscript is a significant contribution the HSC niche field. So many different transgenic strains of mice, here at least 12 gets confusing with all the acronyms and the lack of good explanations, here a table would have helped</italic>.</p><p>We thank very much the reviewer for appreciating the relevance of our study and for the very positive criticism. We have included a table containing a detailed summary of all the mouse strains used in supplementary procedures (Supplementary file 3).</p></body></sub-article></article>
