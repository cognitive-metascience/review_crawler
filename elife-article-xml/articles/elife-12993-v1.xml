However, the mechanisms mediating their emergence and subsequent refinement remain poorly understood in general. Here, we demonstrate that correlated neural activity allows for the emergence of an invariant representation of natural communication stimuli that is further refined across successive stages of processing in the weakly electric fish <italic>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</italic>. Importantly, different patterns of input resulting from the same natural communication stimulus occurring in different contexts all gave rise to similar behavioral responses. Our results thus reveal how a generic neural circuit performs an elegant computation that mediates the emergence and refinement of an invariant neural representation of natural stimuli that most likely constitutes a neural correlate of perception.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12993.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12993.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12993.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>We can effortlessly recognize an object – a car, for example – in many different contexts such as when seen from behind, under different lighting levels or even from different viewpoints. This phenomenon is known as perceptual invariance: objects are correctly recognized, despite variations in exactly what is seen (or otherwise sensed). However, it is still not clear how the brain processes perceptual information to recognize the same object under a wide variety of contexts.</p><p>Some fish, such as the brown ghost knifefish, produce a weak electric signal that they can alter to communicate with other members of their species. A communication call may be produced in a variety of contexts that alter which aspects of the signal nearby fish detect. Despite this, fish tend to respond to a given communication call in the same way regardless of its context; this suggests that these fish also have perceptual invariance.</p><p>The communication calls of weakly electric fish can be easily mimicked in a laboratory and produce reliable behavioral responses, which makes these fish a good model for understanding how perceptual invariance might be coded in the brain. Therefore, Metzen et al. recorded the activity of the receptor neurons that first respond to communication calls in weakly electric fish. The results revealed that a given communication signal made the firing patterns of all receptor neurons in the fish’s brain more similar to each other, regardless of the signal’s context. This occurs despite the changes in context causing single receptor neurons to respond in different ways. At each stage of the process by which information is transmitted from the receptor neurons to neurons deeper in the brain, the similarity in the neurons’ firing patterns is refined, thereby giving rise to perceptual invariance.</p><p>While perceptual invariance to a given object in different contexts is desirable, it is also important to be able to distinguish between different objects. This implies that neurons should respond similarly to stimuli associated with the same object and differently to stimuli associated with different objects. Further studies are now needed to confirm whether this is the case.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12993.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12993.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>weakly electric fish</kwd><kwd>electrosensory</kwd><kwd><italic>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chacron</surname><given-names>Maurice J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chacron</surname><given-names>Maurice J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neural circuits in weakly electric fish perform a set of computations to allow natural communication signals to be perceived independently of their context.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding how the brain processes sensory input in order to generate behavioral responses remains a central problem in neuroscience. Several studies have shown that neurons located in more central brain areas tend to respond more selectively to stimuli than neurons located in more peripheral brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rolls and Tovee, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Perez-Orive et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Olshausen and Field, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hromadka et al., 2008</xref>). At the same time, however, neural representations in more central brain areas become more robust to the differential patterns of sensory input associated with a given stimulus (e.g. those experienced when looking at the same object under different levels of illumination). Such invariant representations are thought to mediate context-independent object recognition and have been observed across sensory modalities (auditory: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bendor and Wang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbour, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bizley and Cohen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rabinowitz et al., 2013</xref>]; visual: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Quiroga et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zoccolan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rust and Dicarlo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">DiCarlo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sharpee et al., 2013</xref>]; somatosensory: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">DiCarlo and Johnson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pei et al., 2010</xref>]; olfactory: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stopfer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cleland et al., 2007</xref>]). Modeling studies have proposed that such representations are built and refined in a feedforward manner across successive brain areas by using OR-like operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hubel and Wiesel, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kouh and Poggio, 2008</xref>). Indeed, these studies suggest that combining neural activities that are locally invariant to complementary subsets of stimulus waveforms associated with a given object should then give rise to a more globally invariant representation. However, the actual computations used by the brain that give rise to invariant neural representations remain poorly understood to this day.</p><p>Wave-type gymnotiform weakly electric fish offer an attractive model system for studying the emergence and refinement of feature invariant neural representations because of well-characterized anatomy and relatively simple natural sensory stimuli that can easily be mimicked in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chacron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marsat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marquez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stamper et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krahe and Maler, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clarke et al., 2015b</xref>). These fish generate a quasi-sinusoidal electric organ discharge (EOD) at a typical individual frequency, resulting in an electric field that surrounds the body. EOD perturbations are sensed by an array of electroreceptors that synapse onto pyramidal neurons within the hindbrain electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) that in turn synapse onto neurons within the midbrain Torus semicircularis (TS). When two conspecifics come into contact (&lt;1 m), each fish experiences a sinusoidal amplitude modulation (i.e. beat) with a frequency that is equal to the difference between the two EOD frequencies. Natural communication signals or chirps consist of transient increases in EOD frequency and always occur simultaneously with the beat under natural conditions. Stimulus waveforms associated with chirps can be uniquely characterized by the increase in EOD frequency, duration, and the beat phase at onset. It has long been recognized that chirp stimulus waveforms are highly heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zupanc and Maler, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hupé and lewis., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study has shown that, while duration and frequency increase of chirps were both narrowly distributed, the beat phase at chirp onset was instead uniformly distributed over the entire beat cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aumentado-Armstrong et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that the observed heterogeneities in stimulus waveforms are, at least in part, caused by the fact that a chirp with given frequency increase and duration can occur with equal probability at any phase of the beat cycle.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that weakly electric fish perceive chirps as evidenced from behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hupé and Lewis, 2008</xref>). Electrophysiological studies have also characterized how chirps are encoded across successive stages of processing and notably, both afferents and ELL pyramidal neurons tend to respond differentially to different chirp stimulus waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marsat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marsat and Maler, 2010</xref>). TS neurons display large heterogeneities in their responses: while some respond in a manner that is similar to that of ELL neurons, others instead respond selectively to chirps through reliable and precisely timed action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vonderschen and Chacron, 2011</xref>). A recent study has, furthermore, shown that some TS neurons can respond similarly to different chirp stimulus waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aumentado-Armstrong et al., 2015</xref>). However, the critical questions of whether weakly electric fish can perceive that different waveforms might constitute signatures of the same chirp stimulus and, if so, the computations leading to the emergence and refinement of an invariant neural representation have not been investigated to date.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We studied the neural encoding and perception of natural communication signals by using a systems level approach in which we recorded from peripheral receptor afferents, ELL pyramidal neurons, TS neurons, and ultimately behavioral responses at the organismal level. In the absence of communication signals (i.e. when both EOD frequencies are constant), interference between the emitter and receiver fish’s EODs gives rise to a sinusoidal amplitude modulation as mentioned above (i.e. the beat) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Natural communication stimuli (i.e. chirps) occur during social interactions in which the emitter fish sends the signal to the receiver fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The chirp consists of one fish increasing its EOD frequency for a short duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top red/green trace), which, when considering the resulting stimulus sensed by the receiver fish, consists of a transient perturbation of the underlying beat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, black bottom trace). Because a chirp with a given EOD frequency timecourse (i.e. 'identity') can occur with uniform probability at all phases of the beat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aumentado-Armstrong et al., 2015</xref>), the resulting stimulus waveforms display significant heterogeneities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, gray bands, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore investigated whether and, if so, how neural responses across successive stages of processing to a chirp with given identity were similar irrespective of its occurrence within the beat cycle and, importantly, whether these constitute a neural correlate of behavior. We will henceforth refer to this concept as 'phase invariance'.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12993.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The same chirp stimulus gives rise to heterogeneous waveforms depending on time of occurrence within the beat cycle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two weakly electric fish with their electric organ discharges (EODs) in red and blue.

Single afferent responses consisted of patterns of excitation and inhibition that strongly depended on the stimulus waveform that was presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, blue curves). Indeed, population-averaged responses strongly varied depending on where the chirp occurred within the beat cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Afferents were excited when the chirp occurred at beat phases lower than 180° and inhibited when it occurred at beat phases greater or equal to 180° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, blue curve). We shall henceforth refer to the stimulus waveforms that gave rise to excitation and inhibition as '+ chirps' and '- chirps', respectively. The similarity between single afferent firing rate responses to different waveforms during a 30 ms time window commensurate with chirp duration was then compared to that obtained between the stimulus waveforms during the same time window in order to measure phase invariance (see Methods). An invariance score near zero indicates that the response waveforms display heterogeneities that are similar to those displayed by the stimulus waveforms while a value near one implies that the response waveforms are all the same. We found that the invariance score for single afferents was near zero (mean: 0.11 ± 0.01; max: 0.15; min: 0.07; population: 0.08) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, inset): this is because the distance between responses was always more or less equal to the distance between the corresponding stimulus waveforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We note that this low value was not due to variability in the response of single afferents, as the population responses obtained by linearly summating the individual neural responses also displayed invariance scores near zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, inset). We further note that computing invariance scores using only responses to subsets of chirps (i.e. those computed using only same type '++/- -' or opposite type '+-' chirp combinations) resulted in low values as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, blue). Thus, we conclude that single peripheral afferent responses were minimally phase invariant as these neurons faithfully encoded the different patterns of sensory input resulting from the same chirp occurring at different phases within the beat cycle.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12993.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Correlated but not single peripheral afferent activity provides a representation that is invariant to the different patterns of stimulation resulting from the same chirp occurring at different phases within the beat cycle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the different stages of processing in the electrosensory system.

We thus quantified similarity by computing a time varying correlation coefficient between spike trains at short timescales (see Methods). Our results show that correlation transiently increased following chirp onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, purple curves). Importantly, the time course of the correlation coefficient was similar for all stimulus waveforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), as quantified by a large invariance score (mean: 0.53 ± 0.02; max: 0.67; min: 0.35; population: 0.61) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, inset &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) that was not significantly different for either simultaneously recorded (0.51 ± 0.02) or recombined (0.53 ± 0.03) afferent activities (t-test, p=0.4). These high invariance scores were obtained because the distance between the time-varying correlation coefficient was always less than that between the corresponding stimulus waveforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar results were observed when systematically varying the time scale at which correlations were computed up to ∼60 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We conclude that correlated activity at short timescales in receptor afferents displays phase invariance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ON and OFF-type hindbrain ELL pyramidal neurons display higher phase invariance than receptor afferents</title><p>Information transmitted by neural activity is only useful to the organism if it is actually decoded downstream. To investigate whether the electrosensory system actually uses the fact that correlated afferent activity provides a phase invariant representation of natural communication signals, we recorded from hindbrain ELL pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These receive synaptic input from afferents and furthermore constitute the sole output neurons of the ELL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maler, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maler et al., 1981</xref>). Pyramidal neurons can be classified as either ON or OFF-type based on whether they respond to increases in stimulus amplitude through increases or decreases in firing rate, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Saunders and Bastian, 1984</xref>) (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clarke et al., 2015b</xref>] for review).

Thus, our working hypothesis is that, if single ON and OFF-type ELL pyramidal neurons actually decode increases in correlated afferent activity in response to natural communication stimuli, then they should: 1) display significantly more phase invariance than single afferents and 2) respond in a complementary fashion to different waveform subsets. Specifically, ON and OFF-type pyramidal neurons should respond more similarly with excitation and inhibition to the stimulus waveforms giving rise to synchronized excitation (i.e. '+ chirps') and inhibition (i.e. '- chirps') in afferents, respectively.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12993.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ON and OFF-type hindbrain ELL pyramidal neurons display more phase invariance by decoding correlated activity from peripheral afferents.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the different stages of processing in the electrosensory system.

We hypothesized that the increased phase invariance is primarily due to the fact that ON cells respond similarly with excitation to '+ chirps' and with inhibition to '- chirps' while OFF cells instead respond similarly with inhibition to '+ chirps' and with excitation to '- chirps'. These opposite responses to different subsets of chirp stimulus waveforms should limit phase invariance as the distances between the evoked responses will then be larger. To test this hypothesis, we computed the invariance score only for same-type chirps combinations (i.e. '++/- -') as well as for opposite-type chirps combinations (i.e. '+-'). We found that invariance scores computed for same-type chirp combinations were significantly larger than those computed for opposite-type chirp combinations for both ON (ANOVA; p&lt;0.01) and OFF-type (ANOVA; p&lt;0.018) pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Further, average invariance score values computed for opposite-type chirp combinations in ON (0.15 ± 0.02) and OFF-type (0.11 ± 0.01) ELL pyramidal cells were similar to those obtained for single afferents (0.16 ± 0.002) (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2F</xref>). These results thus confirm our hypothesis that the increased phase invariance of ELL pyramidal cells is due to the fact that they respond more similarly to '+ chirps' and '- chirps' than single afferents.

Perhaps the simplest way to increase phase invariance is to sum the activities of ON and OFF cells. These responses should then be more similar and thus increase phase invariance. To test this hypothesis, we recorded from midbrain TS neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

However, TS neurons with larger phase invariance scores (N=13) were excited by all chirp waveforms as quantified by positive responses for all chirp waveforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further, computing phase invariance scores over either same type ('++/- -') or opposite type ('+-') chirp combinations led to values that were not significantly different from one another (++/- -: 0.24 ± 0.02; +-: 0.28 ± 0.02) (ANOVA; F = 1.3, p=0.28) and that were furthermore similar to those obtained using all waveforms (0.26 ± 0.02). This confirms our hypothesis that TS neurons are, on average, more phase invariant than ELL pyramidal cells because a significant fraction (∼50%) responds with excitation to both '+ chirps' and '- chirps'. The simplest explanation for this observation is that these neurons receive excitatory input from ELL ON and OFF-type pyramidal cells.

Indeed, both the ON and OFF-type subpopulations showed the greatest degree of phase invariance to waveforms giving rise to either excitation or inhibition in afferents. Responses from both subpopulations are most likely combined in the midbrain TS, thereby giving rise to a more phase invariant representation that, at the population level, approached that seen for correlated afferent activity. Finally, we showed that weakly electric fish displayed similar behavioral responses to stimulus waveforms generated by applying an identity-preserving transformation, which strongly suggests that the globally invariant representation observed in midbrain constitutes a neural correlate of perception. Our results thus reveal generic mechanisms that mediate the emergence and refinement of a neural representation that is invariant to the different patterns of stimulation input resulting from the same chirp occurring at different phases within the beat cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Coding of natural electro-communication stimuli</title><p>Previous studies have reported that the waveforms associated with natural communication stimuli were highly heterogeneous with respect to their time course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zupanc and Maler, 1993</xref>) and that single peripheral afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benda et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2006</xref>) as well as ELL pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marsat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marsat and Maler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vonderschen and Chacron, 2011</xref>) display differential responses to these. While several studies have characterized the distributions of various natural communication stimulus attributes such as frequency increase, duration, or beat phase, for different beat frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zakon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kolodziejski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aumentado-Armstrong et al., 2015</xref>), the tuning curves of electrosensory neurons to these have not been systematically investigated to date. Our results show that the different waveforms resulting from a chirp with given frequency increase and duration occurring at different phases within the beat cycle tend to give rise to more similar neural responses centrally. These most likely constitute a neural correlate of perception. Our electrophysiological and behavioral results thus support our initial hypothesis that the identity of a given chirp is determined by frequency increase and duration but not the phase of the beat at which it occurs at.</p><p>Our results further show that TS neurons displayed significantly less phase invariance than behavioral responses, indicating that further refinement in downstream brain areas is likely necessary. Such refinement is likely to occur in the nucleus electrosensorius, a diencephalic brain structure that receives direct input from TS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carr et al., 1981</xref>), and likely involves integrating the activities of multiple TS neurons. The fact that the invariance score of the TS neuron population was on average higher than that of single neurons supports the latter statement. Importantly, we note here that the TS in weakly electric fish consists of 11 layers with roughly 50 cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carr and Maler, 1985</xref>). Previous electrophysiological studies have revealed that TS neurons are highly heterogeneous and can be roughly classified in two groups: 'dense' neurons that respond to stimuli in a manner that is strongly reminiscent of that displayed by ELL pyramidal neurons; and 'sparse' neurons that respond selectively to a given class of natural electrosensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vonderschen and Chacron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sproule et al., 2015</xref>). Within the sparse group, neurons can either respond selectively to movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chacron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vonderschen and Chacron, 2011</xref>), increases in beat amplitude (i.e. envelopes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McGillivray et al., 2012</xref>), or natural communication stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vonderschen and Chacron, 2011</xref>), indicating that parallel processing of behaviorally relevant stimulus features occurs in this area.</p><p>Interestingly, some TS neurons displayed phase invariance scores that were higher than those observed in single receptors or in ELL neurons. It is likely that these are members of the sparse group as they responded selectively to communication stimuli rather than the underlying beat. A previous study has shown that neurons with similar response profiles receive balanced excitatory input from ON and OFF-type pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aumentado-Armstrong et al., 2015</xref>) and, as such, most likely correspond to previously described 'ON-OFF' neurons that respond to both increases and decreases in the stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Partridge et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rose and Call, 1993</xref>). We, however, note that these neurons correspond to a few if not a single cell type within TS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carr et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carr and Maler, 1985</xref>), as partially reflected by the broad distribution of phase invariance scores observed in the current study in TS neurons. In fact, confirming previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vonderschen and Chacron, 2011</xref>), a significant fraction of TS neurons displayed low-phase invariance scores comparable to those seen in ELL, indicating that they responded differentially (i.e. non-invariantly) to the different waveforms resulting from a given chirp occurring at different phases within the cycle of a beat. Interestingly, it was shown recently that both dense and sparse TS neurons project to higher brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sproule et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that these actually receive parallel sources of information including those transmitted by both phase invariant and non-phase invariant TS neurons. Phase invariant TS neurons would then give information that a chirp has occurred while non-phase invariant TS neurons would instead transmit contextual information about this chirp. While our behavioral results do not demonstrate whether the animal can actually perceive information transmitted by non-phase invariant TS neurons, it is likely that this information is behaviorally relevant.</p><p>However, further studies are needed to understand how TS neurons are tuned to other attributes of natural communication stimuli (i.e. frequency increase, duration, beat phase, beat frequency). This is important, as these have all been shown to carry behaviorally relevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zakon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kolodziejski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hupé et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, we predict that the organism will perceive communication signals whose attributes other than beat phase differ. We further hypothesize that, in more central brain areas, neural representations become more selective to chirp identity while at the same time becoming more tolerant to changes in waveform resulting from a given chirp occurring at different phases during the beat cycle. Specifically, we predict that peripheral afferents will faithfully encode the different waveforms associated with changes in a given feature irrespective of behavioral relevance. However, when moving more centrally from receptors to midbrain, neural responses should become more selective when varying chirp identity. If true, it will then be very interesting to understand the mechanisms by which neurons become selective to given stimulus attributes yet tolerant to others. While a previous study has shown that some TS neurons could respond differentially to communication signals with different frequency increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vonderschen and Chacron, 2011</xref>), the tuning properties of TS neurons to the behaviorally relevant features of natural communication stimuli have not been systematically investigated to date and should be the focus of future studies.</p><p>Finally, we note that we focused on small chirps or type II communication stimuli that tend to occur on top of low frequency beats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 2001</xref>) because the associated waveforms displayed the largest heterogeneities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aumentado-Armstrong et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies have shown that type II communication stimuli can also occur on top of high frequency beats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Walz, 2013</xref>) and further studies are needed to understand whether the encoding strategies for these would differ from those described above. Also, big chirps or type I communication stimuli, as they mostly occur in high-frequency beat contexts, tend to display much less heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aumentado-Armstrong et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the encoding strategies for type I and II communication stimuli strongly differ at the level of peripheral afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benda et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2006</xref>), ELL pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marsat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marsat and Maler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vonderschen and Chacron, 2011</xref>), and it is likely that such differences are preserved in the midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vonderschen and Chacron, 2011</xref>). Further studies are needed to uncover how heterogeneities in type I communication stimuli are encoded in the electrosensory system. Also, we note that the large heterogeneities seen in stimulus waveforms associated with type II communication stimuli occurring at different beat phases might not be found in other weakly electric fish species. Indeed, the duration of type II communication stimuli in <italic>Apteronotus albifrons</italic> tend to be much larger than those of <italic>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</italic> considered in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kolodziejski et al., 2005</xref>) and, as such, might not display the large degree of heterogeneity seen here.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for other systems</title><p>We have shown that the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish actually exploits the feature invariant representation that is given by correlated neural activity through ON and OFF-type ELL pyramidal neurons.

Thus, the discovered computations for generating and refining phase invariance uncovered in the electrosensory system that involve decoding correlated activity through ON and OFF-type neurons and their subsequent combination are also likely to be applicable. This is particularly the case in the primary visual cortex. Indeed, while simple cells respond selectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Movshon, 1975</xref>), complex cells instead display responses that are invariant to the spatial phase of a drifting grating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Movshon et al., 1978</xref>). It is thought that this invariance arises, at least in part, through integration of input from multiple ON and OFF-type simple cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hubel and Wiesel, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martinez and Alonso, 2003</xref>). It is thus conceivable that correlated activity from simple cells could convey a spatial phase invariant representation that is then exploited by complex cells.</p><p>Further, correlations between the activities of neighboring neurons are observed ubiquitously in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>) and are dynamically regulated by several factors such as attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cohen and Maunsell, 2009</xref>), behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vaadia et al., 1995</xref>), and stimulus statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chacron and Bastian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Litwin-Kumar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ponce-Alvarez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simmonds and Chacron, 2015</xref>). Previous studies have found that correlated but not single neuron activity can carry information about stimulus attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">deCharms and Merzenich, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ishikane et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Metzen et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Metzen et al., 2015b</xref>). Here, we have instead shown that correlated neural activity can mediate the emergence of a neural representation of behaviorally relevant stimuli that is phase invariant. We also note that, since previous studies have shown that noise correlations were negligible in electroreceptor afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chacron et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Metzen et al., 2015b</xref>), our results focus on signal correlations that give rise to feature invariant representations of natural communication stimuli.

A small craniotomy (~5 mm<sup>2</sup>) was made above the hindbrain (for afferent and ELL pyramidal neuron recordings) or above the midbrain (for TS recordings), respectively.

To obtain the tuning curve, the responses obtained for each chirp waveform were plotted as a function of beat phase for each cell and then averaged across the respective population.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantifying neural response invariance</title><p>The phase invariance score was defined as:<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>≠</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced close="]" open="["><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mstyle></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>N<sub>chirps</sub></italic> is the number of chirp stimulus waveforms, and <italic>D(x,y)</italic> is a distance metric between x and y that was computed as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aumentado-Armstrong et al., 2015</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ4"><label>(4)</label><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msqrt><mml:mfenced close="&gt;" open="&lt;"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="&gt;" open="&lt;"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="&gt;" open="&lt;"><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mfenced></mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msqrt></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msqrt></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where &lt;…&gt; denotes an average over a time window of 30 ms after chirp onset, <italic>FR<sub>i</sub>(t)</italic> is the PSTH response of a given cell to chirp stimulus waveform <italic>S<sub>i</sub>(t)</italic>, and max(…), min(…) denote the maximum and minimum values, respectively. All responses were normalized prior to computing the distance metric. We note that, according to equation [3], the distance between responses to two different stimulus waveforms is actually normalized by the distance between the stimulus waveforms themselves. Thus, a neuron whose response faithfully encodes the detailed timecourse of the different chirp waveforms will not be considered invariant according to our definition. Invariance scores were computed for each individual cell and subsequently averaged across the respective populations. Some analyses were performed on TS neurons (N = 13) whose phase invariance score was greater than 0.25, which was chosen as the mean plus one standard deviation from our ELL data. We computed phase invariance for correlated activity as described above except that we used the timecourse of the varying correlation coefficient as an input. Alternatively, to test that the low values obtained for receptor afferents were not due to variability, we also computed phase invariance scores for these by first averaging responses across the population.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Behavior</title><p>To measure the chirp stimulus waveforms shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, fish were restrained by placing them in a 'chirp chamber' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Deemyad et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Metzen and Chacron, 2014</xref>). Chirps were elicited by sinusoidal waveforms mimicking another fish<bold>’</bold>s EOD whose frequency was set 10 Hz above the animal<bold>’</bold> s own EOD frequency. The fish<bold>’</bold>s EOD was recorded and the instantaneous EOD frequency was computed from the inverse of the timing difference between successive zero crossings. Chirps were then identified as increases in the animal<bold>’</bold>s own EOD frequency that exceeded 30 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>To measure the chirp echo response, each fish (N = 29) was restrained in a 'chirp chamber' as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Deemyad et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Metzen and Chacron, 2014</xref>). The EOD was measured between electrodes placed near the head and tail, amplified (model 1700 amplifier, A-M systems), digitized at 10 kHz sampling rate using CED 1401plus hardware and Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, E1 and E2), and stored on a computer hard disc for offline analysis. To analyze the chirp echo response, we first extracted the time varying EOD frequency of each fish tested. The fish’s EOD was recorded and the instantaneous EOD frequency was computed from the inverse of the timing difference between successive zero crossings. To measure echo responses to small chirp stimuli delivered at different beat phases, we initially habituated the animal to a 4 Hz beat stimulus lasting 60 s in order to minimize the probability of chirp responses being elicited by the beat alone: the chirp rate during a 200 ms window preceding stimulus chirp onset was null (0 ± 0 Hz). We then randomly interspersed chirp stimuli at variable intervals (15 ms ± 3 ms) and the recording was started 200 ms before chirp onset. In total, for each fish, we played 40 chirp stimuli such that each chirp phase was presented five times. Echo response chirps occurring during a 1 s window after stimulus chirp onset were identified as increases in the animal’s own EOD frequency that exceeded 30 Hz and were segregated into small (type II) and big (type I) chirps as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 2001</xref>). Based on this criterion, almost all echo response chirps were classified as type II (98.7%) while the rest were classified as type I (1.3%). All echo response chirps were included in the analysis. The time of occurrence of echo response chirps was defined as the time at which the EOD frequency excursion was maximal. The echo response chirp rate <italic>CR<sub>chirp</sub></italic> was computed as the number of echo response chirps during a time window of 1 s following the stimulus chirp onset since previous studies have shown that the majority of responses occur during this time window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zupanc et al., 2006</xref>). The echo response latency was determined as the timing of the first echo response chirp after chirp stimulus onset. Since the probability of eliciting an echo response chirp was low in general, we averaged the responses to a particular chirp phase obtained from all fish tested to build peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs). PSTHs for all single chirp phases were smoothed using a 1 s long boxcar filter. Behavioral responses were quantified as log(<italic>CR<sub>chirp</sub>/CR<sub>beat</sub></italic>), where <italic>CR<sub>beat </sub></italic>is the average echo response chirp rate during the beat between 1 and 2 s following stimulus chirp onset, where relatively fewer echo responses tend to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zupanc et al., 2006</xref>). Invariance scores for behavior were computed as described above for neural responses except that we used the behavioral PSTHs as responses. Error bars were estimated using a sequential bootstrapping method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Efron, 1979</xref>) with block size 27.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical significance was assessed through one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Bonferroni method of correcting for multiple comparisons at the p=0.05 level.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald L. Calabres as the Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Frédéric Theunissen (peer reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this report Metzen et al. show for electric fish that neural responses to a communication signal (the chirp) is invariant to the time of occurrence of this signal (phase) relative to the beat envelope produced by the baseline electric field of the two fishes communicating. The results are very convincing: while the response at the level of the afferents is sensitive to the phase, as one moves the neural processing chain responses become more and more invariant to this phase component, potentially explaining how the fish detects chirps and is able to produce the appropriate chirp echo response. It is a beautiful neuroethological study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The data are extensive and appropriately analyzed with relevant statistics. The figures are easy to assimilate and the legends clear. In general the paper is clearly written but there are several concerns about terminology. Materials and methods is extensive but there are concerns about what exactly has been done.</p><p>There are major concerns that were discussed by the reviewers and must be addressed before publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The hypothesized mechanism for how the phase invariance is achieved is not convincing. To quote one of the expert reviewers &quot;The analysis of TS responses is unclear, as are the questions asked and conclusions that follow. Methods: &quot;We limited our recordings to neurons that displayed similar responses to most chirp waveforms.&quot; This is a vague criterion for invariance that lacks quantitative rigor. More importantly, to select a subset of invariant neurons and then conclude the neurons were invariant is circular. By contrast, the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> legend states &quot;Recordings were made from TS neurons that receive balanced excitatory input from both ON and OFF-type ELL hindbrain neurons.&quot; (the first paragraph of the subsection “Midbrain TS Neurons are invariant to heterogeneous stimulus waveforms associated with the same electrosensory object” also implies this). Either select neurons based on ON/OFF convergence and then compare the invariance of TS neurons in the convergent/non-convergent groups, or select neurons based on invariance and compare the degree of ON/OFF convergence in the variant/invariant groups. If any relationship is seen, then you can conclude that ON/OFF convergence is associated with invariance. This is a fundamental conclusion (e.g.”Conclusion” section) that is not supported by the data and analyses presented. Further, unless I am missing something, this exact conclusion was already made by Aumentado-Armstrong et al. 2015.&quot; In addition, this reviewer stated in consultation &quot;I want to emphasize that it is a significant concern given that one of the major conclusions is that a combination of ON/OFF inputs is what creates the invariance in TS neurons. I do not see any data or analyses that justify this conclusion. It also seems this same conclusion was already reached in their previous publication. Thus, this major conclusion comes across as already discovered and/or an assumption.&quot;</p><p>2) To quote one of the expert reviewers &quot;[…]the manuscript suffers from over interpretation of results and most importantly does not probe selectivity of neurons to different objects. To expand on the latter point, statements of invariance to identity-preserving stimuli should be supported by measurements of neural responses to both the same and different objects. Here, the authors only study responses to one type of waveform (with different phases). What is missing is the demonstration that while responses of more central neurons exhibit more invariance across different phases for the same type of stimulus waveform they are also exhibit more selectivity to different types of waveforms.&quot;</p><p>Complementing this concern another expert reviewer wrote &quot;First, the natural variation explored here is along a single dimension, phase. Clearly natural chirps will vary in many other components (amplitude as in the distance and angle between fishes, frequency range of chirp, etc.). Although this is mentioned in the Discussion, it would be nice to get a feel for the actual &quot;natural&quot; variation of these communication signals as produced by two freely swimming and communicating fishes. Also, the correlation might actually not be very sensitive to changes in amplitude? (which would make this a stronger story). Is this something that the authors have measured? Second, I am not convinced that detection of correlated activity is a general principle of invariance in sensory systems. For example, I don't see how it would apply to scale invariance, rotation invariance in visual perception or to intensity invariance or to fundamental frequency invariance in the auditory modality. I am more convinced that the neural signals and mechanisms described here could be general principles to detect signals in noise or to separate two sensory signals (slow and fast as noted in the Discussion). In this sense, the nature of the &quot;invariance&quot; described here appears very specific to the active sense of the electric fish. I still believe that the results are interesting and that general principles of neural computation are revealed but I would be more careful in not overselling the story.&quot; This concern can be alleviated by scaling back the claims of the manuscript. In discussion between expert reviewers one wrote &quot;I would support publication if the authors were to rewrite the manuscript around the theme of phase invariance. For that specific form of invariance, perhaps one stimulus waveform is sufficient and their data are adequate. To demonstrate relevance to other sensory systems, the authors could make connection with the known properties of complex cells in the primary visual cortex (which is presently not done).&quot; This seems a useful path to follow in revision.</p><p>3) There were some less major concerns about Methods. One reviewer wrote &quot;1) I don't really understand your equation [1]. It seems highly unusual to average a cross-covariance (or correlation) over delay times. You could get values of zero for two functions that have very high coherencies. Also, it sounds like you are actually using the square root of the coherence at DC as a measure of correlation coefficient and not equation [1]. So why mention equation [1]. Please clarify and explain. 2) Doesn't the response, log(A/B) go from -inf to inf? 3) Is the sum in equation [4] over all possible pair-wise comparison? Also would it not make more sense to sum(SMr/SMs)? In this case the differences in pair-wise responses would be &quot;normalized&quot; by the difference in the corresponding stims… (if I understand correctly). Since invariance is such a critical measure for the paper, this entire section on invariance needs to be rewritten to very explicitly state what each component in the invariance metric measures and why this particular form has been chosen.</p><p>Another reviewer wrote &quot;The measurement of response was unclear (subsection “Tuning”). Averaging across time and neurons seems to obscure what is a time-varying response. Further, it is not clear why a &quot;response&quot; would be determined by comparing activity within a window to activity within a subwindow. Finally, it is not clear why population-averages were used for comparison, as opposed to pre-stimulus baseline activity. It seems more meaningful and straightforward to ask whether a given neuron increased or decreased its firing rate in response to chirps, which could be determined by comparing each neurons' firing rate during beats with/without a chirp.&quot;</p><p>There were also some less major concerns about terminology. &quot;Much of the language was unnecessarily opaque, wordy, and jargony:</p><p>A) &quot;identity preserving transformation&quot; used throughout. I do not see this as a transformation. It was simply the same stimulus (with a fixed identity not requiring &quot;preservation&quot;) being delivered at different times with respect to the beat, resulting in different patterns of sensory input.</p><p>B) What is meant by invariant vs. non-invariant, local vs. global invariance? It seems that continuous variation is being lumped into arbitrary categories. Invariance is not categorical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> makes this clear).</p><p>C) Synchrony vs. correlation. The correlated firing rates of primary afferents is frequently referred to as &quot;synchrony&quot;. I view synchrony as coincident firing, not similar changes in firing rates.</p><p>D) Discovery of a circuit. In several places, it is stated that a circuit has been revealed/discovered. This circuit was already known. What is being shown here is a particular computation that circuit performs.</p><p>E) Electrosensory &quot;objects.&quot; There is considerable debate and a lack of consensus over the use of this term. A working definition with relevant citations would help make clear what is meant by the term here.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Neural correlations enable invariant coding and perception of natural stimuli&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In the revised version &quot;Neural correlations enable invariant coding and perception of natural stimuli&quot;, the authors have addressed some of the comments from the first round and decided than other were beyond the scope of this study. The paper very clearly demonstrates that the &quot;transient&quot; response produced by communication chirp is coded at the level of the afferents with positive (an increase in rate) and negative signals (a decrease in rate) depending on the phase of the chirp relative to the amplitude beat produced by the interfering EOD of the two fishes. That afferent response is therefore phase sensitive. However, the correlated activity of the afferents shows phase invariance (as the rates decrease in synchrony or increase in synchrony). A detector of such correlated activity would be phase invariant. These computations appear to take place in the &quot;next&quot; two levels of neural processing. First at the level of the ELL, ON and OFF cells show increased invariance for all + chirps and -chirps respectively (+ and – chirps are defined according to the phase of the beat). Then at the level of TS, neurons combine information of ON and OFF cells to generate positive responses to most chirps irrespective of phase. Thus phase invariance is achieved simply by first a weighted sum of afferent responses into two groups and then a sum of these two responses. This computation appears to be similar (both in spirit and connectivity) to the &quot;hierarchical models&quot; that have been proposed for describing complex cells in V1 (see Martinez and Alonso, 2003). It may not be exactly a &quot;correlator&quot; detector or a more general neural computation for other forms of invariance but this is now appropriately discussed.</p><p>There remains a major concern that was discussed by the reviewers and must be addressed before publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. It is not clear how their model/conclusions fit with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref>. It is easy to imagine how appropriate weighting of inputs from one stage of processing could give rise to the increased invariance observed at the next stage, and this is an important finding. However, the way in which this happens does not seem as simple as the narrative presented: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31"><sup>29</sup></xref>) ELL ON-cells being invariant to +chirps but not -chirps; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66"><sup>65</sup></xref>) ELL OFF-cells being invariant to -chirps but not +chirps; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6"><sup>6</sup></xref>) TS cells integrating ON- and OFF-cell inputs to establish global chirp invariance. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref> and the accompanying descriptions in the text do not show this convincingly. The authors either need to show that the +chirp and -chirp differences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> are significant (perhaps with a 2-way ANOVA), or present their conclusions in such a way that they do not depend on their being a difference here. Similarly, they need to show that the +chirp and -chirp differences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> are not significant, or present their conclusions in such a way that they do not depend on their being no difference here.</p><p>More minor is the suggestion from the last review about showing more natural variability. This would seem to make the point on perception more relevant rather than being outside the scope of the report.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12993.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>The data are extensive and appropriately analyzed with relevant statistics.

To address them, we now compute phase invariance across all recorded TS neurons. On average, phase invariance scores were significantly larger in TS than in ELL. This was because, while some TS neurons displayed phase invariance scores comparable to those of ELL neurons, others actually displayed larger values (max ELL: 0.69, min ELL: 0.11; max TS: 0.84, min TS: 0.37). We now mention in the Discussion that a previous study (Aumentado-Armstrong et al. 2015) has shown that the later subset of neurons, (i.e. those displaying the greatest phase invariance scores), receive balanced input from ON and OFF type ELL pyramidal cells (subsection “Coding of natural electro-communication stimuli”, third paragraph).</p><p> <italic>2) To quote one of the expert reviewers &quot;…the manuscript suffers from over interpretation of results and most importantly does not probe selectivity of neurons to different objects.

We appreciate the interest in understanding how electrosensory neurons respond to other chirp attributes such as duration and frequency increase and now more clearly mention that these fall outside the scope of our paper and thus should be the focus of future studies.
