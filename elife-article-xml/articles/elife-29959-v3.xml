In birds some hair cells contain an iron-rich organelle, the cuticulosome, that has been implicated in the magnetic sense. Here, we exploit histological, transcriptomic, and tomographic methods to investigate the development of cuticulosomes, as well as the molecular and subcellular architecture of cuticulosome positive hair cells. We show that this organelle forms rapidly after hatching in a process that involves vesicle fusion and nucleation of ferritin nanoparticles. We further report that transcripts involved in endocytosis, extracellular exosomes, and metal ion binding are differentially expressed in cuticulosome positive hair cells. These data suggest that the cuticulosome and the associated molecular machinery regulate the concentration of iron within the labyrinth of the inner ear, which might indirectly tune a magnetic sensor that relies on electromagnetic induction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pigeon</kwd><kwd>hair cells</kwd><kwd>magnetoreception</kwd><kwd>cuticulosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Y726</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burkard</surname><given-names>Thomas R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>336724</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keays</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cuticulosomes are organelles found in the hair cells of birds that are composed of ferritin nanoparticles, form rapidly after hatching by the fusion of vesicular structures, and may play an indirect role in magnetic sensation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hair cells are located in defined sensory epithelia within the vertebrate inner ear, enabling the transduction of sound, motion, and gravity into neuronal impulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Torres and Giráldez, 1998</xref>). This is mediated by mechanical deflection of stereocilia, which are bristle-like projections that emerge from the apical surface of the cell. Displacement of stereocilia opens cation channels via filamentous structures called tip-links, resulting in cation influx, and subsequently neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pickles et al., 1984</xref>). Stereocilia are composed of tightly packed parallel filaments of f-actin, which taper at their base forming a rootlet that inserts into the cuticular plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pollock and McDermott, 2015</xref>). The latter is a meshwork of actin at the base of the stereocilia that has a characteristic U-shape and is believed to provide stability to the hair bundle. The kinocillium, with its distinctive core of microtubules, also inserts into the cuticular plate serving as an important guidepost for stereocilia development and orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Montcouquiol et al., 2003</xref>). These unique structures were initially identified using transmission electron microscopy, but have been further characterized using electron tomographic methods. Insight into the molecules that are required to construct them has resulted primarily from genetic and transcriptomic studies in various model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mburu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kitajiri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonellis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Following the studies of Dickman and colleagues, who reported that neurons within the vestibular nuclei of pigeons are responsive to weak magnetic stimuli, we conducted a histological analysis of the inner ear of birds employing the Prussian blue stain which labels ferric iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu and Dickman, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2012</xref>). This led to the discovery of an iron-rich organelle in the cuticular plate of avian hair cells, which was termed the ‘cuticulosome’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lauwers et al., 2013</xref>). Electron microscopy revealed that cuticulosomes are approximately 400–500 nm in diameter and 25% are encapsulated by a visible membrane. Each cuticulosome consists of tens of thousands of ferritin-like granules, which have a distinct paracrystalline organization in some but not all cases. Cuticulosomes can be found in all sensory epithelia of the inner ear, however, they are most prevalent in the avian equivalent of the organ of Corti. In this structure, known as the basilar papilla, approximately 30% of hair cells are cuticulosome positive. A phylogenic analysis of adult birds revealed that cuticulosomes are an evolutionary conserved feature in a broad range of avian species (e.g. zebra finches, ducks, chickens and ostriches) but are absent in mice, humans and fish. The function of this curious organelle is currently unknown. While it may play a role in the magnetic sense of aves or in the stabilization of stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu and Dickman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jandacka et al., 2015</xref>), its presence might simply reflect the late onset accumulation of iron which has been described in some neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xie et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Accordingly, we set out to investigate the developmental maturation of cuticulosomes in pigeons, as well as the molecular and subcellular architecture of cuticulosome positive hair cells. Exploiting electron microscopy and histological analysis we show that cuticulosomes develop rapidly after hatching, in a process that involves vesicle fusion and nucleation of ferritin nanoparticles within the cuticular plate. Coupled with a comparative transcriptomic analysis of hair cells with and without cuticulosomes our results emphasize the importance of vesicular function in the formation and maintenance of this iron-rich structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cuticulosomes form rapidly after birds hatch</title><p>To investigate when cuticulosomes are formed during development, we employed the chemical stain Prussian blue (PB) which stains ferric iron (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) bright blue in color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>). Coronal sections of the basilar papilla and the lagenar macula from pigeons of different ages (1 day, 8 days, 16 days, 30 days and 1 year) were stained and quantitated using light-microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In 1 day old birds only a small percentage of hair cells in the basilar papilla were cuticulosome positive (2.46 ± 0.95%, n = 4 birds), whereas they were plentiful at 8 days (23.66 ± 3.03%, n = 3 birds), 16 days (31.19 ± 2.86%, n = 6 birds), 30 days (36.9 ± 3.56%, n = 5 birds), and 1 year of age (24.92 ± 6.74%, n = 3 birds) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

Strikingly, almost all cuticulosomes were located opposite the stereocillia. We measured the length of the cell along its apical surface and recorded the position of the cuticulosome along that vector. This revealed that the position of the cuticulosome gradually changes with time, from a lateral localization, close to the border of the cell in 1 day old birds, to a more medial localization closer to the stereocilia, in 1 year old birds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). We then examined the depth of the cuticulosome within the cell, by analysing coronal sections of the basilar papilla. The height of the cell was measured from its apical to basal end (excluding the hair cell bundle), and the position of the cuticulosome was plotted. We observed that in 1 day old birds the cuticulosome is closest to the apical cell surface, and that it gradually adopts a deeper position within the cuticular plate over the course of a year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Taken together these data show that cuticulosomes form rapidly after hatching, that they are not the product of late-onset iron accumulation and that their localization within the cuticular plate changes from a lateral-apical to a medio-basal position as they mature.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The subcellular architecture of cuticulosomes during development</title><p>To gain insight into the subcellular architecture of cuticulosomes during development, we employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on basilar papillae isolated from pigeons aged 1 day, 8 days, 16 days, 30 days and 1 year. At 1 day of age we observed that 100% of organelles were in the process of formation (n = 3 birds, n = 4 cuticulosomes), which gradually decreased to 34.6% at 8 days (n = 3 birds, n = 26 cuticulosomes), 22.2% at 16 days (n = 3 birds, n = 45 cuticulosomes) and 17.6% at 30 days (n = 3 birds, n = 17 cuticulosomes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). In contrast, only 7% of organelles in 1 year old pigeon hair cells appeared to be incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lauwers et al., 2013</xref>). During this maturation the ferritin-like granules that make up the structure were initial diffuse, but became more dense and structured. In 1 day old birds (n = 3 birds, n = 4 cuticulosomes), we did not observe any evidence of paracrystalline ordering in contrast to 16 day old birds (n = 3 birds, n = 26 cuticulosomes) where ordering of granules was observed in 17.8% of cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). This maturation coincided with an increase in cuticulosome size from 296.4 nm ± 69.2 nm in 1 day old birds (n = 3 birds, n = 4 cuticulosomes), to 387.9 ± 29 nm in 8 day old birds (n = 3 birds, n = 26 cuticulosomes), 580.7 nm ± 21.7 nm in 16 days old birds (n = 3 birds, n = 45 cuticulosomes), and 514.3 ± 38 nm in 30 day old birds (n = 3 birds, n = 17 cuticulosomes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k</xref>).

Segmentation of the ferritin-like nanoparticles, vesicular structures, and the cell membrane allowed the generation of 3D tomographic models of the developing cuticulosome (n = 4 cuticulosomes, n = 3 birds) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video4">4</xref>).

To ascertain whether this is the case we undertook fluorescent histological staining with sera that target the heavy chain of ferritin, coupled with transmitted light microscopy that enables visualization of the cuticulosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–i</xref>). This experiment revealed the presence of heavy chain ferritin throughout the cytoplasm of hair cells, with a notable punctate structure that coincided with the location of the cuticulosome in pigeons aged 1 day (n = 3 birds), 8 day (n = 2 birds) and 1 year (n = 3 birds) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d–i</xref>). We confirmed this result by undertaking double staining of basilar papillae whole mounts with sera that bind to either actin or ferritin heavy chain (n = 3 birds per timepoint). When visualized from a superior perspective we again observed a punctate ferritin positive structure in the cuticular plate of hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j–l</xref>). To assess the expression levels of ferritin heavy chain during development, we microdissected the distal region of the basilar papillar, extracted mRNA, generated cDNA and performed qPCR. This experiment revealed that the expression of heavy chain ferritin peaks at 16 days of age, but is consistently high at all developmental time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is well established that the dominant iron species in ferritin is the iron-oxide ferrihydrite, but it has also been reported to contain phases of magnetite (Fe<sup>2+</sup>Fe<sup>3+</sup><sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and maghemite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cowley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Quintana et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gossuin et al., 2005</xref>).

As the staining was very light, indicative of low levels of Fe<sup>2+</sup>, we post stained sections with the chromogen 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) which is known to amplify the Turnbull Blue reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2002</xref>).

We performed a gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the 387 genes upregulated in cuticulosome positive cells, as the analysis of the significant hits alone did not identify any categories with enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mi et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). When analysing the cellular components enriched in cuticulosome positive cells we identified nine categories including: organelle (GO:0043226); membrane-bounded organelle (GO:0043227); and extracellular exosome (GO:0070062). A GO analysis of molecular function identified eight categories including: binding (GO:0005488); catalytic activity (GO:0003824) and metal ion binding (GO:0046872) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">Figure 5—source datas 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata4">4</xref>). Next we performed a manual annotation of all genes significantly up and down regulated in cuticulosome positive cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). Interestingly, those genes significantly upregulated in cuticulosome positive cells included: RAB5B (which is involved in mediating early steps of endocytosis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilson and Wilson, 1992</xref>); STXBP5L (a homologue of STXBP5 which regulates syntaxin mediated membrane fusion); and HEBP2 (which is a heme binding protein). Notably, RNF128 (a E3 ubiquitin ligase known to be involved in the trafficking of endosomes) and OSBPL2 (which belongs to a family of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate binding proteins that have been implicated in endosomal-endoplasmic reticulum tethering) were significantly down regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamazaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dong et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>).

Attempts to amplify transcripts expressed at low levels by qPCR (FPKM &lt; 5), such as STXBP5L and CLIV_009848, were not successful. Taken together these data reveal that genes associated with vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, the formation of membrane bound organelles, and metal binding are differentially expressed in cuticulosome positive hair cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we investigated the developmental, subcellular, and molecular architecture of cuticulosome positive hair cells. We report that when pigeons hatch only a few cuticulosomes are present, followed by a striking increase in their prevalence at 8 and 16 days of age, with the highest number observable at 30 days. Our electron microscopy studies have further demonstrated that the cuticulosome is formed within the cuticular plate itself. The development of the cuticular plate, which is closely associated with the formation of stereocilia, begins at embryonic day 8 in chickens. At this time it is primarily occupied by vesicles, mitochondria, and lysosomes, before growing basally until embryonic day 14 when it resembles that present in the adult cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tilney and DeRosier, 1986</xref>). Post hatching the cuticular plate, with its web of actin filaments, is considered to be so dense that it excludes all organelles, even ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Corwin and Warchol, 1991</xref>). To enable the passage of vesicles to and from the apical membrane hair cells have a specialized zone close to the cell border that serves as a highway for subcellular structures that support membrane recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kachar et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Our data indicate that the formation of the cuticulosome is initiated at the apical cellular border opposite the kinocilium. It appears that the cuticulosome is formed by the fusion of vesicles, some containing ferritin, that result in an organelle that increases in size and density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It appears that these vesicles are transported into the cuticular plate from the lateral boundary. As the density of the organelle increases, so does the likelihood that it develops a paracrystalline organization which results in alignment of the ferritin nanoparticles. The alignment of ferritin nanoparticles is uniform in some instances, but more often there are multiple domains within a cuticulosome that orient in different directions. Whether this organisation is facilitated by an active process, or is simply a consequence of an increase in density, is unclear. It should be noted, however, that iron-rich siderosomes that are associated with the formation of magnetite in chitons, rarely exhibit paracrystalline packing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shaw et al., 2009</xref>). Intriguingly, our results also show that the position of the cuticulosome changes from an apical location at the edge of the cuticular plate to a medial, deeper position as it matures. This may reflect: (1) a post hatching expansion of the cuticular plate driven by actin polymerization along the apical periphery, resulting in a more centrally localized cuticulosome; or (2) a gradual remodeling of the cuticular plate, whereby the actin-rich meshwork is depolymerized by molecules such as cofilin. Mechanical forces generated by auditory stimuli, or motor proteins such as myosin, might then be responsible for the repositioning of the cuticulosome. This relocation does not appear to rely on microtubule dependent mechanisms, as we have not observed any evidence that the striated organelle associates with this organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vranceanu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29959.027</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of cuticulosome development.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cuticulosomes start to form shortly after hatching at the lateral apical edge of the cuticular plate, opposite the kinocilium. They initially resemble electron dense accumulations of amorphous shape with a diameter of approximately 300 nm. (<bold>b</bold>) Eight days after hatching the percentage of cuticulosome containing hair cells in the basilar papilla has increased 8-fold (20%) in comparison to 1 day old pigeons (2.5%). The size of the cuticulosome has increased to approximately 400 nm in diameter, with a notable increase in density. This increase in density is correlated with the development of paracrystalline arrays which result in the alignment of the ferritin nanoparticles. (<bold>c</bold>) Sixteen days after hatching cuticulosomes have reached their mature size (~580 nm), and their position within the cuticular plate has become more medial and basal. Distinct trails of vesicles from the lateral boundary of the cuticular plate are evident in some instances. (<bold>d</bold>) At one year of age cuticulosomes are mature. Approximately one quarter are still associated with vesicular structures and some exhibit complete paracrystalline organisation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29959-fig6-v3"/></fig><p>Our results have also yielded insight into the molecular architecture of cuticulosome positive hair cells. Employing immunohistochemical methods we have shown that the cuticulosome contains the ferritin heavy chain protein. Moreover, given our RNA sequencing results, which have revealed that the ferritin light chain is expressed at very low levels, we would expect that the cuticulosome is dominated by the heavy chain isoform. Our transcriptomic studies have further implicated molecules associated with vesicular trafficking, endosomal sorting, extracellular exosomes and metal binding with cuticulosome maintenance. Of particular interest are RAB5B and RNF128. RNF128, which was significantly downregulated in cuticulosome containing hair cells, is a Ring finger E3 ubiquitin ligase. Drosophila and human family members of this protein class have been associated with the formation of enlarged Rab5 positive endosomes both in knockdown and overexpression studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamazaki et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, cell lines that overexpress either wildtype Rab5 or a constitutiveIy active form (rab5:Q79L) develop enlarged early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roberts et al., 1999</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that the reduced expression levels of RNF128 and increased expression of RAB5B we observe in cuticulosome positive cells, licenses the formation of such a large membrane bound organelle within the cell.</p><p>The critical question that remains is: What is the function of the cuticulosome? And might it be associated with the magnetic sense? This is a tempting proposition given that pigeons begin to fly at approximately one month of age, a time when the cuticulosome is on the cusp of maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hazard, 1922</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nam and Lee, 2006</xref>). However, this correlation should be viewed cautiously as there is conflicting behavioural data supporting the presence of a magnetic sense in young birds. Wiltschko and colleagues have reported that chickens aged 10 days can be conditioned to a magnetic anomaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Denzau et al., 2011</xref>) and juvenile European Robins are known to possess a magnetic sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Muheim et al., 2002</xref>), whereas pigeons aged 12 weeks are disorientated if they are transported in the dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wiltschko and Wiltschko, 1981</xref>). An experiment that assessed whether magnetic stimuli result in c-fos associated neuronal activation in pigeons of different ages would be valuable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu and Dickman, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The data presented in this manuscript strongly suggest that the formation of the cuticulosome is not the product of late-onset iron accumulation, and is more likely the result of a genetically encoded developmental or homeostatic program. Could the cuticulosome therefore serve as a torque based magnetoreceptor that would exert a direct force on a mechanosensitive channel located on the apical membrane? This would seem unlikely. Firstly, based on our current understanding of the magnetic properties of ferritin, the cuticulosome lacks sufficient magnetic susceptibility in an Earth strength magnetic field to open a mechanosensitive channel, and, secondly, there seems to be no direct physical connection with the apical membrane that would mediate the transfer of a force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jandacka et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed the cuticulosome appears to move deeper into the cuticular plate away from the apical membrane as it matures. An alternative mechanism proposed by Jandacka and colleagues is that the cuticulosome could act as an intracellular magnetic oscillator, that would induce an electrical potential across the cell membrane by auditory induced vibration of the basilar membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jandacka et al., 2015</xref>). This hypothesis is problematic, however, as it requires the presence of an amplification mechanism to generate a voltage that exceeds thermal background. A third possibility is that the cuticulosome plays an indirect role in the magnetic sense by influencing the ionic concentration of the endolymph. A number of investigators have proposed that the detection of magnetic fields may rely on electromagnetic induction within the semicircular canals - the endolymph serving as a conductor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Viguier, 1882</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jungerman and Rosenblum, 1980</xref>). The cuticulosome, coupled with the vesicular machinery associated with it, might represent a means of regulating the conductivity of the endolymph by adjusting the concentration of cations, thereby tuning a magnetic sensor reliant on electromagnetic induction. Alternatively, the cuticulosome may serve as a precursor for a magnetite-based magnetoreceptor located elsewhere in the inner ear. Whether or not this proves to be the case, based on its striking subcellular localisation, elemental composition, and stereotypical early development, it seems unlikely that the presence of the cuticulosome is a mere co-incidence.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Birds were maintained on a 12:12 light-dark cycle at 25°C in a custom built aviary.

Three experts reviewed your manuscript, and their assessments, together with my own (Jeremy Nathans, Reviewing Editor), form the basis of this letter. The handling Senior Editor was Andrew King. As you will see, all of the reviewers were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work.</p><p>I am including the three reviews at the end of this letter, as there are a variety of specific and useful suggestions in them. We appreciate that the reviewers' comments cover a broad range of suggestions for improving the manuscript. Given these disparate concerns, we feel it would be best for you to evaluate the suggestions and write back to us with a prioritized list of experiments that could be completed in a reasonable period of time. We will share your plans with the reviewers and then respond with advice on how best to proceed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The cuticulosome is a newly discovered, orphan organelle in search of a function and a developmental understanding. In this manuscript, Nimpf et al. describe the distribution and formation of ferritin-containing cuticulosomes in hair cells from the basilar papilla of pigeons with high-resolution transmission electron micrographs taken at different developmental stages and observe that the cuticulosomes are surrounded by multiple vesicles with or without ferritin. In addition, single cell transcriptome analysis conducted in this manuscript reveals the potential importance of vesicle fusion in formation of cuticulosomes. And it also provides a rich resource in the form of a gene-candidate list that could now be used to understand the formation or the function of cuticulosomes in the future. This is a well-written and interesting manuscript, which could be improved with the below suggestions, for suitability in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Major concerns</p><p>1) The models put forth of cuticulosome development are interesting. I feel that to make the study more complete the author should also explore the cuticular plate actin structure immediately around the cuticulosome. How is the actin altered by the vesicles? Are there actin-free tunnels (or pockets) in which these vesicles may travel (or reside)? The answers to these questions should be addressed with tomography and added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. This would help answer the developmental question they are addressing. This should not be too difficult since they likely have the data but would need to rework it. In addition, did the authors observe any structural differences in the cuticular plates in hair cells with and without the cuticulosome?</p><p>2) Can the authors localize RAB5B to the cuticulosome or any proteins from their list (preferred) that are differentially expressed? If not, can the authors perform in situ hybridization to show differential expression. The data needs validation. As a last resort, can they do single cell RT-PCR?</p><p>3) Why is there a very wide range of sizes of cuticulosomes in one-year-old pigeons? Since birds can regenerate hair cells, could this be that some of the cuticulosomes measured are in newly born hair cells? Or is there a big variation of cuticulosomes' sizes in a one-year-old pigeon. If so, can the authors further explain the criteria of selecting a single dissociated hair cell?</p><p>4) If, as the authors proposed, vesicles surrounding the developing cuticulosome help the cuticulosome to grow in size, is fusion between the vesicle and the cuticulosome ever observed by electron microscopy?</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> is missing.</p><p>6) When is the onset of hearing and flying ability in pigeons? Additional information on the stages of hair cell and ear development represented by the different ages chosen for analysis would be helpful in interpreting the results. Could the organized ferritin particle be used as a marker for maturation of the cuticulosome?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript is a developmental and transcriptomic characterization of the pigeon hair cells that contain cuticulosomes, an organelle that was originally described by the Keays Lab. The current manuscript suggests that this organelle is tightly regulated and therefore must have an important function. However, what that function might be is very speculative.</p><p>The authors have performed a morphological analysis of this organelle using Prussian blue (PB) staining across post hatching developmental stages. Their novel finding in this section is that cuticulosomes form rapidly, increase in number through development and their localization changes from a lateral-apical to a medio-basal position as they mature. The characterization of hair cells using TEM reveals that hair cells from recently hatched animals contain cuticulosomes that are &quot;diffuse&quot; and around 16 days after hatching they become larger and paracrystalline in structure.</p><p>Q1) Is it possible that the observed change in size and structure is due to the TEM sample preparation and for some reason younger hair cell cuticulosomes are more susceptible to degradation?</p><p>Next, the authors demonstrate that the cuticulosomes are composed of nanoparticles of ferritin by performing ferritin heavy chain IHC.</p><p>Q2) Although the ferritin heavy chain-rich puncta resemble the cuticulosomes there is no quantification to demonstrate that these structures develop similar to PB-positive cuticulosomes and hence they are likely the same organelle.</p><p>The transcriptomic analysis of hair cells with and without cuticulosomes is done with 1-year-old animals. One of the most highly expressed transcripts is the ferritin heavy chain in cuticulosome positive and negative hair cells.</p><p>Q3) The ferritin IHC data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> seem to indicate that there is diffuse heavy chain expression in all cells in 1-year-old animals. However, this background staining is missing in newly hatched birds. Since this is a developmental study that impinges on the presence of ferritin nanoparticles in cuticulosomes, it is critical to know the profile of the transcriptomic information from newly hatched birds, as well. At the very least, expression of ferritin heavy chain transcript across developmental stages should be confirmed by either in situ hybridization or single cell quantitative RT-PCR.</p><p>Differential expression analysis of the transcriptomic data reveals that &quot;genes associated with vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, the formation of membrane bound organelles, and metal binding are differentially expressed in cuticulosome positive hair cells.&quot;</p><p>Q4) It is necessary to confirm at least some of these gene expression profiles with in situ hybridization.</p><p>Q5) In their abstract the authors state that &quot;These data suggest that the cuticulosome and the associated molecular machinery regulate the concentration of Fe3+ within the labyrinth of the inner ear, which might indirectly tune a magnetic sensor that relies on electromagnetic induction.&quot; However, in their previous paper they have stated that &quot;There is no evidence that sensory neurons play a role in iron homeostasis, and it is not clear why a role in iron storage would necessitate the conspicuous positioning of a single organelle in the cuticular plate.&quot; In addition, it is not clear why these structures would need to be composed of ferritin particles that are arranged in a paracrystalline array, heavily regulated developmentally in size/position and appear only in a percent of cells to perform the proposed homeostatic function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Keays and colleagues is the first study that investigates the formation and trafficking of cuticulosomes in pigeon hair cells during early development after hatching. The data revealed in this detailed manuscript are important for understanding the development of magnetoreception in young pigeons. However, a few questions should be addressed before the manuscript is suitable for publication:</p><p>1) One of the main concerns is the low-number animal cohorts (3-6) and few (e.g. 3) repetitions of each experiment. Was the power analysis ever performed, or what was the rationale for cohort size selection? (There's only one RNASeq experiment for which authors discuss their sample size selection.)</p><p>2) Subection “Cuticulosomes form rapidly after birds hatch”, percent averages of cuticulosome positive cells are provided with no standard deviation/error. Given the small cohort sizes it would be valuable to see the deviations.</p><p>3) As authors indicate that the ferritin clusters cuticulosomes may be contributing to magnetoreception, it would be interesting to identify what is the iron content of these structures – that is spacing between individual iron atoms.</p><p>4) Following up on the previous point, the magnetic properties of the cuticulosome are of great interest. Have the authors performed vibrating sample or SQUID magnetometry on these structures? Before magnetoreception can be discussed, the structures need to be proven magnetic or conductive (if the inductive mechanism is considered).</p><p>5) The authors suggest that the cuticulosome and the associated molecular machinery regulate the concentration of Fe3+ within the labyrinth of the inner ear. However, whether the concentration of Fe3+ changes during development is still unknown. The correlation between Fe3+ concentration in the labyrinth and the expression of cuticulosomes is also not clear. The authors need to provide stronger evidence or supporting references to show the relation between Fe3+ concentration in the labyrinth and the number of cuticulosomes in hair cells.</p><p>6) It is surprising that the number of cuticulosomes is the highest in 30-day old pigeons. The authors, however, do not show the localization or the size distribution of cuticulosomes in 30-day old pigeons as compared to 1-year old pigeons. The authors should demonstrate whether the cuticulosomes are fully developed in 30-day old pigeons.</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panels J–L would be better used by showing the immunostaining for Ferritin/Actin at 1 day, 8 days and 1 year for consistency with panels A–I. Showing 3 separate stains at 1 year is redundant (obviously multiple staining experiments must be performed for quantification of expression).</p><p>8) According to the results presented in this manuscript, cuticulosomes develop within a few days after hatching, and the number of cuticulosomes in the basilar papilla peaks in 30-day old pigeons. This is at odds with prior work that demonstrated that young pigeons (&lt;12 weeks old) are incapable of perceiving magnetic field in the dark (Wiltschko and Wiltschko, 1981). The authors should discuss this in their manuscript.</p><p>References: Wiltschko, W. and Wiltschko, R., (1981) Disorientation of inexperienced young pigeons after transportation in total darkness.

Specifically, the reviewer has asked whether there are any actin-free tunnels or pockets. To investigate this we have examined high-resolution electron micrographs of developing cuticulosomes (8 days post hatching). This has not revealed any obvious tunnels (or pockets) in which vesicles travel. To display this data quantitatively we measured the intensity of osmium staining along 200nm lines that extend radially from the edge of cuticulosomes (n= 8 lines per cuticulosome, n=8 cuticulosomes, n=3 birds). This result suggests that there are no &quot;vesicle highways&quot;, but rather vesicles squeeze through the actin meshwork which presumably involves some remodeling of the structure. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and the text has been updated accordingly (subsection “The subcellular architecture of cuticulosomes during development”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Can the authors localize RAB5B to the cuticulosome or any proteins from their list (preferred) that are differentially expressed?

We have likewise had limited success employing <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization on the pigeon adult inner ear. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that validation of our transcriptomic data is important. We have therefore undertaken qPCR analysis of our best candidates RAB5B and RNF128 on cuticulosome positive and negative cells (n=8 birds). These data which are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, confirm that RAB5B is enriched in cuticulosome positive cells and RNF128 is enriched in cuticulosome negative cells. Our attempts to validate additional candidates (such as STXBP5L and CLIV_009848) were unsuccessful as they are expressed at low levels (FPKM&lt;5) and we were not able to amplify them by qPCR (in either cuticulosome positive or negative cells).

It does seem that the variation in cuticulosome size is particularly pronounced at 1 year of age. However, as the reviewer suggests the smaller cuticulosomes at this time could reflect hair cell regeneration which is known to occur in Avian species. Those hair cells with smaller cuticulosomes may represent newly born hair cells. Indeed, this could account for the 7% of cuticulosomes that we observe at 1 year of age that appear to be in the process of formation (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If so, can the authors further explain the criteria of selecting a single dissociated hair cell?</p></disp-quote><p>When selecting single hair cells for the transcriptomic analysis, a visual inspection of individual hair cells was made by moving through the focal plane in the Z-direction.

And might it be associated with the magnetic sense? This is a tempting proposition given that pigeons begin to fly at approximately one month of age, a time when the cuticulosome is on the cusp of maturation (Hazard, 1922, Nam and Lee, 2006). However, this correlation should be viewed cautiously as there is conflicting behavioural data supporting the presence of a magnetic sense in young birds. Wiltschko and colleagues have reported that chickens aged 10 days can be conditioned to a magnetic anomaly (Denzau, Kuriakose et al., 2011) and juvenile European Robins are known to possess a magnetic sense (Muheim, Backman et al., 2002), whereas pigeons aged 12 weeks are disorientated if they are transported in the dark (Wiltschko, 1981). An experiment that assessed whether magnetic stimuli results in c-fos associated neuronal activation in pigeons of different ages would be valuable (Wu and Dickman, 2011).&quot;</p><p>We are not aware of any specific study in pigeons that have assessed their hearing at different ages, however, for chickens it is known that the tonotopic map of the cochlear develops during embryogenesis, and at 21 days of age the auditory system is mature structurally and functionally (Jones and Jones, 1995).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the organized ferritin particle be used as a marker for maturation of the cuticulosome?</p></disp-quote><p>As only 16% of cuticulosomes are ordered in a paracrystalline array in the adult (and this ordering is often partial), we do not think this particular attribute is best for defining whether or not a cuticulosome is mature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript is a developmental and transcriptomic characterization of the pigeon hair cells that contain cuticulosomes, an organelle that was originally described by the Keays Lab.

We are, however, very confident that the ferritin positive structures we report in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are actually cuticulosomes. We are able to see cuticulosomes with transmitted light in 10μm thick sections that have been fluorescently stained, particularly in adults where the cuticulosomes are larger. In all cases where we observed punctate ferritin positive structures in the cuticular plate they overlapped with cuticulosomes identified by transmitted light.

This has yielded diffraction patterns indicative of ferrihydrite ((Fe<sup>3+</sup>)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>•0.5H<sub>2</sub>O) (Lauwers, Pichler et al., 2013). Consistent with this finding our Prussian Blue staining has revealed the presence of Fe<sup>3+.</sup> However, it has been reported that ferritin also contains magnetite (Cowley, Janney et al., 2000, Quintana, Cowley et al., 2004, Gossuin, Hautot et al., 2005). While a specific stain for magnetite (Fe<sup>2+</sup>Fe<sup>3+</sup><sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) is not available, Ferric iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) (which is a component of magnetite) can be stained with the Turnbull Blue method (Wang, Ong et al. 2002). We have now performed this experiment on our birds at hatching, 8 days, 16 day, 30 days and 1 year. As the staining was very light, indicative of low levels of Fe<sup>2+</sup>, we post stained sections with the chromogen 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) which is known to amplify the Turnbull Blue reaction (Wang, Ong et al. 2002). We observed a sharp increase in Turnbull blue staining in the basilar papilla and lagena from hatching to one month of age, mirroring the results of our Prussian Blue staining.</p><p>We report that in:</p><p>· 1-day-old birds 2.27% of hair cells are TB positive (n=3 birds, n=841 cells) in the basilar papilla and 0.4% of hair cells are TB positive (n=3 birds, n=962 cells) in the lagena macula.</p><p>· 8-day-old birds 17.5% of hair cells are TB positive (n=3 birds, n=536 cells) in the basilar papilla and 1.3% of hair cells are TB positive (n=3 birds, n=2007 cells) in the lagena macula.</p><p>· 16-day-old birds 29.12% of hair cells are TB positive (n=3 birds, n=796 cells) in the basilar papilla and 1.64% of hair cells are TB positive (n=3 birds, n=2935 cells) in the lagena macula.</p><p>· 30-day-old birds are 23.9% of hair cells are TB positive (n=3 birds, n=881 cells) in the basilar papilla and 1.12% of hair cells are TB positive (n=3 birds, n=2978 cells) in the lagena macula.</p><p>· 1-year-old birds 19.2%, of hair cells are TB positive (n=3 birds, n=905 cells) in the basilar papilla and 1.16% of hair cells are TB positive (n=3 birds, n=3104 cells) in the lagena macula.</p><p>This experiment reveals that the cuticulosome contains Fe<sup>2+</sup> at all developmental stages, which is consistent with presence of low levels of magnetite. These data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, and the text has been modified accordingly (subsection “The cuticulosome contains ferritin”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Following up on the previous point, the magnetic properties of the cuticulosome are of great interest. Have the authors performed vibrating sample or SQUID magnetometry on these structures? Before magnetoreception can be discussed, the structures need to be proven magnetic or conductive (if the inductive mechanism is considered).</p></disp-quote><p>We have made a number of attempts to purify cuticulosomes (to enable SQUID analysis), as well as undertaking SQUID analysis on the basilar papilla itself. Despite the pooling of large numbers of samples we have not been able to detect any magnetic signature above background for these experiments – indicating that SQUID lacks the sensitivity we require. As a consequence we are currently in the process of undertaking nanoscale magnetic imaging employing nitrogen valence centers. This method relies on the exchange of magnetisation between nitrogen valence centers on a diamond slide and the magnetic domains of the cuticulosome (Degen, 2008). We have recently encountered some technical issues regarding the preparation of the diamonds. We are therefore not in a position to make any conclusions regarding the magnetic properties of the cuticulosome at this stage. We will aim to publish these findings at a later time.</p><p>We wish to emphasize, however, that the inductive mechanism that we propose in the discussion is not dependent on the magnetic properties of the cuticulosome. It is rather dependent on the conductive properties of the endolymph and the presence of a highly sensitive electroreceptor in a population of sensory cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors suggest that the cuticulosome and the associated molecular machinery regulate the concentration of Fe3+ within the labyrinth of the inner ear. However, whether the concentration of Fe3+ changes during development is still unknown. The correlation between Fe3+ concentration in the labyrinth and the expression of cuticulosomes is also not clear. The authors need to provide stronger evidence or supporting references to show the relation between Fe3+ concentration in the labyrinth and the number of cuticulosomes in hair cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has suggested an experiment that we are currently attempting to undertake. We wish to sample the endolymph at various developmental stages, followed by analysis of its ionic composition. As far as we are aware this experiment has not previously been performed – it is technically very very challenging. It requires that we pierce the bony labyrinth of the inner ear with a glass pipette or needle, sample microliters of the endolymph (while avoiding contamination from the perilymph), followed by analysis by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. We hope that we will be able to master this protocol, in birds of various ages, in the next 12-24 months.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is surprising that the number of cuticulosomes is the highest in 30-day old pigeons. The authors, however, do not show the localization or the size distribution of cuticulosomes in 30-day old pigeons as compared to 1-year old pigeons. The authors should demonstrate whether the cuticulosomes are fully developed in 30-day old pigeons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have undertaken a subcellular analysis of cuticulosomes at 30 days of age, quantitating their size, association with vesicles, presence of membranes and paracrystalline organisation (n=3 birds, n=17 cuticulosomes). These data are now shown in an updated version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>. It shows that the cuticulosomes at 30 days seem to be on the cusp of maturation. They are of similar size to one-year-old birds (514.3 ± 31 nm at 30days vs 545 ± 31nm in adults), have a similar degree of paracrystalline organisation (17% at 30 days v 16% in adults), but a higher percentage are incomplete (17% at 30 days v 7% in adults).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panels J–L would be better used by showing the immunostaining for Ferritin/Actin at 1 day, 8 days and 1 year for consistency with panels A–I. Showing 3 separate stains at 1 year is redundant (obviously multiple staining experiments must be performed for quantification of expression).</p></disp-quote><p>We have rectified this as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) According to the results presented in this manuscript, cuticulosomes develop within a few days after hatching, and the number of cuticulosomes in the basilar papilla peaks in 30-day old pigeons. This is at odds with prior work that demonstrated that young pigeons (&lt;12 weeks old) are incapable of perceiving magnetic field in the dark (Wiltschko and Wiltschko, 1981). The authors should discuss this in their manuscript.</p><p>References: Wiltschko, W. and Wiltschko, R., (1981) Disorientation of inexperienced young pigeons after transportation in total darkness. Nature 291: 433 – 434.</p></disp-quote><p>We think it is best to exercise caution when assessing behavioural studies in light of the timeline of cuticulosome formation. It should also be noted that Wiltschko and Wiltschko, 1981 did not directly assess the magnetic sense in 12-week-old pigeons, but rather the orientation of outward homing when pigeons were transported in darkness. They note in this manuscript that &quot;we do not know the exact cause of the disorientated behavior of our experimental birds […] as homing experiments with birds is a highly complex behaviour&quot;. Nonetheless, we think the reviewer has raised an interesting point and have therefore modified the Discussion as follows:</p><p>&quot;The critical question that remains is: What is the function of the cuticulosome? And might it be associated with the magnetic sense? This is a tempting proposition given that pigeons begin to fly at approximately one month of age, a time when the cuticulosome is on the cusp of maturation (Hazard, 1922, Nam and Lee, 2006). However, this correlation should be viewed cautiously as there is conflicting behavioural data supporting the presence of a magnetic sense in young birds. Wiltschko and colleagues have reported that chickens aged 10 days can be conditioned to a magnetic anomaly (Denzau, Kuriakose et al., 2011) and juvenile European Robins are known to possess a magnetic sense (Muheim, Backman et al., 2002), whereas pigeons aged 12 weeks are disorientated if they are transported in the dark (Wiltschko, 1981). An experiment that assessed whether magnetic stimuli results in c-fos associated neuronal activation in pigeons of different ages would be valuable (Wu and Dickman, 2011).&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
