Dysfunctional lysosomes give rise to lysosomal storage disorders as well as common neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we use a DNA-based, fluorescent chloride reporter to measure lysosomal chloride in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> as well as murine and human cell culture models of lysosomal diseases. We find that the lysosome is highly enriched in chloride, and that chloride reduction correlates directly with a loss in the degradative function of the lysosome. In nematodes and mammalian cell culture models of diverse lysosomal disorders, where previously only lysosomal pH dysregulation has been described, massive reduction of lumenal chloride is observed that is ~10<sup>3</sup> fold greater than the accompanying pH change. Reducing chloride within the lysosome impacts Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the lysosome and impedes the activity of specific lysosomal enzymes indicating a broader role for chloride in lysosomal function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28862.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28862.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28862.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In cells, worn out proteins and other unnecessary materials are sent to small compartments called lysosomes to be broken down and recycled. Lysosomes contain many different proteins including some that break down waste material into recyclable fragments and others that transport the fragments out of the lysosome. If any of these proteins do not work, waste products build up and cause disease. There are around 70 such lysosomal storage diseases, each arising from a different lysosomal protein not working correctly.</p><p>A recently developed “nanodevice” called <italic>Clensor</italic> can measure the levels of chloride ions inside cells. <italic>Clensor</italic> is constructed from DNA, and its fluorescence changes when it detects chloride ions. Although chloride ions have many biological roles, chloride ion levels had not been measured inside a living organism. Now, Chakraborty et al. – including some of the researchers who developed Clensor – have used this nanodevice to examine chloride ion levels in the lysosomes of the roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. This revealed that the lysosomes contain high levels of chloride ions. Furthermore, reducing the amount of chloride in the lysosomes made them worse at breaking down waste.</p><p>Do lysosomes affected by lysosome storage diseases also contain low levels of chloride ions? To find out, Chakraborty et al. used <italic>Clensor</italic> to study <italic>C. elegans</italic> worms and mouse and human cells whose lysosomes accumulate waste products. In all these cases, the levels of chloride in the diseased lysosomes were much lower than normal. This had a number of effects on how the lysosomes worked, such as reducing the activity of key lysosomal proteins.</p><p>Chakraborty et al. also found that <italic>Clensor</italic> can be used to distinguish between different lysosomal storage diseases. This means that in the future, <italic>Clensor</italic> (or similar methods that directly measure chloride ion levels in lysosomes) may be useful not just for research purposes. They may also be valuable for diagnosing lysosomal storage diseases early in infancy that, if left undiagnosed, are fatal.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28862.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28862.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>chloride biology</kwd><kwd>lysosomal storage disorders</kwd><kwd>DNA nanotechnology</kwd><kwd>live imaging</kwd><kwd>cell culture</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000882</institution-id><institution>Brain Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BRF SIA-2016-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krishnan</surname><given-names>Yamuna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1 TR000430</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krishnan</surname><given-names>Yamuna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lysosomes are highly enriched in chloride, which is essential for their degradative function.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chloride is the most abundant, soluble anion in the body. Cytosolic chloride can be as low as ~45 mM, while extracellular chloride is ~110 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Treharne et al., 2006</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sonawane et al., 2002</xref>). Chloride concentration values thus span a wide range and yet, in each compartment, it is quite tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sonawane and Verkman, 2003</xref>). For example, in early endosomes it is ~40 mM, late endosomes it is ~70 mM and lysosomes it is ~108 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hara-Chikuma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sonawane et al., 2002</xref>). Chloride levels are stringently regulated by chloride channels such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), the CLC family of channels or calcium activated chloride channels, and their dysregulation is directly linked to several diseases including cystic fibrosis, myotonia, epilepsy, hyperekplexia or deafness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Planells-Cases and Jentsch, 2009</xref>). Chloride is largely considered to function as a counter ion only to balance changes in cation fluxes related to signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scott and Gruenberg, 2011</xref>). In one form, this balancing function serves to reset the membrane potential of depolarized neurons through the operation of plasma membrane resident chloride channels/exchangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen, 2005</xref>). In another form, it serves to continuously facilitate organelle acidification, through the operation of intracellular chloride channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stauber and Jentsch, 2013</xref>). Despite its importance in cell function, intracellular chloride has never been visualized or quantitated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>DNA nanotechnology has offered creative, functional imaging solutions to quantitate second messengers as well as image organelles in real time in living cells and in genetic model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chakraborty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krishnan and Bathe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Surana et al., 2015</xref>). Here, using a previously developed, pH-independent, DNA-based fluorescent chloride reporter called <italic>Clensor</italic>, we have made the first measure of chloride in a live multicellular organism, creating <italic>in vivo</italic> chloride maps of lysosomes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Our investigations reveal that lysosomal chloride levels <italic>in vivo</italic> are even higher than extracellular chloride levels. Others and we have shown that lysosomes have the highest lumenal acidity and the highest lumenal chloride , among all endocytic organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weinert et al., 2010</xref>). Although lumenal acidity has been shown to be critical to the degradative function of the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Appelqvist et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eskelinen et al., 2003</xref>), the necessity for such high lysosomal chloride is unknown. In fact, in many lysosomal storage disorders, lumenal hypoacidification compromises the degradative function of the lysosome leading to the toxic build-up of cellular cargo targeted to the lysosome for removal, resulting in lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guha et al., 2014</xref>). Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a diverse collection of ~70 different rare, genetic diseases that arise due to dysfunctional lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Samie and Xu, 2014</xref>). Dysfunction in turn arises from mutations that compromise protein transport into the lysosome, the function of lysosomal enzymes, or lysosomal membrane integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Futerman and van Meer, 2004</xref>). Importantly, for a sub-set of lysosomal disorders like osteopetrosis or neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL), lysosomal hypoacidification is not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kasper et al., 2005</xref>). Both these conditions result from a loss of function of the lysosomal H<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> exchange transporter CLC-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kasper et al., 2005</xref>). In both mice and flies, lysosomal pH is normal, yet both mice and flies were badly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poët et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weinert et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The lysosome performs multiple functions due to its highly fusogenic nature. It fuses with the plasma membrane to bring about plasma membrane repair as well as lysosomal exocytosis, it fuses with the autophagosome to bring about autophagy, it is involved in nutrient sensing and it fuses with endocytic cargo to bring about cargo degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Appelqvist et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xu and Ren, 2015</xref>). To understand which, if any, of these functions is affected by chloride dysregulation, we chose to study genes related to osteopetrosis in the versatile genetic model organism <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. By leveraging the DNA scaffold of <italic>Clensor</italic> as a natural substrate along with its ability to quantitate chloride, we could simultaneously probe the degradative capacity of the lysosome <italic>in vivo</italic> and then in cultured mammalian cells. Our findings reveal that depleting lysosomal chloride showed a direct correlation with loss of the degradative function of the lysosome. We found that lowering lysosomal chloride also reduced the level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from the lysosome. We also observed that reduction of lysosomal chloride inhibited the activity of specific lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsin C and arylsulfatase B. The role of chloride in defective lysosomal degradation has been hypothesized in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stauber and Jentsch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wartosch and Stauber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wartosch et al., 2009</xref>), and our studies provide the first mechanistic proof of a broader role for chloride in lysosome function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reporter design and uptake pathway in coelomocytes of <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>In this study we use two DNA nanodevices, called the I-switch and <italic>Clensor</italic>, to fluorescently quantitate pH and chloride respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Modi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saha et al., 2015</xref>). The I-switch is composed of two DNA oligonucleotides. One of these can form an i-motif, which is an unusual DNA structure formed by protonated cytosines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gehring et al., 1993</xref>). In the I-switch, intrastrand i-motif formation is used to bring about a pH-dependent conformational change, that leverages fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to create a ratiometric fluorescent pH reporter. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>)</p><p>The DNA-based chloride sensor, <italic>Clensor,</italic> is composed of three modules: a sensing module, a normalizing module and a targeting module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prakash et al., 2016</xref>). The sensing module is a 12 base long peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligomer conjugated to a fluorescent, chloride-sensitive molecule 10,10′-Bis[3-carboxypropyl]−9,9′-biacridinium dinitrate (BAC), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sonawane et al., 2002</xref>). The normalizing module is a 38 nt DNA sequence bearing an Alexa 647 fluorophore that is insensitive to Clˉ. The targeting module is a 26 nt double stranded DNA domain that targets it to the lysosome via the endolysosomal pathway by engaging the scavenger receptor or ALBR pathway. In physiological environments, BAC specifically undergoes collisional quenching by Clˉ, thus lowering its fluorescence intensity (G) linearly with increasing Clˉ concentrations. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of Alexa 647 (R) remains constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). This results in R/G ratios of <italic>Clensor</italic> emission intensities varying linearly with [Clˉ] over the entire physiological regime of [Clˉ]. Since the response of <italic>Clensor</italic> is insensitive to pH changes, it enables the quantitation of lumenal chloride in organelles of living cells regardless of their lumenal pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saha et al., 2015</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28862.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Clensor</italic> recapitulates its chloride sensing characteristics <italic>in vivo</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the ratiometric, fluorescent chloride (Clˉ) reporter <italic>Clensor</italic>.

We re-created two widely used murine and human cell culture models of Gaucher’s disease by inhibiting β-glucosidase with its well-known inhibitor conduritol β epoxide (CBE) in murine and human macrophages namely, J774A.1 and THP-1 cells respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hein et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schueler et al., 2004</xref>). We also recreated common mammalian cell culture models of Niemann-Pick A/B disease by inhibiting acid sphinogomyelinase (SMPD1) in J774A.1 and THP-1 cells with a widely used inhibitor amitriptyline hydrochloride (AH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones et al., 2008</xref>).

In Gaucher’s cell culture models, murine and human cells showed a substantial decrease in lysosomal chloride to ~101 mM and ~92 mM respectively. This is a drop of 15–25 mM (13‒21% change) chloride, as compared to a drop of ~10 µM in lysosomal proton concentrations. In Niemann-Pick A/B cell culture models, murine and human macrophages showed an even more dramatic decrease in lysosomal chloride to ~77 mM and ~86 mM respectively. This is also a substantial decrease of 30–40 mM (25‒34% change) chloride, as compared to a drop of ~9 µM in lysosomal proton concentrations. On average in these four cell culture models, we find that the magnitude of chloride concentration decrease is at least 3 orders of magnitude greater than proton decrease, indicating that lysosome dysfunction is easily and sensitively reflected in its lumenal chloride concentrations. A Niemann Pick C cell culture model using the inhibitor U18666A recapitulated our findings in nematode models, where only lysosomal pH, but not Cl<sup>-</sup>, was altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>High chloride regulates lysosome function in multiple ways</title><p>The ClC family protein CLC-7 is expressed mainly in the late endosomes and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Graves et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jentsch, 2007</xref>).

The principal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel responsible for lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is Mucolipin TRP channel 1 (TRPML1). We therefore sought to estimate lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> by measuring Ca<sup>2+</sup> that is released from the lysosome using two different triggers under conditions of normal and reduced lysosomal Cl<sup>-</sup>. Glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (GPN) is a substrate for Cathepsin C, which when added to cells, gets cleaved in the lysosome to release naphthylamine that is known to compromise the integrity of the lysosomal membrane, leading to a leakage of ions such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jadot et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>). This has been used to induce lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.</p><p>The cytosol of J774A.1 cells are labeled with ~3 µM Fura2-AM to ratiometrically image cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation upon its release, if at all, from the lysosome. After addition of 400 µM GPN, cells were continuously imaged ratiometrically over 15–20 mins. Shortly after GPN addition, a burst of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was observed in the cytosol, corresponding to released lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). When the same procedure was performed on cells that had been incubated with 50 µM NPPB that reduces lysosomal Cl-, the amount of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> released was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b–d</xref>) We then performed a second, more targeted way to release lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytosol, by using 20 µM ML-SA1 which specifically binds to and opens the TRPML1 channel on lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shen et al., 2012</xref>). We found that when lysosomal Cl<sup>-</sup> was reduced with NPPB, lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release into the cytosol was near negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c–d)</xref>. Taken together this indicates that high lysosomal Cl<sup>-</sup> is necessary for effective lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, possibly by affect lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation.</p><p>We next investigated whether reducing lysosomal chloride directly impacted the activity of any lysosomal enzymes. <italic>In vitro</italic> enzymology of Cathepsin C, a lysosome-resident serine protease has revealed that increasing Cl<sup>-</sup> increased its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cigic and Pain, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McDonald et al., 1966</xref>).

We therefore used GPN cleavage to probe Cathepsin C activity in the lysosome upon reducing Cl<sup>-</sup> with NPPB. GPN cleavage by Cathepsin C releases naphthylamine which compromises lysosomal membrane integrity leading to proton leakage from the lysosome into the cytosol. This hypoacidifies the lysosomes resulting in reduced LysoTracker labeling as the labeling efficiency of the latter is directly proportional to compartment acidity.</p><p>Lysosomes are pre-labeled with TMR-Dextran, and LysoTracker intensities are normalized to the fluorescence intensity of TMR-Dextran, given as G/R. Hypoacidifying lysosomes by addition of 1 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl indeed reduced LysoTracker labeling, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e–f</xref>). A similar effect was also obtained upon GPN addition. The presence or absence of NPPB showed no change in LysoTracker labeling in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e–f)</xref>, indicating that NPPB by itself caused no alteration in lysosomal pH. However, when GPN was added to NPPB treated cells LysoTracker staining was remarkably well preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and f</xref>) indicating preservation of lysosomal membrane integrity because GPN was no longer effectively cleaved by Cathepsin C when lysosomal Cl<sup>-</sup> was reduced. Unlike other cathepsins, Cathepsin C does not undergo autoactivation but requires processing by Cathepsin L and Cathepsin S to convert it into active Cathepsin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dahl et al., 2001</xref>). We measured the activity of the upstream cathepsins such as Cathepsin L using fluorogenic substrates in the presence and absence of NPPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We observed no effect of chloride levels on Cathepsin L activity. This indicates that low Cathepsin C activity is not due to decreased amounts of mature Cathepsin C in the lysosome, but rather, reduced activity of mature Cathepsin C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Based on reports suggesting that arylsulfatase B activity was also affected by low chloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wojczyk, 1986</xref>), we similarly investigated a fluorogenic substrate for arylsulfatase and found that NPPB treatment impeded arylsulfatase cleavage in the lysosome. Taken together, these results suggest that high lysosomal chloride is integral to the activity of key lysosomal enzymes and that reducing lysosomal chloride affects their function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The lysosome is the most acidic organelle within the cell. This likely confers on it a unique ionic microenvironment, reinforced by its high lumenal chloride, that is critical to its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xu and Ren, 2015</xref>). Using a DNA-based, fluorescent reporter called <italic>Clensor</italic> we have been able to create quantitative, spatial maps of chloride <italic>in vivo</italic> and measured lysosomal chloride. We show that, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, lysosomes are highly enriched in chloride and that when lysosomal chloride is depleted, the degradative function of the lysosome is compromised. Intrigued by this finding, we explored the converse: whether lysosomes that had lost their degradative function – as seen in lysosomal storage disorders - showed lower lumenal chloride concentrations. In a host of <italic>C. elegans</italic> models for various lysosomal storage disorders, we found that this was indeed the case. In fact, the magnitude of change in chloride concentrations far outstrips the change in proton concentrations by at least three orders of magnitude.</p><p>To see whether chloride dysregulation correlated with lysosome dysfunction more broadly, we studied murine and human cell culture models of Gaucher’s disease, Niemann-Pick A/B disease and Niemann Pick C. We found that in mammalian cells too, lysosomes are particularly rich in chloride, surpassing even extracellular chloride levels. Importantly, chloride values in all the mammalian cell culture models revealed magnitudes of chloride dysregulation that were similar to that observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Our findings suggest more widespread and as yet unknown roles for the single most abundant, soluble physiological anion in regulating lysosome function. Decrease in lysosomal chloride impedes the release of calcium from the lysosome implicating an interplay between these two ions in the lysosome. It is also possible that chloride accumulation could facilitate lysosomal calcium enrichment through the coupled action of multiple ion channels. The ability to quantitate lysosomal chloride enables investigations into the broader mechanistic roles of chloride ions in regulating multiple functions performed by the lysosome. As such, given that chloride dysregulation shows a much higher dynamic range than hypoacidification, quantitative chloride imaging can provide a much more sensitive measure of lysosome dysfunction in model organisms as well as in cultured cells derived from blood samples that can be used in disease diagnoses and screening applications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>All fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides were HPLC-purified and obtained from IBA-GmBh (Germany) and IDT (Coralville, IA, USA).

For a given experiment, mean [Clˉ] of an organelle population was determined by converting the mean R/G value of the distribution to [Clˉ] values according to the intracellular calibration profile. Data was presented as mean of this mean [Clˉ] value ± standard error of the mean. Data for chloride clamping experiments was analyzed similarly.</p><p>Colocalization of GFP and Alexa 647 was determined by counting the numbers of Alexa 647 positive puncta that colocalize with GFP and representing it as a Pearson's correlation coefficient.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Lysosomal labelling in coelomocytes</title><p>Temporal mapping of I-switch and <italic>Clensor</italic> was done in 10 worms of <italic>pwIs50 [lmp-1::GFP + Cb-unc-119(+)]</italic> as previously described by our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Surana et al., 2011</xref>).

For Cathepsin C enzyme activity; we used Gly-Phe β-naphthylamide as a substrate. Lysosomes of J774A.1 cells were pre-labeled with TMR-dextran (0.5 mg/mL; G) for 1 hr and chased in complete medium for 16 hr at 37°C. The cells were then labeled with 50 nM LysoTracker in complete medium for 30 mins at 37°C. 50 μM NPPB or 200 μM GPN were then added to the cells and incubated for 30 mins at 37°C. The cells then washed and imaged in HBSS buffer containing either NPPB or GPN. The whole cell intensity ratio (G/R) was plotted to quantify the level of LysoTracker labelling of the endosomes. For Cathepsin L and Aryl Sulfatase enzyme activity Magic Red Cathepsin L assay kit (Immunochemistry Technologies) and Lysosomal sulfatase assay kit (Marker Gene) were used. The experiment was performed using the manufacture’s protocol. Briefly, cells were incubated with 1X Magic Red Cathepsin L assay probe or 200 μM Lysosomal sulfatase assay probe for 4 hr in complete medium. The cells were then labelled with 10 μM Hoechst stain for 10 mins at 37°C after which the cells were washed and imaged. For low chloride containing dishes; cells were preincubated with 50 μM NPPB before the addition of the enzyme probes. The ratio of enzyme substrate whole cell intensity to that of DAPI was used to quantify enzyme activity.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Professors John Kuriyan, Susan Cotman, Drs A H Rahmathullah and D McEwan for critical comments and valuable suggestions.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;High lumenal chloride in the lysosome is critical for lysosome function&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Suzanne R Pfeffer (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Haoxing Xu (Reviewer #2) and Carsten Schultz (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that this manuscript will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. As you will see in the following comments, the reviewers noted a number of strengths in the use of your novel chloride sensor. However, they felt that additional work would be required to bring the work to the level of significance and novelty expected for presentation in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Quoting a review from Jentsch (2013), exact measurements of lysosomal [Cl−] have not been reported due to the lack of suitable Cl− sensors for the high [Cl−] at low pH. However, from measurements with cells treated with low Cl− and from model calculations, lysosomal [Cl−]lumen is greater than 80 mM. 2010 data strongly point to a crucial role of Cl− transport in organellar physiology that &quot;goes beyond merely providing the electrical shunt for proton pumping by the V-ATPase.&quot; Despite maintaining lysosomal conductance and normal lysosomal pH, Clcn7unc/unc mice showed lysosomal storage disease like mice lacking ClC-7. Although various proteins are known to be regulated by Cl−, the mechanism by which (mainly luminal) Cl− affects membrane traffic and organellar function has remained elusive; the 2010 analysis of Clcn5unc and Clcn7unc mice has suggested that luminal anion concentration is important all along the endosomal-lysosomal pathway.</p><p>Here, the authors use a novel, DNA based chloride sensor to try more accurately to determine lysosomal chloride levels. Like the previous work from the Jentsch lab, the findings using <italic>C. elegans</italic> lysosomes indicate a high level of lysosomal chloride. Chloride ion levels are decreased under conditions of lysosomal dysregulation due to mutations in genes that lead to lysosomal storage disorders. Not clear are the mechanisms underlying these observations.</p><p>Recently, the lysosome has been shown to represent a significant calcium store, and in worms, CUP-5 is the MCOLN-1 homolog that is important for lysosomal calcium levels and functions. If chloride is not the counterion for protons, it may be important for calcium homeostasis. Given that it is not clear how chloride influences lysosome function in disease states or in normal cells, it would be very important for these authors to clarify the connection between chloride accumulation defects and calcium uptake and regulation. Without this, the findings seem somewhat anecdotal, despite highlighting the recently uncovered importance of chloride ions in lysosome function. No doubt this is an interesting area for further investigation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Cl<sup>-</sup> transport across endosomal and lysosomal membranes are known to be crucial for lysosomal acidification and physiology, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, largely due to the lack of the methods that can be used to reliably monitor luminal Cl<sup>-</sup> levels in live cells. The authors previously reported the development of a DNA-based fluorescent reporter (i.e., <italic>Clensor</italic>) for Cl<sup>-</sup>. Compared with protein-based ion-sensing probes, a major advantage for DNA-based probes is their relative insensitivity to pH, which is low in the endosomes and lysosomes. Building on this exciting development in the field, the authors now report the use of <italic>Clensor</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammalian phagocytes, providing evidence that a decrease in lysosomal [Cl<sup>-</sup>] is likely to be a primary pathogenic factor in a number of lysosome storage diseases (LSDs). Overall, the cell biology and imaging experiments in the study were carefully designed, and the results were mostly clean and convincing, and carefully interpreted. Both the use of <italic>Clensor</italic> and the major conclusions of the paper are of substantial interests to researchers working on lysosome biology, anion channels and transporters, membrane transport, organellar channels and transporters, and LSDs. The manuscript can be improved if following points are taken into consideration.</p><p>1) Cl<sup>-</sup> channels are known to exhibit poor anion selectivity. What is the anion selectivity for <italic>Clensor</italic>? When lysosomal [Cl<sup>-</sup>] is reduced in some LSD cells, assuming that lysosome lumen is still electroneutral and iso-osmotic, what are substituted anions? Phosphate is probably an obvious candidate. Therefore, it would be helpful if the authors can show the effects of NO3(-) and PO4(3-) in <italic>Clensor in vitro</italic>.</p><p>2) Lysosomal delivery of <italic>Clensor</italic> might be slowed down in LSD cells, compared with wild-type (WT) cells. Could trafficking defects contribute to the observed reduction in lysosomal [Cl<sup>-</sup>]? Given the 40 mM difference in late endosomal vs. lysosomal [Cl<sup>-</sup>], it is plausible that a block in endosome maturation might affect the [Cl<sup>-</sup>] measurement. I would assume that the calibration curves and maximal signals are identical for WT and LSD cells. Is that the case?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The work of Krishnan and co-workers describes the use of previously published fluorescent sensors for measuring lysosomal pH and Cl levels. Elegantly, the work was performed in circulating nematode macrophages as well as cultured mammalian cells. This is a very exciting application and the authors observe that a lack of chloride levels correlates with a loss of degrading capacity of the lysosome. The authors follow the hypothesis that the drop-in chloride content is responsible for driving lysosomal function. They tested model conditions for lysosomal storage diseases in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and found indeed reduced chloride levels under such conditions. However, this is not a prove that the chloride ion levels are instrumental. The question remains if chloride levels are the key component in lysosomal dysfunction or a by-stander effect.</p><p>The authors argue that CF patients show lysosomal distress symptoms at the molecular level (changes in enzyme activities) similar to Niemann-Pick patients. What the authors do not consider in their argumentation is that CF patients share very little of the NPC phenotype. There is no early neurodegeneration in CF nor a liver accumulation of lipids such as cholesterol or sphingosine. As a result, the conclusions driven by the present study do not hold. Down to the bare bones, the study reveals very interesting data regarding the chloride ion levels in lysosomes but lacks any mechanistic insight. Unfortunately, there is no consideration (or even mentioning) of the calcium levels in the lysosome that have received quite some attention in the regulation of lysosomal function and signaling lately (for instance, see Medina et al. Nature Cell Biology 17, 288-299 (2015)). Chloride might change driving forces for lysosomal im- or export but a direct switching function through changes in protein conformation as is known for calcium ions would be a large surprise.</p><p>For publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, I would expect a more profound mechanistic insight of what chloride ions are doing in lysosomes. So far, the authors present highly interesting observations in very relevant cells followed by a conclusion section that is in my opinion not coherent with the observed phenotype (in CF). To make this work suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>, I would expect measuring and/or manipulating calcium levels under conditions where lysosomal chloride levels are high or low, respectively. In addition, the authors could manipulate chloride levels in lysosomes acutely and observe effects spontaneously.</p><p>In summary, I suggest to reject this manuscript until the above-mentioned experiment sets have been performed and a mechanistic model is presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28862.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Quoting a review from Jentsch (2013), exact measurements of lysosomal [Cl−] have not been reported due to the lack of suitable Cl− sensors for the high [Cl−] at low pH.

We pursued two hypotheses. One, suggested by this reviewer, was that low chloride could impede lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation, which is known to compromise lysosome function (1–3). We also explored whether chloride could directly impact the proper function of specific lysosomal enzymes (1).</p><p>Our studies revealed both mechanisms to be operational. Briefly, selectively inhibiting chloride channels with NPPB resulted in reducing lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-D</xref>).

This reveals that the sensitivity of <italic>Clensor</italic> to diverse biologically abundant anions including NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> is negligible. This is attributed to the fact that <italic>Clensor's</italic> chloride-sensing module, BAC, undergoes collisional quenching selectively with halide ions because of their well-matched HOMO-LUMO energies (2,3). However, chloride is the most abundant physiological anion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) hence BAC acts as a chloride sensor in biological systems.</p><p><italic>2) Lysosomal delivery of Clensor might be slowed down in LSD cells, compared with wild-type (WT) cells.

Before any Cl<sup>-</sup> measurements were made in any mutant <italic>C. elegans,</italic> we performed colocalization studies of <italic>Clensor</italic> with LMP-1::GFP transgenic worms, where the relevant lysosomal storage disorder gene was knocked down by RNAi. These revealed ~80% colocalization at t = 60 min post injecting <italic>Clensor</italic> in all mutant backgrounds studied here, indicating that trafficking of the probe was not affected. Further, in the context of clh-6 worms, though there is an imbalance in chloride concentrations, lumenal pH of these compartments matches that of wildtype lysosomes suggesting that these compartments are indeed likely to be lysosomes. Several other mutants e.g., ncr-1, aman and manba showed <italic>Clensor</italic> accumulated in grossly misshapen and/or enlarged LMP1::GFP positive compartments, further reinforcing that the compartments are indeed lysosomes swollen due to the accumulated material.</p><p>In murine and human macrophages, we pre-labelled lysosomes with TMR-Dextran (0.5 mg/mL) using literature protocols (5), treat cells with U18666A and Conduritol β-epoxide (CBE) to induce Niemann Pick C and Gaucher's cellular phenotype, only then pulse <italic>Clensor</italic> for 30 min, chased for 60 min, and scored for co-localization with TMR-Dextran. Amitriptyline (AH) and NPPB were added 30 min after pulsing and chasing of <italic>Clensor</italic> to lysosomes. We observed that <italic>Clensor</italic> colocalized with lysosomes under each of these conditions, indicating that they do not suffer trafficking defects in these cell culture models of lysosomal storage diseases.
