We examine a piRNA-based immunity that relies on the acquisition of viral derived cDNA (vDNA) and how this pathway discriminates between self and non-self. The piRNAs derived from these vDNAs are essential for virus control and Piwi4 has a central role in the pathway. Piwi4 binds preferentially to virus-derived piRNAs but not to transposon-targeting piRNAs. Analysis of episomal vDNA from infected cells reveals that vDNA molecules are acquired through a discriminatory process of reverse-transcription and recombination directed by endogenous retrotransposons. Using a high-resolution <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> genomic sequence, we found that vDNAs integrated in the host genome as endogenous viral elements (EVEs), produce antisense piRNAs that are preferentially loaded onto Piwi4. Importantly, EVE-derived piRNAs are specifically loaded onto Piwi4 to inhibit virus replication.

Although arboviruses can cause severe disease in humans, they generally cause non-cytopathic, persistent, lifelong infections of competent <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. vectors. Antiviral immunity is thought to be central to these divergent outcomes. As in other arthropods, RNA interference (RNAi) is a major component of the mosquito antiviral defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blair and Olson, 2015</xref>). Intracellular long dsRNA, such as viral replicative intermediates generated during positive-sense viral RNA replication, are processed by the processive endoribonuclease Dicer2 (Dcr2) into 21 nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNA (siRNAs) duplexes, which are loaded onto the endoribonuclease Argonaute-2 (Ago2) at the core of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Ago2 then cleaves one strand of the virus-derived siRNA duplex and utilizes the remaining strand as a guide to target and cleave complementary viral RNAs, thereby restricting viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Rij et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In addition to 21 nt viral siRNAs (v-siRNAs), arboviral infections of <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquitoes and cultured cells also lead to the accumulation of 24–30 nt long virus-derived small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hess et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morazzani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vodovar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miesen et al., 2015</xref>). These small RNAs are similar in size to PIWI-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs), which are generally associated with germline defense against mobile genetic elements. Like germline piRNAs, virus-derived piRNA (v-piRNA) production involves PIWI proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miesen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Varjak et al., 2017a</xref>). In the germline, long antisense piRNA transcripts from genomic piRNA clusters are cleaved to produce primary guide piRNAs with a uridine at their 5’ end (guide U1), which are loaded onto a Piwi protein (Piwi or Aubergine in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brennecke et al., 2007</xref>]) to target and cut cognate transposon mRNAs. Despite the absence of pairing between the U1 of piRNAs bound to Piwi/Aubergine and the target mRNA, Piwi/Aub preferential binds to target sequences with an adenine at their first position (target A1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). The 3’ products from cleaved transposon mRNAs are used to form secondary guide piRNAs with an adenine at their new position 10 (secondary guide A10) and are loaded onto Ago3. These secondary piRNA complexes can then target their corresponding antisense transcript to generate a new antisense U1 piRNA, which are loaded onto another Piwi/Aub protein. This ping-pong model thereby provides the germ line with a pathway for biogenesis of anti-transposon piRNAs. In arbovirus-infected cells, the v-piRNAs also present characteristics supporting the idea that these viral small RNAs are produced via a ping-pong mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vodovar et al., 2012</xref>). However, v-piRNAs are not observed in virus-infected Drosophila, nor are PIWI proteins involved in the fly antiviral defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petit et al., 2016</xref>). Despite a much greater invasion of its genome by TEs compared to the fruitfly, the <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito dedicates a smaller fraction of its piRNAs to target TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arensburger et al., 2011</xref>) and possess an expanded Piwi gene family compared to <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lewis et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting a functional diversification of the Piwi family in mosquito. Conflicting reports have attributed antiviral roles to different PIWI clade proteins in mosquito. For instance, Piwi5 and Ago3 have been suggested to be specifically required for the formation of virus-derived piRNAs, although knock-down of these proteins had no effect on viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miesen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Varjak et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast Piwi4, has been shown to be antiviral in dsRNA knock-down screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Varjak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Varjak et al., 2017a</xref>) but a direct association of viral piRNAs with Piwi4 has not been shown yet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miesen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Upon arboviral infection in insect cells, fragments of viral RNA genomes are converted into vDNA by the reverse-transcriptases derived from endogenous retrotransposons, leading to the accumulation of episomal vDNA molecules. These episomal vDNA molecules serve in the amplification of the antiviral RNAi response in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tassetto et al., 2017</xref>) and have been linked to vector competence in mosquito (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goic et al., 2016</xref>). At the genomic level, integration of viral elements has been identified in all eukaryotes and for all virus families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holmes, 2011</xref>). In insects, these endogenous viral elements (EVEs) are derived mostly from non-retroviral RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Palatini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Whitfield et al., 2017</xref>), with <italic>Aedes spp</italic> genomes harboring approximately 10 times more EVEs than other mosquito species. Parallel analyses of genome and small RNA sequences from <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and derived cell lines reveal that EVEs organize in large loci characterized by high LTR retrotransposon density and the production of high levels of piRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Whitfield et al., 2017</xref>). The abundance of EVEs and EVE-derived piRNAs in mosquito cells, the accumulation v-piRNAs during infection and the contribution of PIWI proteins in antiviral defense suggest the existence of EVE-derived immunity in mosquito through RNAi mechanisms. However, from a mechanistic point of view, little is known about the role of the piRNA machinery in the RNAi-based adaptive immunity in mosquito and the potential antiviral function of EVEs.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that Piwi4 is upregulated in somatic tissues in adult female <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> following blood meal and restricts dengue virus replication in vivo. In infected cells, Piwi4 is required for the accumulation of mature v-piRNAs and binds preferentially to antisense v-piRNAs (corresponding to the anti-genome viral RNA) and not to anti-transposon piRNAs. High-throughput sequencing of episomal DNA accumulating during infection reveals that viral RNAs are preferentially reverse-transcribed, indicating that this antiviral system discriminates between self (host mRNAs) and non-self RNAs (viral RNA) during the vDNA acquisition process. Furthermore, Piwi4 preferentially binds to v-piRNAs derived from genomic EVEs and as compare to v-piRNAs derived from replicating viral RNA. Consistent with this observation, knock-down of Piwi4 results in a decrease in EVE-derived piRNAs and an increase of CFAV RNA accumulation. Furthermore, Aag2 cells infected with Sindbis virus engineered to carry EVE sequences lead to efficient inhibition of SINV replication in a sequence and strand-specific manner, and knock-down of Piwi4 upregulates virus replication. Together our results indicate that genomic EVEs, EVE-derived piRNAs and Piwi4 are central to the antiviral adaptive immunity in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. Given that EVEs are stably incorporated into genome, these observations suggest that the acquisition of vDNA provide a mechanism to long-lasting mosquito adaptive immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Piwi4 is required to restrict virus replication in mosquitoes</title><p>In <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, four Piwi clade proteins have been associated with the host response to arboviral infection. While Piwi5 and Ago3 are involved in v-piRNA production, their knock down does not affect viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schnettler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miesen et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, knock-down of Piwi4 expression leads to increased replication of Semliki Forest Virus, Bunyawera virus, Zika virus and Rift Valley fever virus but does not affect the overall amount of v-piRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Varjak et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dietrich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Varjak et al., 2017b</xref>).

To determine whether Piwi4 is involved in the production of mature antiviral small RNAs, we analyzed virus-derived small RNAs in Aag2 cells infected with SINV, in which Ago2, Piwi4 or Ago3 were depleted using specific dsRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In control dsRNA-treated cells, both SINV-derived siRNAs (v-siRNAs, 21 nt long) and SINV-derived piRNAs (v-piRNAs, 24–30 nt long) accumulated during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The 21 nt v-siRNAs, are uniformly derived from the entire viral genome and correspond to both the sense and antisense strands of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, 24 to 30 nt v-piRNAs were asymmetrically distributed with respect to strand polarity and position on the virus genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miesen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Varjak et al., 2017a</xref>), the overall size distribution of v-piRNAs was not affected by Piwi4 knock down. We then asked whether v-piRNA maturation was affected by Piwi4 loss-of-function. Maturation of piRNAs is mediated by their 3'-end methylation following loading onto a PIWI protein and can be readily assessed by its resistance to ß-elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horwich et al., 2007</xref>). Analysis of virus-derived small RNAs after ß-elimination showed a decrease in mature v-piRNAs in Piwi4 knock-down samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting a role for Piwi4 in v-piRNA maturation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"/></p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41244.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Piwi4 is required for v-piRNA maturation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Size distribution plot of small RNAs mapping to the SINV genome from infected Aag2 cells treated with Fluc/control, Piwi4, or Ago3 dsRNA.

We found more than 200 hybrids between SINV and the most abundant LTR-retrotransposon sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5E</xref> and 70 with Ty3 and 132 with Ty1 elements). Furthermore, mapping of hybrid reads from the most prevalent recombinants (SINV-Ty3/gypsy Element73) showed that recombination occurred in the virus 5’UTR, the non-structural viral genes and in the subgenomic viral RNA that contains the structural genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,i and ii</xref>). In combination with the broad coverage of the SINV genome by the other SINV-only derived vDNA fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,i</xref>), our data suggest little bias in the recombination between LTR-retrotransposons and SINV mRNA.

Indeed, the number of SINV vDNA reads was higher than for the most abundant host mRNA-derived episomal DNA (586 and 256 reads, for SINV and Aag2 transcript AAEL006357, respectively). Our results indicate that reverse transcription and recombination with retrotransposons is a highly specific mechanism, which preferentially converts viral RNA into vDNA.

Furthermore, EVE-derived piRNAs showed a strong bias for uracil at the 1st position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and were protected from beta-elimination, suggesting that they are mature piRNAs, methylated on their 3’end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,i</xref>). Importantly, knockdown of Piwi4 and Ago3, but not Ago2, resulted in a loss of EVE-derived piRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,ii</xref>). Thus, the length, methylation, and sequence bias indicate that small RNAs derived from EVEs are <italic>bona fide</italic> piRNAs and their production requires Piwi4 and Ago3. Because Piwi4 specifically binds to antisense v-piRNAs produced during acute infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>), we examined whether Piwi4 also preferentially associates with antisense piRNAs during persistent infection. Analysis of the new, highly contiguous, Aag2 genome assembly revealed the existence of a unique CFAV-EVE in contig 933F, that produces high level of antisense piRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>) and corresponds to the NS2a gene of CFAV strain distinct from the CFAV that established persistent infection in the Aag2 cell line (see Methods). Accordingly, the sequence differences between CFAV-EVEs and CFAV genomic RNA allowed us to distinguish between EVE- and virus-derived piRNAs. Strikingly, Piwi4-associated small RNAs mostly corresponded to CFAV EVE-derived antisense piRNAs and not to CFAV virus-derived piRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) nor to TE-targeting piRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Of note, during acute infection SINV-derived piRNAs bound to Piwi4 were also significantly enriched for longer sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Again, the preferential binding of Piwi4 for longer piRNAs derived from genomic (EVE) versus RNA viral template was further confirmed in the other two replicates of the Piwi4-IP experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Similar results were obtained with the majority of piRNAs derived from EVEs identified in the Aag2 genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) demonstrating that Piwi4 preferentially associated with longer EVE-piRNAs at the genome-wide level (28–29 nt vs 26–27 nt, <italic><sup>2</sup></italic>, p&lt;2.2e-16).</p><p>The lack of enrichment in Piwi4 IP for the overall population of TE-targeting piRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>) suggests that Piwi4 specifically discriminates between TE-targeting and EVE-derived piRNAs. We hypothesized that the signals allowing this specific piRNA sorting to Piwi4 might be contained in the genomic loci of EVEs. Because EVEs are strongly enriched in a sub-population of TE-rich piRNA clusters interspersed with LTR TE fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Whitfield et al., 2017</xref>), loci-specific sorting to Piwi4 may then extend to neighboring TE-targeting piRNAs (which would have been masked in the genome-wide analysis). We thus examined whether TE-targeting piRNAs transcribed from piRNA clusters associated with EVEs were preferentially bound to Piwi4 compared to TE-targeting piRNAs derived from piRNA clusters that contained only TE fragments. Like for piRNAs derived from TE-only loci, analysis of TE-targeting piRNAs transcribed from EVE containing piRNA clusters showed no enrichment for Piwi4 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Therefore, piRNAs that associate with Piwi4 does not appear to be specified at the global piRNA cluster level. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Piwi4 binds preferentially to longer piRNAs and distinguishes between antiviral EVE-derived piRNAs and other piRNA cluster TE-targeting piRNAs through localized EVE-specific signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>EVE-derived piRNAs and Piwi4 provide antiviral defense against acute and persistent infections</title><p>Like antisense v-piRNAs from acute SINV infection in Aag2 cells, CFAV EVE-derived piRNAs are efficiently loaded onto Piwi4, which acts as a restriction factor against acute arboviral infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>).

Aag2 cells, pretreated with dsRNA against Piwi4 or eGFP as control, were infected with a SINV strain containing the Firefly luciferase reporter gene and a sense (S) or antisense (AS) EVE target sequence. Specific inhibition of the sense EVE target containing virus was assessed as the luciferase activity ratio of the SINV with the AS EVE over S EVE. In control cells (eGFP dsRNA), the relative viral replication advantage of the AS EVE containing virus over its S EVE counterparts increased over a 4 day time course. On the contrary, this ratio was significantly reduced at 48, 72 and 96 hr post infection (hpi) in Piwi4 knock-down Aag2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>, Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, n = 4 independent experiments), indicating that Piwi4 is involved in the specific inhibition of virus replication by EVE-derived piRNAs in acute infection. We note that, while piRNAs that target the viral genome significantly decreased virus replication, it did not completely inhibit virus production. It is possible that the interaction of the EVE/piRNA system with the virus replication machinery may facilitate the establishment of a host-virus equilibrium typical of persistent infections. To test this hypothesis, we first determined the effect of Piwi4 knockdown on CFAV persistent infection and observed a significant increase in viral genome copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, p&lt;0.001). Given that Piwi4 knockdown appears to affect both siRNA and piRNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>), we sought to further examine the antiviral effect specific to piRNAs. To this end, we also performed Ago3 knockdown, which inhibits the production of piRNAs without significantly affecting siRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C</xref>, bottom panel).

Investigating the role of the PIWI proteins in the mosquito immune response, we found that the anti-transposon surveillance pathway common to the majority of metazoan has evolved in mosquitoes as an effective adaptive antiviral defense. A central player in this pathway is Piwi4, which appears to specifically act in the mosquito antiviral piRNA system. In addition, episomal DNA and genome resequencing have revealed that conversion of viral RNA genomes into vDNA is a self-nonself discriminatory process and that EVE-derived piRNAs are loaded onto Piwi4 to restrict acute and persistent infections in mosquito cells.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The antiviral factor Piwi4 binds to v-piRNAs and is required for their maturation</title><p>RNAi is the main antiviral defense in insects. Unlike other diptera such as <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, arboviral infection of mosquito cells is known to lead to virus-derived piRNAs production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blair and Olson, 2015</xref>), which is usually associated with genome surveillance against TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brennecke et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, expansion of the Piwi gene family in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> suggested functional diversification of its piRNA pathway. Indeed, studies of mosquito Piwi proteins have showed that Piwi5 and Ago3 bind to v-piRNAs and are involved in v-piRNA production but do not have antiviral activity. By contrast, Piwi4 was reported to control arboviral infections but not to bind to v-piRNAs nor contribute to their production. This discrepancy between antiviral function and piRNA production and binding has left our understanding of the piRNA machinery’s role in antiviral defense incomplete. Accounting for viral RNA level and piRNA methylation, we now demonstrate that in fact, Piwi4 binds to antisense v-piRNAs and is required for their production and maturation. In this context, the lack of antiviral effect in Piwi5 and Ago3 knock down experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miesen et al., 2015</xref>) suggests that v-piRNA accumulation from the ping pong amplification between Piwi5 and Ago3 might solely reflect a degradation pathway for viral RNAs already silenced by other RNAi complexes, such as Piwi4 and Ago2.</p><p>In SINV-infected Aag2 cells, knock down of Ago2, which binds to v-siRNAs, led to a decrease of mature v-siRNAs but not of mature v-piRNA production. By contrast, knock down of Piwi4, which we found binds to v-piRNAs, led to a loss of both mature v-siRNAs and v-piRNAs. In addition, Piwi4 does not bind to TE-targeting piRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) but is required for their maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Finally, our results and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Varjak et al., 2017a</xref>) indicate that Piwi4 and Ago2 interact. Together, these data suggest that Piwi4 acts as a hub between the siRNA and piRNA antiviral pathways in mosquito and could affect siRNAs and piRNAs maturation by controlling the recruitment of the endogenous small RNA methyltransferase to RISCs. Ago3, which is also involved in TE targeting and v-piRNA methylation does not affect v-siRNA maturation and thus does not share the central role of Piwi4.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Piwi4 binds to a specific form of v-piRNAs transcribed from vDNA elements</title><p>Production of vDNA molecules in <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes during arboviral infection is linked to viral tolerance in mosquito vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goic et al., 2016</xref>) and consequently a capacity to act as an arbovirus vector. By sequencing episomal DNA in SINV and DENV infected Aag2 cells, we have confirmed that fragments of the infecting arbovirus are reverse-transcribed with LTR TEs providing unbiased coverage from loci across the entire viral RNA genome. Thus, recombination between viral genomes and transposons appears to be sequence-independent.

In both cases, Piwi4 associates preferentially with long forms of v-piRNAs (28–29 nucleotides in length). Furthermore, inhibition of vDNA production leads to increased viral replication and decreased v-piRNA accumulation during acute SINV infection, similar to Piwi4 knock down. Because of this phenocopy between vDNA inhibition and Piwi4 knock down and the conserved binding preference of Piwi4 to v-piRNAs derived from EVEs and acute infection, we propose that antisense v-piRNAs bound to Piwi4 during acute arborviral infection derived from vDNA transcription rather than from the viral RNA itself. Consistent with this model, the lack of effect of Ago2 knock down on v-piRNA production despite Ago2 interaction with Piwi4, further suggests that v-piRNAs bound to Piwi4 are not processed from viral RNA genomes cleaved by Ago2-RISCs.</p><p>In Aag2 cells, EVE-containing piRNA clusters produce more piRNAs than loci without EVEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Whitfield et al., 2017</xref>).

To specifically identify small RNAs derived from CFAV-EVEs, reads were first filtered out by mapping them to the persistently infecting CFAV virus genome (Bristol strain, accession # KU936054). Unmapped reads were then aligned to CFAV-EVEs identified in the PacBio Aag2 genome.

For the genome-wide analysis of EVE-derived small RNAs, reads were aligned to all EVEs identified in the Aag2 PacBio genome without the CFAV-EVEs to avoid confounding effect from the previous analysis.

RNA-seq reads were aligned and quanti- fied to the Liverpool <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> transcripts reference (Aedes-aegypti-Liver- pool_TRANSCRIPTS_AaegL3.4.fa, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vector%20base.org">www.vector base.org</ext-link>) using the transcript quantification tool, Salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Patro et al., 2017</xref>). Relative transcript abundance is expressed as Transcript Per Million.</p><p>Comparative analysis of SINV and Aag2 mRNA-derived sequences in episomal/circular DNA sequencing dataset (see above) was performed using Bowtie 1.2.1.1. To filter out contamination from genomic sequences, episomal DNA reads were first aligned to the new Aag2 genome obtained by PacBio sequencing (see below), in v mode allowing up to two mismatches (-v 2). SINV and host mRNA-derived sequences were then identified by aligning the genome-unmapped reads to SINV genome (accession # NC_001547) or <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> transcripts (Aedes-aegypti-Liverpool_TRANSCRIPTS_AaegL3.4.fa) respectively, using the same v mode (-v 2).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>EVE identification</title><p>Identification of EVEs was achieved using standalone Blast. Blast Searches were run using the Blastx command specifying the genome as the query and a refseq library composed of the ssRNA and dsRNA viral protein-coding sequences from the NCBI genomes website as the database. The E-value threshold was set at 10<sup>−6</sup>.</p><p>The EVE with the lower E-value was chosen for further analysis to predict EVEs that overlapped. Several Blast hits to viral protein genes were identified as artifacts because of their homology to eukaryotic genes (e.g. closteroviruses encode an Hsp70 homologue). These artifacts were filtered by hand.</p><p>To determine the necessity of genes for the biogenesis of virus RNA-derived piRNAs, we knocked down expression of each gene in Aag2 cells by dsRNA soaking and infected with SINV (MOI = 10). As a control, we soaked Aag2 cells in Fluc dsRNA. Following a four-day infection, we harvested the small RNA (&lt;200 nt) for deep sequencing analysis and large RNA (&gt;200 nt) for RT-qPCR analysis of knockdown efficiency and SINV genome copy number. RT-qPCR analysis of these samples confirmed that knockdown of each gene was effective (&gt;90%) and SINV genome copy number increased with each treatment relative to control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>PCR and cloning</title><p>Genomic DNA was purified from Aag2 cells using Nucleospin Tissue mini spin columns (Macherey-Nagel). Fragments of EVEs were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using Phusion polymerase (NEB).~500 bp PCR products from EVEs were non-directionally cloned into the 3’ UTR of pUb-Renilla using NotI (NEB). Clones of inserts in both sense and antisense polarity were isolated and amplified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Data availability</title><p>Next-generation sequencing libraries of small RNAs and

The paper may be further considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> only if all the concerns are adequately addressed.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work nicely ties together research from mosquitos showing that piRNAs can function in an antiviral-manner with work showing that extrachromosomal circular DNAs can be produced and retained in hemocytes to confer long-lasting immunity in the fly or mosquito. This work more thoroughly characterizes the role of Piwi4 in the mosquito antiviral immunity, showing that it is associated with antisense, viral piRNAs, and provides the most comprehensive, though not complete, mechanism for their biogenesis described to date. This manuscript also describes a role for Piwi4 to function in somatic tissues to protect the mosquito from persistent infections, which is very distinct from the germline-specific role of Piwi in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This manuscript appears to be sloppily prepared, raising questions about its credibility. It is hard to follow and understand. A few examples throughout the manuscript: The third paragraph of the Introduction ends abruptly; Figure citations at the end of the first paragraph of the subsection “Piwi4 binds to antisense v-piRNAs”, is wrong; The figure legends for Figure 5 do not match with figure; The Figure 7 does not have panel D, which appeared in figure legend. These issues with the figure legends make it impossible to understand some of the data presented without guessing which legends belongs with each figure panel. Relatedly, some of the data presentation is uninterpretable to the generalist reader of <italic>eLife</italic>, especially the presentations in Figure 5 that include the analysis of next-gene sequencing results from circular DNAs. Likewise, the methodology is sometimes very difficult to follow. For example, in Figure 7Ai, how was this expression level of various EVEs determined? Is this PIWI4 pulldown/seq? Or bulk small RNA seq? Or something else? Although the details are in the Materials and methods, the overall approach should be explained in plain English in the main text and ideally be clear from the data presentation in the figure.</p><p>2) The statistical analysis is inconsistent throughout. Some figures make claims of significance without providing any statistical metrics, even when effects are relatively small. For example, the modest 3 fold increase in 28bp small RNAs, compared to 22/22bp RNAs is argued to be a significant difference. Likewise, The differences in enrichment between the EVE reads, the TE-assoc. with EVE reads, and the TE-only reads is only about 2x. Statistical demonstration of statistical significance is lacking. Also, the authors just assumed all of their data were not normally-distributed, and performed non-parametric stats without doing normality tests. They should also include statistical test names and test statistic values within the Results section, and real P values, rather than just writing P &lt; 0.01 etc.</p><p>3) The paper is often framed from an in vivo perspective. However, ~95% of the data were generated in vitro. Specifically, most data (except Figure 1B and C) were generated based on mosquito Aag2 cells. Since the Aag2 cell line was established in 1968 and was passaged for many generations, whether this anti-viral immunity pathway applies to mosquitoes requires further confirmed. For example, the authors identified a CFAV-derived EVE in Aag2 genome, but it is missing in the Ae. aegypti genome AaegL3. Ideally, data should be provided that takes advantage of a virus that is engineered to contain an EVE element observed in the genome of actual mosquitoes, to perform an in vivo analysis similar to that shown for Aag2 cells in Figure 7B/C.</p><p>Likewise, the claims of &quot;transgenerational antiviral immunity&quot; were raised in the Introduction, and given a whole paragraph in the Discussion. Yet, the authors don't have any data supporting this concept. At a minimum, the relevant sections of the paper should be written speculatively.</p><p>4) For both the existing cell-based data in Figure 7 (and any additional mosquito based data) the effect of these EVE elements in restricting virus replication needs to be causally linked to Piwi4.</p><p>5) How is it determined that the viral gene fragment conversion is uniform (Figure 5D)? Is there a statistical test to show that there is no bias? There appear to be patches with fewer mapped reads (i.e. around 4000 and again around 8000), and areas with more densely mapped reads (1-1000) to my untrained eye. A statistical model showing that these are stochastic is needed to make these claims.</p><p>6) Missing and incomplete citations. There are quite a few places in the manuscript lacking references – the Discussion in particular is guilty of this. Other examples include Introduction, third paragraph; subsection “Piwi4 binds to a specific form of v-piRNAs transcribed from vDNA element”, last paragraph; subsection “Ae. Aegypti”.</p><p>7) In this paper, the authors propose that piRNAs from virus are produced by some other PIWI proteins, and then get matured in Piwi4 by gaining the 3'-end methylation. This means that the piRNAs need to be transferred from one PIWI protein to Piwi4 for methylation. Since in all examined animals, piRNA production (loading) and methylation are coupled, it is hard for me to imagine how the proposed two step mechanism would occur. Some insight is required.</p><p>8) Perhaps related to #7: in the field, it is proposed that Ago3 and Piwi5 are the central players for piRNA biogenesis and viral defense in mosquito somatic cells. Van Rij group actually reported that Piwi4 is not induced upon SINV infection, and Piwi4 does not associate with v-piRNAs (Miesen et al., 2015). In this paper, the authors appear to ignore the potential function of Piwi5 completely, and intentionally only focus on Piwi4. The authors need to have a better explanation on the discrepancy with published work and potentially examine the role Piwi5.</p><p>9) For the first half section of the manuscript, the authors focus on SINV and claim that Piwi4 preferentially binds with piRNAs from viruses. But in the second half section, the authors switch to CFAV and propose that Piwi4 mainly binds with piRNA from EVE, but not viruses. The Discussion should address this dichotomy more explicitly; do these two ideas contradict?</p><p>Title:</p><p>The title is overstated, for the current version of the manuscript, as the antiviral adaptive immunity examined in the manuscript is characterized only in mosquito cell lines.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Control of RNA viruses in mosquito cells through the acquisition of vDNA and endogenous viral elements&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The revised manuscript has greatly improved the data presentation issues, highlighted in the earlier round of reviews and the new title more accurately reflects the conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One major issue remains, that was brought up in the earlier reviews, and still requires attention. In particular, a key prediction of the models is that control of the engineered SINV, containing the sense-strand of the CFAV EVE, should be dependent on Piwi4. This needs to be tested. It should be a straight forward experiment given the tools already in-hand.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41244.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This manuscript appears to be sloppily prepared, raising questions about its credibility.

For example, we have revised all the references to the figures and other typos as well as detailed some parts of the Materials and methods. To better explain the next generation sequencing of circular DNAs, we have added detailed cartoons in Figure 5 describing our approaches to highlight what was sequenced. Regarding the expression levels of piRNAs from various EVEs, the legend of Figure 7A has been edited to explain that EVE-derived piRNAs are expressed as a ratio to total read number (i.e. bulk small RNA seq). Importantly, all the results presented are consistent with a model where Piwi4 is a central player in the pathway, whereas Piwi5/Ago3 are accessory proteins that generate sense small viral RNAs, but that do not provide antiviral protection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The statistical analysis is inconsistent throughout.

Since the Aag2 cell line was established in 1968 and was passaged for many generations, whether this anti-viral immunity pathway applies to mosquitoes requires further confirmed. For example, the authors identified a CFAV-derived EVE in Aag2 genome, but it is missing in the Ae. aegypti genome AaegL3. Ideally, data should be provided that takes advantage of a virus that is engineered to contain an EVE element observed in the genome of actual mosquitoes, to perform an in vivo analysis similar to that shown for Aag2 cells in Figure 7B/C.</p><p>Likewise, the claims of &quot;transgenerational antiviral immunity&quot; were raised in the introduction, and given a whole paragraph in the Discussion. Yet, the authors don't have any data supporting this concept. At a minimum, the relevant sections of the paper should be written speculatively.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that further experimentation will be required to establish the precise EVEs role in antiviral defense in vivo. We have modified accordingly the relevant sections to more clearly specify that our data show that EVEs produce functional antiviral piRNAs in a Piwi4-dependent manner, and we suggest that given that Aag2 cells are persistently infected with CFAV, EVEs are under positive selection and are maintained during cell divisions in the mosquito cell line. This leads to the speculation that similar positive selection could exist in mosquito populations. Indeed, previous reports showing the presence of different EVEs in distinct mosquito species collected from the same geographic area suggests that EVEs are endogenized and maintained in mosquito populations in part in a lineage-specific manner (Palatini et al., 2017). We further speculate that EVEs might originate from ancient vertically transmitted insect-specific viruses. However, even though transgenerational EVE-mediated immunity could be a low-frequency event, during acute arboviral infection the acquisition of EVEs in somatic cells, such as mosquito circulating immune cells (i.e.: hemocytes), may be central to effective antiviral immunity. Thus, our results presented in this study represent an important advance in our understanding of the mechanism of mosquito piRNA immunity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For both the existing cell-based data in Figure 7 (and any additional mosquito based data) the effect of these EVE elements in restricting virus replication needs to be causally linked to Piwi4.</p></disp-quote><p>CFAV data address this issue. Piwi4 binds only to CFAV-EVE derived piRNAs (Figure 6D and E) and knock-down of Piwi4, which leads to a decrease of CFAV-EVE derived piRNAs, significantly increases CFAV genomic RNA (Figure 7C). Thus, EVE-derived piRNAs mediate the antiviral effect and Piwi4 is a central player in the pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) How is it determined that the viral gene fragment conversion is uniform (Figure 5D)? Is there a statistical test to show that there is no bias? There appear to be patches with fewer mapped reads (i.e. around 4000 and again around 8000), and areas with more densely mapped reads (1-1000) to my untrained eye. A statistical model showing that these are stochastic is needed to make these claims.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the distribution of SINV viral gene fragments is not uniform over its genome. This observation was confirmed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to test for uniform distribution of reads, which indicated that the distribution of vDNA reads is not uniform across the genome. We have corrected the manuscript to better describe the data, namely by removing the mention of “uniform distribution” and instead indicates that SINV viral RNA genome is almost fully converted into DNA, with only a couple of specific genomic regions presenting lower density of vDNA fragments libraries. This might be due to structure and/or initiation site in the subgenomic viral RNA promoter, and depth of sequencing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Missing and incomplete citations. There are quite a few places in the manuscript lacking references – the Discussion in particular is guilty of this. Other examples include Introduction, third paragraph; subsection “Piwi4 binds to a specific form of v-piRNAs transcribed from vDNA element”, last paragraph; subsection “Ae. Aegypti”.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we have made an effort to correct the deficiencies pointed out by the reviewer and to include as many relevant references as possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In this paper, the authors propose that piRNAs from virus are produced by some other PIWI proteins, and then get matured in Piwi4 by gaining the 3'-end methylation. This means that the piRNAs need to be transferred from one PIWI protein to Piwi4 for methylation. Since in all examined animals, piRNA production (loading) and methylation are coupled, it is hard for me to imagine how the proposed two step mechanism would occur. Some insight is required.</p></disp-quote><p>We hypothesize that the production of the Piwi4 bound v-piRNAs is akin to primary anti-transposon piRNA production, where piRNA precursors are transcribed from piRNA clusters and processed by an endonuclease (e.g.: Zucchini in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) to produce primary guide piRNAs that are loaded onto Piwi where they become methylated. In our model, v-piRNA precursor are first transcribed from vDNA molecules (either as episomal and/or chromosomal EVEs), these vDNA-derived piRNAs are then processed by a yet unknown endonuclease before being loaded onto Piwi4, followed by methylation. We have now added a section in our Discussion to further clarify these aspects of the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Perhaps related to #7: in the field, it is proposed that Ago3 and Piwi5 are the central players for piRNA biogenesis and viral defense in mosquito somatic cells. Van Rij group actually reported that Piwi4 is not induced upon SINV infection, and Piwi4 does not associate with v-piRNAs (Miesen et al., 2015). In this paper, the authors appear to ignore the potential function of Piwi5 completely, and intentionally only focus on Piwi4. The authors need to have a better explanation on the discrepancy with published work and potentially examine the role Piwi5.</p></disp-quote><p>The antiviral role of Piwi5 was tested in our study and we found that Piwi5 doesn’t have an antiviral function under the experimental condition assayed (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). This is consistent with previously reported results by the Van Rij group. To clarify this issue, we now included a discussion and modified the model in Figure 7 on the potential role of Piwi5 in the process. Briefly, we propose Piwi5 is involved in the generation of small RNAs from degraded viral genomic RNA, whereas Piwi4 is involved in vDNA-derived functional piRNAs biogenesis. Since Dicer2, Ago2 and Piwi4 act as antiviral factors but not Piwi5 in our screen (and in a previous study on Piwi5 (Miesen et al., 2015)), we hypothesize that the Dicer2/Ago2 pathway directly targets viral RNA genomes, which in turns triggers vDNA production, similar to the antiviral immune response in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Tassetto et al., 2017 and Poirier et al., Cell Host and Microbe, 2018). piRNAs transcribed from vDNA are then loaded on Piwi4, which participate in the control of virus replication. Given that Piwi5 and Ago3 are involved in the production of virus-derived piRNA production (Miesen el al., 2015), but lack antiviral function, we suggest that these factors participate in degradation of viral RNA genomes fragments that have been already targeted and inactivated by Ago2 and Piwi4 (Figure 7D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) For the first half section of the manuscript, the authors focus on SINV and claim that Piwi4 preferentially binds with piRNAs from viruses. But in the second half section, the authors switch to CFAV and propose that Piwi4 mainly binds with piRNA from EVE, but not viruses. The Discussion should address this dichotomy more explicitly; do these two ideas contradict?</p></disp-quote><p>The first half of our manuscript describes the role of Piwi4 in acute arboviral infections, especially in the case of SINV infection. We show that Piwi4 binds to antisense SINV-derived piRNAs and is required for their methylation. We also demonstrate that Piwi4 acts as antiviral factor against SINV (and also CHIKV and DENV2) in cell culture and in adult female mosquitoes (in the case of DENV2). We then demonstrate that inhibition of vDNA production in mosquito cells leads to a decrease in v-piRNA production and an increase in viral replication. This suggests that the antiviral piRNAs bound by Piwi4 originate from vDNA transcription. During acute viral infection, the reverse-transcription of viral RNA genomes into vDNA leads to the production of two viral nucleic acid elements indistinguishable by deep-sequencing. In contrast, by re-sequencing the genome of Aag2 cells, we identified endogenized viral elements (EVEs) from a Cell Fusing Agent Virus (CFAV) strain distinct from the related CFAV strain that persistently infects Aag2 cells. We thus leveraged our ability to distinguish between piRNAs derived from CFAV EVEs and those derived from replicating CFAV to further our understanding of Piwi4 antiviral role. We found that Piwi4 binds specifically to piRNAs derived from EVEs and not from the replicating RNA virus. Since Piwi4 restricts viral replication during acute and persistent infection, and vDNA formation is involved in antiviral defense, our results suggest that Piwi4 binds to vDNA-derived piRNAs in both acute and persistent infections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Title:</p><p>The title is overstated, for the current version of the manuscript, as the antiviral adaptive immunity examined in the manuscript is characterized only in mosquito cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>Title has been changed to:</p><p>Control of RNA viruses in mosquito cells through the acquisition of viral DNA and endogenous viral elements</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One major issue remains, that was brought up in the earlier reviews, and still requires attention. In particular, a key prediction of the models is that control of the engineered SINV, containing the sense-strand of the CFAV EVE, should be dependent on Piwi4. This needs to be tested. It should be a straight forward experiment given the tools already in-hand.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the essential revision identified by the Editors on the role of Piwi4 in EVE-piRNA antiviral activity, we have now conducted an experiment in 4 independent biological replicates using Sindbis virus strains engineered to express the <italic>firefly luciferase</italic> reporter gene and a sense or antisense EVE target sequence, in the context of Piwi4 knock down in Aag2 cells. Specific inhibition of the sense EVE target containing virus was assessed as the ratio of luciferase activity from the virus strain with the antisense EVE (AS) over the strain with the sense EVE (S). In control cells (treated with dsRNA against eGFP), the relative viral replication advantage of the AS EVE containing virus over its S EVE counterparts increased over a 4 day time course. On the contrary, this ratio was significantly reduced at 48, 72 and 96 hours post infection (hpi) in Piwi4 knock-down Aag2 cells (Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, n=4 independent experiments). These results are now in Figure 7—figure supplement 2, and confirm that Piwi4 is involved in the specific inhibition of viruses containing EVE-piRNA targets.</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate that EVE-piRNAs are loaded onto Piwi4 and can exert sequence-specific antiviral immunity in Aedes aegypti cells.</p><p>In the absence of any available specific Piwi4 antibody, we used overexpression of a tagged Piwi4 construct to perform Piwi4 pull down followed by small RNA-seq to identify small RNA species associated with Piwi4. If overexpression was to increase non-specific binding of piRNAs by the tagged Piwi4, one would expect to see a bias for the most abundant small RNA species, in origin and/or size. However, we have provided 3 levels of control that indicate that our data are very likely representative of the behavior of the endogenous Piwi4.</p><p>First, we found that Piwi4 preferentially binds to EVE-derived and virus-derived piRNAs and not to TE-piRNAs, whereas the latter are the most abundant piRNA species present in Aag2 cells.</p><p>Second, we found that Piwi4 preferentially binds to longer form of virus-derived small RNAs (piRNA vs. siRNA), whereas the virus-derived siRNAs are more abundant than virus-derived piRNAs.</p><p>Last, we confirmed the absence of bias in our approach by normalizing to total small RNA input, performing three independent pull down experiments with the tagged Piwi4 and one control experiment with eGFP. Ultimately, we performed boostrapping of all datasets to confirm that the size distribution of small RNAs bound to Piwi4 was specific and not biased by the amount of small RNA isolated by tagged Piwi4 pull down (with a 95% confidence interval).</p><p>In conclusion, we are confident that the description of our experimental approach and statistical analysis in the Results and Materials and methods sections address the concerns about potential bias due to tagged Piwi4 overexpression at the relevant points in our study and would not improve the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
