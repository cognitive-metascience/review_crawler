disease caused by infection with <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Davila et al., 2010</xref>). Mechanistic insights have been challenging since variation within this locus is complex and biological roles of the factor H-related proteins, unlike factor H, are incompletely understood. <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> subverts immune responses by hijacking a host-immune regulator, complement factor H (CFH), to the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schneider et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Madico et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schneider et al., 2009</xref>). We demonstrate that complement factor-H related 3 (CFHR3) promotes immune activation by acting as an antagonist of CFH. Conserved sequences between CFH and CFHR3 mean that the bacterium cannot sufficiently distinguish between these two serum proteins to allow it to hijack the regulator alone. The level of protection from complement attack achieved by circulating <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> therefore depends on the relative levels of CFH and CFHR3 in serum. These data may explain the association between genetic variation in both CFH and CFHR3 and susceptibility to meningococcal disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04008.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04008.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04008.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Meningitis is a potentially life-threatening condition whereby the membranes that cover and protect the brain and spinal cord become inflamed. Often meningitis is caused by a viral or bacterial infection—such as infection by a bacterium called <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, also known as meningococcus. However, not everyone that comes into contact with this bacterium will develop meningitis; 40% of the population is thought to carry <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> at the back of the nasal cavity and yet show no signs of the disease.</p><p>It remains unclear why some people exposed to <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> develop meningitis while others do not; however recent research revealed that part of the immune system called the complement system plays a role in susceptibility to meningitis. The complement system is a collection of small proteins that work together to support the actions of the cells of the immune system. When activated, complement proteins trigger a cascade of events that helps to destroy the pathogen.</p><p>Several mechanisms exist to keep the complement proteins in check—for example, a protein called complement factor H (or CFH) protects host cells from being attacked by other complement proteins. <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> can undermine the complement system by expressing a protein that binds to CFH and firmly fixes CFH to its cell surface. While the CFH-binding protein helps explain why some people are unable to mount the appropriate immune response to infection by <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, it does not explain why some carriers of the pathogen do not develop meningitis.</p><p>Now, Caesar et al. have examined a protein called CFH related-3 (or CFHR3), and discovered that CFHR3 competes with CFH for the binding protein on <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>. CFHR3 is structurally similar to CFH, but it is unable to regulate or silence the complement system. Caesar et al. explain that susceptibility to meningococcal disease is determined by how much CFH and how much CFHR3 each individual has, and that those with less CFHR3 will be more susceptible to <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>. An individual's genes will affect how much CFH and CFHR3 they have, while the genes of the bacterium can influence how strongly the CFH binding protein binds to either of these human proteins. Caesar et al. suggest that these two factors determine whether or not an individual will develop meningitis or simply carry the bacterium without any ill effects.</p><p>Caesar et al.'s findings highlight the different ways that people's genes can determine how they respond to an invading pathogen. The findings also suggest that it is important to consider variation in the levels of these complement proteins across a population when planning immunisation schedules.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04008.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04008.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic></kwd><kwd>complement evasion</kwd><kwd>genetic susceptibility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100298</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caesar</surname><given-names>Joseph JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Lea</surname><given-names>Susan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102908</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Christoph M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004211</institution-id><institution>Oxford Martin School, University of Oxford</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vaccine Design</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>Philip N</given-names></name><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Christoph M</given-names></name><name><surname>Lea</surname><given-names>Susan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0900888</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lavender</surname><given-names>Hayley</given-names></name><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Christoph M</given-names></name><name><surname>Lea</surname><given-names>Susan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>082291</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Talat H</given-names></name><name><surname>Pickering</surname><given-names>Matthew C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000761</institution-id><institution>Imperial College London</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goiecoechea De Jorge</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EUCLIDS FP7 GA no. 279185</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Christoph M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic susceptibility to an infectious disease is linked to competition for binding a molecule on the bacterial surface by two host proteins with opposing roles in host immunity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> is an important cause of rapidly progressive septicaemia and meningitis in children and young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stephens et al., 2007</xref>); case fatality rates for bacteraemic disease remain at around 10%, and a significant proportion of survivors are left with long-term sequelae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vyse et al., 2013</xref>). For most individuals, however, this human-specific bacterium is primarily a non-pathogenic commensal of the nasopharynx, and up to 40% of the population are healthy carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Caugant and Maiden, 2009</xref>). The mechanisms underlying human genetic influences that govern the development of invasive disease or asymptomatic carriage are incompletely understood. It is known, however, that complement activation is critical for protection against disease, evident from the susceptibility of individuals with genetic deficiency of either the alternative complement pathway (AP) or terminal pathway activation, and among those receiving therapy that prevents terminal pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schneider et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McKeage, 2011</xref>). Amongst several strategies that promote complement evasion<italic>, N. meningitidis</italic> recruits the human negative complement regulator, complement factor H (CFH), to its surface by expressing factor H binding protein (fHbp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schneider et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Madico et al., 2007</xref>). fHbp can be divided into three variant groups (V1, V2, and V3), which have &gt;85% sequence identity within the groups but only 60–70% similarity between groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Masignani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brehony et al., 2009</xref>). fHbps from all variant groups bind CFH with a <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> in the low nanomolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is significant that the only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with meningococcal disease in a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) were those among the <italic>CFH–CFHR</italic> locus. These included SNPs within <italic>CFH</italic> and the downstream gene, <italic>CFHR3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Davila et al., 2010</xref>). While CFH has been extensively studied (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Makou et al.

Given the association of CFHR3 with meningococcal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Davila et al., 2010</xref>), we investigated whether this protein and CFHR4 also act as CFH antagonists in this assay. We generated full-length CFHR3 and CFHR4B (which both consist of five complement control protein [CCP] domains, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and truncated versions of these proteins, and we examined their ability to influence complement activation by the AP, which is regulated by CFH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Makou et al., 2013</xref>). Erythrocyte haemolysis assays demonstrate that CFHR3 and CFHR4B are also CFH antagonists on this surface, with their two C-terminal domains enabling them to compete with CFH for binding sites on cell complement fragments such as C3b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

We previously identified a series of alanine substitutions in fHbp that significantly reduce or ablate CFH binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we measured the contribution of fHbp residues to interactions with CFHR3 to determine whether any amino acid changes altered the specificity of fHbp for the two complement factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). The results demonstrate that the majority of mutations that impair CFH binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>) also significantly reduce CFHR3 binding, so do not alter specificity for CFH; point mutations at only a few sites led to modest alterations in specificity at levels that are unlikely to be physiologically relevant given the relative affinities for CFHR3/CFH and their abundance in serum (CFHR3 1–1.6 μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fritsche et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hebecker and Jozsi, 2012</xref>]; CFH 1–4 μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hakobyan et al., 2008</xref>]). Interestingly the V1 fHbp used as the background for the mutations (V1.1) did reveal a degree of specificity for CFH over CFHR3 (in the order of ∼20-fold) in contrast to V2 and V3 fHbps, suggesting that certain fHbps can discriminate between CFH and CFHR3.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04008.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Key residues in fHbp that mediate binding to CFHR3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SPR was used to determine <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub>s for both CFH<sub>67</sub> and CFHR3<sub>12</sub> binding to a panel of fHbps bearing alanine substitutions within the CFH<sub>67</sub> binding site. ∼50 mutations were screened in each of three fHbps (V1.1, 2.21 and 3.28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>]).

This demonstrated that V2 and V3 fHbps displayed no selective affinity for CFH over CFHR3 (average selectivity being 1.8 ± 1.4 and 2.4 ± 1.0, respectively). In contrast, V1 fHbps had lower affinities for CFHR3 compared to CFH (average selectivity 8.9 ± 4.6-fold), with 12 of the 14 V1 fHbp variants binding CFH 5- to 20-fold more tightly than CFHR3. Modeling the effect on the occupancy of fHbp with CFH indicates that certain V1 fHbps will be bound by CFH in the physiological situation regardless of CFHR3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To examine whether this has any functional consequence, we examined complement AP killing of isogenic strains expressing fHbp sequences with different abilities to discriminate between CFH and CFHR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>); AP killing was assessed to exclude any confounding influence of antibodies in sera preferentially recognizing different fHbps. Bacteria expressing V3.28 fHbp, which has identical affinities for CFH and CFHR3, were the most sensitive to AP killing, while the strain expressing the V1.1 fHbp sequence (which has ∼20-fold tighter binding to CFH than CFHR3) was the least sensitive; bacteria with fHbps with intermediate CFH specificity displayed intermediate levels of protection.

Assuming that the number of molecules of either of these is significantly greater than the number of molecules of fHbp then the percentage of bacterial surface fHbp molecules binding CFH at equilibrium will be determined by: the relative amounts of both present in the individual; and the affinities of that fHbp sequence for CFH vs CFHR3 (essentially a model of competitive antagonism, see equation below). Natural fHbp sequences are relatively constant in their K<sub>D</sub> for CFH (K<sub>D</sub> ∼3 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>] and this work), therefore we modelled the effect of the K<sub>D</sub> for CFHR3 varying between 3 nM and 300 nM against this constant K<sub>D</sub> for CFH under two conditions.

Our data predict that the risk of developing meningococcal disease will be governed by the relative abundance of CFH and CFHR3 in individuals and the affinity of these molecules for the specific fHbp on the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). It is notable that the Δ<italic>CFHR3/1</italic> allele has a high prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>) where there are high rates of epidemic disease. Our mechanism is consistent with this association, since this allele would enhance the interaction between CFH and fHbp and favour pathogen survival. This is particularly true as the <italic>Δ</italic><italic>CFHR3/1</italic> deletion is associated with increased plasma CFH levels, most likely due to the loss of a regulatory locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ansari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). However, host polymorphisms in CFHR3 might have less impact on strains of bacteria that express fHbp that more selectively bind CFH. Therefore, susceptibility to meningococcal disease will be influenced by polymorphisms and copy number variation affecting two host complement factors and by the relative affinity of fHbp on an infecting strain for CFH and CFHR3. This illustrates why genetic association studies in infectious diseases are likely to be technically challenging since these will be influenced not only by sequence and structural variation within the host but also by genetic variation in pathogen.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cloning and mutagenesis for protein expression</title><p>Sequences encoding CFHR1<sub>45</sub>, CFHR3<sub>12</sub>, CFHR3<sub>45</sub> and CFHR4<sub>45</sub> were amplified using primer pairs CFHR1-4-Forward(5′-GAAGGAGATATACCATGACGGGAAAATGTGGGCC-3′)/CFHR1-5-Reverse(5′-GGCCCACATTTTCCCGTCATGGTATATCTCCTTC-3′), CFHR3-1-Forward(5′-GATATACATATGAAACCTTGTGATTTTCCAGACATTAAAC-3′)/CFHR3-2-Reverse(5′-GGATCCTCGAGCTAACGGATGCATCTGGGAGTAG-3′), CFHR3-4-Forward(5′-GGCAGCCATATGTCAGAAAAGTGTGGGCCTCCTC-3′)/CFHR3-5-Reverse(5′- CGGATCCTCGAGTTATTCGCATCTGGGGTATTCCACTATC-3′) and CFHR3-4-Forward/CFHR4-5-Reverse(5′- CGGATCCTCGAGTTATTCGCATCTGGGGTATTCCACTATG-3′), respectively.

Previously, it is known that fHbp, a surface exposed lipoprotein from <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, can bind to complement factor H (CFH), playing an important role of evasion of complement-mediated killing of the bacteria. Because of this, study of fHbp binding to CFH has important implications in vaccine design and improvement. In this work, the authors pursue a result from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) study of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> that implicates human variability in CFHR3 as associated with host susceptibility. They demonstrate that CFHR3 could also bind to fHbp with a similar affinity as CFH and went further to show that the binding surface on fHbp by CFH and CFHR3 completely overlaps. They then demonstrate convincingly that CFHR3 promotes complement activation by competing with CFH on the bacterial surface. Finally, they further propose a model that the relative levels of two complement and related proteins (CFH and CFHR3) in the circulation system is a critical factor for determining the host susceptibility to meningococcal disease. In general, the study is very clearly written and provides an exciting and generally interesting observation. The concept proposed is novel and highly interesting given that there are five CFHR proteins that are often involved in binding to surface proteins of various bacterial pathogens. The paper is potentially suitable for <italic>eLife</italic> after addressing the following points.</p><p>1) As a rationale for the study and also a clinically relevant conclusion, the authors point to a recent GWAS study showing linkage disequilibrium to a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and hence indicating the possibility that the linkage could be a result of deletion of CFHR3/CFHR1. In reading the Nature Genetics report, though, it does not appear that the CFHR3/CFHR1 deletion itself is linked to disease risk, but the association is rather to the CFHR3 SNP that is outside of the deleted region. The authors should clarify to readers the exact understanding of the relationship between <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> risk and the CFHR3/CFHR1 deletion. If that connection is not established through population studies then what could be the proposed mechanistic link to the CFHR3 polymorphism(s)?</p><p>2) In contrast to the binding assays, the actual differences in relative survival of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> in the presence and absence of CFHR3 are rather modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figure 3d, e, 4c</xref>). In addition, only one serum concentration and one protein concentration is used. In what is likely to be optimized conditions, the differences are &lt;two-fold. Given the non-linear activities of the complement alternative pathway (AP) and amplification loop, it is not certain how modest changes in serum concentration would impact the results with different CFHR3/CFH ratios. To address this issue, the authors should present results of killing assays using a range of serum and protein concentrations. The authors should also include the fHbp-deficient <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> mutant strain as well as complementation by E255A as controls. Moreover, statistics should be also performed on the differences between normal human serum (NHS) and heat-inactivated serum with different CFHR3 proteins with p values calculated.</p><p>3) Serum killing assays are of course only an approximation of the complex bacterial protective response in vivo. Although there are no good animal models of human CFHR activities, inclusion of human neutrophils can provide a more complete analysis of the relationship between serum complement-bactericidal activity and bacterial killing (see for instance Ross et al, J Infect Dis. (1987) 155 (6): 1266-1275). The authors should perform such combined serum- and cell-based assays in which a more complete role of complement, and in particular its C3 fragment receptors on neutrophils, can be evaluated for their contribution to bacterial killing.</p><p>4) CFH and CFHR3 are generally considered to have similar function of negatively regulating the complement activity. However, the authors indicate here and in previous studies that this perception is wrong and CFHR3 can compete with CFH to bind the C3b complex and therefore counteract the negative function of CFH. The authors should go beyond the erythrocyte haemolysis assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and examine the general function of CFHR3 in serum-mediating killing of bacteria that have nothing to do with CFH/CFHR3 binding (also consider using their CFHR3-deficient sera). This is particularly important in that pathogens exhibit a wide variety of mechanisms to evade the in vivo immune response, most of which do not directly target the complement system. In that context, additional support for an important role by this mechanism would add substantially to the relevance and potential impact of the study.</p><p>5) According to the authors' model, the function of CFHR3 should depend on the presence of CFH. However, there were no direct evidences demonstrating this point. Can CFH-deficient serum be found? If not, is it possible to deplete or block CFH by using CFH-specific antibody? In the latter, the authors can then examine whether exogenous CFHR3 still has any effect on complement-mediated killing in the sera in the absence of CFH function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04008.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) As a rationale for the study and also a clinically relevant conclusion, the authors point to a recent GWAS study showing linkage disequilibrium to a specific SNP and hence indicating the possibility that the linkage could be a result of deletion of CFHR3/CFHR1.

If that connection is not established through population studies, then what could be the proposed mechanistic link to the CFHR3 polymorphism(s)?</italic></p><p>The GWAS study by Davila <italic>et al.</italic> did not show an association with the CFHR3‐1 deletion polymorphism as evident by the lack of an association between macular degeneration and the typed rs6677604 SNP (Davila et al., Nature Genetics 2010, Supplemental data Table 3). This SNP tags the CFHR3–1 deletion in many populations. The statistically significant associations in the GWAS study consisted of SNPs within CFH, within CFHR3 and within CFHR1, although the latter failed genotyping in one of the cohorts [Spanish] so was not included in the combined analysis (Davila et al., Nature Genetics 2010, Table 2). On the data presented it was not possible to conclude that the identified SNPs were causal because many of them were in linkage disequilibrium across the CFH–CFHR locus. In fact Davila et al. make the point “these CFH and CFHR SNPs are statistically indistinguishable from one another, and further work, such as deep resequencing, may be needed to identify the causal variant or variants within the associated region if the currently identified SNPs are not the functional variants”. What we can robustly conclude from the existing data is that variation within the CFH–CFHR locus influences susceptibility to macular degeneration. This includes variation within CFH (not unexpected from observations from complement deficiency states) and within the CFHR protein family (unexpected). Our functional studies support an association with variation within CFHR3. We have modified the text to reflect these comments.</p><p><italic>2) In contrast to the binding assays, the actual differences in relative survival of N. meningitidis in the presence and absence of CFHR3 are rather modest (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4"><italic>Figure 3d, e, 4c</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>The difference in survival on the addition of CFHR3 is approximately 40% in the assay we performed that was over the course of 30 minutes. Although the difference appears modest to the reviewer, this will be marked during bacteraemia over hours in an infected individual. For example, over two hours the presence of CFHR3 would result in 88% less in survival of bacteria in the presence of CRHR3 compared to an individual with ΔCFHR3‐CFHR1 (and a 95% difference over 3 hrs).</p><p><italic>In addition, only one serum concentration and one protein concentration is used. In what is likely to be optimized conditions, the differences are &lt;two-fold. Given the non-linear activities of the AP and amplification loop, it is not certain how modest changes in serum concentration would impact the results with different CFHR3/CFH ratios.

The amount of serum in both the NHS and AP assays was kept constant to give approximately 80% bacterial survival without additional CFHR3; this enables the impact of this de‐regulator (which was expected to decrease survival) to be determined. The results demonstrate that the effect of CFHR3 (Mol Microbiol. 2011 Sep;81(5):1330-42; Nat Rev Microbiol. 2012 Jan 31;10(3):178-90) on meningococcal survival is dose and fHbp dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We now include these results as supplementary data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>, panel a).</p><p><italic>Moreover, statistics should be also performed on the differences between NHS and heat inactivated serum with different CFHR3 proteins with p values calculated</italic>.</p><p>We have added the relevant statistical analyses to the Figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> in our revised manuscript) as requested.</p><p><italic>3) Serum killing assays are of course only an approximation of the complex bacterial protective response in vivo.

The authors should perform such combined serum- and cell-based assays in which a more complete role of complement and in particular its C3 fragment receptors on neutrophils can be evaluated for their contribution to bacterial killing</italic>.</p><p>This is an interesting suggestion. Marked susceptibility to meningococcal disease is seen in individuals with rare complement defects (especially loss of components of the terminal pathway, which is necessary for bacteriolysis and not opsonphagocytosis), those receiving C5 inhibitors (i.e. eculizumab), and inherited defects of the AP (i.e. properdin and factor D deficiencies). Furthermore, the established correlate of protection against meningococcal disease is the presence in the serum of bactericidal antibodies (i.e. antibodies that trigger the classical complement pathway and cause bacteriolysis).</p><p>In contrast, neutropaenic patients and people unable to generate a neutrophil anti-microbial oxidative burst do not exhibit high rates of meningococcal disease. This is consistent with the detection of diplococci in neutrophils in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood of patients with meningococcal disease (the bacterium was originally named <italic>Diplococcus intracellulare</italic>) and the resistance of pathogenic Neisseria to killing by neutrophils in the laboratory (shown by us and others, e.g., Mol Microbiol. 2011 Sep;81(5):1330-42; Nat Rev Microbiol. 2012 Jan 31;10(3):178-90). Work cited by the reviewer used a large number of uncharacterised bacterial strains and no details were provided about the method of recovery of neutrophils (which affects their activation status/NET formation).</p><p>Therefore neither genetic, clinical nor laboratory evidence implicates polymorphonuclear leukocytes and opsonphagocytosis in innate immunity against the meningococcus. Therefore work with polymorphonuclear leukocytes would not contribute any further insights into the effects of CFHRs. However, in line with the reviewers’ comments, we now discuss this point in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) CFH and CFHR3 are generally considered to have similar function of negatively regulating the complement activity. However, the authors indicate here and in previous studies that this perception is wrong and CFHR3 can compete with CFH to bind to C3b complex and therefore counteract the negative function of CFH.

In that context, additional support for an important role by this mechanism would add substantially to the relevance and potential impact of the study</italic>.</p><p>Our hypothesis, supported by the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, is that CFHR3 has no activity except in its ability to compete for the same binding sites as CFH. This is now further supported by the additional demonstration that CFHR3 <italic>per se</italic> has no effect on complement-mediated lysis in the absence of CFH (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> and the answer to point 5 below). As suggested by the reviewer, to further exemplify this point we have now examined serum-mediated killing of <italic>E. coli</italic> since these do not express any CFH binding protein. These new data (now incorporated into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>, panel b) clearly demonstrate that addition of CFHR3 has no direct effect on killing of this bacterium.</p><p><italic>5) According to the authors' model, the function of CFHR3 should depend on the presence of CFH. However, there were no direct evidences demonstrating this point. Can CFH-deficient serum be found? If not, is it possible to deplete or block CFH by using CFH-specific antibody? In the latter, the authors can then examine whether exogenous CFHR3 still has any effect on complement-mediated killing in the sera in the absence of CFH function</italic>.</p><p>Working with CFH-deficient sera is difficult as it is prone to full complement activation following relatively minor insult. However, as suggested, we have now repeated the haemolytic assays in CFH-deficient sera and show that addition of CFHR3 has no effect on haemolysis in the absence of CFH (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, reconstitution of the sera with CFH restores the ability of CFHR3 to promote haemolysis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
