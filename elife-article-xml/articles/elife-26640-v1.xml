(PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>) and play important roles in regulating the PI3K/Akt pathway in physiology and disease. Aiming to uncover interdomain regulatory mechanisms in SHIP2, we determined crystal structures containing the 5-phosphatase and a proximal region adopting a C2 fold. This reveals an extensive interface between the two domains, which results in significant structural changes in the phosphatase domain. Both the phosphatase and C2 domains bind phosphatidylserine lipids, which likely helps to position the active site towards its substrate. Although located distant to the active site, the C2 domain greatly enhances catalytic turnover. Employing molecular dynamics, mutagenesis and cell biology, we identify two distinct allosteric signaling pathways, emanating from hydrophobic or polar interdomain interactions, differentially affecting lipid chain or headgroup moieties of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. Together, this study reveals details of multilayered C2-mediated effects important for SHIP2 activity and points towards interesting new possibilities for therapeutic interventions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26640.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26640.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Inositol phosphatase</kwd><kwd>phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate</kwd><kwd>C2 domain</kwd><kwd>structural biology</kwd><kwd>enzyme kinetics</kwd><kwd>allosteric regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2010-15923</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lietha</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Comunidad de Madrid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S2010/BMD-2457</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lietha</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2016-77665-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lietha</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The SHIP2 inositol phosphatase is an important upstream regulator of the Akt signaling pathway, which requires a catalytic core formed by the phosphatase domain tightly packed to a C2 domain for its function.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The levels of soluble inositol phosphates and membrane integrated phosphoinositide lipids in the cell are regulated by inositol kinases and phosphatases. They play key roles in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, survival and vesicular trafficking. The generation of the phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>) is triggered via stimulation of growth factor and cytokine receptors that activate type I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) to produce PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> from PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Upon stimulation, PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels peak rapidly followed by a prompt return to basal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stephens et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yip et al., 2008</xref>). The two main enzymes responsible for PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> degradation are the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which removes the 3-phosphate (3 P) and the SH2-containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP), which dephosphorylates the 5 P to generate PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>. Deregulation of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels is one of the most frequent causes of tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vanhaesebroeck et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The SHIP 5-phosphatase (5-Ptase) family consists of two members, SHIP1 and SHIP2. SHIP1 expression is limited to hematopoietic cells and spermatocytes, whereas SHIP2 is ubiquitously expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pesesse et al., 1997</xref>). SHIP1 plays an important role in myeloid homeostasis and exhibits reduced levels or mutational inactivation in various leukemias and lymphomas, suggesting a role as tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the PI3K/Akt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luo et al., 2003</xref>). SHIP2 polymorphisms associate with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kagawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaisaki et al., 2004</xref>) as well as opsismodysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Below et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iida et al., 2013</xref>), a rare but severe type of skeletal dysplasia. SHIP2 knockout mice were reported to be resistant to dietary obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sleeman et al., 2005</xref>) and mice expressing catalytically inactive SHIP2 displayed several developmental defects and lower insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubois et al., 2012</xref>). Several studies associate SHIP2 with signaling triggered by growth factors, including EGF and FGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jurynec and Grunwald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Olsen et al., 2006</xref>). Like SHIP1, SHIP2 also plays important roles in cancer, although its behavior is more complex and tissue dependent. Similar to SHIP1, SHIP2 functions as a tumor suppressor in glioblastoma, erythroleukemia and squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giuriato et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2008</xref>), but is oncogenic in breast carcinomas and colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoekstra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prasad et al., 2008</xref>). On the one hand, this ambivalent oncogenic behavior of SHIP2 in different cell types likely depends on how efficient the SHIP2 product, PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, is further metabolized to PI(3)P, a reaction catalyzed by inositol polyphosphate 4-phophatases (INPP4). Accumulation of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> in a case where the INPP4 reaction is rate limiting can be oncogenic, since PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> can still partially activate the Akt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li and Marshall, 2015</xref>), but is no longer accessible for degradation by PTEN. On the other hand, the SHIP product can be directly tumor suppressing by shutting down mTORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marat et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>SHIP1 and SHIP2 are large ~140 kDa multidomain proteins that share a very similar domain organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The SHIP Ptase domain belongs to a family of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inositol phosphatases with specificity for 5 P dephosphorylation of inositol rings. These 5-Ptases have different substrate recognition specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jefferson and Majerus, 1996</xref>) with the SHIP 5-Ptase exhibiting a strong preference for 3-phosphorylated substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pesesse et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>). Further, the inositol 5-Ptase family displays distant homology to Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent DNase I and Apurinic/Apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dlakić, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Whisstock et al., 2000</xref>) and the conservation of catalytic residues suggests a common mechanism of catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whisstock et al., 2002</xref>). The existence of a C2 domain following the Ptase domain was previously predicted for SHIP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ong et al., 2007</xref>), however, the sequence identity to other C2 domains is low and a C2 fold has not been structurally confirmed. The SHIP1 C2 domain was reported to allosterically upregulate Ptase activity by binding to the PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> product, a feature not found to be conserved in SHIP2.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26640.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of SHIP2 Ptase-C2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic domain structure of human SHIP2.

We show that, both the Ptase and Ptase-C2 regions of SHIP2 bind phosphatidylserine (PS), which likely localizes the rigid Ptase-C2 region close to its substrate. Importantly, even in the absence of a localization effect, the C2 domain provides activating signals to the Ptase active site, resulting in a significant increase in catalytic turnover. Combining enzyme kinetics, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and mutagenesis we identify distinct regions at the domain interface with different effects on SHIP2 activity. Hydrophobic Ptase-C2 interactions increase SHIP2 turnover with the lipid chain containing PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> substrate, whereas polar interactions communicate from the domain interface to a substrate binding loop mainly affecting catalysis of the soluble inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP<sub>4</sub>) substrate. Together, our data provide novel structural and mechanistic insights on a C2 assisted functioning of SHIP2, and by homology likely of SHIP1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of SHIP2 Ptase-C2</title><p>A construct of human SHIP2 containing residues 420–878 corresponding to the Ptase and a C2 domain (Ptase-C2) was crystallized and diffraction data collected to 1.96 Å. The protein crystallized in the P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> space group with eight molecules per asymmetric unit (for crystallographic and refinement statistics, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Each of the eight molecules (A-H) contains a 5-Ptase and a C2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The overall structure of the Ptase domain in Ptase-C2 is similar to the one previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mills et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>), displaying a central β-sheet sandwich decorated by seven helices (α1-α7) and several loops (L1-L4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, there are significant differences. Loop residues 587–594 (L3) are located at the interface with the C2 domain and are due to extensive interactions with the C2 domain well ordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, a loop proximal to the active site, spanning residues 674–684 (L4), was in previous Ptase structures disordered or closed over the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mills et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; hereafter referred to as L4-in conformation), whereas in our structure 6 of the Ptase-C2 monomers (A, B, C, E, F, G) exhibit a conformation where L4 points away from the active site (L4-out). These L4-out conformations are stabilized by interactions of R682 in L4 with one or two aspartic acids (D613/D615) adjacent to helix α5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>, hereafter referred to as singly or doubly bound L4-out conformations). In molecule D, R682 is half way between the L4-in and L4-out conformation and in monomer H R682 is disordered. Together, these conformations suggest extensive mobility of L4 with a displacement of the guanidinium group of the R682 side chain by ~20 Å between L4-in and L4-out conformations. L4-out conformations appear to be favored by the presence of the C2 domain, since they are only observed for Ptase-C2, although crystal packing analysis suggests ample space in Ptase crystals in this region. In L4-out structures where R682 is doubly bound to D613 and D615 (molecules B and F), a network of hydrogen bonds is established that includes H674, T683 and N684 on L4, rigidifying the loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26640.005</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Diffraction and refinement statistics.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26640.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26640.005</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Ptase-C2 <break/>WT</th><th>Ptase-C2 <break/>FLDD</th><th>Ptase-C2 <break/>FLDD</th><th>Ptase-C2 <break/>D607A</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Space group</td><td>P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub></td><td>P2<sub>1</sub></td><td>I<sub>2</sub></td><td>P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub></td></tr><tr><td>Cell dimensions</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><italic>a, b, c (Å)</italic></td><td>136.0, 175.8, 176.9</td><td>44.0, 81.1, 128.9</td><td>43.7, 73.4, 158.0</td><td>137.1, 177.1, 177.4</td></tr><tr><td><italic>α, β, γ (°)</italic></td><td>90.0, 90.0, 90.0</td><td>90.0, 92.9, 90.0</td><td>90.0, 90.7, 90</td><td>90.0, 90.0, 90.0</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution (Å)*</td><td>48.97–1.96 <break/>(1.99–1.96)</td><td>81.12–1.94 <break/>(1.99–1.94)</td><td>78.98–1.85 <break/>(1.89–1.85)</td><td>49.17–2.65 <break/>(2.70–2.65)</td></tr><tr><td>R<sub>merge</sub>*</td><td>8.0 (88.1)</td><td>13.3 (110.7)</td><td>5.9 (59.5)</td><td>16.1 (134.4)</td></tr><tr><td>R<sub>meas</sub>*</td><td>8.6 (95.6)</td><td>14.4 (120.0)</td><td>7.0 (70.4)</td><td>17.0 (142.5)</td></tr><tr><td>R<sub>pim</sub>*</td><td>3.3 (36.8)</td><td>5.5 (45.9)</td><td>3.8 (37.2)</td><td>5.5 (46.7)</td></tr><tr><td>CC (1/2)*</td><td>0.999 (0.743)</td><td>0.998 (0.787)</td><td>0.999 (0.768)</td><td>0.996 (0.700)</td></tr><tr><td>Mean (I/σ(I))*</td><td>14.8 (2.1)</td><td>11.8 (2.3)</td><td>11.6 (2.1)</td><td>13.4 (2.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Completeness (%)*</td><td>100.0 (100.0)</td><td>100.0 (100.0)</td><td>99.3 (99.1)</td><td>100.0 (100.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Multiplicity *</td><td>6.8 (6.7)</td><td>6.8 (6.7)</td><td>3.4 (3.5)</td><td>9.0 (8.9)</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Refinement</bold></td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Resolution (Å)</td><td>48.96–1.96</td><td>81.12–1.94</td><td>78.98–1.85</td><td>49.17–2.65</td></tr><tr><td> No. reflections</td><td>287002</td><td>63790</td><td>40283</td><td>119204</td></tr><tr><td> R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub></td><td>18.0/20.8</td><td>19.0/22.9</td><td>17.8/20.5</td><td>20.6/24.5</td></tr><tr><td> No. atoms</td><td/><td/><td/><td><break/></td></tr><tr><td> Protein</td><td>28142</td><td>6901</td><td>3423</td><td>27555</td></tr><tr><td> Ligand</td><td>225</td><td>39</td><td>16</td><td>237</td></tr><tr><td> Water</td><td>1564</td><td>288</td><td>139</td><td>284</td></tr><tr><td> B- factors</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Protein</td><td>46.77</td><td>27.37</td><td>34.01</td><td>61.54</td></tr><tr><td> Ligand/ion</td><td>42.66</td><td>34.64</td><td>42.10</td><td>66.88</td></tr><tr><td> Water</td><td>44.01</td><td>29.82</td><td>38.30</td><td>45.57</td></tr><tr><td> R.m.s. deviation</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Bond lengths (Å)</td><td>0.009</td><td>0.010</td><td>0.008</td><td>0.009</td></tr><tr><td> Bond angles (°)</td><td>1.306</td><td>1.354</td><td>1.260</td><td>1.267</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><p>*Highest resolution range shown in parentheses</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>The C2 domain interacts with the Ptase on a face that is opposite to the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

A sequence-based similarity search using HH-pred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Söding et al., 2005</xref>) also identified the C2 domain of dysferlin as the closest related C2 domain (E-value = 0.049), although with 16% sequence identity the homology is low. The topology adopted by the SHIP2 C2 domain is as for itchy and dysferlin that of type II (or P-variant) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corbalan-Garcia and Gómez-Fernández, 2014</xref>). PKC type C2 domains usually bind phospholipids, most frequently phosphatidylserine (PS), often in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner via acidic residues present in three Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops (CBLs) at the tip of the C2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho and Stahelin, 2006</xref>). Structure-based sequence alignment indicates that only 2 of 5 acidic residues on CBL1 and CBL3 are conserved between PKCα and SHIP2 (D829 and E832) and two are replaced by serines (S761 and S827). To test for lipid binding and calcium dependency, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments with immobilized PS vesicles and protein lipid overlay (PLO) assays. We found that both the Ptase and Ptase-C2 bind PS, with the C2 domain enhancing the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In summary, we conclude that both, the Ptase and Ptase-C2 bind PS and the small effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup>suggests that the interaction is dominated by direct PS binding to basic residues, rather than Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated binding to acidic residues and serines. Nevertheless, the low conservation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding residues in CBL1 and CBL3 of the SHIP2 C2 domain might weakly contribute to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated lipid binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26640.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The C2 domain of SHIP2 and lipid binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure-based sequence alignment of the C2 domains of SHIP2, dysferlin, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and protein kinase Cα (PKCα) and alignment of the corresponding sequence of SHIP1.

In order to disrupt the hydrophobic core of the domain interface we mutated F593 and L597 to aspartates (FLDD mutant). Further, we mutated R649 in the Ptase to alanine (R649A) to prevent polar interactions with E862 and F855 in the C2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Crystal structures of Ptase-C2 FLDD confirm that few hydrophobic interactions remain intact between the Ptase and C2 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The FLDD mutations also disrupt interdomain hydrogen bonds between R649 and E862. When comparing the catalytic turnover of the FLDD mutants we find that the C2 domain no longer has a significant effect with either substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), indicating that the FLDD mutations largely mimic the absence of the C2 domain. We note that the FLDD mutations increase intrinsic Ptase activity with PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-diC8, but importantly the presence of the C2 does not cause any further change. Interestingly, the polar R649A mutation specifically eliminates the effect of the C2 domain on IP<sub>4</sub> kinetics, while retaining most of its effect on PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the polar R649-E682/F855 interactions between Ptase and C2 domains mainly affect SHIP2 activity with IP<sub>4</sub>, whereas hydrophobic interactions increase activity towards PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>Next, we tested whether PS binding alters the C2-mediated effects. We find that soluble PS-diC8 has little effect on IP<sub>4</sub> kinetics and increases activity ~40% with PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-diC8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>), both for Ptase and Ptase-C2. If instead a lipid vesicle embedded PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-diC16 substrate is used, the presence of 30% (mol/mol) PS-diC16 in the vesicles increases SHIP2 activity ~2–3 fold for both, Ptase and Ptase-C2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The PS-mediated increase in activity on vesicles is maintained for the FLDD mutant, whereas as with soluble substrates, the increase in activity due to the C2 domain is abrogated by the interface mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In summary, these data show that the effect of PS is amplified for SHIP activity on vesicles, possibly due to a localization or positioning effect and this effect is independent and additive to the enhancing allosteric signaling of the C2 domain.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26640.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Effect of PS binding on SHIP activity.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Activity was measured in presence or absence of 100 μM PC-diC8 or PS-diC8 and as substrate 150 μM IP<sub>4</sub> (<bold>A</bold>) or PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-diC8 (<bold>B</bold>).

Simulations were started in the doubly bound L4-out conformation, where R682 interacts with D613 and D615 (based on molecule B in the crystal structure). The simulations indicate that the C2 domain induces several dynamic changes in the Ptase domain, as can be seen from root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) throughout the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Not surprisingly, L3 is strongly stabilized due to its direct interaction with the C2 domain. On the other hand, L2 (residues 531–539) and L4 fluctuate stronger in presence of the C2 domain. RMSF analysis separated into different L4 states (R682 unbound, singly or doubly bound) indicate that higher L4 fluctuations occur when L4 is detached from D613/D615 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Non-loop regions fluctuate little overall but fluctuations are increased in a stretch containing helices α5 and α6 and the proximal D613/D615 docking site of R682 (shaded grey in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). Principal component analysis shows as one of the principal motions α5 moving away from α6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> insert, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>). In order to analyze which regions deviate during the simulations most from the doubly bound L4-out starting conformation, we calculated root mean square deviations (RMSD) with respect to the L4-out starting structure, analyzed per residue and averaged over time. We find a significant difference in the region of α5, α6 and the proximal D613/D615, which in the presence of the C2 domain remain closer to the R682 doubly bound starting structure, whereas in absence of the C2 domain this region deviates significantly from the starting conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, also observed in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>). The same RMSD analysis of different L4 states indicates that this occurs specifically in conformations where R682 is singly bound to either D613 or D615 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Interestingly, different α5 helix positions are also observed in the Ptase-C2 crystal structure, confirming its mobility, and in agreement with MD simulations helix α5 is shifted specifically in singly bound R682 conformations by ~1.5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The C2 induced increase of L4 fluctuations when L4 is unbound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) together with stabilized D613/D615 when R682 is singly docked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>) could potentially favor the transition from L4-in to L4-out and might be a reason why the L4-out conformation is only observed in Ptase-C2 crystal structures, but not in Ptase-only or Ptase-C2 FLDD structures.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26640.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>SHIP2 dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) during MD simulations of the Ptase (brown) or Ptase-C2 (blue) are plotted for Cα atoms in the Ptase domain.

While in absence of the C2 domain R682 experiences only brief releases followed by immediate rebinding, in the Ptase-C2 simulation R682 remains fully detached from D613/D615 for ~1 μs of the 4.35 μs simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Indeed, cluster analysis of snapshots from the simulation reveals that for the Ptase alone all of the main clusters remain in a L4-out conformation, whereas for Ptase-C2 the third most populated cluster has R682 detached from D613/D615 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>). Together, these data support a communication between the C2 domain and the active site in the Ptase by modulating the dynamics of helices α5–7 and L4 to facilitate transitions between L4-in and L4-out conformations. Structurally, this suggests a communication via R649, since this residue connects helices α5–7 to the C2 domain.</p><p>To understand how L4 dynamics could affect catalysis, we next analyzed the mode of substrate binding in SHIP2. Co-crystallization experiments using the catalytically inactive SHIP Ptase-C2 D607A mutant with Mg<sup>2+</sup> and substrate failed to reveal clear electron density for the substrate. Therefore we generated a model based on the homologue INPP5B crystal structure containing the PI(4)P product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>) and insights from AP endonucleases, which are thought to share a common phosphate hydrolysis mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whisstock et al., 2002</xref>). We modeled the substrate according to a Michaelis-Menten complex, where all catalytic residues are in place for catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). In this complex the catalytic base D607 stabilizes a water molecule for 5 P attack. According to our model a key 4 P interacting residue is N684 on L4. N684 can adopt two conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>) and needs to point towards the active site to interact with the substrate 4 P, which is seen in unbound or singly bound, but not doubly bound L4 conformations. In our model L4 adopts the L4-in conformation seen in 2 SHIP2 Ptase structures (PDB: 3NR8 and 4A9C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mills et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>). In this conformation R682 is ideally positioned to interact with the 3 P of PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>.

To test this hypothesis, we generated the following mutants along the path: R649A (already generated as an interface mutant), R691A, D613A/D615A, R682A, N684A as well as active site mutants D607A and R665A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). All mutants were generated for Ptase and Ptase-C2 with the exception of R691A and D613A/D615A, which appear to destabilize the isolated Ptase and only yielded soluble protein for Ptase-C2. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis indicates that most of the mutations do not alter protein structure, apart from R691A in Ptase-C2 and N684A in the Ptase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The mutants were tested for changes in activity with IP<sub>4</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-diC8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Interestingly, D613A/D615A mutated Ptase-C2 behaves similar to the R649A mutant, in that both only affect turnover with IP<sub>4</sub>, but have little effect on PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B–C</xref>). This similitude in behavior supports an allosteric communication via R649 and D613/D615. Further, we find that the R682A and N684A mutants have lost most of their activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>; note that for N684A this is also the case for the CD-stable Ptase-C2 form), supporting a key role for these residues in substrate binding via 3 P and 4 P, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). R691 links the Ptase core β-sandwich with helices α5–7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and its mutation inactivates Ptase-C2, which together with the changed CD spectra indicates a structural role for this residue. Unexpectedly, R665A mainly affects the Ptase domain, but has little effect on Ptase-C2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). According to our model, R665 stabilizes a water molecule in the coordination sphere of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This fits with MD simulations showing C2-mediated stabilization of the substrate headgroup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>), apparently making the R665-mediated stabilization dispensable in presence of the C2 domain. Together, these results support an allosteric communication from the C2 domain via R649 and helices α5–7 to L4, which by changing their dynamic behavior affects enzyme kinetics with the IP<sub>4</sub> headgroup. In addition, they support an overall stabilization of the Ptase active site by the C2 domain allowing both substrates to bind in a catalytically productive mode.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26640.024</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>SHIP2 mutational analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Residues mutated in the SHIP2 Ptase domain are shown as sticks and are labeled.

Surprisingly, even though the Ptase domains of PTEN and SHIP2 bear no homology at the sequence or structural level, they conceptually share an important feature in that they are rigidly linked to a C2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 1999</xref>). Despite the low homology between the PTEN and SHIP2 C2 domains (4% identity in a structural alignment) they use a common face for Ptase interactions. Indeed, a corresponding surface is also used by the C2 domain of PLCδ1 to form extensive interactions with its catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Essen et al., 1996</xref>). It appears therefore, that the C2 domain presents an ideal scaffold to dock lipid modifying enzymes onto the membrane and via rigid interactions orient the catalytic domain for productive substrate attack. For SHIP2, we show that the C2 domain is essential for cellular function and the rigid interface enhances its efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Assuming that the SHIP2 C2 domain engages the membrane via motifs known to bind lipids in other C2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho and Stahelin, 2006</xref>) and taking into account several positively charged residues on the Ptase and C2 domains facing the membrane, we provide a model of SHIP2 Ptase-C2 docked to a lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Although, we cannot rule out domain rearrangements between the Ptase and C2 domains upon lipid binding, the extensive domain interface between the two domains argues against large changes and suggests that the Ptase-C2 portion of SHIP2 represent the minimal fully active catalytic unit. Moreover, our model indicates that the rigid Ptase-C2 fragment can bind the membrane and engage substrate without the need of extensive extraction of the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> substrate from the lipid bilayer. In SHIP2, PS binding occurs through both, the C2 and the Ptase domains and, as shown previously, interactions with the Ptase enhance SHIP2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vandeput et al., 2006</xref>). A similar scenario has indeed been observed for PTEN, where regions outside the C2 domain also contribute to membrane interactions and binding of acidic phospholipids to the N-terminus enhances activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walker et al., 2004</xref>). The fact that the PS effect is larger when embedded in vesicles compared to soluble PS-diC8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) suggests that PS mediated SHIP2 localization and/or positioning on vesicles does contribute to activity on lipid membranes, however, binding via the Ptase appears sufficient for this effect.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26640.033</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of SHIP2 catalytic cycle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of SHIP2 Ptase-C2 docked to the membrane and with PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-Mg<sup>2+</sup> bound to the active site.

Top: Docking of Ptase-C2 to the membrane orients via the rigid domain interface the Ptase active site towards its membrane substrate. Step 1: L4 is ‘out’ to allow entry of the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> headgroup. Step 2: Initial engagement of the substrate 4 P with N684 destabilizes the doubly bound L4-out conformation and initiates the switch to L4-in, which allows R682 interactions with the substrate 3 P. L2 opens and penetrates the membrane to interact with PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> lipid chains. Step 3: With the substrate correctly positioned, catalysis proceeds and the cleaved 5 P and the Mg<sup>2+</sup>ion move towards the metal B-site (see text). Step 4: Product interactions are weakened by L4 moving ‘out’, releasing R682 from the product 3 P. Further, N684 releases 4 P interactions by switching to bind H674 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Step 5: The weakly bound product is released and a new substrate can be engaged.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26640.033">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26640.033</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-26640-fig9-v1"/></fig></p><p>Independent to a role in membrane binding, our data suggest that the C2 domain provides important allosteric interdomain effects to increase Ptase activity. In contrast to a traditional concept of allosteric signaling, effects by the C2 domain appear to be transmitted via changes in protein dynamics and active site stabilization rather than large conformational changes. Our data suggest that hydrophobic and polar regions at the Ptase-C2 domain interface differentially affect the lipid chains or head group of the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> substrate. The fact that the R649A mutant, which presumably retains hydrophobic Ptase/C2 interactions, only removes C2 effects on IP<sub>4</sub> but not PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> kinetics, indicates that R649 communicates with the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> headgroup and hydrophobic interactions with PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> lipid chains. Since the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> lipid chains are predicted to interact with L2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), this suggests a communication between hydrophobic C2 interactions and L2.</p><p>Further, our study has identified a specific path of polar connections, linking the C2 domain to the Ptase active site. This ‘polar’ path leads via C2 interactions with R649 in the Ptase to helices α5–7 and at the other end of the helices to D613/D615 and R682 in L4. Mutation of R691 at the interface between helices α5–7 and the Ptase core inactivates SHIP likely due to structural destabilization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and similar inactivating mutations at this interface have been associated with opsismodysplasia (P659S and W688C) and protection from diabetes (L632I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kagawa et al., 2005</xref>). More specific disruption of this path, by either R649A or D613A/D615A mutations specifically removes C2 effects on IP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B–C</xref>). In a cellular setting this path could be relevant, firstly for SHIP2 activity on intracellular IP<sub>4</sub>, whose cellular roles are only emerging for example in T-cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang and Sauer, 2010</xref>). Secondly, it is likely also important when the SHIP2 enzyme approaches the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> substrate in membranes with the lipid chains buried in the lipid bilayer.</p><p>A critical observation in our study is that L4, proximal to the active site, can switch between a closed (L4-in) and an open (L4-out) conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>) and our simulations indicate that the dynamics of this loop and the region capturing the loop in the open conformation is altered by the C2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We propose a catalytic cycle for SHIP2 where efficient opening and closing of L4 is important for high turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>): To initiate the cycle, L4 needs to open to allow substrate entry to the active site. Initial interactions of the PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> head group include 4 P binding to N684, which prevents the formation of a hydrogen bond network seen in the R682 doubly bound L4-out conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). With this hydrogen network disrupted L4 is more mobile (see e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) facilitating the switch to L4-in. We propose closure of L4 over the substrate as an important second step in catalysis, allowing R682 interactions with the substrate 3 P. With the substrate tightly bound and correctly positioned, catalysis proceeds. Once 5 P cleavage has occurred we propose that L4 needs to open again for product release. In absence of 3 P and 5 P interactions, reestablishment of the hydrogen network as seen in the R682 doubly bound L4-out conformation that orients the N684 sidechain towards H674 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), might aid ejection of the product, hence closing the catalytic cycle.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media5" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-26640-media5.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26640.034</object-id><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>The SHIP2 catalytic cycle.</title><p>The conformational changes between L4-out doubly bound, L4-out singly bound and L4-in conformations are shown as morphs between observed crystal structures and assembled in sequence according to the model of the catalytic cycle explained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26640.034">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26640.034</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>It has been previously proposed that the 3 P specificity of SHIP2 is conferred by R682 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>). Our model shows that R682 in the L4-in conformation is well placed to interact with the 3 P of PI(3,4,5)P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and mutation of R682 confirms an important role for this residue in catalysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). In other 5-Ptases the loop corresponding to L4 is significantly shorter and residues corresponding to R682 (K516 in INPP5B) and N684 (R518 in INPP5B) on L4 interact with the 4 P and belong to a set of residues defined as the P4 interacting motif (P4IM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>). Possibly, R682 in SHIP2 might also contribute to 4 P interactions, which could account for the observed PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> activity of SHIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elong Edimo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakatsu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>), however, several reports demonstrate a clear preference for PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pesesse et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vandeput et al., 2007</xref>). Another difference in SHIP2 is the somewhat weaker Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordination compared to other 5-Ptases. An asparagine in INPP5B (N275) providing a Mg<sup>2+</sup>coordination is replaced by a glycine in SHIP2 (G434) and the coordination is likely provided by a water molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This water can be stabilized by R665, which appears important only in absence of active site stabilization by the C2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Other head group interactions are conserved among 5-Ptases and the mechanism initiating 5 P attack is well described and shared among 5-Ptases as well as the AP endonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dlakić, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Whisstock et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">2002</xref>). However, the exact mechanism of catalysis is still being debated. Different models have for AP nucleases proposed the involvement of either one or two static, or one moving metal ion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beernink et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mol et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oezguen et al., 2007</xref>). A 2-metal hypothesis for AP nucleases is supported by a crystal structure of APE1, which has two Pb<sup>2+</sup> ions bound 5 Å apart from each other, with one ion at the site seen in 5-Ptases (A-site) and the other at a more buried site (B-site) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beernink et al., 2001</xref>). Similar to a recent structure of INPP5B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mills et al., 2016</xref>), we observe in our Ptase-C2 D607A structure the Mg<sup>2+</sup> displaced on average by 1.3 Å from the A towards the B-site and a phosphate group shifted by 1.7 Å from the 5 P location towards the attacking water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mills et al. (2016)</xref> this likely represents the post-cleavage position for Mg<sup>2+</sup> and the 5 P, since there is no longer space for the attacking water. In contrast, for OCRL a free phosphate is observed at the pre-cleaved 5 P site and the Mg<sup>2+</sup> at the A-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trésaugues et al., 2014</xref>), hence there appear to be subtle differences in the post-cleavage positioning of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate for different 5-Ptases. We note that the movement of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> seen in INPP5B and SHIP2 from the A towards the B-site is opposite to the B to A-site movement proposed to occur during catalysis in AP nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oezguen et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>SHIP1 shares an overall 45% sequence identity with SHIP2 (65% within the 5-Ptase and 43% in the C2 domain), suggesting that many of the mechanisms described here are conserved among the two enzymes. Residues at the Ptase-C2 domain interface are mostly conserved, suggesting that the interface as well as a possible communication to L2, which is fully conserved, are also present in SHIP1. The polar path is partially conserved with R649 replaced in SHIP1 by H632, D613/D615 are with D593 and E598 similar and R682 is substituted by K665. The equal length of L4 suggests that it will be able to sample a similar space and likely K665 provides the 3 P specificity in SHIP1.</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides important insights into how the C2 domain assists SHIP2 catalysis via a combination of membrane positioning, active site stabilization and allosteric signaling, which together is crucial for efficient cellular functioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Since SHIP enzymes are highly implicated in disease, this will likely aid the design of novel strategies to target SHIP enzymes with high specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The experimental details regarding the cloning, expression and purification of human SHIP2 Ptase-C2 have been described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Le Coq et al., 2016</xref>).

The size of the simulation cell was chosen such that a distance of at least 10 Å between the surface of the protein and the cell boundaries was maintained. The systems were neutralized with Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup>. All calculations were carried out with periodic boundary conditions. All complexes were minimized in three stages. In the first stage, the water molecules and the ions were energy minimized, while harmonic restraints of 1000 kJ/(mol·nm<sup>2</sup>) were applied to the protein and the lipid; 500 steps of steepest descent and 500 steps of conjugate gradient minimization were carried out. In the second stage the lipid harmonic restrains were removed and another 500 steps of minimization were carried out. In the last stage, all restrains were removed and the entire system was minimized for 2000 steps. The resulting configurations were used for MD production: the lipid systems were simulated for a total of 300 ns each, and the non-lipid simulations for 3 × 1.5 μs each (three independent simulations for each system).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Evzen Boura (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Previous work has established the structure of the SHIP2 phosphatase domain and its relationship with other members of the 5-phosphatase family. This manuscript has established the structure of a pptase-C2 domain construct and examined the role of the C2 domain in catalysis. The current study represents a significant advance in understanding SHIP2. The structure shows that the C2 domain makes an extensive interaction surface with the phosphatase domain. A similar interaction of the C2 domain with the catalytic domain has been observed in other lipid-modifying enzymes, such as PLCδ1 and PTEN. The manuscript establishes that the C2 domain acts as an allosteric activator by stabilising the pptase domain and contributing to membrane binding. The manuscript outlines two distinct pathways of stabilisation contributing to the effect of the C2 domain, a polar pathway manifest on activity with the soluble substrate IP4 and a hydrophobic pathway that specifically affects interactions with the acyl chains of PIP3.</p><p>The combination of structures and molecular dynamics provides a compelling model for the catalytic cycle of SHIP2 encountering substrate in lipid membranes, with the L4 loop changing conformation between an initial encounter state and a state in which substrate is engaged in the active site. This is an important contribution to our understanding of this family of enzymes. It also provides a detailed picture of how the C2 domain of SHIP2 participates in membrane binding and catalysis.</p><p>Several points made by the reviewers (see below) should be taken into account in the revised manuscript. The reviewers have found the allosteric mechanism for the effect of the C2 domain based on crystallography and MD are convincing, but it would be helpful if you could provide a movie that portrays this mechanism. In the revision, you should take account of the suggestions by the reviewers, in particular, in the discussion of an effect on k<sub>cat</sub> and K<sub>M</sub> as being indicative of allostery (reviewer 1).</p><p>An important concern that has been raised by the reviewers is that the lipid blot demonstration of lipid affinity is not adequate for the work. These blots are subject to a range of artifacts. It would be better if you could measure the affinity using lipid vesicles and the FRET assay suggested by reviewer 3. This assay has been described by a number of workers (see, for example, PMID 22949682). Also, the methods should be revised to make clear exactly what lipids are being used and how the lipids are prepared for the assay. While the reviewers believe that assays with substrate in lipid vesicles would be an informative addition to the manuscript, it may be that this is beyond the scope of the present work, and this should not be regarded as essential.</p><p>In an earlier study of several phosphatases (Nordlund and colleagues), the L4 loop of SHIP2 was referred to as the P4-interacting motif (P4IM). It would be helpful for readers familiar with the previous study if the current manuscript also at least mentions this nomenclature.</p><p>It is claimed at the end of the manuscript that the cellular assays presented show that the C2 domain has an additional role, likely in membrane localization. This statement should be clarified, or if the statement is not based on the results, this should be explained.</p><p>The manuscript claims that &quot;both, the Ptase and C2 domains of SHIP2 bind PS in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent manner&quot; This is misleading. The C2 domain on its own was never tested. It could be that the interaction depends entirely on the pptase domain, but that the pptase is only oriented and stabilised by the C2 domain. The statement consistent with the results would be &quot;both the Ptase only and the Ptase-C2 constructs bind PS in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner.&quot;</p><p>Common membrane-binding mechanisms are asp/glu residues binding Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which in turn binds to membranes or lys/arg residues that bind directly to the negatively charged lipids. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows that the SHP2 residues in the key positions are ser or asp/glu residues, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows that Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not affect binding. It would be helpful if you briefly discuss this point.</p><p>For assistance to color blind readers, it would be helpful if the explanatory keys in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are placed next to the curve that they describe, or that there is a line between the curve and the key. There are shapes for markers on the curves in the figure, but these are typically small in the final version and may not be clear on their own.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, since the ratio pAkt/Akt is not the directly observed quantity, the manuscript should make clear how the errors in this ratio were determined. Error propagation in the ratio based on the standard deviations of the two observed quantities should have been carried out. The reviewers are concerned that differences in activity are complicated by differences in expression. To allay these concerns, the statistical methods should be described in the Materials and methods.</p><p>The WT X-ray dataset appears to be the same data set that was described in the earlier crystallisation report, however, the I/σ and highest resolution shell limits are not the same. It appears that the data have been reprocessed, and this is not surprising. However, it should be made clear how the resolution limits were chosen. Since the I/σ for the highest-resolution shells differ for the various datasets, it does not seem that this was the decisive criterion. The correlation coefficients cc1/2 and cc* have been proposed as a criterion to help make resolution cutoff in a statistically reliable manner. The table should also include cc1/2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Previous work has established the structure of the SHIP2 phosphatase domain and its relationship with other members of the 5-phosphatase family. The current study by Lietha and colleagues has established the structure of pptase-C2 domain construct and examined the role of the C2 domain in catalysis. A previous report by the same group described crystallisation and diffraction of the pptase-C2 construct and demonstrated its enzymatic activity. The current study represents a significant advance in understanding this enzyme. The structure shows that the C2 domain makes an extensive interaction surface with the phosphatase domain. A similar interaction of the C2 domain with the catalytic domain has been observed in other lipid-modifying enzymes, such as PLCδ1 and PTEN. The authors establish that the C2 domain acts as an allosteric activator by stabilising the pptase domain and contributing to membrane binding. The authors are suggesting two distinct pathways of stabilisation contributing to the effect of the C2 domain, a polar pathway manifest on activity with the soluble substrate IP4 and a hydrophobic pathway that specifically affects interactions with the acyl chains of PIP3.</p><p>The study provides a compelling model for the catalytic cycle of SHIP2 encountering substrate in lipid membranes, with the L4 loop changing conformation between an initial encounter state and a state in which substrate is engaged in the active site. This is an important contribution to our understanding of this family of enzymes. It also provides a detailed picture of how the C2 domain of SHIP2 participates in membrane binding and catalysis. This is particularly useful, since a similar catalytic domain/C2 module is present in other lipid-modifying enzymes.</p><p>In a previous study by Nordlund and colleagues, structures of SHIP2, OCRL, and INPP5B pptase domains were determined and compared. In this previous study, it was shown that a motif referred to as the P4-interacting motif (P4IM) interacts with 3- and 4-phosphates of the substrates. In the manuscript of Lietha and colleagues, the same feature is referred to as loop L4. To simplify things for the readers, it would be helpful if the authors of the current manuscript use the P4IM notation or at least point out that this is contained in L4. The presence of the C2 domain results in a large change in the conformation of the L4 loop, and the authors propose that this change likely constitutes an important component of the catalytic cycle of SHIP2 on membranes.</p><p>In the first paragraph of the subsection “The C2 domain affects SHIP2 activity” it states that changing k<sub>cat</sub> without much change in K<sub>M</sub> suggests that the activation is allosteric. The most common definition of allosteric is an effect on activity due to interaction outside the catalytic site. This can be an effect on K<sub>M</sub> (K-type allostery), or it can be an effect on V<sub>max</sub> (V-type), or come combination of these. However, simply an effect on k<sub>cat</sub> does not suggest an influence directed from outside the active site. A k<sub>cat</sub>-only effect could be obtained by forming additional interactions with the transition state, but not with the substrate, but this would not be an allosteric effect. What the authors mean is that if the C2 domain has any influence at all, it must be allosteric, since the C2 domain is not near the active site. This should be restated. There is also a grammatic problem with the sentence in its current form (should be &quot;suggests&quot; instead of &quot;suggesting&quot;).</p><p>In the last paragraph of the subsection “The C2 domain affects SHIP2 activity”, describing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, it is not clear what the authors have done in the experiments that they describe as adding &quot;PC&quot; and &quot;PS&quot;. What exactly are the lipids that they have used? If they are synthetic, they should state what the acyl chains are. If they are from a natural source, they should quote the dominant component of the source. It is particularly important the length and saturation of the acyl chains. Also, there is no description of how the lipid substrates were presented. Were they prepared as unilamellar vesicles? Were the multilammelar vesicles? Were they SUVS? LUVS? GUVS? The reason that this is important is that the authors are using a di-C8 PIP3 lipid that is soluble on its own, so it is not clear that this lipid would effectively and completely partition into membranes of lipid vesicles. If the lipid substrate is both in the bulk phase and in the membranes, it makes interpretation of the results more complex. Ideally, it would be helpful if the authors had used long-chain PIP3 incorporated into unilamellar vesicles for at least some of their assays, in order to strengthen their conclusions for the behavior of SHIP2 in cells.</p><p>In the aforementioned paragraph, it is proposed that PS orients the enzyme on PIP3-containing membranes.

In this previous study, it was shown that a motif referred to as the P4-interacting motif (P4IM) interacts with 3- and 4-phosphates of the substrates. In the manuscript of Lietha and colleagues, the same feature is referred to as loop L4. To simplify things for the readers, it would be helpful if the authors of the current manuscript use the P4IM notation or at least point out that this is contained in L4. The presence of the C2 domain results in a large change in the conformation of the L4 loop, and the authors propose that this change likely constitutes an important component of the catalytic cycle of SHIP2 on membranes.</italic></p><p>In Tresaugues et al. (2014) the P4-interacting-motif (P4IM) is defined to be composed of the INPP5B residues Tyr502, Lys503, Arg518, and Lys516. Of these, only Arg518 (Asn684 in SHIP2) and Lys516 (Arg682 in SHIP2) are contained within loop L4. As suggested we point out that residues Asn684 and Arg682 in SHIP2 correspond to residues in the P4IM (Discussion, fifth paragraph). However, since 2 residues of the P4IM are located outside L4 and because Arg682 in SHIP2 likely has an important role in P3 substrate interactions, we believe it would be misleading to use the P4IM terminology in SHIP throughout the manuscript.</p><p><italic>In the first paragraph of the subsection “The C2 domain affects SHIP2 activity” it states that changing k<sub>cat</sub> without much change in K<sub>M</sub> suggests that the activation is allosteric. The most common definition of allosteric is an effect on activity due to interaction outside the catalytic site. This can be an effect on K<sub>M</sub> (K-type allostery), or it can be an effect on V<sub>max</sub> (V-type), or come combination of these. However, simply an effect on k<sub>cat</sub> does not suggest an influence directed from outside the active site. A k<sub>cat</sub>-only effect could be obtained by forming additional interactions with the transition state, but not with the substrate, but this would not be an allosteric effect. What the authors mean is that if the C2 domain has any influence at all, it must be allosteric, since the C2 domain is not near the active site. This should be restated. There is also a grammatic problem with the sentence in its current form (should be &quot;suggests&quot; instead of &quot;suggesting&quot;).</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.

What exactly are the lipids that they have used? If they are synthetic, they should state what the acyl chains are. If they are from a natural source, they should quote the dominant component of the source. It is particularly important the length and saturation of the acyl chains. Also, there is no description of how the lipid substrates were presented. Were they prepared as unilamellar vesicles? Were the multilammelar vesicles? Were they SUVS? LUVS? GUVS? The reason that this is important is that the authors are using a di-C8 PIP3 lipid that is soluble on its own, so it is not clear that this lipid would effectively and completely partition into membranes of lipid vesicles. If the lipid substrate is both in the bulk phase and in the membranes, it makes interpretation of the results more complex.</italic></p><p>We apologize for not specifying the type of lipids used.

The new data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-D</xref> and show that the C2 domain also enhances activity of SHIP in vesicles and this effect is abrogated by FLDD interface mutants.

Nevertheless, it is correct that native SHIP levels appear low and the transfected constructs are strongly overexpressed.</p><p>Regarding the limited decrease in pAkt, we believe there could be several reasons explaining this behavior. As described in the Introduction, the effect of SHIP on Akt phosphorylation is complex and likely depends on several other factors, including: 1) Whether the SHIP product PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> is efficiently further degraded to PI(3)P (since PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> has still partial activity towards Akt); 2) What the relative contributions are of SHIP and PTEN in PIP3 degradation under the chosen condition and cellular context and how these activities compare to PI3K activity generating PIP3; 3) How efficiently is the overexpressed SHIP2 targeted to the membrane under the experimental conditions? We believe any of these factors could cause a limited effect of the expressed SHIP proteins on reducing Akt phosphorylation.</p><p><italic>Second, the deletion of the C2 domain clearly reduces activity, but the FLDD mutation has only a minute affect, which they say is statistically significant.

However, in our case dividing by total Akt is a “normalization” of the phospho-Akt signal and only the ratio is expected to have similar values, not necessarily the individual values.

Nevertheless, after 8 triplicate experiments (n=24), our results do still show significance between WT and FLDD mutants. Taking all experiments together the total SHIP expression levels are no longer smaller for the FLDD mutant (actually slightly higher, but without significance), making it unlikely that differences in pAkt levels are due to different SHIP expression levels.

As a result, this assay is not suitable to measure SHIP interactions with PS vesicles.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26640.036</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Tryptophan-dansyl FRET assay.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Emission scan resulting from excitation at 280nm of dansyl vesicles alone (blue trace) or vesicles in presence of SHIP2 Ptase (red trace).

These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-D</xref> of the revised manuscript and the lipid blot data is now presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. Shown are SPR responses resulting from differences between the active flow cell coated with 30% (mol/mol) PS vesicles and the reference flow cell containing 100% PC vesicles. These data confirm a stronger interaction with Ptase-C2 comparted to the isolated Ptase, although the difference is smaller compared to PLO experiments. Unfortunately, we were not able to extract dissociation constants or kinetic k<sub>on</sub>/k<sub>off</sub> values from SPR sensorgrams. Binding and dissociation appear to follow non-trivial kinetics, which we were not able to fit with standard models. On the other hand, plotting steady-state values versus protein concentration suggests that K<sub>D</sub> values are significantly above the highest protein concentration used (10µM).</p><p>Injecting higher protein concentrations caused irreversible deposition of protein on the surface making responses unreliable. Interestingly, using injections at 5 µM protein we detected a weak but significant effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> only with Ptase-C2, increasing the binding by ~10%. We do not claim that this modest effect is biologically significant, but as discussed in the subsection “The C2 domain of SHIP2”, this effect might result from the low conservation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding residues in CBL1 and 3 of the SHIP2 C2 domain.</p><p><italic>2) Biochemical (enzymatic) analysis is done using soluble substrates only.

These data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-D</xref> of the revised manuscript. The data show that the C2 domain also promotes SHIP2 activity on vesicles and this effect is removed by the FLDD interface mutants. We further show that PS in vesicles promotes SHIP activity in an independent and additive manner to the C2 effect.</p></body></sub-article></article>
