Hematopoietic stem cells emerge during development, from vascular components, via a process called the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT). Here, we reveal essential biomechanical features of the EHT, using the zebrafish embryo imaged at unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution and an algorithm to unwrap the aorta into 2D-cartography. We show that the transition involves anisotropic contraction along the antero-posterior axis, with heterogenous organization of contractile circumferential actomyosin. The biomechanics of the contraction is oscillatory, with unusually long periods in comparison to other apical constriction mechanisms described so far in morphogenesis, and is supported by the anisotropic reinforcement of junctional contacts. Finally, we show that abrogation of blood flow impairs the actin cytoskeleton, the morphodynamics of EHT cells, and the orientation of the emergence. Overall, our results underline the peculiarities of the EHT biomechanics and the influence of the mechanical forces exerted by blood flow.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37355.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As humans, we have two major types of blood cell: our red blood cells transport oxygen around the body, while our white blood cells fight disease. Both types of cell come from the same stem cells, which first appear early in embryonic development. These stem cells emerge from the walls of major blood vessels, including the aorta – which carries blood from the heart.</p><p>Stem cells have not yet decided which adult cell to become. Given the right signals, blood stem cells can form red blood cells or any of the different types of white blood cell. Understanding this process could allow scientists to recreate it in the laboratory, making blood stem cells that can give rise to all blood cells found in the body. But, this is not yet possible because we do not know all the conditions needed to make the cells and ensure they survive. One crucial gap in our understanding concerns the importance of blood flow. As the main blood vessel leaving the heart, the aorta experiences mechanical stress every time the heart beats. Lancino et al. wanted to find out whether this influences the development of the blood stem cells.</p><p>Zebrafish embryos are transparent, making it easy to see their bodies developing under a microscope. Like humans, they also produce both red blood cells and white blood cells meaning Lancino et al. could watch the birth of blood stem cells in these embryos from a part of the aorta called the aortic floor. A new software tool unwrapped pictures of the tube-shaped blood vessel into flat, two-dimensional maps, making it possible to see how the aorta changed over time. This revealed that, as blood stem cells leave the aortic floor, they bend and contract with the direction of the blood flow. Rings of actin and myosin proteins that formed around the stem cells as they are born helped the process along, while stopping the heartbeat changed the way the blood cells emerged. Without any blood flow, the actin proteins did not assemble properly; the stem cells also emerged in the wrong direction and some of them even died.</p><p>These findings show that physical forces play a role in the formation of blood stem cells. Understanding this process brings scientists a step closer to recreating the conditions for making different kinds of blood cells outside of the body.</p></abstract><kwd-group

to the genesis of all blood lineages throughout life. Currently, producing full-potential hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vitro remains a challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yvernogeau et al., 2016</xref>), in particular for regenerative purposes. This points to the relevance of reinforcing the fundamental knowledge of the process as it occurs in vivo.</p><p>HSCs with long-term replenishment potential are formed in the embryo according to a genetic program highly conserved between vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciau-Uitz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciau-Uitz and Patient, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaffredo and Yvernogeau, 2014</xref>). HSCs emerge during the so-called definitive wave of hematopoiesis, from vascular components, in particular the ventral floor of the dorsal aorta, in the aorta-gonad mesonephros (AGM) region as well as from the umbilical and vitelline arteries in mammals.</p><p>The zebrafish has proven to be an extremely valuable model for studying the developmental aspects of hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frame et al., 2017</xref>); the combination of cell tracing and live-imaging have notably allowed to trace the migration of definitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to successive hematopoietic organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kissa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murayama et al., 2006</xref>). Real-time in vivo imaging also established unambiguously the aortic origin of definitive HSPCs, that were visualized emerging as single cells directly from the hemogenic endothelium in the floor of the dorsal aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertrand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kissa and Herbomel, 2010</xref>). This very unique type of cell emergence, called the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT), is characterized by an unusual bending of the cell that increases while the emergence is progressing, and so until the exit from the vascular wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kissa and Herbomel, 2010</xref>). The process was also described ex vivo in slices of mouse embryos, although at a lower resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boisset et al., 2010</xref>). An apparent difference between zebrafish and mouse is the direction of the emergence, with HSPCs extruding into the sub-aortic space in the former and into the aortic lumen in the latter (where they initiate the so-called intra-aortic clusters). The reasons for such a difference are currently unknown and may relate to different biophysical constraints of the aortic and sub-aortic environments in either species.</p><p>The vascular and aortic systems have very unique characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aird, 2012</xref>). They are constituted by extremely flat endothelial cells with luminal/apical and basal membranes having virtually equal surfaces (a so-called squamous epithelium) and organized around a lumen filled with blood cells and fluid, and exposed to high mechanical loading, including shear stress exerted on the surface of endothelial cells as well as circumferential wall stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu and Kassab, 2011</xref>). Blood flow also appears to regulate endothelial cell fates in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">García-Cardeña and Slegtenhorst, 2016</xref>) and, in regard to hematopoiesis, to have an influence on the expression of key transcription factors such as Runx1, the transcription factor essential for hematopoiesis, both in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamo et al., 2009</xref>) and in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">North et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, comprehending the fundamental mechanisms of HSC emergence requires taking into account the peculiarities of the vascular environment and the mechanical constraints.</p><p>The EHT allows single live cells to leave a squamous epithelium without perturbing its integrity. Most other cell extrusion processes that have been described concern thick, columnar/cuboidal epithelia, and among them, only the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lamouille et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nieto et al., 2016</xref>]) gives rise to live wandering cells endowed with a new potential, as the EHT does. Hence, in order to specify further the peculiarities of the EHT and to be able to establish comparisons with the other cell extrusion processes described so far, we delved deeper into the process, taking the vascular environment into account. To do so, we developed a novel algorithm allowing the deployment of the aortic wall into high-resolution 2D-cartographies and 2D-time-lapse sequences. We also addressed the influence of blood flow on the EHT morphodynamics by abrogating heart beating. This led us to uncover some of the key and unique features of the EHT (and to draw a comprehensive model of its main steps) and identify the contribution of some of the essential molecular components involved in the morphological changes accompanying the emergence. Further, our analysis brought insight into the dynamic interplay between cells undergoing EHT and adjoining endothelial cells and pointed to the essential role of blood flow in HSCs emergence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EHT dynamics at high spatio-temporal resolution</title><p>In order to unravel the critical biomechanical features of the EHT, we performed confocal live-imaging at high spatio-temporal resolution. In comparison to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kissa and Herbomel, 2010</xref>), we improved the spatial resolution of our time-lapse (TL) sequences by reducing the distance between the sequential optical planes (0.43 μm instead of 2 or 0.60 μm) and improved the temporal resolution by reducing the 5 min intervals between Z-stacks acquisitions down to 2 min when performing spinning-disk confocal imaging. We imaged the dorsal aorta (DA) of transgenic zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), starting at 48 hpf (corresponding to the timing at which the EHT process is culminating, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kissa and Herbomel, 2010</xref>), until 72 hpf. We noticed that the angles of emergence of EHT undergoing cells (hereafter designated as 'EHT cells') varied between approximately 0–45° from the dorso-ventral axis of the DA and 0–45° from its antero-posterior (A-P) axis. In general, the most valuable information was obtained from cells for which the two most distant poles were parallel to the A-P axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We initiated the study using <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>kdrl:Ras-mCherry; kdrl:eGFP)</italic> fish so as to visualize cellular membranes as well as the cytoplasmic volume. As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kissa and Herbomel, 2010</xref>), the morphological criterion allowing unambiguous identification of cells having initiated the EHT is their cup-shaped morphology, with bending toward the sub-aortic space. Hence, many of our TL sequences were initiated at this stage, increasing chances to image completion of the process and minimizing the risk of phototoxicity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> for a 3D-rendering view, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). Ras-mCherry allowed visualizing the luminal and basal membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), revealing that the latter underwent more or less extensive blebbing at the cup-shaped stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,I</xref>). This blebbing preceded the protrusion of large membrane extensions that were formed hours before the cell exit and were reminiscent of cell shape changes occuring during amoeboid migration (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). Finally, at the end of the process, Ras-mCherry delineated a transient narrow membrane foot that remained connected to the aorta floor and preceded release in the sub-aortic space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G and L</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37355.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sequential steps and morphological changes during the EHT</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) The EHT is variable in space and time.

We also imaged the initial phase of the cell bending, starting from a flat-shaped to the cup-shaped stage in order to determine the time required to reach the latter. We followed a limited amount of cells because, in addition to increasing the risk of phototoxicity owing to long hours of laser exposure, it is currently impossible to determine the precise starting point at which EHT committed cells, engulfed in the hemogenic endothelium, will initiate the emergence (hence hampering the precise determination of EHT initiation and duration). The time intervals between the flat morphology to the cup-shaped stage were also very variable, with an average of 6.5 hr (n = 7, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, left panel and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">Figure 1—video 3</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to quantify the progression of the process, starting from the cup-shaped stage, we manually measured through time the distance between the anterior and posterior poles of the EHT cell (within the plane of the aortic wall), which we will refer to as the A-P luminal distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Firstly, we found little correlation between the A-P luminal distance at the beginning of our imaging and the time of exit of the EHT cell (the longest A-P luminal distances did not imply the longest times-to-exit, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Secondly, we noticed that the narrowing down of the A-P luminal distance did not occur at a uniform pace, but with phases of contraction and of relative stabilization of variable durations taking place in the limit of an A-P luminal distance of approximately 2 µm, followed by steep decrease until the release of the cell (this fast drop may represent a collapse following the culmination of mechanical tensions). Hence, the heterogeneous duration of the EHT might be explained by these discontinuities, but the reason for this is unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Intercellular junctions and apical constriction of EHT cells are anisotropic</title><p>A specific feature of the EHT is that EHT cells maintain contact with their endothelial neighbors until the very end of the process.

This complemented, with a higher spatio-temporal resolution, our results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> on the variability of the temporal course of the EHT process per se and led to two main conclusions. Firstly, the spots of eGFP-ZO1 high density at the two opposite poles of the EHT cell moved mainly along the A-P axis, often with an imbalance of migration distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and legend). Secondly and importantly, the distance between the two eGFP-ZO1 high-density regions decreased non-uniformly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), with phases of contraction and relative stabilization (already visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> and better resolved spatio-temporally here owing to semi-automatic tracking, see Materials and methods). The successive phases of contraction and stabilization are characterized by oscillations of the closing speed of relatively homogenous periodicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>), each oscillation resulting from acceleration and deceleration phases. The oscillations taking place during the contraction phases are the largest in amplitude and are interspersed by short periods of time during which the progression of the A-P distance reaches a minimum (referred to as pseudo-plateaus, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This oscillatory behavior of the apical constriction is reminiscent of the pulsatile/oscillatory behavior observed in several morphogenetic events during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levayer and Lecuit, 2012</xref>), although with significant differences in the biomechanical parameters of these oscillations (see Discussion).</p><p>We then thought of investigating more systematically the localization of eGFP-ZO1 in junctional regions across the entire aortic wall, as well as using the delineation of cell contours by this reporter to study in detail the EHT cellular landscape, notably the morphology of EHT cells and adjoining endothelial ones. Precise morphological information on the aortic cellular landscape is difficult to extract from Z projections or 3D views, and projections mask structures in the medial Z planes and distort distances. This prompted us to develop a specialized software tool able to unwrap the signal of the roughly cylindrical cell layer of the aorta onto a plane (2D plane images will be referred to as 2D-maps thereafter). This software allows the treatment of information through time, taking into account heterogeneities and variations in the shape of the aorta along its axis using semi-automatic adjustment of the surface (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and Materials and methods for details).

The 2D-map algorithm revealed F-actin enrichment at contacting surfaces that are more or less perpendicular to the blood flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, bottom panels). This localization is very similar to what we observed with eGFP-ZO1, suggesting that F-actin contributes to the organization of sub-junctional regions and perhaps the stabilization of junctional complexes that are, as proposed before, the most exposed to mechanical tension. In addition, the data also support the idea that the apical constriction of EHT cells requires the contractile activity of a circumferential actomyosin belt.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37355.017</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Actin localization and dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Lifeact-eGFP expressing 48 hpf embryos were imaged by spinning-disk confocal microscopy to obtain maximum projections of Z-planes (A, top and B), single Z planes (A, middle), or 2D-map projections (A, bottom; note that cells #2 and #3 are from the same aorta; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

The involvement of blood flow in hematopoiesis was initially shown in seminal work in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">North et al., 2009</xref>) in which the abrogation of heart beating and blood circulation impaired arterial identity and HSC formation (using the silent heart (sih) mutant of cardiac troponin T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sehnert et al., 2002</xref>]). Hence, to question the involvement of hemodynamic forces on the cytoskeleton of hemogenic cells and, more broadly, the dynamics of HSC emergence, we interfered with heart beating using a sih morpholino (injected in <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>kdrl:Ras-mCherry; kdrl:Lifeact-eGFP)</italic> embryos to visualize F-actin and cellular membranes). We observed, in addition to major alterations in the morphology of the dorsal aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), the recurrent absence of EHT cells with cup-shaped morphology and emerging toward the sub-aortic space (14 embryos injected with the sih morpholino were carefully analysed, all along the dorsal aortic wall). Rather, the aortic floor was decorated with ovoid cells, with their luminal/apical membrane protruding into the lumen of the aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The lumen also contained cells labelled with Lifeact-eGFP and Ras-mCherry (hence from vascular origin and supposedly having performed their extrusion from the surrounding aortic wall since circulation is abrogated and cells in the aortic lumen do not migrate extensively in comparison to cells in the sub-aortic space, see <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref> for Z-sectioning of the aorta and visualization of the content of the aortic lumen). TL sequences performed in the trunk region revealed that the ovoid cells in the aortic floor do undergo mitosis and are able to emerge either toward the sub-aortic space or, more unexpectedly, toward the aortic lumen (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>, right), which we never saw in the control condition (this intra-aortic emergence was observed in 3/3 movies obtained from three independent injection experiments). Interestingly, in one of our TL sequences (1/3, the longest TL sequence that lasted 13.30 hr), two of the released cells ended up bursting into pieces (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>, left), suggesting that cells released in the absence of mechanical constraints exerted by blood flow are prone to cell death. This is consistent with previous studies showing a reduction in the number of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors upon sih morpholino treatment (in particular in the caudal hematopoietic tissue, see Murayama et al., 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murayama et al.

They also suggest that the biomechanics of the emergence may impact downstream cellular functions and/or commitments that, if not fulfilled, impede cell survival. Interestingly, when heart beating and blood flow were temporarily arrested using tricaine methanesulfonate (at 1 mg/ml), the inward bending of the apical/luminal membrane was not observed anymore and cells performing the emergence toward the sub-aortic space maintained their path (10 embryos were observed, all along the dorsal aortic wall, between a time window of 35–135 min after interruption of blood flow, data not shown). This result strongly supports the idea that components of hemodynamic forces (among which the mechanical strain, the force perpendicular to the flow axis acting on the vascular wall) are exerting a direct action on the apical/luminal membrane bending.</p><p>Finally, we also investigated the effect of obliterating blood flow on F-actin and ZO1 organization. We managed to obtain reasonably good images after 2D-maping with the <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>kdrl:Ras-mCherry; kdrl:Lifeact-eGFP)</italic> fish line, although with difficulties because of the strong distortion of the aortic shape in the sih embryos. Images clearly revealed a perturbation of F-actin organization in EHT cells, with little reinforcement of that staining at the antero-posterior poles of the cells in comparison to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, bottom panels). Unfortunately, in the case of eGFP-ZO1, fluorescence signals in the sub-cortical regions of hemogenic cells were too low and aorta too distorted to perform 2D-maping. However, 3D-projections and 3D-analysis with the Imaris software also revealed changes in eGFP-ZO1 localization in cells of the hemogenic endothelium, with altered recruitment at the sub-plasmalemmal level and apparent increase of the eGFP-ZO1 cytoplasmic pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and see <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video3">Figure 6—video 3</xref> for 3D-Imaris rendering).

Hence, phosphorylation of this amino-terminal site inhibits myosin activity and actomyosin contraction.</p><p>We mutagenized the Myl9b cDNA to substitute the two amino-terminal serine residues by alanines, and expressed the wt or mutant form (Myl9bA2A3) fused to eGFP in zebrafish embryos by transient transgenesis. Expression of the mutant form using the kdrl promoter caused mild morphological alterations of the dorsal vascular system (with maintenance of blood flow, no obvious change in the shape of the dorsal aorta and a few distortions at the base of intersegmental vessels, data not shown). To restrict the expression of Myl9bA2A3 or the wt form to aorta-derived HSPCs, we used the Runx’1 + 23’ enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tamplin et al., 2015</xref>), which we confirmed to drive transient expression specifically in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These results suggest that preventing N-terminal phosphorylation impairs definitive hematopoiesis and may interfere with the emergence from the aortic floor. Finally, we performed live imaging in this context, and made a series of observations. Firstly, while we occasionally found hemogenic cells in the aortic floor that expressed the wt Myl9b-eGFP and underwent EHT, we were unable to find such cells upon expressing Myl9bA2A3-eGFP, suggesting that the latter cells emerged at a significantly lesser frequency. Secondly, cellular fragments were often seen in the sub-aortic area, usually indicative of cell bursting. This cell fragmentation may have occurred during the EHT as described upon <italic>runx1</italic> knock-down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kissa and Herbomel, 2010</xref>), or in EHT-derived HSPCs as upon scl-α knock-down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhen et al., 2013</xref>).

It strengthens the idea that the process is indeed very unique when compared to other single cell extrusion or delamination processes described so far. The high spatio-temporal resolution of our TL sequences and their qualitative and quantitative analysis, in particular using an appropriate 2D-algorithm, highlight the specific features of the EHT, schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Here, in addition to underlining the peculiarities of the EHT, we propose to discuss the results that are most relevant to a comparative analysis of the process with other cellular extrusion mechanisms.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The bending of the apical/luminal membrane and the orientation of the emergence</title><p>The inward bending of the luminal membrane of EHT cells is one of the hallmarks of the EHT that, to our knowledge, has never been described so far for any other type of cell extrusion. In the context of the EHT, the direction of extrusion is opposite depending on the species, i.e towards the sub-aortic space in the zebrafish and the aortic lumen in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klaus and Robin, 2017</xref>). Although the two emergences proceed in opposite directions, it appears that the EHT, in these two species, may have something in common. Indeed, electron microscopic images of cells of the embryonic mouse aorta floor showed the presence of large intracellular vacuole-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marshall and Thrasher, 2001</xref>) reminiscent of what is observed in the zebrafish embryo, raising the idea that the inward bending of the apical/luminal membrane may be followed by its intracellular release after the emergence.</p><p>If the reason for the discrepancy regarding the direction of the emergence between the mouse and the zebrafish is currently unknown, this study contributes shedding light on this issue. When abrogating the blood flow by obliterating heart beating from the very beginning, we show that cells from the aortic floor can emerge in the aortic lumen (presumably hemogenic cells endowed with the potential to become hematopoietic). Unless, in the zebrafish, hemogenic cells that have never been exposed to hemodynamic forces do not express the relevant cytosolic machineries essential for performing a sub-aortic emergence, this raises the possibility that the variation between the two species is a direct consequence of differences in the strength of components of hemodynamic forces, such as, for example, the mechanical strain (the force perpendicular to the direction of the flow and that relates to the rhythm of heart beating, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hahn and Schwartz, 2009</xref>). However, the differences in heart beating frequencies between the two species are not so far from each other at that developmental stage (approximately 2–3 beats/s, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xing et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hahurij et al., 2014</xref>]). Hence, it is not so clear if the sub-aortic orientation of the emergence of HSCs in the zebrafish may be a direct consequence of the mechanical strain; what might count as well regarding the difference between the two species are the physical properties of the respective aortic walls that should impact the way they respond to the force because of their diameters, much wider in the mouse than in the zebrafish (approximately 300 μm in the mouse and 25 μm in the zebrafish embryos at the time window of the EHT).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanical forces exerted by blood flow control the EHT biomechanics</title><p>The period of the aortic development during which the EHT takes place is the one at which aortic cells are highly exposed to mechanical tensions. Indeed, it has been shown by using a VE-cadherin mechanical sensor, that young aortic cells (at 48 hpf), are more exposed to tension than 2 days later, when the aorta has matured and the aortic cells align with the direction of the flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lagendijk et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, elongated hemogenic and EHT cells, on the aortic floor, may also orientate and contract along that same axis (as we show in our work with the 2D-maping results), to minimize environmental constraints and membrane tension. In this context, the membrane interfaces that remain the most exposed to mechanical tensions are most probably the ones that are enriched in ZO1 and actin and are oriented perpendicular to blood flow (consistently with ZO1 enrichment at the interface between endothelial cells that spread over a large surface of the aorta and whose orientation is also perpendicular to blood flow). According to our results obtained upon abrogation of heart beating and showing alteration of actin anisotropy (i.e the reduction in the recruitment of sub-cortical actin at the two poles of the cells more or less aligned with the blood flow axis), tensions exerted by the hemodynamics control sub-plasmalemmal cytoskeletal architecture in EHT cells and, consequently, the actin/junctional interface (as suggested by the delocalization of ZO1 that we observe in these conditions). Altogether, these results support the conclusion that the EHT biomechanics are specifically adapted to - and influenced by - the mechanical tensions exerted by blood flow. It should be noted that this control by the flow might be direct (ex: via cell surface mechanosensors), and/or indirect (ex: via the induction of Runx1, the transcription factor essential for hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamo et al., 2009</xref>]). Indeed, hemodynamics and in particular shear stress was shown to control endothelial cell morphology and influence the expression of many transcription factors (for example, for a link between flow, mechanotransduction, actin, transcription see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakajima et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Biomechanics of the apical constriction compared to other morphogenetic processes</title><p>The constriction of the apical/luminal side of EHT cells, like many apical cell constriction events described so far, should depend on the activity of actomyosin recruited at the junctional circumferential belt. The membrane interfaces that are the less enriched in actomyosin (oriented along the antero-posterior axis), are the ones that shrink the most, supporting the idea that the constriction is also coupled with their consumption, possibly by endocytosis.</p><p>EHT cell apical constriction exhibits peculiar biomechanical characteristics in comparison to other apical constriction mechanisms described so far. It is pulsatile, with successive phases of contraction and of stabilization, each one with a time-length varying stochastically (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The pulsatility relies on variations of the apical closing speed that oscillates (owing to acceleration and deceleration cycles), with more or less large amplitudes (with larger amplitudes during the constriction than the stabilization phase) and with periods of approximately 40 min on average. This average period value is longer than in the most extensively studied and quantified processes taking place during development, such as, for example, the apical-medial contraction of cells during ventral mesoderm invagination in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryos (see the seminal article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2009</xref>]), or the apical-medial and apical-junctional mediated contractions during neuroblasts ingression (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simões et al., 2017</xref>]); the latter being more comparable to the EHT process since a single cell extrudes from an epithelium, the ectoderm. In these two processes, for which the duration of the apical constriction takes approximatey 6 min and 30 min, respectively, the period of each pulsatile cycle is in the minute range (with, for example, an average of 3.2 constriction pulses over 6 min for ventral cells (interspersed with inter-periodic intervals of similar values) and of 28.8 constriction pulses over 30 min for neuroblasts (value extrapolated from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simões et al., 2017</xref>)). Finally, for the EHT, the inter-periodic intervals of the contraction phase take approximately 21 min on average (which we referred to as pseudo-plateaus, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Currently, the reason for such a discrepancy in the periods of pulsatile cycles of the apical constriction is not known. However, in comparison to the time scale of apical contraction in the neuroblast ingression process that also leads to cell extrusion (lasting for approximately 30 min, as mentioned already), the timescale of the EHT process per se is relatively long (average duration of approximately 10 hr). This suggests that the specific parameters of the oscillations of the apical closing speed for EHT cells that impact on contraction efficiencies (in particular for periods and amplitudes) correlate with the time scale of the whole process, suggesting that they may be controlled at the mesoscopic level, perhaps involving gene regulatory networks controlling cyclic expression of genes (such as in the case of ultradian oscillations that have periods in the time-range of the hour, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Isomura and Kageyama, 2014</xref>). Indeed, EHT cells are integrated into a developing lumenized tissue that is submitted to a series of mechanical tensions owing to aortic morphological maturation including (i) the adaptation of the endothelial wall to EHT cell emergence and the significant reduction of the aortic diameter with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Isogai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kissa and Herbomel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sugden et al., 2017</xref>), (ii) the extensive modification of the structure of the sub-aortic space (with the modification of the basal lamina contacting EHT cells and transducing forces via integrins; see the incidence of basal lamina on periods of oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gorfinkiel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koride et al., 2014</xref>]) and, last but not least, (iii) complex hemodynamic forces. In such environment, the high mechanical tensions might tune the downstream molecular events controlling actin-driven directional forces and actomyosin recruitment and contractility (for the relevance of high-order information, at the tissue level, on the biomechanics and role of contractile pulses and the theoretical description of pulsatile/oscillatory behaviour, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levayer and Lecuit, 2012</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The regulation of actomyosin contraction</title><p>In this study, we do show that the contraction of circumferential actomyosin accompanies the constriction of EHT cells; however, we do not show a correlation between apical pulses and oscillatory recruitment of actomyosin components in that specific region as performed in other studies, essentially for technical reasons (the weakness of signals of myosin RLCs fused to fluorescent reporters in all the transgenic lines established is too close to background to allow extraction of oscillatory signals from fluctuating noise). Hence, we can only speculate that the peculiarities of the biomechanical characteristics of apical constriction discussed above rely on the regulation of actomyosin recruitment and contraction. However, interfering with <italic>Myl9b</italic> function by mutagenesis of its PKC phosphorylation site impairs hematopoiesis, which is consistent with the requirement for actomyosin activity during the EHT and points to the importance of a particular regulatory pathway. Indeed, the N-terminal phosphorylation site in <italic>Myl9b</italic>, shared with most other myosin RLCs, was shown to be the substrate of PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ikebe et al., 1987</xref>) and, upon phosphorylation, to prevent the activating phosphorylation of a downstream site (the MLCK site, the most characterized phosphorylation site of RLCs, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Turbedsky et al., 1997</xref>]). Hence, this reinforces the possibility that a major regulatory axis of the EHT process relies on controlling actomyosin activity, by regulating a complex interplay between activating and inhibitory kinases. In this scenario, there exists the possibility that <italic>Myl9b</italic>, via the phosphorylation of its N-terminus, contributes to the tuning of the mechanical parameters of the contraction. Finally, there may be additional complexity to the system, for another RLC, <italic>Myl9a</italic>, is expressed in the aorta and may be co-expressed with <italic>Myl9b</italic> in EHT cells. <italic>Myl9a</italic> is a paralog that appears to be more restricted to the zebrafish and lacks the N-terminal, PKC phosphorylation site. Since the knock-down of <italic>myl9a</italic>, as is the case for <italic>myl9b</italic>, impairs definitive hematopoiesis, both isoforms may be involved in the EHT, with a fine tuning of their molecular ratio.</p><p>In conclusion, our study reveals key biochemical and biomechanical features of hematopoietic stem cell emergence in the zebrafish embryo and strengthens the significance of the mechanical constraints imposed by the environment and more specifically the blood flow. This work paves the way for future studies on this very unique process, including studying the contribution of forces exerted by the adjoining endothelial cells. Overall, it invites to biophysical modelling to point to the most relevant biomechanical features of the process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(Zebrafish)</td><td>Zebrafish: AB</td><td valign="bottom">Zebrafish International <break/>Resource Center (ZIRC)</td><td valign="bottom">ZFIN: <break/>ZDB-GENO-960809–7</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(Zebrafish)</td><td>Zebrafish Tg(kdrl:HsHRAS <break/>-mCherry): s916Tg</td><td valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chi et al.

It is decomposed in two sections aimed at (1) the segmentation of the aortic tube, (2) the unwrapping. To perform the segmentation of the tube, the algorithm first needs to be initialized by the user. To circumvent the variations in the aortic shape, movements, and signals coming from neighboring structures, a strong constrained surface is imposed to the aortic wall (this part is available as an Icy plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org">http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org</ext-link>) called TubeSkinner; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Chaumont et al., 2012</xref>]). The aorta tube is rotated so that its axis becomes almost aligned with the Z-axis. On the first Z-section, the user then manually adjusts a circle fitting the inner part of the aorta. In such a section, the aorta is represented as a few numbers of bright spots representing the intersection of the plane with cellular membranes. The circle is then adjusted to maximize the sum of the fluorescent signals in a crown around its diameter, and to minimize the sum of intensity inside the inner circle of the crown. This procedure is repeated along the tube, effectively locating its central axis. Then for each circle, the intensity is collected along its perimeter as the maximal signal in the crown for a given angle. Finally, the unwrapper algorithm creates the image by transforming the point in the z-stack to the (theta, r) coordinate system considering the circle fit, making sure the final calibration is isotropic. No interpolation is performed on pixel intensity. The X-axis of the final image corresponds to the perimeter of the circles, and its Y-axis corresponds to the tube central axis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>2D-Maps representation</title><p>The obtained 2D-maps were then duplicated to merge the rims of unwrapped aorta and visualize the continuity of all cell contours.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>3D-rendering</title><p>3D-rendering of live-imaging have been processed using the Imaris software (Bitplane, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bitplane.com/">http://www.bitplane.com/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Manual A-P distance measurements</title><p>We considered the Antero-Posterior luminal distance (A-P distance), as the length between the most anterior and posterior luminal poles of the EHT undergoing cell, aligned with the A-P axis.</p><p>In the case of EHT cells emerging parallel to the A-P axis, we used the ‘Straight Line’ tool on Fiji software (NIH, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/Fiji">https://imagej.net/Fiji</ext-link>) and measured the A-P distance (for each time points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) on 2 or three consecutive Z-planes localized in the central part of the EHT cell (where the apparent A-P distance was the longest) and averaged.</p><p>For cells emerging at a small angle relative to the A-P axis, we measured the apparent A-P distance on the maximum projection along the Z-axis; when the angle was larger, we first performed a 3D-rotation on Imaris software so as to align the cell in the X-Y plane before doing the measurement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Semi-automatic A-P distance and closing speed measurements</title><p>In order to measure A-P luminal distances and dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), dense eGFP-ZO1 extremities were independently tracked using the Fiji plugin TrackMate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/TrackMate">https://imagej.net/TrackMate</ext-link>) after maximum projection along the Z-axis and X,Y translation using the Fiji plugin ‘Descriptor based series registration’ to correct the X,Y drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Preibisch et al., 2010</xref>).

That could be accomplished by the silent heart morpholino or using chemicals.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The submitted work by Schmidt et al. builds upon previous work from the Herbomel lab (Kissa and Herbomel, 2010) studying the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT) in zebrafish. The present study uses novel imaging techniques and software analysis to investigate the biomechanics of this process. Based on their data, the authors come to three major conclusions: (i) EHT involves anisotropic contraction along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis facilitated by the heterogeneous organization of contractile circumferential actomyosin, (ii) the contraction is oscillatory with periods of stability that are much longer than other known cell extrusion processes, and (iii) <italic>myl9b</italic> is a target of Runx1 and its amino-terminal phosphorylation site is critical to definitive hematopoiesis. Overall, although the writing could be more clear and succinct and conclusion (ii) could be better supported with requested data and information, this submission provides new and valuable insights into the EHT and seems to be a good fit for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> pending revisions.</p><p>1) Conclusion (ii) would be better supported by an improved and more standardized approach to determining length of time of the EHT. This could include more specific and quantitative definitions of the intervals that the authors refer to as &quot;periods&quot; and &quot;pseudo-plateaus.&quot; Using time of imaging onset does not appear to be the best initial time from which to measure the duration of the EHT since it is somewhat arbitrary – can this be more standardized from the data already collected? Further, the description for calculating oscillation duration and stabilization was vague, and it was not clear from the text which parameters the authors used to define acceleration/deceleration cycles. And, why were only 7 tracings shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C? These tracings don't appear to incorporate the full range of closing patterns observed nor does the 2-4 μm cut-off seem to apply more broadly (e.g., see Figure 2C). Finally, the authors could do a better job comparing (both qualitatively and quantitatively) their findings for EHT to other cell extrusion processes in the Discussion to strengthen their argument for the uniqueness of the EHT and to situate their findings in a broader context.</p><p>2) With regard to conclusion (iii), although the authors demonstrate what they claim as a major conclusion, their data leave open a few questions that would be good to address in this work in accordance with published standards for morpholinos (see Stainier et al., 2017). This could include phenocopies with multiple morpholinos or rescue experiments. Could the <italic>myl9a</italic> data (i.e., not regulated by Runx1 but affecting hematopoiesis) be explained by an off-target effect of the morpholino on <italic>myl9b</italic>? What would <italic>myl9b</italic> expression look like with the myl9a morpholinos (potentially add condition to Figure 6—figure supplement 1E)? What does the dose response curve look like and why were such high quantities of morpholinos injected (8-12ng) in the main text when Figure 6—figure supplement 1E suggests that 4ng gave similar changes in mRNA expression levels? Do the myl9aspe2i2 and myl9bspe2i2 morpholinos phenocopy myl9aspi3e4 and myl9bspe3i3, respectively?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the authors described the detail process of endothelial-hematopoietic transition (EHT) including EHT time consumption and occurrence location, hemogenic endothelium morphological change, and dynamic change of intercellular cell junction and cytoskeleton. They regarded EHT as a special pattern of developmental morphogenetic event and cell extrusion. Finally, the authors showed that <italic>myl9b</italic> is a downstream target of Runx1 and plays a role in the dynamic change of cytoskeleton during EHT. Although this is a nice piece of cell biology work, the genetic regulation analysis is relatively rough and weak. It also lacks mechanistic study to explore the signals that trigger the dynamic change of hemogenic endothelium. Addition of these data will significantly enhance the quality of the manuscript.</p><p>1) In subsection “Hemodynamic forces control the morphodynamics of the emergence” and Figure 6, the authors argued that Runx1 positively regulates the expression of <italic>myl9b</italic>. Because MO knockdown may have toxicity and off-target effects, the authors should re-examine the expression pattern of <italic>myl9b</italic> in <italic>runx1</italic> mutants rather than <italic>runx1</italic> morphants. More importantly, time-lapse imaging should be performed on <italic>runx1</italic> mutants to find out whether the patterns of Myl9b and F-actin are indeed perturbed in hemogenic endothelium in the mutant fish. Finally, CHIP assay should also be performed to confirm Runx1 indeed binds to the promoter or enhancer of the <italic>myl9b</italic> gene and promotes the expression of <italic>myl9b</italic> in zebrafish.</p><p>2) The authors showed that during the EHT, ZO1 and F-actin tend to be enriched in the trijunctions and membrane interfaces that are perpendicular to the blood flow, raising the possibility that blood flow may act as an extracellular mechanical force that triggers or affects the morphological change and cytoskeleton dynamics of HE during EHT. Thus, it would be of great interest to investigate the influence of blood flow on EHT dynamics by manipulating the physical property of blood flow (velocity, volume and viscosity, for example).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37355.043</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>For the rebuttal, please pay attention to the timing issues addressed in reviewer 1, point number 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reinvestigated our time-lapse experiments and found 7 EHT cells that were imaged, starting from a flat morphology (hemogenic cells) to their exit (hence including the cup shape stage). We observed that, as is the case for the time-to-exit of cells imaged starting at the cup shape stage, the time intervals between the flat morphology to the cup shape stage are also very variable, with an average of 6.5 hours (ranging from 3.2 hours to 10.33 hours). We have now calculated the apparent complete duration of the EHT, which lasts for more than 10 hours on average (apparent because it is currently impossible to determine the precise starting point at which EHT committed cells, in the hemogenic endothelium, will initiate the emergence). This very long timing of the process reinforces the fact that starting imaging when hemogenic cells committed to perform the EHT are still flat is at risk regarding phototoxicity (which legitimates our initial choice of imaging the process starting at the cup shaped stage). These results are included now in a new version of Figure 1—figure supplement 1, panels A and B (left part), the new Figure 1—video 3 and the related paragraph in the revised main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewers had issues with the myl9b morpholino work, as illustrated by point 2 of reviewer 1 and point 1 of reviewer 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed 3 major sets of experiments with respect to these concerns, which are outlined in more detail in response to reviewer 1 point 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Blood flow should also be addressed as reviewer 2's point 2.

In addition, and regarding the main text, we believe that things are more clearly explained now and that the text gained very much in quality following the reviewer’s recommendations.</p><p>Please find beneath our answers to the specific points.</p><p>Regarding the duration of the EHT, we have provided a response to this in the first point in the Essential revisions section of the decision letter.</p><p>Regarding the 2-4 μm cut-off, we agree that this does not apply to all cells and have simplified the text accordingly and propose (subsection “EHT dynamics at high spatio-temporal resolution”):</p><p>“Secondly, we noticed that the narrowing down of the A-P luminal distance did not occur at a uniform pace, but with phases of contraction and of relative stabilization of variable durations taking place in the limit of an A-P luminal distance of approximately 2 µm, followed by steep decrease until the release of the cell (this fast drop may represent a collapse following the culmination of mechanical tensions). Hence, the heterogeneous duration of the EHT might be explained by these discontinuities, the reasons of which being unknown.”</p><p>Regarding the biomechanics of the apical constriction, we have improved the main text so as to describe more clearly the phases of contraction, relative stabilization and oscillations (phases of acceleration/deceleration). As a support to the main text, we have made a new supplemental figure that clearly indicates what we refer to as contraction, stabilization, period and pseudo-plateau (see the new Figure —figure supplement 1 and its legend). The text that we now propose is found in subsection “Intercellular junctions and apical constriction of EHT cells are anisotropic”.</p><p>In addition, following the reviewer’s requests, we have improved the quantitative analysis of some of the parameters of the apical contraction and automatized the mathematical analysis of the oscillation periods:</p><p>a) For the calculation of the periods, we have automatized the analysis by using a small algorithm based on the prominence (the prominence of a local minimum, or valley, measures how the valley stands out with respect to its depth and location relative to other valleys), see the following link that we have also indicated in a revised paragraph in Materials and methods section, in which one can find also the information for the algorithm): https://fr.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/islocalmin.html</p><p>b) The calculation of the periods is what is the most important here hence we have not automatized the calculation of the pseudo-plateaus and removed this information from the plot Figure 2D.</p><p>Figure 1C shows only 7 tracing because all measurements were performed by hand, which was extremely fastidious (in comparison to the A-P distances measured and reported Figure 2C that were obtained semi-automatically using TrackMate and are more resolutive (because less noisy)). Showing those data in the Supplement file and at that stage of the paper allows introducing, with the support of a morphological criterion, the reason why the EHT process is stochastic and variable in time.</p><p>We are astonished to read this comment ‘the authors could do a better job comparing (both qualitatively and quantitatively) their findings for EHT to other cell extrusion processes in the Discussion section’. Indeed, we make quantitative comparisons in the Discussion section, but we focused on few cases (among which 1 extrusion case), the reason being that those have been the most extensively characterized and quantified (ventral cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and the ingression of neuroblasts, also in <italic>Drosophila</italic>). In addition, we feel that this would rather be the scope of a review on the topic. We have substantiated with few additional numbers the part regarding the oscillations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) With regard to conclusion (iii), although the authors demonstrate what they claim as a major conclusion, their data leave open a few questions that would be good to address in this work in accordance with published standards for morpholinos (see Stainier et al., 2017). This could include phenocopies with multiple morpholinos or rescue experiments. Could the myl9a data (i.e., not regulated by Runx1 but affecting hematopoiesis) be explained by an off-target effect of the morpholino on myl9b?

In summary, neither Myl9a nor Myl9b morpholinos triggered significant off-target effects. However, with one of the Myl9a morpholinos (spi3e4), we measured an increase in the Myl9b mRNAs indicating that decreasing Myl9a expression can trigger a compensatory response on Myl9b mRNA expression.</p><p>These results, more complete, are now substituting the previous results of the previous Figure 6—figure supplement 1, now becoming Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</p><p>In addition, because the phenotype triggered by the use of the Myl9a morpholino spi3e4 may be owed to a compensatory response by the upregulation of Myl9b, the left panels of the new Figure 8D and E (previous Figure 6E and F) are now composed with data obtained with the second Myl9a morpholino (spe2i2).</p><p>We have phenocopied the phenotype (on the number of CD41:eGFP+ cells in the CHT and sub-aortic space) with a second morpholino for both Myl9a and Myl9b and provide dose-dependences of the effects of morpholinos on the numbers of CD41:eGFP+ cells.

A similar deletion mutant (but lacking the putative nuclear targeting signal) was used and characterized as a dominant negative form in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (see Tracey et al., 1998).</p><p>Injection of mRNAs encoding for this mutant form triggered quite significant decrease of CD41:eGFP+ hematopoietic cells in the CHT at 48hpf (in addition to small haemorrhaging within the brain and, apparently, the pericardial space, which appears to be consistent with the phenotype obtained with Runx1 deficient mouse embryos (Okuda et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1996)). This validated the approach and encouraged us investigating further the effect of the Runx1 deletion mutant on the expression levels of Myl9a, Myl9b and Myb (the control). We found, for Myl9a and Myl9b approximately the same results as for the crispants: no to little variation in Myl9a mRNAs, a reproducible increase in Myl9b mRNAs, but no decrease in the positive control (Myb).</p><p>In conclusion, these 2 sets of data are contradicting the results obtained by the Runx1 morpholino approach, i.e. a potential involvement of Runx1 in controlling positively the expression of Myl9b. A possible explanation for the discrepancies, outside from toxic and/or off-target effects of morpholinos, is the activation of compensatory responses upon strong modification of Runx1 expression level that affect the consistency of results as well as the sensitivity of hemogenic cells to Runx1 dosage.</p><p>Because of these inconsistencies, we removed the results obtained with the Runx1 morpholino (which was previous Figure 6, panel B). We believe that this does not impairs the impact of this work that is now very much substantiated by the outcome of the new investigations that we have conducted on the influence of blood flow on the EHT dynamics.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] 1) In subsection “Myosin regulatory light chains 9a and 9b are required for definitive hematopoiesise” and Figure 6, the authors argued that Runx1 positively regulates the expression of myl9b. Because MO knockdown may have toxicity and off-target effects, the authors should re-examine the expression pattern of myl9b in runx1 mutants rather than runx1 morphants. More importantly, time-lapse imaging should be performed on runx1 mutants to find out whether the patterns of Myl9b and F-actin are indeed perturbed in hemogenic endothelium in the mutant fish. Finally, CHIP assay should also performed to confirm Runx1 indeed binds to the promoter or enhancer of the myl9b gene and promotes the expression of myl9b in zebrafish.</p></disp-quote><p>First of all, we wish to thank the reviewer for his/her very fruitful recommendation on investigating the influence of blood flow on the EHT dynamics. As the reviewer will see, the outcome of the experiments is very interesting and substantiates very much the idea that blood flow has an influence on several aspects of the EHT biomechanics. In addition, the comments on the morpholinos work has been very valuable also and led to substantial revision of our work. Please find beneath our answers to the specific points.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that we have not shown that the <italic>myl9b</italic> gene is a direct target of Runx1 (which we wrote was a possibility since it was shown to be the case for mouse cells). This would require, as suggested by the reviewer, a CHIP assay. The CHIP assay is the only experiment that we have not performed because we do not handle this technique in the laboratory and, taking information from other laboratories on our campus, this kind of experiment cannot reasonably be conducted in 2 months (the time we were given with this revision for which virtually all points raised by the reviewers were addressed). Importantly, and as the reviewer will see beneath, since the new experiments that were performed during this revision in order to interfere with the expression of Runx1 (using CRISPR/Cas9 and the expression of a deleted form of Runx1) gave inconsistent results with the morpholinos, we have removed the qRT-PCR data on Runx1/Myl9b, Myl9a from the paper. We believe that this does not harm the overall outcome of our work that is now more substantiated on its main message, i.e the importance of mechanical forces of the blood flow in the biomechanics of the EHT, which is a new part of the revised version and which arose after the very constructive suggestion of the reviewer.</p><p>We addressed particular points in regard to the experiments aimed at interfering with the activity of the Runx1 transcription factor and analysing consequences on Myl9a and Myl9b mRNAs expression (by another approach than using morpholinos). This information is given in response to reviewer 1’s second point.</p><p>For the comment “time-lapse imaging should be performed on runx1 mutants to find out whether the patterns of Myl9b and F-actin are indeed perturbed in hemogenic endothelium in the mutant fish”:</p><p>To perform a pattern analysis at a good resolution, we need to use ideally our 2D-map treatment of images, which we cannot perform presently because, as we mention in the text of our paper, we do not have enough sensitivity with our fish lines, neither for Myl9a, nor for Myl9b. The experiments requested by the Reviewer are extremely difficult experiment to perform (in particular in the 2-3 months of a revision) owing to low sensitivity (in particular for Myl9a and b) and variability (in particular when imaging stochastic processes, as EHT is). Hence, this type of experiments would need, at least, to have at hand a well-characterized stable fish line mutant for Runx1, which we presently do not have. This would indeed require such a line because, for Myl9b (and so would be the case for Myl9a), we would have to inject a Myl9b encoding plasmid (to increase the chance to have enough sensitivity of detection but having to face the problem of mosaicism in transient transgenesis). We currently do not handle transient transgenesis for expression of Lifeact and we can anticipate on the same type of difficulties.</p><p>So, we feel that we are not so far from addressing the reviewer’s request (although rather indirectly) by showing the alteration of the F-actin pattern after the injection of the sih morpholino (see the new Figure 6, bottom of panel B), given that the blood flow controls the expression of Runx1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors showed that during the EHT, ZO1 and F-actin tend to be enriched in the trijunctions and membrane interfaces that are perpendicular to the blood flow, raising the possibility that blood flow may act as an extracellular mechanical force that triggers or affects the morphological change and cytoskeleton dynamics of HE during EHT. Thus, it would be of great interest to investigate the influence of blood flow on EHT dynamics by manipulating the physical property of blood flow (velocity, volume and viscosity, for example).</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed experiments using a silent heart morpholino and show/illustrate a series of results that are listed below. It should be emphasized that lack of blood flow triggered a quite significant decrease in the diameter of the aorta and distortions of its wall rendering the imaging more difficult than in normal conditions. However, we have been able to obtain few time-lapse sequences with interesting results regarding the orientation of the emergence and the morphodynamics of emerging cells (see below). We also explored further the phenotype, in particular with our 2D-algorithm to analyse the localization/organization of F-actin and ZO1. Impairing blood flow also dramatically affected the results of image treatment with the 2D-algorithm because these distortions project the signals outside from the crown drawn on aortic sections and supposed to contain signals of highest intensities (which are the signals projected on the 2D plane). Hence, we have narrowed down the images obtained by 2D-mapping to the plane of the aortic floor (that was less distorted than the aortic roof that flattened a lot, see Figure 6A) and obtained interesting information on the organization of F-actin (see below).</p><p>We also investigated the consequence of impairing blood flow on the localization/organization of ZO1. Unfortunately, fluorescence signals were too low and aorta too distorted to perform 2D-mapping (in addition, we wish to inform the reviewer that we had a serious incident in our animal facility and lost several of our fish lines, including the UAS:eGFP-ZO1 line that had been highly selected over several generations to reduce mosaicism that was very strong in the dorsal aorta. Hence, the experiments that were performed here with the sih morpholino were on transient expression, which is why we had very little amounts of cells expressing eGFP-ZO1 in the aortic floor (see new Figure 6, panel C)). However, although we were not able to perform 2D-mapping with our Z-stacks obtained with fishes transiently expressing eGFPZO1, 3D-projections and 3D-analysis with the Imaris software were very helpful and revealed alterations of eGFP-ZO1 localization in cells of the hemogenic endothelium, with altered recruitment at the sub-plasmalemmal level and apparent increase of the cytoplasmic pool. In addition to the morphological alterations of the dorsal aorta, we show/illustrate: (a) the absence, on the ventral side of the dorsal aorta, of EHT cells with their luminal/apical membrane oriented towards the sub-aortic space (in the same direction than the basal membrane) but, rather, the presence of ovoid cells (with the luminal/apical membrane protruding into the aorta lumen). 14 embryos were imaged all along the dorsal aorta at 48 hpf and 3 additional ones were used for time lapse sequences that lasted for 6 to 12 hours; in none of these embryos did we see any cup shaped EHT undergoing cells; (b) the emergence of ovoid cells in the lumen of the aorta (which we never saw before); (c) the clear modification in the organization of both F-actin and ZO1 in hemogenic and EHT cells. (d) the maintenance of mitosis of cells embedded in the aortic floor (most probably in the hemogenic endothelium). (e) evidence for the death of some of the cells that have emerged in the sub-aortic space (in the time window of our time-lapse experiments).</p><p>In addition, we also interfered with the heart beating by using treatment with tricaine. In these conditions, the inward bending of the apical/luminal membrane is abrogated and cells performing the emergence towards the sub-aortic space maintained the direction of the emergence towards the sub-aortic space (we introduced that information in the text as Data not shown).</p><p>Overall, these results show that hemodynamic forces contribute to the bending of the apical/luminal membrane of EHT cells towards the sub-aortic space (the cupshaped cells) as well as the direction of the emergence (the sub-aortic space) and reinforce the peculiarity of the EHT biomechanics, influenced by – and adapted to – the mechanical tensions exerted by the blood flow (Abstract).</p><p>These new results are included in a new figure, Figure 6, and 3 new Movies (Figure 6—video 1 (which is not a movie sensu stricto but a series of Z stacks illustrating the aortic morphology, intra-aortic cells, and the presence of ovoid cells included in the aortic floor), Figure 6—video 2 (illustrating the dynamics of the EHT emergence without flow) and Figure 6—video 3 (illustrating, by 3D-projections and 3D-analysis with the Imaris software, the alterations of eGFP-ZO1 localization in cells of the hemogenic endothelium). These results are contained in subsection “Hemodynamic forces control the topology and the dynamics of the emergence” and led to some modifications of the text on the sequential steps of the EHT (see subsection “EHT sequential steps and key features”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
