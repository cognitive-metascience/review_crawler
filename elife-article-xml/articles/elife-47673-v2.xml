Their functions in the migration of neocortical projection neurons, however, are unclear. We have found that FGFRs regulate multipolar neuron orientation and the morphological change into bipolar cells necessary to enter the cortical plate. Mechanistically, our results suggest that FGFRs are activated by N-Cadherin. N-Cadherin cell-autonomously binds FGFRs and inhibits FGFR K27- and K29-linked polyubiquitination and lysosomal degradation. Accordingly, FGFRs accumulate and stimulate prolonged Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Neurons inhibited for Erk1/2 are stalled in the multipolar zone. Moreover, Reelin, a secreted protein regulating neuronal positioning, prevents FGFR degradation through N-Cadherin, causing Erk1/2 phosphorylation. These findings reveal novel functions for FGFRs in cortical projection neuron migration, suggest a physiological role for FGFR and N-Cadherin interaction in vivo and identify Reelin as an extracellular upstream regulator and Erk1/2 as downstream effectors of FGFRs during neuron migration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebral cortex</kwd><kwd>neuronal migration</kwd><kwd>FGFR</kwd><kwd>embryogenesis</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>J.0129.15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jossin</surname><given-names>Yves</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>J.0179.16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jossin</surname><given-names>Yves</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T.0243.18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jossin</surname><given-names>Yves</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003134</institution-id><institution>Fonds pour la Formation à la Recherche dans l’Industrie et dans l’Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kon</surname><given-names>Elif</given-names></name><name><surname>Calvo-Jimenez</surname><given-names>Elisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Cossard</surname><given-names>Alexia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS080194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Jonathan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM109463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Jonathan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>FGFRs regulate multipolar cortical neuron orientation and the morphological change into bipolar cells in vivo under the control of N-Cadherin and the extracellular matrix protein Reelin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian neocortex has a complicated structure, with multiple layers of different types of neurons linked together in microcircuits. Cortical neurons are generated by progenitor divisions at or near the ventricular zone (VZ), then migrate to defined positions in the developing cortical plate (CP) where they differentiate and connect among themselves and to other brain regions. In general, projection neurons arise from the local VZ, below the CP, while interneurons migrate tangentially from the ganglionic eminences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parnavelas, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rash and Grove, 2006</xref>). The projection neurons are layered in birth order, such that neurons born early in development are below those born later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takahashi et al., 1999</xref>). Correct neuron layering is important: major defects in projection neuron migration may underlie lissencephalies and heterotopias coupled with mental retardation while milder defects are associated with mental disabilities including dyslexia, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bielas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Francis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Romero et al., 2018</xref>). A great deal is known about the distinct neuron migration paths and the signals that regulate them but a significant number of patients with developmental disorders lack a diagnosis. It is thus crucial to identify further causes of disease and understand them mechanistically.</p><p>Migrating projection neurons have been visualized in fetal mouse brains in which individual neurons have been labeled in utero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tabata and Nakajima, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nadarajah and Parnavelas, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>). Migration occurs in distinct phases. First, neurons move radially from the VZ into the lower intermediate zone (IZ). They then become multipolar and despite an apparent irregular movement, move towards the CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nadarajah et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tabata and Nakajima, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jossin and Cooper, 2011</xref>). When multipolar neurons reach the upper IZ, they become bipolar and traverse the CP by glial-guided locomotion. The lower IZ therefore constitutes a multipolar migration zone (MMZ) and the upper IZ and CP a radial migration zone (RMZ). Movement out of the MMZ is regulated by many signals, which, if disrupted, can lead to altered layering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cooper, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kon et al., 2017</xref>). One signal that regulates exit from the MMZ is Reelin, an extracellular matrix protein that activates the small GTPases Rap1A and RalA to upregulate surface levels of neural cadherin (NCad, CDH2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jossin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jossin and Cooper, 2011</xref>). Inhibiting Reelin, Rap1 or NCad interferes with the orientation of multipolar neurons, increases sideways and downwards movements, and increases time spent in the MMZ. Defects in multipolar migration may contribute to the altered layering in Reelin mutant mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lambert de Rouvroit and Goffinet, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hong et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) are important during the development of many tissues and for wound healing, tissue repair and metabolism after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beenken and Mohammadi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ornitz and Itoh, 2015</xref>). There is wide functional redundancy between family members, with specificity conferred by cell-type-specific expression of FGFs and FGFRs and alternative splicing of FGFRs. At the cellular level, FGFRs regulate cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, survival and cell shape. At the molecular level, FGF and heparan sulfate proteoglycan bind to FGFRs and induce FGFR dimerization and activation. Activated FGFRs autophosphorylate on multiple cytoplasmic tyrosine residues, followed by recruitment and phosphorylation of a variety of downstream signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ornitz and Itoh, 2015</xref>). Following activation, FGFRs are down-regulated by ubiquitination, endocytosis and lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katzmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haugsten et al., 2005</xref>). Defects in FGFR activation or down-regulation can lead to anomalous signaling and are associated with developmental defects, metabolic disorders and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wesche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ornitz and Itoh, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition to FGFs and heparan sulfate, cell surface proteins including neural cadherin (NCad or CDH2), epidermal cadherin (ECad or CDH1), L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) and neural CAM (NCAM) can also bind to and activate FGFRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Williams et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Williams et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suyama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2016</xref>). Both NCad and FGFRs are highly expressed during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of cancer cells and their interaction may be important for metastasis. Indeed, tumor cells artificially over-expressing NCad require FGFR activity for metastasis. Nevertheless, the role of NCad-dependent FGFR activation in metastasis pathology remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hulit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qian et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the developing cerebral cortex FGFR1-3 are expressed in the VZ and MMZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iwata and Hevner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hébert, 2011</xref>) (Allen Institute for Brain Science. Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas. Available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://developingmouse.brain-map.org/">http://developingmouse.brain-map.org/</ext-link>) and FGFRs have been associated with neurodevelopmental diseases including schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O'Donovan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Terwisscha van Scheltinga et al., 2013</xref>), epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Okazaki et al., 2017</xref>), autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wentz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coci et al., 2017</xref>) and lissencephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tan and Mankad, 2018</xref>), suggesting possible roles in neuron migration. However, analysis of cortical neuron migration in FGFR mutant mice has been inconclusive for two reasons. First, functional redundancy may suppress the phenotypes of loss of function mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beenken and Mohammadi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hébert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ornitz and Itoh, 2015</xref>). Second, FGFRs are needed for developmental steps that occur before migration, such as regional patterning of the cortex, neurogenesis and radial glia differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rash and Grove, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mason, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Paek et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the roles of FGFRs in neocortical neuron migration are unclear.</p><p>In this paper we report that FGFR1-3 have overlapping functions during the multipolar migration in vivo. FGFRs are required downstream of Rap1 for multipolar cells to orient towards the CP, adopt bipolar morphology, and migrate out of the MMZ. We found that Rap1-dependent NCad upregulation stabilizes FGFRs by inhibiting K27- and K29-linked polyubiquitination and lysosomal degradation and that NCad-FGFR <italic>cis</italic> interaction (on the same cell) is involved. Consequently, FGFRs accumulate and are activated, resulting in prolonged activation of Erk1/2 when neurons are stimulated in vitro with Reelin. In vivo inhibition of K27-linked polyubiquitination or overexpression of FGFRs rescues the migration of neurons with inhibited Rap1. Inhibition of Erk1/2 activity in the developing cerebral cortex induces a similar phenotype as FGFR or Rap1 inhibition. These data reveal a novel function of FGFRs in cortical projection neuron migration and the control of its activity by ubiquitination and NCad interaction in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first physiological role for FGFR-NCad interaction during tissue development. Furthermore, we identified FGFRs as mediating Reelin activation of Erk1/2 to control migration during the multipolar phase. These findings provide insights into FGFR mutation-related inherited brain diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FGFRs are required for multipolar neurons to orient correctly and become bipolar in vivo</title><p>To avoid potential functional redundancy, we tested the importance of FGFRs in neuron migration by inhibiting all family members. Cytoplasmic domain deletion mutants of FGFR1-3 are dominant negative (DN) because they form non-functional heterodimers with all FGFR family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ueno et al., 1992</xref>). To avoid effects on neurogenesis, DN mutants were expressed from the NeuroD promoter, which is activated after cells leave the VZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jossin and Cooper, 2011</xref>). Apical neural stem cells located at the VZ were electroporated in utero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tabata and Nakajima, 2001</xref>) at embryonic day E14.5 with DN FGFR1-3 along with GFP and the positions of daughter cells were monitored 3 days later at E17.5. While most control neurons expressing GFP alone had entered the RMZ, neurons over-expressing DN mutant but not full-length FGFR1-3 were arrested in the MMZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). These results suggest that the FGFR1-3 cytoplasmic domains are important for multipolar migration. The knock-down of FGFR1 or FGFR2 using specific shRNAs also induced an arrest of cells at the MMZ, with a more pronounced phenotype when the two receptors are downregulated together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

NECad but not ENCad was able to increase FGFR protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Moreover, NECad but not ENCad rescued the positional defect observed when Rap1 is inhibited in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). This suggests that the specificity of NCad to protect FGFR from degradation and to function in multipolar migration in vivo lies in the ECD. To map the NCad-specific function more closely, we prepared two other chimeric proteins: ENNCad has the EC1, EC2 and the first half of EC3 domains of ECad and the remainder of NCad, while NENCad has the second half of EC3, EC4 and EC5 domains of ECad and the remainder of NCad. NENCad but not ENNCad was able to increase FGFR protein level and rescue the positional defect observed when Rap1 is inhibited in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These results show that EC4-5 of either NCad or ECad can protect FGFRs from degradation and stimulate migration provided that EC1-2 and part of EC3 are derived from NCad. Overall, these data demonstrate that cadherin EC4 interaction with FGFR is necessary but not sufficient to stabilize and activate FGFRs and regulate multipolar migration in vivo. Additional unique features carried by NCad EC1-2 are also needed.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47673.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>NCad EC1-2 are required to increase FGFR protein levels and stimulate multipolar migration in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) NCad EC1-2 are necessary to increase FGFR protein abundance.

FGFR ubiquitination was inhibited by co-expressed NCad but not NCad<sup>ΔEC4</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>) or ECad (data not shown), consistent with NCad binding inhibiting FGFR ubiquitination. Ubiquitin ladders can result from the addition of single ubiquitin moieties at many sites (multi-monoubiquitination) or addition of ubiquitin chains (polyubiquitination). Seven lysine (K) residues on the ubiquitin molecule may be used for polyubiquitination, resulting in diverse outcomes for the target protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ikeda and Kerppola, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fushman and Wilkinson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sadowski et al., 2012</xref>). To test whether over-expressed FGFR1-Myc is multi-monoubiquitinated or polyubiquitinated, we inhibited polyubiquitination by co-over-expressing a ubiquitin mutant (Ubi<sup>K0</sup>), in which all 7 K residues substituted to arginine (R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lim et al., 2005</xref>).

To identify the specific polyubiquitin linkage, we used ubiquitin mutants that contain single K to R substitutions. We found that over-expressing Ubi<sup>K27R</sup> or Ubi<sup>K29R</sup> but not other mutants increased FGFR protein level to the same level as that induced by the presence of NCad-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>).

Our findings implicate FGFRs in a signaling pathway that regulates the orientation of projection neuron multipolar migration during the development of the cerebral cortex (see our working model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>). When FGFRs are inhibited, multipolar neurons accumulate in the multipolar migration zone. This includes a defect in the orientation of multipolar migration with fewer cells facing the CP, followed by a delay in the multipolar to radial morphology transition and a consequent accumulation of cells at the MMZ. Previous studies indicated that the orientation of multipolar migration and the subsequent bipolar morphology transition is triggered by Reelin, or the R3-6 fragment, diffusing from the outer part of the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jossin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jossin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Uchida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jossin and Cooper, 2011</xref>). Reelin activates Rap1, and this in turn upregulates NCad on the neuron surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jossin and Cooper, 2011</xref>). However, the mechanism by which NCad stimulates the multipolar migration was unknown. One possibility was that NCad on migrating neurons engages in homophilic binding interactions with NCad on surrounding cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kawauchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsunaga et al., 2017</xref>). However, our new evidence leads us to propose a model in which NCad-NCad <italic>trans</italic> interactions are not required. Instead, NCad binds in cis to FGFRs on the same cell. This cell-autonomous binding inhibits FGFR K27/K29 polyubiquitination and lysosomal degradation, resulting in a large increase in FGFR abundance and prolonged activation of FGFR and Erk1/2 that is required for the multipolar migration. FGFR-dependent Erk1/2 stimulation may therefore be a key signal for orienting multipolar neurons towards the CP.</p><p>FGFRs have been implicated in other developmental cell movements, including migration of mesodermal and tracheal cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gisselbrecht et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lebreton and Casanova, 2016</xref>), neuroblasts in the mouse olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>) and keratinocytes during repair of epidermal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>). A possible role for FGFRs in cortical projection neuron migration has not been reported previously, perhaps because FGFRs are needed for early telencephalon patterning and neurogenesis, and because of functional redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Paek et al., 2009</xref>). Cortical layering was defective in a mouse model expressing dominant-negative FGFR1 during neurogenesis but this could be secondary to the defective radial glia processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shin et al., 2004</xref>). By inhibiting FGFR signaling in postmitotic neurons, we avoided effects on neurogenesis or radial glia processes. Under these conditions, neurons were delayed in the multipolar migration zone, with randomized orientation, suggesting that FGFRs provide directional information. Conventionally, FGFRs are activated by FGFs and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ornitz and Itoh, 2015</xref>), so directional information could be provided by an FGF gradient, serving as a chemorepellent or attractant, as in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lebreton and Casanova, 2016</xref>). However, a large number of FGFs are expressed in the developing cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ford-Perriss et al., 2001</xref>), making it challenging to identify which, if any, may be involved. It is also possible that NCad activates FGFRs in the absence of FGFs. Reelin could stimulate FGFR-dependent Erk1/2 activity in cultured neurons in the absence of added FGF, suggesting that external FGF may not be needed in vivo. The co-clustering of FGFRs with NCad may be sufficient to activate the receptor independently of FGF, with FGFRs acting as ‘catalytic subunits’ downstream of NCad. A similar mechanism has been suggested for activation by the co-receptor Klotho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our cell culture experiments suggest that NCad stabilizes cell-surface FGFR by inhibiting K27/K29-linked polyubiquitination and lysosomal degradation. Importantly, inhibiting K27-linked polyubiquitination by expression of a mutant ubiquitin rescued the migration of Rap1-inhibited neurons, suggesting that this mechanism also occurs in vivo. The involvement of K27 and K29 is unusual. Polyubiquitin chains assemble through any of seven lysine residues on the ubiquitin molecule, resulting in diverse outcomes for the target protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fushman and Wilkinson, 2011</xref>). While K11 and K48 polyubiquitination is linked to proteasomal degradation and K63 polyubiquitination to lysosomal degradation, the roles of K6-, K27-, K29-, and of K33-linked ubiquitin chains are less clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sadowski et al., 2012</xref>). K27 and K29 ubiquitin linkages have been implicated in protein interactions and protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chastagner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ikeda and Kerppola, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zotti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fei et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birsa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). We found here that both K27 and K29 ubiquitin linkages are necessary for FGFR lysosomal degradation. This may involve mixed linear or mixed branched ubiquitin chains or single K27 and K29 chains attached to different lysine residues on the cytoplasmic tail of FGFRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yau and Rape, 2016</xref>). The E3 ligase and mechanism of lysosomal targeting remains unclear.</p><p>ECad also binds FGFRs but, unlike NCad, does not inhibit FGFR ubiquitination, protect FGFRs from degradation, or regulate multipolar migration in vivo. Using mutated receptors and chimeric proteins, we found that FGFRs bind both ECad and NCad and that binding is necessary but not sufficient to stabilize FGFRs and stimulate multipolar migration. Binding requires the fourth NCad EC domain, but FGFR stabilization and neuronal migration rescue also require the first two NCad domains. Their function is unclear. They may bind to a third partner in the complex that helps NCad inhibit FGFR degradation.</p><p>Our results indicated that Reelin does not activate ERK signaling directly but does so by stabilizing FGFR. ERK phosphorylation was delayed, presumably due to the time necessary to accumulate sufficient FGFR. A prolonged Erk1/2 activation might be required to induce a signal as is the case for EGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Traverse et al., 1994</xref>). For instance, Erk1/2 signaling has been linked to transcription of matrix metalloproteinases genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Westermarck and Kahari, 1999</xref>) and some metalloproteinases are essential for the organization of the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jorissen et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, Erk1 and Erk2 double mutant mice exhibit a defect in cortical lamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Imamura et al., 2010</xref>). A cell-autonomous function of Erk1/2 signaling could not be determined because of a failure in maintenance of the radial glia scaffolding. However, our results indicate that Erk1/2 activity is required in migrating neurons during the multipolar phase.</p><p>While we were writing this manuscript, FGFR2 was reported to regulate neuronal migration and spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Szczurkowska et al., 2018</xref>). Defective mice showed impaired core behaviors related to autism spectrum disorders. Interestingly, the Reelin pathway also regulates spine density and has been linked to autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lammert and Howell, 2016</xref>). Reelin was also reported to regulate the migration of dopaminergic neurons into the substantia nigra, with induction of bipolar morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vaswani et al., 2019</xref>). Additional research will be needed to elucidate the mechanism of FGFRs in Reelin-induced migration and spine density and the link with autism spectrum disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

rid="bib64">Tabata and Nakajima, 2001</xref>), using timed pregnant CD-1 mice. Timed-pregnant mice were anesthetized and each uterus was exposed under sterile conditions. Plasmid solutions containing 1 µg/µl of DNA were injected into the lateral ventricles of the embryos using a heat-pulled capillary. Needles for injection were pulled from Wiretrol II glass capillaries (Drummond Scientific) and calibrated for 1 μl injections. DNA solutions were mixed in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, with 0.01% Fast Green. Forceps-type electrodes (Nepagene) with 5 mm pads were used for electroporation (five 50 ms pulses of 45 V using the ECM830 electroporation system, Harvard Apparatus). Embryos were placed back into the abdominal cavity, and mice were sutured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Histology and immunofluorescence</title><p>Embryos were collected at E16.5 or E17.5. Brains were dissected and successful electroporations were chosen by epifluorescence microscopy. Positive brains were fixed in a 3.7% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution and cryoprotected in a 30% sucrose/PBS solution overnight at 4°C. Brains were frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT), and sectioned with a cryostat at 14-μm-thickness. Sections were placed on slides, permeabilized for 30 min in 0.4% Triton X-100/PBS then blocked for 30 min with 5% normal goat serum (NGS) in 0.4% Triton X100/PBS. Primary antibodies were diluted in 0.4% Triton X100/PBS incubated on slides overnight at 4°C. Sections were washed 3 times for 5 min in 0.4% Triton X100/PBS. Secondary antibodies were diluted in 0.4% Triton X100/PBS and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).

NCad<sup>ΔEC4</sup> was made by PCR using junction primers at the KpnI site already present in the sequence resulting in the deletion of residues 515–604. NCad<sup>W161A</sup> was made by site-directed mutagenesis with oligo <named-content content-type="sequence">5’-GCT CTA CAA AGG CAG AAG CGA GAC GCG GTC ATC CCG CCA ATC AAC-3’</named-content> and its reverse complement, changing codon 161 from TCG to GCG and introducing a silent mutation to destroy an EarI restriction site that was used for screening. NCad<sup>DN</sup> contains the transmembrane and intracellular domains (deletion of residues 99–708) and was described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jossin and Cooper, 2011</xref>). ENCad and NECad were made by using PCR using junction primers that inserted SpeI sites five residues N-terminal to the transmembrane domain (between ECad codons 704 and 705, and between NCad codons 717 and 720). NENCad and ENNCad were made using overlap extension PCR with recombination junctions between residues 420–421 of NCad and 415–416 of ECad.

The authors show that interaction of FGFR with N-Cadherin, CDH2, seems to protect FGFR from ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by lysosome. This leads to sustained FGFR levels and increased Erk1/2 downstream signaling which the authors propose regulates neuronal migration. Reelin seems important for FGFR-mediated Erk1/2 signaling, presumably by stabilizing and/or recruiting N-Cadherin to the plasma membrane.</p><p>While a number of interesting observations are presented, none directly assays FGFR function in cortical neuron migration. Rather, the data appear to show that disruption of FGFR and/or FGFR signaling stalls neuronal development at the multipolar stage, thereby preventing further differentiation and/or migration to form the neuronal layers. The experimental design and performance were nice, but the experiments are carried out mostly in HEK293 cells, not on developing cortical neurons. In addition, from the currently presented data it is difficult to see a coherent model for how the FGFRs actually function in locomotion (or a polarity defect at the multipolar stage). In total, the authors failed to demonstrate a direct function for FGFRs in migration in neurons.</p><p>The essential revisions to improve this work include a number of issues indicated in the reviews. In particular we feel that providing live-imaging data to resolve whether and to which extent FGFR signaling is required for migration versus polarization/differentiation is needed. In addition the authors need to repeat the biochemistry/pathways experiments in primary cortical cells and also draw a more coherent model of their functional relevance in vivo. Taken together, substantial amount of additional data is required in order to reach the high standard of <italic>eLife</italic>.

More specifically the authors show that FGFR-mediated signaling regulates multipolar migration and the switch to bipolar morphology.

They show that interaction of FGFR with N-Cadherin, CDH2, seems to protect FGFR from ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by lysosome. This leads to sustained FGFR levels and increased Erk1/2 downstream signaling.

The authors added new and important data which greatly support and strengthen the main conclusions of the manuscript. The authors made an effort to clarify the writing in general and now explicitly state that FGFR signaling controls multipolar migration and subsequent switch to bipolar morphology. Given the convincing data and additional experimental evidence the current data set supports the main conclusions of the manuscript very well, even without direct live-imaging data. Overall this study is likely to be of great interest to the broader neuroscience community.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Kon et al. revised their manuscript ʺFGFR ubiquitination and degradation controls neuronal migration in vivoʺ to reflect their observation that cortical neurons appear to stall at the multipolar stage when FGFR signaling is perturbed by transgenic expression of DN FGFR. They have done a nice job of streamlining the biochemical and in utero electroporation epistasis experiments, and performing more of the biochemical experiments in cultured cortical neurons as requested, to work out the signaling mechanism involved. While the manuscript overall has improved, there are several issues that I feel do not make it suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at this time and may be more suitable for a more specialized journal.</p><p>First, I still worry that expression of a DN FGFR, as opposed to conditional genetic loss of function experiments, may have some off-target effects.

In response we have performed additional experiments and rewritten the text to improve logical flow. In summary:</p><p>1) We agree that disrupting FGFR signaling stalls or delays neurons at the multipolar stage. While our new data show that the phenotype is not due to a defect in differentiation, the evidence points to a failure before multipolar neurons become bipolar. This is the same phenotype as we described before when we inhibited Reelin receptors, Rap1 or N‐cadherin (Ncad) (Jossin and Cooper, 2011). In those experiments, we tracked neurons in slice cultures and found that migration speed was normal but the migration paths were more erratic, with more neurons moving down or sideways compared with controls. While we now lack the facilities to image neurons in slice culture, we show that blocking FGFR signaling has a similar effect as blocking Rap1 or NCad on neuron morphology and orientation near the top of the multipolar zone. Moreover, FGFR expression rescues multipolar neurons with inactive Rap1. Since Rap1 and NCad‐dependent FGFR activation by Reelin stimulates Erk, and since inhibiting Erk also delays neurons at the multipolar stage, we suspect that FGFRs may be needed for Erk‐dependent signals activated by Reelin in multipolar neurons. These signals might include expression of genes required for polarization, orientation or migration, but it would likely require single cell RNA‐Seq to identify a distinct differentiation state. To avoid misleading the reader as to the precise nature of the migration defect, we have now replaced “defect in neuronal migration” with “defect in multipolar migration”.</p><p>2) The original paper presented in vivo results, from in utero electroporation, showing:</p><p>a) Dominant‐negative FGFRs disturb the migration of neurons with multipolar morphology and impair their orientation towards the cortical plate.</p><p>b) Wildtype FGFR expression rescues migration of neurons with inhibited Rap1.</p><p>c) Ncad‐mediated cell‐cell adhesion is not needed for neuron migration in vivo.</p><p>d) NCad that cannot bind FGFRs does not rescue neurons with inhibited Rap1.</p><p>e) Over‐expressing ubiquitin K27R inhibits FGFR downregulation and rescues Rap1inhibited neurons.</p><p>f) While both ECad and NCad bind FGFRs, ECad does not prevent FGFR degradation and does not rescue multipolar migration in vivo unless it carries the NCad EC1‐2 region.</p><p>g) Dominant‐negative but not wildtype Erk1 or Erk2 inhibits multipolar neuron migration in vivo.</p><p>These in vivo experiments were complemented by experiments with cultured embryonic cortical neurons showing that long‐term stimulation with Reelin increases endogenous <italic>FGFR1</italic> expression and activates Erk, dependent on FGFR kinase activity, and that endogenous FGFRs are degraded by the lysosome pathway. Transfected HEK293 cells were used for biochemical experiments to validate the NCad mutants used, to confirm that NCad binds to and inhibits ubiquitination and degradation of FGFRs, and to identify the ubiquitin linkage in polyubiquitinated FGFR. In restructuring the paper, we have moved many of the HEK293 experiments to supplementary figures, to focus attention on the in vivo and neuron culture experiments. We also provide the following new data:</p><p>a) Neuron proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation state, as determined with</p><p><italic>Sox2</italic>, Tbr2 and Satb2, are unaffected when FGFRs are inhibited in vivo (new Figure 2A).</p><p>b) Inhibition of FGFRs in vivo affects the morphological switch from multipolar to bipolar (new Figure 2C).</p><p>c) Transfected FGFR levels decrease when Rap1 is inhibited in utero (new Figure 3B).</p><p>d) Endogenous FGFR levels increase when NCad is expressed in primary neurons (new Figure 3C).</p><p>e) Increased FGFR protein levels and activation of Erk in Reelin‐stimulated neurons requires Rap1 and NCad (new Figure 8D).</p><p>Other figures have been updated with improved data. We hope that the reviewers will understand that repeating all the biochemical experiments in neurons would be very time consuming and will excuse the remaining HEK293 experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Overall the manuscript by Kon et al. investigates timely aspects in cortical development.

Unfortunately, we no longer have the facilities for live imaging. Nevertheless, we improved the quality of the images provided in the new Figure 2B so the reader could better appreciate the phenotype. We went further in the description of the phenotype by showing a delay in the morphological transition from multipolar to bipolar cell (new Figure 2C). While the phenotype is very similar to that caused by inhibiting Rap1 or NCad (Jossin and Cooper, 2011),, we have bolstered the evidence that FGFR function is linked to the Reelin/Rap1/NCad pathway by adding new data: Reelin increases FGFR signaling in primary cortical neuron cultures, in an NCad‐dependent manner; Rap1 inhibition in vivo decreases FGFR protein level in multipolar neurons; NCad over‐expression in neurons increases FGFR protein level; FGFR inhibition does not alter cell fate, proliferation or survival in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 5B could be improved by showing the real microscopic images that relate to the quantification chart.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments.

The first result is expected in light of our observation of a defect in multipolar migration. The second result also suggests parallels with Reelin signaling, because Reelin also increases spine density. Szczurkowska et al. have the added twist that another cell adhesion molecule, NEGR1 also inhibits FGFR degradation. This suggests that at least two pathways – Reelin/Rap1/NCad and NEGR1 – stabilize FGFRs and increase signaling. We have added a concluding paragraph commenting on this new paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Cooper and colleagues &quot;FGFR ubiquitination and degradation controls neuronal migration in vivo&quot; presents a series of experiments on cortical development the stated purpose of which is to investigate the role of FGF receptors in the migration of cortical projection neurons.

We use now the more precise term “multipolar migration”. Cortical projection neurons go through two types of migration: multipolar migration and bipolar migration (or locomotion). Our results show that FGFRs are important for the multipolar migration that occurs before locomotion. The results provided here suggest that the Reelin/Rap1/Ncad pathway regulates FGFRs to control multipolar migration and our previous studies on Rap1‐inhibited neurons revealed no alteration in locomotion. We are sorry that it was confusing and we have made changes in the text to clarify this issue. Please see general point 1 above.</p><p>We have now added immunostaining results to show that neuronal differentiation, proliferation and survival are not affected in vivo (Figure 2A). However, we cannot exclude that the neurons are in a subtly different stage of differentiation that may be revealed by detailed gene expression analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, while the pathways that impact FGFR dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation and degradation are interesting vis a vis downstream signaling pathways, and the experiments are nicely done, the experiments are carried out in HEK293 cells, not on developing cortical neurons.

In the re‐submission, we have added new data showing that NCad over‐expression in cortical neurons increases endogenous <italic>FGFR1</italic> protein level (new Figure 3C), that activation of Erk in Reelin simulated cortical neurons requires Rap1 and NCad (new Figure 8D), and that FGFR levels decrease when Rap1 is inhibited in utero (Figure 3B). HEK293 cells, which share features with neurons (Shaw et al. 2002, PMID 11967234), were used to validate the NCad mutants used, to confirm that NCad binds to and inhibits ubiquitination and degradation of FGFRs, and to identify the K27/29 ubiquitin linkage in polyubiquitinated FGFR. Such an extensive series of transfection experiments would be challenging in primary neurons. We feel that the preponderance of evidence supports the model depicted in Figure 9B, but there are gaps in our knowledge that we discuss frankly in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific issues include the following:</p><p>1) Expression of a dominant negative form of the receptor is not as clean as a conditional genetic experiment in cortical projection neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the use of dominant‐negative forms has disadvantages but conditional knockout with post‐mitotic neuronal drivers such as Dcx‐Cre may not be effective if there is perdurance of FGFR mRNA or protein. In addition, <italic>FGFR1</italic>‐3 have overlapping activators and downstream effectors. By using the NeuroD promoter to inhibit the whole family of FGFRs we can rapidly inhibit FGFR signaling in migrating neurons without disrupting neurogenesis. There were no effects of electroporating the full-length FGFRs under similar conditions, suggesting that FGFR cytoplasmic domain functions are required for normal migration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As is true with many electroporation approaches, the identity of the neuronal populations that are affected are not specified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this limitation. The neuronal populations affected are those derived from apical progenitors in the neocortical VZ at the time of electroporation and their progeny. This includes postmitotic neurons and basal progenitors. However, the number of Tbr2 positive basal progenitors in the electroporated area was not affected by DN FGFRs (new Figure 2A). In addition, there was no change in the number of Satb2 positive neurons destined for the upper CP, or in <italic>Sox2</italic> positive apical neural stem cells. Cell proliferation and cell survival were also unaffected (new Figure 2A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is no direct evidence that the FGFR family members act redundantly during the transition from the multipolar to bipolar stage and migration into the cortical plate.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>FGFR1</italic>‐3 are all expressed in the developing neocortex. Single mutants have subtle defects and the triple mutant has no telencephalon, precluding investigation of neuron migration (Paek et al., 2009; Iwata and Hevner, 2009). However, our use of dominant negatives, which inhibit the family by forming heterodimers (Ueno et al., 1992), suggests that one or more family members is important for migration. Moreover, each family member has the ability to rescue Rap1‐inhibited neurons. They thus act interchangeably under these conditions. The Wikipedia definition of genetic redundancy is “situations where a given biochemical function is redundantly encoded by two or more genes”. However, since we have not been able to formally prove that each family member functions in multipolar migration when expressed at endogenous level in vivo, we now say the evidence “suggests” that the FGFR family members act redundantly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the dominant negative FGFR dimerize with receptors other than FGFR family members or N-Cad? Such interactions could contribute to the phenotypes observed.</p></disp-quote><p>The dominant‐negative mutants that were used have an intact extracellular domain but truncated cytoplasmic domain. They have the potential to interfere with endogenous FGFRs by competing for extracellular partners, including FGFs, NCad, NCAM, L1CAM and NEGR1, or by inhibiting endogenous FGFR kinase activation by forming mixed heterodimers. However, ability of both NCad and FGFR to rescue migration of Rap1 inhibited neurons, coupled with the lack of rescue by NCadΔEC4 and the finding that dominant‐negative NCad inhibits Reelin‐induced FGFR activation in neurons makes us favor NCad as the relevant partner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Does NCad-dEC4 bind to receptors other than FGFRs?</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware of any studies.

HEK293T cells share features with neurons and are easy to transfect (Shaw et al., 2002). Nevertheless, we have added new data to the paper showing that endogenous <italic>FGFR1</italic> protein level increases when NCad is overexpressed in cultured cortical neurons (new Figure 3C), that inhibiting Rap1 in neurons in utero decreases FGFR protein level (new Figure 3B) and that the effect of Reelin on FGFRs in cortical neurons depends on NCad and Rap1 (new Figure 8D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There appears to be a disconnect between the Rap1/CDH2/FGFR and Reelin/FGFR/ERK1 and 2 signaling pathways in this manuscript that are bridged by the following sentence and the authors' previous paper &quot;The Rap1-dependent upregulation of NCad is triggered by Reelin, an extracellular ligand present in the MMZ (Jossin and Cooper, 2011)&quot;.

FGFR1 appears even lower when co-expressed with NCad-HA. On the other hand, NCad-dEC4, which is proposed to not interact with FGFR1, seems to increase FGFR1 expression.

The same figure also shows that the EC4 domain-containing chimeric E/NCad does not increase FGFR or promote migration. This is confusing. If NCad does interact with FGFR1 via EC4 and promotes migration via EC1-2, it would suggest that homophilic binding of NCad or heterophilic binding to other proteins, in addition to heterophilic NCad:FGFR binding, plays a role in migration. Nevertheless, the authors present data indicating that homophilic NCad interactions do not have a role migration. These data need clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>This is exactly what we are claiming in this manuscript. Binding of NCad EC4 to FGFR is necessary but not sufficient to inhibit FGFR degradation. Indeed, ECad also interacts with FGFR through its EC4 but is unable to prevent FGFR degradation or promote neuronal migration in vivo. An NCad molecule containing EC4‐5 from ECad still protects FGFR from degradation and promotes neuron migration in vivo. The reciprocal switch, putting EC4 of NCad into ECad, does not give to ECad the ability to prevent FGFR degradation or to promote neuronal migration in vivo. The protection from degradation and promotion of migration map to EC1‐2 even though it needs the NCad‐FGFR interaction through EC4. This EC1‐2 function is not NCad‐NCad homophilic binding. We suggest that another protein interacting with NCad but not ECad EC1‐2 might be involved. Discovering this third partner is however beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Were the ERK1/2 constructs expressed in cortical neurons selectively expressed in post-mitotic cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we used the NeuroD promoter, as stated in the figure legend (Figure 9A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The Discussion ends rather abruptly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment, and have added a concluding paragraph.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Kon et al. revised their manuscript ʺFGFR ubiquitination and degradation controls neuronal migration in vivoʺ to reflect their observation that cortical neurons appear to stall at the multipolar stage when FGFR signaling is perturbed by transgenic expression of DN FGFR. They have done a nice job of streamlining the biochemical and in utero electroporation epistasis experiments, and performing more of the biochemical experiments in cultured cortical neurons as requested, to work out the signaling mechanism involved. While the manuscript overall has improved, there are several issues that I feel do not make it suitable for publication in eLife at this time and may be more suitable for a more specialized journal.</p><p>First, I still worry that expression of a DN FGFR, as opposed to conditional genetic loss of function experiments, may have some off-target effects. In addition, the finding by Szczurkowska et al., 2018, that FGFR2 regulates neuronal migration and spine density suggests that the FGFRs may not act redundantly.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed the issue of specificity of FGFRs downregulation and overlapping functions of FGFRs in multipolar migration. We specifically knock‐down <italic>FGFR1</italic>, 2 and 3. We tested at least 6 shRNA for each receptor and selected the most efficient. The efficiency of the shRNAs was tested in cell culture and in vivo as explained in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p>We found that the in vivo knock‐down of <italic>FGFR1</italic> and 2 induces an arrest of cells at the MMZ, with a more pronounced phenotype when the two receptors are downregulated together (Figure 1B). The knock‐down of FGFR3 resulted in a small, statistically non‐significant effect on cell positioning (Figure 1B). These results suggest that FGFRs work redundantly with a prominent role for <italic>FGFR1</italic> and <italic>FGFR2</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #2 was also concerned that FGFR(DN) could affect NCad. We found that in cell culture, FGFR(DN) does not change NCad protein expression level, does not reduce NCad homophilic interaction and does not prevent NCad accumulation at cell‐cell junctions (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, I do not agree that the terminology &quot;multipolar migration&quot; is justified without more detailed analysis of the cellular mechanism involved. Better high magnification/resolution images of cell morphology at this stage, combined with live imaging, would be required to determine why and how these cells are stalling.</p></disp-quote><p>To gain insight into the mechanism underlying the migration defect, we analyzed the morphology of migrating neurons. Analysis of the morphology revealed no difference in the number of neurites or in the cell body length‐to‐width ratio of FGFR‐inhibited multipolar neurons compared to control multipolar neurons</p><p>(Figure 2B-D). In addition, the few FGFR‐inhibited bipolar neurons migrating in the RMZ exhibited no difference in the length of the leading process and the cell body length‐to‐width ratio compared to control cells and possess an axon at the rear (Figure 2G=I).</p></body></sub-article></article>
