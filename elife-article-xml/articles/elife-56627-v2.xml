NEC deforms the inner nuclear membrane (INM) around the capsid by forming a hexagonal array. However, how the NEC coat interacts with the capsid and how curved coats are generated to enable budding is yet unclear. Here, by structure-guided truncations, confocal microscopy, and cryoelectron tomography, we show that binding of the capsid protein UL25 promotes the formation of NEC pentagons rather than hexagons. We hypothesize that during nuclear budding, binding of UL25 situated at the pentagonal capsid vertices to the NEC at the INM promotes formation of NEC pentagons that would anchor the NEC coat to the capsid. Incorporation of NEC pentagons at the points of contact with the vertices would also promote assembly of the curved hexagonal NEC coat around the capsid, leading to productive egress of UL25-decorated capsids.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nuclear egress complex</kwd><kwd>membrane budding</kwd><kwd>capsid budding</kwd><kwd>herpes simplex virus type 1</kwd><kwd>herpesvirus</kwd><kwd>nuclear egress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM111795</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heldwein</surname><given-names>Ekaterina E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD018111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Z Hong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U24GM116792</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Z Hong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>55108533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heldwein</surname><given-names>Ekaterina E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM126760</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Draganova</surname><given-names>Elizabeth B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI-1338135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Z Hong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMR-1548924</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Z Hong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Collaborative Research Travel Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Draganova</surname><given-names>Elizabeth B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Natalie V.

Viruses are thus experts at hijacking, manipulating, and, sometimes, even remodeling cellular architecture during viral morphogenesis and egress. Identifying and understanding the unique aspects of virus-induced cellular remodeling could unveil targets for therapeutic intervention; yet, we are only beginning to understand the mechanisms behind many of these processes.</p><p>One prominent example of virus-induced remodeling of cellular architecture can be observed during egress of herpesviruses â enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect a wide range of hosts, from mollusks to humans. All herpesviruses can establish lifelong, latent infections within the host, from which they can periodically reactivate, spreading to uninfected tissues and hosts and causing a number of ailments. When the virus actively replicates during a primary infection or reactivation of a latent infection, the progeny virions are assembled and released from the cell in a process termed egress whereby herpesvirus capsids traverse severalÂ cellular membranes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bigalke and Heldwein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson and Baines, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roller and Baines, 2017</xref>). First, nuclear capsids bud at the inner nuclear membrane (INM) forming enveloped vesicles that pinch off into the perinuclear space. These perinuclear envelopedÂ virions fuse with the outer nuclear membrane, which releases the capsids into the cytosol. Cytoplasmic capsids then bud again at vesicles derived from the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network and early endosomes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson and Baines, 2011</xref>) to form mature, infectious virions that are released from the cell by exocytosis. Whereas many enveloped viruses acquire their lipid envelopes by budding at the cytoplasmic membranes or the plasma membrane, herpesviruses are unusual among vertebrate viruses in their ability to bud at the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bigalke and Heldwein, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Capsid budding at the nuclear envelope requires two conserved herpesviral proteins, which are named UL31 and UL34 in herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), that form the nuclear egress complex (NEC) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bigalke and Heldwein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigalke and Heldwein, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mettenleiter et al., 2013</xref>). The NEC heterodimer is anchored at the INM through the single C-terminal transmembrane helix of UL34 and faces the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shiba et al., 2000</xref>). UL31 is a nuclear phosphoprotein that colocalizes with UL34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang and Roizman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reynolds et al., 2001</xref>) and interacts with the capsid during nuclear egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trus et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang and Baines, 2011</xref>). Both UL31 and UL34 are necessary for efficient nuclear egress, and in the absence of either protein, capsids accumulate in the nucleus and viral replication is reduced by several orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuchs et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roller et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we discovered that HSV-1 NEC has an intrinsic ability to deform and bud membranes by demonstrating that purified recombinant NEC vesiculates synthetic lipid bilayers in vitro without any additional factors or chemical energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bigalke et al., 2014</xref>). Similar findings were reported with the NEC homolog from a closely related pseudorabies virus (PRV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lorenz et al., 2015</xref>). Using cryogenic electron microscopy and tomography (cryoEM/ET), we showed that the NEC forms hexagonal âhoneycombâ coats on the inner surface of budded vesicles formed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bigalke et al., 2014</xref>). Very similar hexagonal coats were observed in capsidless perinuclear vesicles formed in vivo, in uninfected cells expressing PRV NEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hagen et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, HSV-1 NEC formed a hexagonal lattice of the same dimensions in crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bigalke and Heldwein, 2015</xref>). The high-resolution crystal structure of the hexagonal NEC lattice revealed interactions at the lattice interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bigalke and Heldwein, 2015</xref>), and subsequent work confirmed that mutations that disrupt oligomeric interfaces reduce budding in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bigalke and Heldwein, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bigalke et al., 2014</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arii et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roller et al., 2010</xref>). Collectively, these findings established the NEC as a viral budding machine that generates negative membrane curvature by oligomerizing into a hexagonal coat on the surface of the membrane.</p><p>What remains unclear, however, is how the NEC achieves appropriate coat geometry compatible with negative membrane curvature formation during budding. A purely hexagonal arrangement is flat, so curvature is typically achieved either by insertions of pentagons as found at 12 vertices of an icosahedron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zandi et al., 2004</xref>), or by inclusion of irregular defects as observed in several viral coats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heuser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hyun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schur et al., 2015</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the capsid geometry may influence the geometry of the NEC coat. In perinuclear visualized in infected cells, the NEC coats appear to be tightly associated with the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hagen et al., 2015</xref>). Capsid interactions with the NEC during nuclear budding may be mediated by binding of the capsid protein UL25 to UL31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang and Baines, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, UL25 forms pentagonal complexes at the vertices of the icosahedral herpesvirus capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai and Zhou, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Furlong, 1978</xref>). However, it is unknown whether interaction with a mature capsid could promote pentagonal formation within NEC coats and if so, how the NEC coat would be arranged around the capsid.</p><p>A fortuitous observation that HSV-1 UL25, a capsid protein that decorates the vertices, co-localizes with synthetic liposomes in vitro in the presence of the NEC prompted us to investigate interactions between UL25 and NEC and the effect of UL25 on NEC-mediated budding in vitro. Here, by confocal microscopy, we show that free UL25 (i.e., not on capsid vertices) inhibits NEC-mediated budding in vitro. 3D visualization of the molecular architecture by cryoET further revealed that free UL25 forms a looselyÂ linkedÂ net of five-pointed stars on top of membrane-bound NEC layer that may block budding by preventing membrane-bound NEC coats from undergoing conformational changes required for budding. We also found that the NEC forms an alternative pentagonal, rather than hexagonal, arrangement when bound to UL25, and that this phenomenon requires residues 45â73 that form the UL25/UL25 helical bundles on the native capsids. We hypothesize that during nuclear budding, NEC pentagons areÂ formed at the points of contact with the capsid vertices and that they both help anchor the NEC coat to the capsid and generate appropriate coat curvature through the inclusion of pentagons into a hexagonal coat as it assembles around the capsid. This mechanism would ensure successful budding and egress of the UL25-decorated viral capsid.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of UL25 variants</title><p>HSV-1 UL25 can be expressed in soluble form in <italic>E. coli</italic> only when residues 1â44 are deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowman et al., 2006</xref>). Residues 1â50 are necessary and sufficient for capsid binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cockrell et al., 2009</xref>), and in the cryoEM structure of the HSV-1 capsid, these residues mediate extensive interactions with another capsid protein, UL17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai and Zhou, 2018</xref>). This suggests that these residues are likely disordered in free UL25, potentially leading to aggregation and poor solubility. Therefore, we generated and expressed an HSV-1 UL25â44 construct, which lacks residues 1â44. UL25â44 was soluble and could be purified, in agreement with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowman et al., 2006</xref>), but was proteolytically cleaved during purification despite the presence of protease inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). N-terminal sequencing of the single proteolytic product by Edman degradation yielded the amino acid sequence AAELPV, corresponding to residues 73â78. This suggested that UL25â44 was cleaved between residues Q72 and A73. To prevent heterogeneity due to cleavage, we generated two constructs: UL25â44 Q72A, which has a single point mutation designed to eliminate the cleavage site, and UL25â73, which corresponds to the cleavage product. Both constructs yielded a single UL25 species after purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of NEC-mediated budding by UL25 constructs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The UL25 structure and a diagram of domain organization is shown along with a multiple sequence alignment of UL25 residues 45â74 from five alphaherpesviruses.

However, eGFP-UL25â44 Q72A construct was unstable during purification, so eGFP-UL25â50 Q72A was generated instead. eGFP-UL25â50 Q72A (as well as its untagged version UL25â50 Q72A) efficiently inhibited NEC-mediated budding, whereas eGFP-UL25â73 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). When eGFP-tagged UL25 constructs were incubated with the fluorescently labelled GUVs, no eGFP signal was detected on the GUV membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), confirming that UL25 did not bind membranes directly.</p><p>Next, eGFP-UL25â50 was incubated with the GUVs in the presence of the NEC220, at a 1:10 molar ratio of NEC to UL25 (the minimal inhibitory UL25 concentration).

We hypothesize that the adjacent NEC pentagons capped with UL25 stars are loosely connected, which results in a patchy network of pentagons instead of small, well-defined coats that would form if the arrangement were rigid. Regardless, the cryoET data clearly show the ability of the NEC to form an alternative, pentagonal arrangement in the presence of UL25 thus documenting the ability of the NEC to form different types of oligomers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The intrinsic ability of the NEC to deform and bud membranes and to oligomerize into a hexagonal coat is well established (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bigalke and Heldwein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigalke and Heldwein, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mettenleiter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roller and Baines, 2017</xref>).

First, UL25 binds the NEC on lipid vesicles in vitro and inhibits NEC-mediated budding in a dose-dependent manner. Second, the NEC forms pentagons when bound to UL25. We hypothesize that UL25/NEC interactions observed in vitro mimic UL25/NEC interactions that anchor the NEC coat to the capsid vertices. We further hypothesize that NEC pentagons formed at the points of contact with the capsid vertices could nucleate the assembly of the otherwise hexagonal NEC coats and introduce curvature into them.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>UL25 inhibits NEC-mediated budding in vitro by forming a star-shaped net over the membrane-bound NEC layer</title><p>We found that UL25â44 Q72A construct inhibited NEC220-mediated budding in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. We also observed that this UL25 construct formed five-pointed stars linked into a loose net on the surface of the membrane-bound NEC220 layer. To understand the nature of inhibition by UL25, we modelled UL25 interactions within the stars by examining UL25 interactions on the capsids. The five-pointed UL25 stars formed in vitro resemble the five-pointed stars crowning each capsid vertex that are composed of five copies of the capsid-associated tegument complex (CATC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai and Zhou, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).

Therefore, we hypothesize that UL25â44 Q72A also forms an antiparallel four-helix bundle when bound to the NEC220 on the membrane surface in vitro.

While we cannot exclude the possibility that the UL25 can oligomerize in solution at protein concentrations higher than what was used in our experiments, we favor an alternative hypothesis that UL25 oligomerization requires a binding partner â a capsid or an NEC oligomer. The latter notion is supported by our observations that the NEC and UL25 do not interact in solution but do interact when the NEC is tethered to a scaffold, for example, the membrane of a lipid vesicle or the surface of an SPR chip.</p><p>We propose that UL25â44 Q72A inhibits NEC220-mediated budding in vitro by binding the membrane-bound NEC and forming five-pointed stars on top of NEC pentagons that are linked into a loose net (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Such a net could inhibit budding by restricting conformational changes within the NEC lattice necessary to generate negative membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>).

Both in vitro and in NEC-expressing uninfected cells, the NEC is constitutively active. However, during infection, the NEC budding activity is controlled,Â presumably by a viral protein, to ensure budding of only mature capsids and to prevent premature, non-productive budding. It would be interesting to test whether co-expression of UL25 along with the NEC could inhibit NEC-mediated budding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>UL25/NEC interactions in vitro mayÂ mimic interactions between CATC at the capsid vertices and the NEC coats during infection</title><p>How the NEC coat is anchored to the capsid is yet unclear. Nevertheless, interactions between UL25 and UL31 have been implicated in this process. UL31 from HSV-1 infected cell lysates was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with UL25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang and Baines, 2011</xref>) and bind nucleocapsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). More recently, NEC185â50 (a previously crystallized truncated construct with an intact membrane-distal UL31 region) from <italic>E. coli</italic> was shown to bind purified nucleocapsids from HSV-1 infected cells in a pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takeshima et al., 2019</xref>). This interaction requires UL25 because the VP5, VP23, and UL17 capsid proteins were only detected if UL25 was present on capsids, suggesting NEC binds capsid-bound UL25. UL25 likely binds to the membrane-distal tip of UL31 because capsid binding to the NEC requires UL31 residues R281 and D282, which are located in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takeshima et al., 2019</xref>). Other charged residues within the membrane-distal region of UL31 have also been implicated in capsid interactions in PRV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">RÃ¶nfeldt et al., 2017</xref>). Our work showed that four mutations within this membrane-distal region (NEC22-CBM) rendered this mutant less sensitive to inhibition by UL25 relative to the WT NEC220. Collectively, these observations implicate interactions between UL25 and the membrane-distal end of UL31 in NEC/capsid interactions during nuclear egress.</p><p>In our cryoET reconstruction, UL25 cores sit on the membrane-distal ends of the NEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that the interactions between UL25 and membrane-bound NEC that we observed by cryoET in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b and d</xref>) mimic how the NEC interacts with UL25 on the capsid vertices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and c</xref>). Although the distance between the presumed locations of the cores within the UL25 stars observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>) is shorter than between the cores of the innermost UL25 copies within the CATC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), the cores could move into most favorable orientations for NEC binding. Indeed,Â in cryoEM reconstruction of the HSV-1 capsid, the cores are connected to the N-terminal helices by long, flexible linkers and appear dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai and Zhou, 2018</xref>). On the other hand, the NEC may be able to tilt relative to the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), which would also allow each NEC to adopt the optimal orientation for binding the UL25 cores at the capsid vertices. The model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and c</xref> illustrates how the NEC coat may be anchored to the capsid.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The NEC pentagons could introduce curvature into the hexagonal NEC lattice</title><p>The ability of the NEC to oligomerize into a hexagonal lattice in vitro and in vivo is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bigalke and Heldwein, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bigalke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hagen et al., 2015</xref>) and is an important feature of its membrane deformation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bigalke and Heldwein, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bigalke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roller et al., 2010</xref>). But how the hexagonal NEC lattice accommodates curvature is yet unclear.</p><p>A strictly hexagonal lattice is flat, so the curvature is typically achieved through the inclusion of lattice defects, also termed insertions. These can either be regular insertions of a different geometry, for example, pentagons â as observed in icosahedral or fullerene-like capsids â or irregular insertions. Although no deviations from the hexagonal symmetry have yet been visualized in any NEC coats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bigalke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hagen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Newcomb et al., 2017</xref>), this could be due to the low resolution of the cryoET reconstructions or the imposition of symmetry in averaging. For example, one study used cryoEM and cryoET to visualize NEC/capsid interactions within perinuclear enveloped virions isolated from cells infected with an US3 kinase-null HSV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Newcomb et al., 2017</xref>), a mutation that causes the accumulation of perinuclear enveloped virions. Although only the hexagonal NEC arrays were observed, the averaging of NEC/CATC interactions was hindered by significant noise in the relevant regions of the tomograms because the NEC coat did not have the same icosahedral symmetry as the capsid. As the result, NEC/CATC interactions were difficult to visualize. Additionally, the lack of US3 could have altered the structure of the NEC coat or the NEC/CATC interactions.</p><p>In perinuclear envelopedÂ virions formed in PRV-infected cells, the NEC coats appear tightly associated with the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hagen et al., 2015</xref>). Capsidless perinuclear vesicles formed in uninfected cells expressing PRV NEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hagen et al., 2015</xref>) are relatively uniform in size (~115 nm in diameter; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, inset) but smaller than the capsid (~125 nm in diameter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai and Zhou, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) or the perinuclear envelopedÂ virions isolated from cells infected with the HSV-1 US3-null mutant virus (~160 nm in diameter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Newcomb et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The capsid thus appears to define the size of NEC-budded vesicles during infection, so the capsid geometry could influence the geometry of the NEC coat.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model of NEC-mediated budding in HSV-1 infected cells.</title><p>Capsid-bound UL25 induces the formation of pentagonal insertions (purple pentamers) within the NEC coat (pink hexamers and white monomers) as it is forming, which enables the formation of an NEC coat of appropriate size and curvature around the capsid.

This finding suggests that during nuclear egress, NEC pentagons could form at the points of contact with UL25 (within CATC) at the capsid vertices. The inclusion of pentagons into a hexagonal coat would help generate the NEC coat of appropriate curvature as it assembles around the capsid. A similar strategy is observed during HIV-1 capsid formation by the Gag protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mattei et al., 2016</xref>). As the mature capsid is built, the Gag protein is cleaved, and the Gag capsid-domain builds a hexagonal lattice containing 12 pentamers to form a closed fullerene-like structure.</p><p>In vitro and in NEC-expressing cells, curved NEC coats are assembled even in the absence of a capsid, and we do not yet understand how the curvature can be achieved in these cases. Hexagonal NEC coats formed in in vitro or in NEC-expressing cells have a smaller diameter than those formed around the capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), however, they may achieve coat curvature by other means, for example, by having irregular defects. Incorporation of irregular defects into curved hexagonal lattices has been observed for immature HIV capsids formed by Gag protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schur et al., 2015</xref>) and in early poxvirus envelopes formed by the D13 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heuser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hyun et al., 2011</xref>).

Although in vitro or in NEC-expressing cells, the NEC budding does not require either the capsid or UL25, in both cases, the NEC is already in its active, uninhibited form. In contrast, during infection, the budding activity of the NEC is somehow inhibited until the capsid comes along. Binding to UL25 on the capsid could potentiallyÂ serve as a trigger for releasing the NEC from its inhibited state, allowing budding to occur.</p><p>While UL25 is not required for NEC-mediated budding in vitro and in large amounts even inhibits it, small amounts of UL25 may be expected to stimulate budding in vitro by promoting formation of a limited number of NEC pentagons that could nucleate the coat assembly and promote coat curvature. Although we did not observe any stimulation of NEC-mediated budding by small amounts of UL25, thisÂ couldÂ be because in vitro, theÂ NEC is already active. Perhaps, the stimulatory effect of UL25 only manifests itself with the inhibited NEC. In the future, the knowledge of the mechanism by which the virus inhibits the NEC budding activity during infection would allow one to test if UL25 alone could overcome this inhibition in vitro. Alternatively, this inhibition can only be overcome by the capsid.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>A model of NEC-mediated capsid budding during infection</title><p>Based on our observations, we propose the following model of NEC-mediated capsid budding during nuclear egress in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Binding of the cores of five neighboring copies of CATC at the capsid vertices to the NEC at the INM would promote formation of NEC pentagons, which would serve as a nucleation event for the assembly of the NEC coat around the capsid and also help anchor the capsid to the INM. As the hexagonal NEC coat continues to grow, the incorporation of pentagons into the coat at the points of contact with the vertices would both help attach the NEC coat to the capsid and introduce curvature into the NEC coat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>In both HSV-1 and PRV, removal of UL25 results in an accumulation of capsids at the INM, unable to undergo egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klupp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kuhn et al., 2008</xref>). Our results suggest that UL25 both anchors the NEC coat to the capsid and contributes to formation of a curved coat. Additionally, our results could potentially explain why mostly mature, DNA-containing C-capsids undergo budding at the INM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klupp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roizman and Furlong, 1974</xref>). A- and B-capsids have fewer UL25 copies on the capsid surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Newcomb et al., 2006</xref>), and we hypothesize that only C-capsids, which contain UL25 at a full occupancy, can generate pentagonal NEC insertions necessary for the formation of an NEC coat around the capsid. In this manner, NEC/UL25 interactions could provide a quality-control mechanism that would favor budding of mature, DNA-containing C-capsids â which have a full UL25 set â over the capsid forms with fewer UL25 copies thereby acting as a checkpoint during nuclear egress.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

membrane and then fusing with the outer nuclear membrane. Previous studies by this group and others have elegantly shown that these viruses encode nuclear egress complex (NEC) that can form hexameric cages that carry capsids through the inner nuclear membrane. However, those studies left open the question of how these cages can fully close because a hexagonal lattice alone cannot enclose space. Here, Draganova and colleagues present a satisfying solution to this mystery by showing that the HSV-1 capsid protein, UL25, promotes the formation of NEC pentagons (rather than hexagons), thereby allowing the NEC to form closed, curved cages that comprise a hexagonal lattice with 12 pentameric &quot;defects&quot; that form at the points of contact with the capsid vertices.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural basis for capsid recruitment and coat formation during HSV-1 nuclear egress&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Draganova and colleagues study how truncation variants of the HSV capsid protein UL25 binds to the nuclear egress complex in the presence of membranes. They conclude that UL25 and NEC interact on membranes â the two proteins form a net of pentagons on the membrane and this inhibits NEC mediated budding in vitro. Net formation and inhibition are dependent on the presence of residues 45-73. They speculate that UL25 on the capsid causes NEC to form pentamers to generate curvature as it assembles around the capsid.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a nicely performed study, with careful attention to detail and proper controls and analyses. Overall, the writing is clear and compelling, with the exception of part of the Discussion (see below). The data demonstrating an inhibitory effect of residues 45-73 on NEC mediated budding in vitro appears sound but there are some minor issues which should be addressed. The in vitro system is artificial, and a link from the in vitro system to the in vivo model is not demonstrated, but the system nevertheless appears to be revealing several key structural insights into the assemblies: i.e., regulation of NEC budding by UL25/capsid, and identification of pentameric assemblies that are likely vertices to help drive membrane curvature to form the coat. Therefore, has the potential to be an important step in the understanding this process at the molecular level.</p><p>The biggest concern is that although the &quot;pentagon&quot; model is attractive, it needs to be more strongly supported. In particular, the data showing the presence of pentagons is not yet fully convincing, as discussed below.</p><p>1) The authors show a structure of the pentagon star from NEC220+UL25d44 after applying five-fold symmetry. They say that five-fold symmetry is apparent before this is applied, but this should be convincingly shown and carefully tested because this is a main conclusion. Are they sure that apparent five-fold symmetry is not an artefact, and why? What fraction of the protein is forming pentagons â most of it or just some of it? Are there also hexagons, or only pentagons. Do they in fact have a mixture of states and how has this possibility been tested? It should be possible to sort this issue out by further analysis or image processing of existing data, without performing any new experiments.</p><p>2) As the authors point out, a network of stars would make a small spherical object. This would enclose a vesicle with a radius of about 10 nm. This is not what they see. What do they think is the overall arrangement? Some pentagons on the surface surrounded by five other pentagons and then something else in between? They say that they cannot map the coordinates of the sub-tomograms back onto the raw data but some analysis of the arrangement is needed to understand what is happening. There is an inconsistency between the proposed structure (a pentagon surrounded by five pentagons) and the vesicle morphology (not very curved).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56627.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a nicely performed study, with careful attention to detail and proper controls and analyses.

Granted that no systematic errors were introduced, we are confident that this is not an artifact. Indeed, by applying the same workflow to the coats containing only NEC220 (Figure 5B), we observed a different â 6-fold â symmetry, which essentially serves as a negative control. We have previously applied the same protocol to resolve the trimeric structure of glycoprotein gB from human cytomegalovirus both in its pre- and postfusion forms (Si et al., 2018) and an asymmetric structure of the 96-nm axonemal repeat of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (Imhof et al., 2019).</p><p>Within the NEC220/UL25Î44 dataset, we only observed 5-fold symmetry in the protruding densities, whereas in the NEC220 dataset, we observed only 6-fold symmetry (Figure 5B). As far as we can tell, when bound to UL25Î44, the NEC220 forms only pentagons and not a mixture of pentagons and hexagons. We have included this description in the Results section of the manuscript (subsection âL25â44 Q72A forms a net of stars bound to NEC pentagonsâ, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As the authors point out, a network of stars would make a small spherical object.

Per reviewersâ suggestion, we mapped the coordinates of each sub-tomogram back onto the raw data and show that particles selected for analysis only partially cover the vesicles used for data processing (new Supplementary table 1 in Supplementary file 1). We have expanded the description of particle coverage in the last paragraph of the subsection âUL25â44 Q72A forms a net of stars bound to NEC pentagonsâ.</p><p>While such partial coverage is in line with visual observations, we want to point out that the surface coverage by particles selected for analysis (new Supplementary table 1 in Supplementary file 1) is lower than the estimate based on visual inspection. This is because particles were selected for analysis according to a set of criteria to ensure the highest achievable quality of the reconstructions. Specifically, distinct spike-like projections radiating outwards from the vesicle bilayer were defined as particles selected for analysis. Each spike was assigned two points (<italic>head</italic> and <italic>tail</italic>) in one contour using IMOD where the <italic>head</italic> and the <italic>tail</italic> are the membrane-proximal and the membrane-distal ends of the density protruding from the vesicle. Only spikes of similar length were selected to ensure that each contained both NEC220 and UL25â44 Q72A. We have added the description of the particle selection protocol to the Materials and methods section of the manuscript (subsection â3D reconstruction and subtomographic averagingâ).</p><p>Regarding the overall arrangement, we hypothesize that the interactions between adjacent UL25â44/NEC220 pentagons are not strong, which results in a loose network of pentagons forming patches instead of a small, spherical coats that would be formed if the arrangement were rigid. This interpretation is supported by the observation that the surrounding pentagons in the sub-tomographic averages (Figure 5) are not as sharply defined (lower resolution) as the central one (which contributed the most power to alignment during data processing), suggesting flexibility, likely due to weak interactions. We have added this explanation of the data to the manuscript (subsection âUL25â44 Q72A forms a net of stars bound to NEC pentagonsâ, last paragraph and Discussion).</p></body></sub-article></article>
