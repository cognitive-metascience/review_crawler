protein (GAP) with four C-terminal splice variants: α1, α2, β, and γ. Although studies have implicated <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> in several cognitive disorders, it is not clear which SynGAP isoforms contribute to disease. Here, we demonstrate that SynGAP isoforms exhibit unique spatiotemporal expression patterns and play distinct roles in neuronal and synaptic development in mouse neurons. SynGAP-α1, which undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation with PSD-95, is highly enriched in synapses and is required for LTP. In contrast, SynGAP-β, which does not bind PSD-95 PDZ domains, is less synaptically targeted and promotes dendritic arborization. A mutation in SynGAP-α1 that disrupts phase separation and synaptic targeting abolishes its ability to regulate plasticity and instead causes it to drive dendritic development like SynGAP-β. These results demonstrate that distinct intrinsic biochemical properties of SynGAP isoforms determine their function, and individual isoforms may differentially contribute to the pathogenesis of <italic>SYNGAP1</italic>-related cognitive disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>synaptic gtpase activating protein</kwd><kwd>liquid-liquid phase separation</kwd><kwd>dendritic development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH112151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huganir</surname><given-names>Richard L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS036715</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huganir</surname><given-names>Richard L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Detailed SYNGAP1 splice variant characterization uncovers distinct isoform functions and biochemical properties contributing to critical aspects of neurodevelopment, providing previously unknown isoform-level insight into SYNGAP1-related cognitive disorders.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>SynGAP is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that is highly enriched in dendritic spines of excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 1998</xref>). SynGAP is a Ras- and Rap- GTPase activating protein that facilitates the hydrolysis of small G protein-bound GTP (active) to GDP (inactive), thus negatively regulating the activity of small G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carlisle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pena et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rumbaugh et al., 2006</xref>). SynGAP is encoded by the <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> gene and is alternatively spliced to generate 4 distinct C-terminal isoforms: SynGAP-α1, SynGAP-α2, SynGAP-β, and SynGAP-γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McMahon et al., 2012</xref>). The C-terminal domain of SynGAP-α1 contains a class I PDZ ligand sequence (QTRV) which binds MAGUK family proteins such as PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 1998</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grant and O'Dell, 2001</xref>). Heterozygous deletion of <italic>Syngap1</italic> in rodents causes severe deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP) at synapses of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons that are innervated by Schaffer collaterals (SC), as well as severe working memory deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Komiyama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rumbaugh et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In humans, loss-of-function variants in <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> have been associated with Intellectual Disability (ID), epilepsy, Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), and Neurodevelopmental Disability (NDD). While there are hundreds of genetic risk factors for these disorders, the significantly elevated frequency and 100% penetrance of loss-of-function variants in <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> as well as the range of brain disorders associated with <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> pathogenicity make it unique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berryer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carvill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hamdan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hamdan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Satterstrom et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Many loss-of-function variants of the <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> gene have been causally associated with ID, epilepsy, ASD, and other NDDs.

Additionally, several MRD5-associated <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> missense mutations also cause SynGAP protein instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berryer et al., 2013</xref>). These data strongly suggest that <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> haploinsufficiency is pathogenic in <italic>SYNGAP1</italic>-associated ID and ASD. Thus, several lines of evidence in mice and humans support that SynGAP is a critical regulator of synaptic plasticity, development, and behavior.</p><p>We recently discovered that SynGAP-α1 is rapidly dispersed from dendritic spines during LTP, which allows for concomitant spine enlargement and accumulation of synaptic AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 2015</xref>). SynGAP-α1 dispersion from the dendritic spines releases the inhibition of synaptic RAS activity which is required for the expression of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harvey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murakoshi and Yasuda, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Walkup et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2002</xref>). Additionally, SynGAP is the third mostly highly expressed protein in the postsynaptic density (PSD) and can undergo multivalent interactions with PSD-95 via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a process of forming highly concentrated condensates with liquid-like properties, which may contribute to the formation of the PSD complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>). LLPS in cells is a phenomenon in which biochemical reactants are spatially clustered and concentrated in the absence of a surrounding membrane, allowing for organelle-like function without the physical and energetic barriers posed by lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>). Although SynGAP is an ideal candidate to provide the structural basis of PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>), the phase separation of SynGAP was extensively characterized only with SynGAP-α1. The degree to which the other SynGAP isoforms undergo activity-dependent dispersion and LLPS remains largely unknown, as does the functional significance of these isoforms.</p><p>Although <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> haploinsufficiency likely affects the expression of all SynGAP isoforms, only the α1 isoform has been rigorously characterized to date. Only a few functional studies of non-α1 SynGAP isoforms have been conducted to probe how these isoforms regulate synaptic physiology and disease pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McMahon et al., 2012</xref>). In these overexpression studies, the various SynGAP isoforms have been shown to have differing – and even opposing – effects on synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McMahon et al., 2012</xref>). However, as these were overexpression experiments, endogenous SynGAP was intact in this study, complicating interpretation of these results. It is currently unknown whether <italic>SYNGAP1</italic>-associated ID/ASD pathology is associated with select deficits of specific SynGAP isoforms that may underlie unique features of NDD.</p><p>Here, we report that SynGAP-α1 constitutes only 25–35% of total SynGAP protein in the brain, underscoring the importance of characterizing how the C-terminal SynGAP splice variants contribute to neuronal and synaptic development that are associated with the pathogenesis of <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> haploinsufficiency. In developing neurons, the various SynGAP isoforms display differences in neuroanatomical and subcellular expression. We report that SynGAP-β is expressed earlier in development than the other SynGAP isoforms, and functions specifically to promote dendritic arbor development. In contrast, SynGAP-α1 reaches peak expression later in development, and regulates the processes underlying synapse strengthening, including AMPAR insertion and dendritic spine enlargement. Our findings describe unique roles for select SynGAP isoforms in mediating different facets of neuronal function. Furthermore, we identify isoform-specific differences in biochemical interactions between SynGAP and PSD-95, and show how these differences are related to the functional mode of each isoform, regulating either synaptic plasticity or dendritic structure. These results suggest that individual SynGAP isoforms mediate distinct, specialized regulation of neuronal and synaptic development and will inform potential therapeutic strategies for treating <italic>SYNGAP1</italic>-related disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SynGAP isoforms have distinct and overlapping expression profiles during brain development</title><p><italic>SYNGAP1</italic> is alternatively spliced at several sites to include exons 18, 19, or 20 to generate four unique C-terminal isoforms: SynGAP-α1, SynGAP-α2, SynGAP-β, and SynGAP-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

To determine the expression profile of SynGAP isoforms, we isolated 8 brain regions from adult (P42) mice.

However, there are several isoform-specific differences in regional expression. For example, SynGAP-β and SynGAP-γ are weakly expressed in the olfactory bulb, and SynGAP-γ is expressed at low levels in the cerebellum. <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> mutations have been linked to NDDs such as ID and ASD, which suggests an important role for <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> in normal brain development. Thus, we sought to investigate the expression of the SynGAP isoforms throughout development in brain tissue from mice at several developmental stages spanning late embryogenesis to adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>, complete set of quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). SynGAP-β is expressed earlier in development (E18-P14) compared to other isoforms, whereas SynGAP-α2 is generally the most abundant isoform and reaches maximal expression at P21-P35. SynGAP-α1 expression also increases later in development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>). Expression of other synaptic proteins (GluA1, PSD-95, and TARPs) reached maximal expression between P21 and P42, which is similar to the timeframe for maximal expression of SynGAP-α1 and SynGAP-α2.</p><p>In order to more rigorously quantify the expression levels of SynGAP isoforms over development, using standardized detection ratios of each isoform to total SynGAP based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, we calculated the relative abundance (% total SynGAP) of each isoform at P0 and P42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>). SynGAP-β is relatively highly expressed at P0 (34.6 ± 0.6%) and decreases to 15.7 ± 0.8% at P42. SynGAP-α2 expression increases more slowly than the β isoform prenatally, but is also well expressed at P0 (31.9 ± 0.4%). The α2 isoform is the most abundant isoform at P42 (44.9 ± 1.5%), which is consistent with a previous finding that SynGAP-α2 is the dominant isoform at the level of mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yokoi et al., 2017</xref>). SynGAP-α1 exhibits relatively low expression levels at P0 (24.3 ± 0.3%) and then accumulates throughout development, eventually becoming the second-most highly expressed isoform when measured at P42 (35.0 ± 0.9%) next to the α2 isoform. SynGAP-γ is expressed at low levels throughout development (9.1 ± 0.5% at P0, and 4.3 ± 0.3% at P42) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>To extend our protein-level observations and investigate the correspondence to human <italic>SYNGAP1</italic>, we analyzed previously published human brain RNAseq data (n = 338) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jaffe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>, Reads per 80 million mapped (RP80M) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). Consistent with our biochemical estimates, splice junctions that lead to the β isoform comprised ~22% of all reads spanning the exon 17–18 junction and decreased slightly across development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). At the α1/ α2/γ junction, which is relevant in the non-β transcripts (the remaining 78%), we observe that junction reads corresponding to the α2 isoform are the most abundant across all ages (~56% of reads spanning exon 18 to 19/20 junctions), and the α1 isoform follows at ~35%, increasing slowly throughout development, while the γ isoform junction reads are rare (~9% of non-β) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). This correspondence with protein data shows that the SynGAP isoform abundance levels are tightly controlled at the level of splicing, and the relative ratios across development are conserved in mice and humans. Therefore, we next tested whether these isoforms have unique neuronal functions and play distinct roles in <italic>SYNGAP1</italic>-related pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Unique biochemical properties and subcellular localization patterns of SynGAP isoforms</title><p>To better understand potential isoform-specific functions of SynGAP in neurons, we first investigated differences in LLPS, a mechanism for the effective subcellular organization of cellular proteins. We previously discovered that SynGAP-α1 undergoes LLPS with PSD-95 at physiological concentrations in vitro, resulting in the concentration of SynGAP into dense condensates that are reminiscent of the PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>). To investigate the biochemical and phase separation propensities of other SynGAP isoforms, we first performed a sedimentation assay in HEK 293 T cells transfected with constructs encoding tagged full-length PSD-95 and SynGAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Here, centrifugation of the sample resulted in two fractions: the insoluble-protein-containing pellet fraction (termed: [P]) and the soluble supernatant fraction (termed: [S]). The ratio of each protein in the condensed phase fraction ([P] /([S] + [P]), termed ‘Sedimentation index’) was calculated to indicate the propensity of the protein to undergo LLPS. Both myc-PSD-95 and GFP-SynGAP-α1 wild-type (WT) remain mostly in the soluble fraction when expressed alone in HEK 293 T cells (23.1 ± 4.2% of PSD-95 in the pellet fraction, 38.2 ± 0.5% of SynGAP-α1 in the pellet fraction when expressed alone, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Co-expression of myc-PSD-95 and GFP-SynGAP-α1 WT causes a dramatic increase in the abundance of both proteins in the pellet [P] fraction (80.3 ± 2.2% of PSD-95 and 74.7 ± 3.3% of SynGAP-α1 in the pellet fraction when co-expressed, ***p&lt;0.001 compared to expressed alone, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We previously generated a mutant form of SynGAP-α1 that contains two point mutations – L1202D and K1252D (SynGAP-α1 LDKD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>) – which prevent SynGAP trimerization and phase-separation with PSD-95. First, we tested the effect of the LDKD mutation on the synaptic mobility of SynGAP-α1 by measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of single dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We found that GFP-tagged full-length SynGAP-α1 LDKD recovers fluorescence in spines to a magnitude greater than that of GFP-SynGAP-α1 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, Recovery plateau for GFP-SynGAP-α1 WT = 0.183 (95% CI = 0.169–0.199); Recovery plateau for GFP-SynGAP-α1 LDKD = 0.372 (95% CI = 0.362–0.384); ***p&lt;0.0001), indicating that disruption of SynGAP/PSD-95 LLPS without disrupting PDZ-domain-binding results in a measurable decrease in SynGAP PSD association. Previously, we observed that GFP-SynGAP-α1 LDKD displays diminished synaptic localization in neurons when compared to SynGAP-α1 WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>), underscoring the relationship between phase separation and synaptic localization of SynGAP. In biochemical assays, co-sedimentation of GFP-SynGAP-α1 LDKD and PSD-95 was significantly decreased in the [P] fraction when compared to that of GFP-SynGAP-α1 WT and PSD-95 (44.0 ± 5.0% of PSD-95 and 27.3 ± 4.6% of SynGAP-α1 LDKD at condensed phase fraction when SynGAP-α1 LDKD and PSD-95 was co-expressed, ***p&lt;0.001 compared to SynGAP-α1 WT and PSD-95 was co-expressed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that this assay can be used to sensitively probe changes in LLPS propensity, although other factors such as protein aggregation and innate insolubility may still contribute to sedimentation. We also determined that the PDZ ligand (QTRV) of SynGAP-α1, which is required for SynGAP/PSD-95 LLPS in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>), is also critical for LLPS-like sedimentation of SynGAP and PSD-95 in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, Co-sedimentation index: 80.0 ± 3.8% of PSD-95 when co-expressed with SynGAP-α1, but 49.7 ± 2.7% of PSD-95 when co-expressed with SynGAP-α1 ΔQTRV, **p&lt;0.01).

The failure of non-α1 isoforms to induce measurable formation of cytoplasmic puncta suggests that a complete coiled-coil domain and PDZ ligand are necessary for live-cell LLPS of SynGAP in this assay.

Our data suggest novel roles for SynGAP isoforms in regulating dendrite and synapse development in neurons. SynGAP-β is expressed at higher levels than the other isoforms early in brain development, and is gradually replaced in the mature brain through an increase in the expression of SynGAP-α1 and SynGAP-α2. Although SynGAP-β appears dispensable for synaptic plasticity function, it exhibits the strongest GAP activity of all the C-terminal isoforms, preferentially targeting Rap1 and facilitating dendritic arbor development. SynGAP-β not only lacks a PDZ ligand, but also lacks a full coiled-coil domain, likely leading to the dramatically increased cytoplasmic localization. SynGAP-α1, however, contains a complete coiled-coil domain and PDZ ligand, allowing for LLPS with PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>) and robust concentration at the PSD. We find SynGAP-α1 to be uniquely critical for LTP expression. This dense packing in the PSD in turn may be important to allow the dynamic dispersion of SynGAP during LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), which we have shown previously to be required for both spine growth and AMPAR trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 2015</xref>). Our data suggest that while SynGAP is important for the regulation of both plasticity and dendritic development, the biophysical and localization properties of the various isoforms are closely related to their functional role: isoforms that undergo LLPS and cluster densely in the PSD regulate synaptic plasticity and function while those that express more cytoplasmically dominate the regulation of dendritic arbor development. This finding is strengthened by our observation that disruption of SynGAP-α1 LLPS (through the LDKD mutation) resulted in a switch from regulation of synaptic plasticity to regulation of dendritic development in a manner similar to SynGAP-β, despite the fact that the C-terminus retains the SynGAP-α1 PDZ ligand.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Distinct roles of individual SynGAP isoforms in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity.</title><p>(<bold>Α</bold>) Schematics illustrating isoform-specific roles for SynGAP in neuronal maturation and synaptic plasticity. SynGAP-β is expressed early in development, has the lowest LLPS propensity resulting in cytosolic localization, possesses the highest GAP activity in cells, and promotes normal dendritic development. SynGAP-β deficiency may be relevant to the neuronal development deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). SynGAP-α1 is expressed later in development, undergoes strongest LLPS in spines resulting in dense expression in the PSD at the basal state, and is rapidly dispersed upon synaptic NMDAR-CaMKII activation.

Importantly, only SynGAP-β effectively rescues this developmental phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

For example, Rap1 increases proximal dendritic branching in rat cortical neurons, and Rap2 activation decreases the length and complexity of developing axonal and dendritic branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). These data link our observed dendritic phenotype caused by SYNGAP1 deficiency to regulation of small G-proteins. Further, dominant-negative forms of Rac1 decrease proximal dendritic branching and increase distal dendritic branching in hippocampal organotypic slice cultures, suggesting that a proper balance of small G-protein activation is crucial for normal dendritic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakayama et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, the Ras-PI3K–Akt–mTOR pathway controls somatic and dendritic sizes and coordinates with Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling to maintain dendritic complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kumar et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, it is possible that SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency causes overactivation of Ras and Rap1 and consequently disrupts the balanced signaling required for normal dendritic development. Our results suggest that SynGAP-β plays pivotal role in establishing this balance by regulating Rap1 and other small G proteins.

The additional lack of a complete coiled-coil domain in the SynGAP-β isoform leads to another ~25% decrease of synaptic localization. Specific mutations introduced in SynGAP-α1 to disrupt the coiled-coil-domain-dependent multimerization required for phase separation (SynGAP-α1 LDKD) and PSD-95 PDZ binding (SynGAP-α1 Δ4) led to comparable decreases in synaptic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AB</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>), supporting the idea that both the direct binding to PSD-95 and the phase separation contribute to SynGAP synaptic localization. We also found in the present study that SynGAP knockdown alters dendritic development, and the α1 isoform cannot fully rescue this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, the SynGAP-α1 LDKD was able to rescue the dendritic arborization phenotype. By specifically manipulating some intrinsic properties of SynGAP – including its localization patterns and ability to phase separate – we observe that these intrinsic properties themselves are related to distinct functional effects.</p><p>As we have shown, the SynGAP isoforms differentially regulate small G-proteins. These results may be due to differences in the localization of the SynGAP isoforms, since rates of biochemical reactions are dependent on the concentration of reactants within a microenvironment. LLPS of SynGAP physically separates the GAP domain within SynGAP from the small G proteins. This is consistent with our observation that while SynGAP-β generally showed the weakest LLPS but has the highest GAP activity towards almost all small G-proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). It is known that various GAPs are also differentially localized by distinct lipid modifications. After synthesis of Ras, Rap1, and Rac1, farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moieties are attached to the C-terminal ‘CAAX’ motifs (C: Cys; A: an aliphatic amino acid, X: M, Q, S, T, or A for farnesyl, L or I for geranylgeranyl) for membrane tethering, facilitating interaction with effector molecules proximal to the membrane. The various small G proteins have slightly different CAAX motifs that are susceptible to distinct modifications (e.g. H-Ras contain CVIM for farnesylation, Rap1a contain CLLL for geranylgeranylation) and thus are differentially targeted to cellular microenvironments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moores et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simanshu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wright and Philips, 2006</xref>).

Mutation of <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> explains ~0.75% of all NDD cases which is nearly as high as prominent X-linked disorders, such as the Fragile X syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fitzgerald et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> is located in the 6p21 region, near the major immuno-histocompatibility complex (MHC) where a high rate of sequence variability is observed between people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reche and Reinherz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sommer, 2005</xref>). This high rate of variability within genomic regions, along with the fact that <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> does not have neuronal homologs despite its critical roles in development and plasticity, may contribute to the high rate of association of <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> with MRD5 in ID/ASD populations. We highlight the importance of SynGAP-α1 in synaptic plasticity and suggest that correcting the exaggerated downstream activity due to haploinsufficiency of SynGAP-α1 might be beneficial for patients. In this paper, we characterized dynamic changes in the expression profile of SynGAP isoforms in the brain throughout development. We showed that SynGAP-α1 expression accounts for only 25–35% of total SynGAP, highlighting the importance of assessing the function of all isoforms to understand the pathogenesis of MRD5. We also found SynGAP-β to be expressed earliest in development, and to play a unique role in dendritic arbor development. Further characterization of downstream small G proteins and kinases that have pivotal roles in dendritic development will lead to unique targets for treating the aberrant neuronal wiring that is associated with MRD5 as well as other ID/ASD-related neurodevelopmental disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>SynGAP-α1</td><td/><td>NM_001113409.3</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>SynGAP-α2</td><td/><td>AF050183.2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>SynGAP-β</td><td/><td>AB01692.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>SynGAP-γ</td><td/><td>AF058789.2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td>SynGAP KO mice</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2003</xref></td><td/><td>Backcrossed with C57BL6</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-3216</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Biological sample <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td>Mouse whole brain or brain region</td><td/><td/><td>C57BL6, male and female</td></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>Rat Hippocampal Primary Neuron</td><td/><td/><td>Days in vitro 3–21</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclononal antibody</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 1998</xref></td><td>JH2469</td><td>Anti-SynGAPα1 <break/>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclononal antibody</td><td/><td>JH7265</td><td>Anti-SynGAPα2 <break/>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclononal antibody</td><td/><td>JH7266</td><td>Anti-SynGAPβ <break/>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclononal antibody</td><td/><td>JH7366</td><td>Anti-SynGAPγ <break/>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>SynGAPα2 C-tail</td><td>Johns Hopkins Sequencing Facility</td><td>RH376</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">CPPRLQITENGEFRNTADH</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>SynGAPβ <break/>C-tail</td><td>Johns Hopkins Sequencing Facility</td><td>RH371</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">CGGGGAAPGPPRHG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>SynGAPγ <break/>C-tail</td><td>Johns Hopkins Sequencing Facility</td><td>RH377</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">CRLLDAQLLIR</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Primer: SG upstream sense for ScaI cloning</td><td>IDT</td><td>SJ22</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">ACTGTAGCCTGGGTGTCCAATATG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Primer: alpha 2 SG reverse</td><td>IDT</td><td>SJ24</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">ggattgcggccgcCTAGTGGTCTGCGGTGTTCCG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Primer: beta SG reverse</td><td>IDT</td><td>SJ25</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">ggattgcggccgcTCAGCCATGGCGGGGTGGTCC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Primer: gamma SG reverse</td><td>IDT</td><td>SJ23</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">ggattGCGGCCGCttacctgatgaggagCTGAGCGTCGAGCAGCCT</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>GFP-SynGAP-α1</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 2015</xref></td><td/><td>EGFP: N terminal tag</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>GFP-SynGAP-α2</td><td/><td/><td>EGFP: N terminal tag</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>GFP-SynGAP-β</td><td/><td/><td>EGFP: N terminal tag</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>GFP-SynGAP-γ</td><td/><td/><td>EGFP: N terminal tag</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>GFP-SynGAP-α1 LDKD</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeng et al., 2016</xref></td><td/><td>EGFP: N terminal tag;

Splice junctions were quantified by the number of supporting reads aligned by Tophat, and counts were converted to ‘RP80M’ values, or ‘reads per 80 million mapped’ using the total number of aligned reads across the autosomal and sex chromosomes (dropping reads mapping to the mitochondria chromosome), which can be interpreted as the number of reads supporting the junction in our average library size, and is equivalent to counts per million reads mapped (CPM) multiplied by 80.

To stabilize the imaging focal plane for long-term experiments, we employed Definite focus (Zeiss). For quantification, we selected pyramidal neurons based on morphology that consisted of a clear primary dendrite, and quantified all spines on the 30–40 μm stretch of the secondary dendrite beginning just after the branch from the primary dendrite. For identifying spine regions, we used the mCherry channel to select the spine region that was well separated from dendritic shaft. These regions of interest (ROIs) in the mCherry channel were transferred to the green channel to quantify total SynGAP content in spines. Total spine volume was calculated as follows; (Average Red signal at ROI – Average Red signal at Background region) * (Area of ROI). Total SynGAP content was calculated as follows; (Average Green signal at ROI – Average Green signal at Background region) * (Area of ROI). Through this quantification, we can precisely quantify the total signals at each spine even if the circled region contained some background area. For [%] spine enlargement before/after LTP, we took a relative ratio of these total spine volume (total red signal) of each spine before/after LTP ([%] spine enlargement = (Total Red Signal after chemLTP/Total Red signal at basal state-1)*100). For [%] SynGAP dispersion, we calculated the degree of total SynGAP content loss after chemLTP at each spine compared to the total SynGAP content at basal state ([%] dispersion = (1- Total Green Signal after chemLTP/Total Green signal at basal state) * 100).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of single dendritic spines</title><p>Rat hippocampal neurons were prepared as in ‘Chemical LTP stimulation and quantification.’ Neurons were transfected at DIV 17–19 with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and the experiment was performed 36–48 hr following transfection.

Short stretches of dendrites of pyramidal neurons were imaged using a 63X objective, and only one dendritic segment was imaged per each 1 hr imaging session. Confocal Z-stack images were acquired every 60 s using 488 nm and 563 nm lasers for excitation of GFP (SynGAP) and mCherry (shRNA reporter and cell-fill), respectively. Two baseline Z-stacks were acquired before photobleaching with the 488 nm laser (100% intensity, 25 iterations) at multiple ROIs drawn around single dendritic spines by the experimenter. Z-stack images were acquired every 60 s until the end of the 60 min experiment. Photobleaching laser intensity and image acquisition parameters were kept constant across experiments. Images were analyzed using ImageJ. A median filter was applied to the maximum intensity projection of each channel-split time course image before rigid body registration using the plugin MultiStackReg. Mean intensity values across all timepoints were extracted from each FRAP ROI, two additional non-bleach ROIs to be used for correcting for photobleaching during image acquisition, and two background ROIs (one above and one below the horizontal dendritic segment) for subtraction of background signal.

This is important work, as the molecule underlies relatively common and variably severe intellectual disability, is a prominent synaptic component, and has been shown by these authors and others to exert strong control over synaptic structure and function. The work provides critical information about isoform-specific developmental time course, breaks new ground in ascribing control of dendrite growth patterns to different isoforms, and links functional outcomes to particular domains of the molecule which control subcellular localization and thus availability for GAP activity. Technically, the work is sound and the document is clearly written.</p><p>Addressing a few concerns would clarify some remaining issues and provide tighter support for some key conclusions.</p><p>1) The authors emphasize repeatedly that the developmental expression profile is unique for α1 vs. α2 or β. This is a very attractive simplification, but Figure 1G demonstrate striking similarities rather than differences in the expression timeline, and the impressive accumulation of human RNA seq data in Figure 1I and J show little developmental changes at all in the ratio of transcript levels from 9 wks gestation to 90 years of age. In mouse, β does start to decrease around the time α peaks, but I don't see how the magnitude of these changes can be emphasized so strongly as a mechanism underlying the human disorders stemming from SynGAP haploinsufficiency.</p><p>2) The unique functional profile of β is ascribed to its lack of LLPS propensity and thus lack of synapse targeting. This could be tested directly by simply adding an exogenous synaptic targeting signal (PDZ-binding or other). I would guess that it would be fairly straightforward to test the prediction that this construct would fail to rescue dendrite growth in the knockdown; the LTP-related predictions also would be interesting to test but seem much more intensive and the effort may not be warranted.</p><p>3) The authors unequivocally ascribe all synaptic accumulation (and consequent function) to LLPS. Again, this is an attractive conclusion, but the direct evidence for LLPS vs. &quot;traditional&quot; binding within the PSD is limited, is it not? It seems difficult here to ascribe a particular function to LLPS per se. If phase separation in synapses and accumulation without certain particular features of phase separation itself are essentially indistinguishable experimentally, this should be acknowledged. The PSD is after all a highly ordered megamolecular structure, and the respective roles of discrete protein-protein interactions vs phase separation in creating this order still seem unknown.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study compares roles of the four different SynGAP C-terminal splice isoforms (α1, α2, β and γ) in synaptic function and development. The authors report that heterologous expression of individual SynGAP isoforms present (1) different GAP activity and ability to recruit PSD95 in HEK cells, (2) different expression levels at synapses, (3) different dispersion kinetics from dendritic spines upon induction of chemical LTP, and (4) different ability to rescue either neuronal morphology or chemical LTP-induced spine enlargement and AMPA receptor insertion. The authors further perform biochemical experiments to assess whether and how the different isoforms contribute to the generation of phase condensates together with PSD-95. There is value in a systematic analysis of the localization and function of the various SynGAP isoforms. However, the paper overstates some of the at best correlative findings, and overall this paper is borderline for <italic>eLife</italic> in its current form in my view.</p><p>Given the current coronavirus crisis, I am not suggesting further experimentation. Instead, addressing the following points in textual revision and data analyses, the paper may become suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Key concern:</p><p>The authors use two measurements for phase separation that, together, are not sufficient to establish phase separation. First, the sedimentation-based assay performed in cell lysates (Figures 2A-2C) cannot distinguish between phase condensates and aggregates, both would end up in the pellet (this is different from its typical use in which the experiment starts with purified protein in solution and aggregates are removed before the experiment starts). Second, in the transfection assay (Figures 2D, 2E), all SynGAP isoforms form puncta of variable size, but only the α1-isoform forms puncta that colocalize with co-transfected PSD-95. Although phase separation results in puncta, not all puncta reflect phase transitions, and in this experiment it is impossible to tell whether only SynGAP-α1+PSD-95 from phase condensates, or whether all SynGAP isoforms form them but PSD-95 is only recruited into the condensates when there is direct binding to PSD-95 (which would be different from the initial findings described in Zeng et al., 2016, but match better with the data shown in Figure 2A-2C). Ultimately, the conclusion that can be drawn is the recruitment of PSD-95 by individual SynGAP isoforms, and the experiment cannot strongly speak to LLPS (without, for example, using FRAP of the puncta to establish turnover rates as a key distinguishing property between phase condensates and aggregates).</p><p>Hence, the current data do not provide strong evidence for phase separation properties of the various SynGAP isoforms. At the very least, the authors would have to remove the causative claims of the relationship between phase transition and SynGAP function (most importantly from the title, but careful phrasing should be used everywhere), re-write the Results section and relabel Figures 2A-2C such that it is not assumed that everything that is in the pellet is a phase condensate. The model of phase separation should be appropriately discussed in the Discussion section, but results etc. should not assume that the experiments establish phase transitions because they do not. This would lead to a refocus of the paper on the isoform-specific functions of SynGAP, which is really what the data provide insight in, and in my view would be suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Araki et al. investigate the expression and the role for the different isoforms of the gene SYNGAP1, whose many loss of function mutations were associated with various neurodevelopmental diseases. Multiple outcomes for the mutations in the same gene make the study of SYNGAP1 isoforms essential for a better understanding of the disease origin.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and addresses a topic of likely broad interest. Overall, the experiments are well designed and use a nice combination of techniques, different tools are validated with correct controls, and the data is solid and followed up by reasonable conclusions.</p><p>However, there are two issues which should be addressed before this work is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) According to the Materials and methods, normality of the samples seems to not be tested, however, ANOVA tests are parametric and assume normality of the data tested. Authors should address this issue and if necessary, perform the appropriate statistical analysis.</p><p>2) Differential regulation of GTPase activity by the different isoforms is an important topic of the manuscript, but despite the strong and specific tools designed by the authors, they perform their assay only in cell line. However, authors show a specific isoform localization in neurons in compartments which don't exist in HEK cells. Furthermore, they show that neuronal protein partner PSD95 has a dramatic effect of the localization. Authors should address this issue by ICC and western blot with one experiment in neurons.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56273.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) A more balanced interpretation of the results is necessary without the tendency to overinterpret as noted by all reviewers.

The large differential between the pellet sedimentation of α1 LDKD+PSD95 (5th column of graph) compared to α1 WT+PSD95 (3rd column of graph) shows that the assay can discriminate bona fide phase-separation fraction from non-specific aggregation.</p><p>We have also added new data (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1A) showing that our GFP-tagged full-length version SynGAP-α1 LDKD exhibits enhanced fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of dendritic spine spines, suggesting that disruption of SynGAP LLPS without disrupting PDZ-binding leads to enhanced synaptic mobility of SynGAP, likely due to a decrease in PSD association resulting from diminished LLPS propensity. In other words, these data suggest that LLPS – in addition to PDZ-domain-binding – is crucial for robust synaptic enrichment and clustering of SynGAP at the PSD. These data are consistent with previous findings showing that the LDKD mutation decreases the synaptic enrichment of SynGAP in cultured neurons (Zeng et al., 2016).</p><p>However, we understand that we cannot fully answer reviewer 2's key concern without additional data (e.g. FRAP data on SynGAP isoforms in live heterologous cells or purified proteins in vitro).

This is a general problem in the LLPS field as phase transitions are more easily studied in vitro in simple systems and it is hard to extrapolate to more complex systems in cells. Our current data in Figure 4 and our previous report (Zeng et al., 2016, Figure 6A,B) provide two lines of evidence to quantify the relative contribution of phase separation and “traditional binding”. The lack of the PDZ ligand in SynGAP-α2 is the key difference with the SynGAP-α1 isoform, which disrupts the direct affinity towards PSD-95 and is shown to decrease the synaptic localization of SynGAP about 25% (Figure 4). The additional lack of a complete coiled-coil domain in the SynGAP-β isoform, which is critical for phase separation, leads to another ~25% decrease of synaptic localization. Specific mutations introduced in SynGAP-α1 to disrupt phase separation (L-D and K-D) and PSD-95 PDZ binding (∆4) led to comparable decreases in synaptic localization (Zeng et al., 2016, Figure 6A,B), supporting the idea that both the direct binding to PSD-95 and the phase separation contribute to SynGAP synaptic localization. Of note, these results likely underestimate the contribution because despite of the shRNA-induced knockdown, the remaining endogenous SynGAP likely limits the impact of these mutations through interaction with the exogenously expressed SynGAP. We have revised the text and discussion to clearly reflect these findings and the caveats of our conclusions.</p><p>It is true we can only see the &quot;correlations&quot; of phase separation deficient mutants (LDKD mutant) with (i) synaptic localization, (ii) plasticity function, and (iii) role of dendritic arborization. We already observed phase-separation mutation of SynGAP-α1 resulted in (i) deficits in synaptic location of SynGAP (Zeng et al., 2016, Figure 6A,B), (ii) deficits in synaptic plasticity regulation (i.e. threshold of LTP is decreased) (Zeng et al., 2016, Figure 7C,D), and (iii) better rescue in dendritic arborization upon SynGAP knockdown (this paper, Figure 6). Although these &quot;correlations&quot; are clear, we understand we cannot ascribe all these functions were explained by LLPS. We have revised the Discussion of this point in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Key concern:</p><p>The authors use two measurements for phase separation that, together, are not sufficient to establish phase separation.
