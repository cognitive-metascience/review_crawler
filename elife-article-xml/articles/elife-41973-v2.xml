manifestation of a globally degenerating motor neuron. Using in vivo imaging of single axons and their NMJs over a three-month period, we identify that single motor-units are dismantled asynchronously in <italic>SOD1<sup>G37R</sup></italic> mice. We reveal that weeks prior to complete axonal degeneration, the dismantling of axonal branches is accompanied by contemporaneous new axonal sprouting resulting in synapse formation onto nearby NMJs. Denervation events tend to propagate from the first lost NMJ, consistent with a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons, with distal branches being more susceptible. These results show that NMJ denervation in ALS is a complex and dynamic process of continuous denervation and new innervation rather than a manifestation of sudden global motor neuron degeneration.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41973.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder. It occurs when the neurons that control muscles – the motoneurons – disconnect from their target muscles and die. This causes the muscles to weaken and waste away. More and more muscles become affected over time until eventually the muscles that control breathing also become paralyzed. Most patients die within two to five years of diagnosis.</p><p>Motoneurons consist of a cell body plus a cable-like structure called the axon. The cell body of each motoneuron sits within the spinal cord, and the axon extends out of the spinal cord to the motoneuron’s target muscle. Within the muscle the axon divides into branches, each of which connects with multiple muscle fibers. The breakdown of these connections, known as neuromuscular junctions, is one of the first signs of ALS.</p><p>Does a motoneuron lose all of its connections with muscle fibers at once, or do the connections break down a few at a time? This distinction is important as it will help to identify the events that lead to muscle paralysis in ALS. To find out, Martineau et al. studied mice that had two genetic mutations: one that causes ALS and another that produces fluorescent molecules in some motoneurons. This allowed the branches of the motoneurons to be tracked over time with a fluorescence microscope.</p><p>Martineau et al. found that individual neurons lose their connections to muscle fibers gradually. Moreover, motoneurons grow new branches and form new connections even while losing their old ones. This dual process of pruning and budding lasts for several weeks, until eventually the motoneuron dies.</p><p>Developing drugs to stabilize neuromuscular junctions during the period when motoneurons gradually disconnect from muscles could be a promising avenue to explore to improve the quality of life of ALS patients. One advantage of this treatment strategy is that neuromuscular junctions in muscles are easier to access than motoneurons inside the spinal cord. To identify potential drugs, future studies will need to focus on the proteins and signals that cause the neuromuscular junctions to break down.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</kwd><kwd>neuromuscular junction</kwd><kwd>motor unit</kwd><kwd>reinnervation</kwd><kwd>synapse loss</kwd><kwd>superoxide dismutase (SOD1)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-111070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robitaille</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canadian Foundation for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vande Velde</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name><name><surname>Robitaille</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009017</institution-id><institution>ALS Society of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doctoral Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martineau</surname><given-names>Éric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005202</institution-id><institution>Muscular Dystrophy Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vande Velde</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vande Velde</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012312</institution-id><institution>Robert Packard Center for ALS Research, Johns Hopkins University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robitaille</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-152934</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Di Polo</surname><given-names>Adriana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009017</institution-id><institution>ALS Society of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vande Velde</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Motor axons undergo dynamic branch-specific changes for weeks before complete neuronal degeneration in a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, highlighting the importance of peripheral factors, intrinsic and extrinsic to motoneurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by upper and lower motor neuron (MN) loss. Loss of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) is a key pathological event in ALS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Killian et al., 1994</xref>) and in animal models of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tallon et al., 2016</xref>). Denervation of NMJs is observed prior to symptom onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tallon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vinsant et al., 2013</xref>) and before any significant MN axonal or cell body loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vinsant et al., 2013</xref>). However, whether early NMJ denervation arises from local branch-specific degeneration (‘dying-back hypothesis’) or is merely the manifestation of a diseased and globally degenerating motor neuron remains ill-defined.</p><p>There is considerable evidence which suggests that a subset of degenerating motor-units (MU, a motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates) swiftly lose their NMJs while a distinct, yet unaffected, population compensates via axonal sprouting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schaefer et al., 2005</xref>), somewhat akin to a nerve injury. Indeed, NMJs innervated by fast-fatigable MNs are lost early, followed by fast-fatigue resistant and slow MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pun et al., 2006</xref>). This is further supported by electromyographic (EMG) recordings showing that the number of MUs declines in parallel with muscle strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azzouz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dantes and McComas, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hegedus et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hegedus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kennel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McComas et al., 1971</xref>) and that surviving MUs increase in size in animal models and in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dantes and McComas, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dengler et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McComas et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmied et al., 1999</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the loss of NMJs within a single MU is a dichotomous and mostly synchronous event and that local synaptic events have a limited impact on the denervation process. Under this monotonic paradigm, degenerating MUs are irrevocably caught in a degenerative cascade while surviving MUs attempt to compensate, consequently undermining the relevance of the NMJ as a disease-modifying therapeutic target.</p><p>However, the rescue of neuronal loss in SOD1 mice does not necessarily improve NMJ denervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gould et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suzuki et al., 2007</xref>) suggesting that local branch-specific events may play a key role in NMJ denervation. In ALS, local alterations of synaptic function and molecular signaling take place very early at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arbour et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Winter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jokic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rocha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taetzsch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tremblay et al., 2017</xref>), implying that local, MU-independent, structural changes could occur. Finally, ALS is a non-cell autonomous disease where cell types other than motor neurons contribute to the disease pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boillée et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ilieva et al., 2009</xref>). Contribution of various cell types known to interact with NMJs and motor axons has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arbour et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lobsiger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loeffler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nardo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Turner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), which could contribute to NMJ loss. In this scenario, asynchronous branch-specific synaptic changes would take place over time within single MUs.</p><p>Altogether, these divergent paradigms highlight that the precise sequence of events taking place at the NMJ in ALS remains ill-defined. From a therapeutic viewpoint, this distinction is of high importance since it could pinpoint the NMJ as an accessible target that can be exploited within a time window between the onset of structural changes and the global degeneration of the MU, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cantor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miyoshi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pérez-García and Burden, 2012</xref>). Here, we used longitudinal repeated in vivo imaging of single motor neuron axonal arbors and their NMJs to directly assess the time course and dynamics of structural changes during ALS progression. We predict that a MU-dependent mechanism would result in the more or less synchronous degeneration of the whole MU over a brief period, while a contribution of local neuromuscular changes would result in the asynchronous loss of NMJs within a single MU.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vivo imaging of single MU arbors</title><p>SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice (lox<italic>SOD1<sup>G37R</sup></italic>) are well known for their slow disease progression, making it an ideal model to follow single MU changes over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boillée et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lobsiger et al., 2009</xref>).

Indeed, local signals emanating from muscle fibers, glial cells or a damaged axonal branch (e.g. chemorepulsive molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Winter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maimon et al., 2018</xref>) or misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grad et al., 2014</xref>) could potentially propagate through the extracellular space and contribute to NMJ loss in ALS. If such local signals in the neuromuscular environment influence NMJ dismantlement, one would predict that these events may tend to propagate from one or several focal points. To test this possibility, we performed a Sholl-like analysis on all MU arbors bearing multiple complete NMJ losses (37 events out of 141 NMJs over 9 MU arbors, N = 6; see Materials and methods).

This time course reveals a long time-window after the onset of NMJ loss during which MNs are not globally degenerating and preserve their capacity to reinnervate NMJs. Peripheral stabilization of NMJs and MUs thus represents an attractive therapeutic target in the context of ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cantor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miyoshi et al., 2017</xref>), particularly when considering the accessibility of the neuromuscular system (i.e. no blood-brain-barrier). The propagating pattern of events and the asynchronous or multidirectional changes within a single MU suggest that neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor axons (i.e. the local neuromuscular environment) affect or contribute to NMJ loss in ALS. These factors would presumably interact with the intrinsic vulnerability of axonal branches (distal vs proximal, etc.) to shape MU dynamism in ALS. Notably, chemo-repulsive molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Winter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jokic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maimon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moloney et al., 2014</xref>), availability of trophic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moloney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taetzsch et al., 2017</xref>), enhancement of NMJ stabilizing signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miyoshi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pérez-García and Burden, 2012</xref>), secreted pathological proteins or dysfunctional glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arbour et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arbour et al., 2017</xref>) are mechanisms of therapeutic interest.</p><p>Another main finding is that MUs are not segregated as either degenerating or compensating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schaefer et al., 2005</xref>). Rather, we observed a broad spectrum of MU phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), with the majority continuously alternating between expansion and disassembly for weeks. This asynchronous branch-specific behavior contrasts with previous observations made by Schaefer and colleagues using single time point MU imaging in the fast-progressing SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schaefer et al., 2005</xref>). They reported that MUs with fragmented (degenerating) branches lacked thin axons (sprouts) while enlarged MUs lacked signs of degeneration. A number of observations can explain this apparent discrepancy. First, our time lapse analysis revealed that only some MUs underwent gains and losses in the same session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), thus often giving the impression that they are either degenerating or compensating if only a single time point is considered. Second, we seldom observed a degenerating fragmented branch (9/38, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1 A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A,A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> for example), which led us to believe that the complete dismantlement of a single axonal branch can easily be missed if identified only by the fragmented axonal morphology. Another possibility would be that different MU types were considered in these studies, whereas the present study only focused on fast-fatigable MUs (MHC IIb and IIx fibers). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pun et al., 2006</xref> reported no signs of compensatory reinnervation on the surface of the TA (same region as the present study) while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schaefer et al., 2005</xref> imaged a mixture of fast-fatigable and fast-resistant MUs (<italic>Sternomastoid</italic>, <italic>Cleidomastoid</italic> and <italic>Clavotrapezius</italic>), with the former presumably behaving similarly to what we describe here. Hence, we do not believe these discrepancies can be attributed to differences between MU types. Nevertheless, these studies raise the possibility that slower MU types may behave differently in ALS. One might speculate that the fast-resistant and slow MUs may be resistant to the asynchronous dismantlement and only exhibit late synchronous degeneration. Alternatively, these MUs may degenerate similarly to fast-fatigable MUs, but at a later time point, in part due to their small axonal arborization size (see below). Further examination of MU dynamism in a slow-twitch muscle, which could not be achieved here due to technical and ethical considerations, could shed light on these possibilities.</p><p>Interestingly, this pattern is reminiscent of post-natal synapse elimination at the NMJ, where the elimination of supernumerary axonal branches is also asynchronous and branch-specific within single MUs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Keller-Peck et al., 2001</xref>). This resemblance suggests that similar molecular mechanisms could be involved. A recent study has shown that selective axonal branch loss during post-natal synapse elimination was mediated by branch-specific microtubule destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brill et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, pharmacological stabilization of microtubules is beneficial to ALS mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fanara et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that microtubule instability could underly the increased MU dynamism described here.</p><p>One unexpected finding was that MNs failed to re-innervate their lost NMJs, despite preserving their capacity to sprout and form new synaptic contacts onto other heterologous postsynaptic sites. Indeed, motor axons usually autologously reinnervate their original postsynaptic sites with great fidelity following an axonal lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nguyen et al., 2002</xref>). It could be argued that MU expansions represent the autologous re-innervation of NMJs that were dismantled before session 1. However, this scenario seems unlikely considering that some YFP-negative axons reinnervated NMJs lost by the imaged YFP-positive motor axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). One possible explanation may be that either the heterologous sprout itself or a molecular signal at the endplate prevents the original axon from reinnervating its target. Alternatively, asynchronous losses occur more frequently on distal branches, which seem intrinsically less likely to form sprouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), thus reducing the likelihood of autologous reinnervation occurring.</p><p>Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tallon et al., 2016</xref>), we report that NMJs arising from distal branches in complex arbors (higher branch order) are more susceptible than proximal ones at the single MN level in ALS. These results support the notion that a larger axonal arborization size increases the energetic load on neurons, thus making them more vulnerable to pathological insults in neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Le Masson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pacelli et al., 2015</xref>). One could speculate that the constant dynamism and the excessive MU expansions further increases the energetic load of MNs thus adding to their stress during disease progression.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Overall, this detailed in vivo analysis reveals a previously unsuspected dynamism at the NMJ in an animal model of ALS.

NMJs near the surface were imaged using a 20X water immersion objective (0.4 NA, Nikon, Japan) mounted on an upright epifluorescent microscope (Nikon, Optiphot-2) equipped with a Neo-sCMOS camera (Andor, UK). Fluorescence excitation and emission were filtered using a Brightline Pinkel filter set optimized for CFP/YFP/HcRed (CFP/YFP/HcRed-3X-A-000; Semrock, NY). Images of the whole superficial MU axonal arborization at multiple focal planes were acquired using the Metafluor software (Molecular Devices, CA).

Buprenorphine (3 μg/10 g body weight; Temgesic, CEVA Animal Health Ltd, UK) was administered by subcutaneous injections three times a day for 24 hr following the surgery. Antibiotics (0.1 mg/10 g body weight; Baytril; Bayer.Inc, Canada) were administered subcutaneously every 24 hr for 72 hr.

Only mice in which the MU arbor could be reliably followed for at least three sessions, with at least three NMJs near the surface, were included in the analysis (11/16 mice). NMJs which were too deep to be fully resolved were discarded. Images were analyzed using the Fiji software. First, focal planes from the same region were aligned using the ‘StackReg’ pluggin. MU branches were traced using the ‘Simple Neurite Tracer’ plugin. The clearest session (generally session 1) was chosen for tracing. All segments of the MU arbor (from each region imaged) were merged in Photoshop (Adobe) and BTX labelling (in the overlap between the regions) was used as a reference for alignment. Tracings were used as a map to identify each NMJ on subsequent imaging sessions. For the purpose of this analysis, two labeled branches that could not be undoubtedly linked to the same main motor axon were considered as independent MNs. Then, the state of innervation of each NMJ was determined and a MU dynamic diagram showing the state of each NMJ within the arborization on each session was created using Visio2013 (Microsoft). NMJs were then classified based on their dynamic changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The initial event (center) was defined as the first completely lost NMJ. When two or more NMJs were lost simultaneously, the one which first showed signs of denervation (partial loss) was defined as the center. If they could not be distinguished in this manner, the analysis was carried out with multiple centers (2/9 MU arbors). For one animal (#34), several branches were fairly close to each other, that is in the same field of view (branches A and B, C and D). To more accurately assess the presence of a spreading pattern, a single center per field of view was determined. Branch order was determined using the motor-unit dynamic diagrams. MU expansions were assigned the same branch order as the branch from which they originated from, to determine likelihood of sprouting of axonal branches.</p><p>To create the heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), the % of change was calculated by counting the number of gained or lost NMJs over the number of initial NMJs.

These analyses were performed in the GraphPad Prism 7.0 software, with the exception of the analysis for the NMJ innervation was made in SPSS 24.0.0.0.</p><p>No sample size estimations were performed before the experiments. All available SOD1 animals which met our inclusion/exclusion criteria were included (see in vivo images and data analysis). For the NMJ innervation and motor neuron counts experiments, sample sizes similar to previous experiments were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tremblay et al., 2017</xref>). No test to detect outliers was performed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements </title><p>We thank Dr. Keith Murai and Dre.

We know that this is not happy news. That said, all the reviewers (and editors) agree that the images are remarkable. We would be willing to consider a new manuscript abbreviated to focus on what we see as the primary novelty of the your work: that denervation in a genetic form of ALS is not from a neuron/axon so damaged that it cannot regenerate, but rather that initial denervation is accompanied by simultaneous attempts at renervation.</p><p>If you would like to move forward with the manuscript in its present form, we wish you best of success at other journals.

The primary conclusions, which will be surprising to many in the research community and seem well known to the clinical community from the increase in muscle unit size in ALS patients, are that branch-specific degeneration is accompanied in the same axon by new sprouting.

Here, the authors repeatedly recorded images of single, labeled motor units to determine whether neuromuscular junctions from a single motor unit disassemble synchronously or asynchronously. As such, the authors sought to determine whether the motor nerve terminal or the motor neuron as a whole is the 'unit' of denervation. They report that synapses are disassembled asynchronously, indicating that the synapse rather than the neuron per se is the target for denervation.</p><p>Others (Lichtman/Sanes) raised a similar question in studying the mechanisms of synapse elimination during development and similarly found that the synapse behaves as the 'unit', as certain synapses from a single motor neuron are lost while other synapses from the same motor neuron are maintained (Keller-Peck et al., 2001). It would seem sensible to discuss the results reported here in light of these findings.</p><p>The reported findings are interesting and well-documented. I question however whether the findings are of broad interest and provide a sufficiently large advance in our knowledge and understanding of ALS to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The authors indicate that sub-saturating levels of fluorescent α-bungarotoxin were used to label and image nAchRs, but they provide no further information regarding how they determined that α-bungarotoxin binding was subsaturating and had no effect on the process of denervation.</p><p>2) The authors report that some denervated synapses were reinnervated by the same motor unit. They should supply this number/percent in the text.</p><p>3) The authors indicate that they imaged IIb and IIx myofibers, leaving open the possibility that motor nerve terminals on slower IIa muscle fibers behave differently. Did the authors examine other muscles in which surface IIa muscle fibers could be imaged to answer this question?</p><p>4) The authors indicate that the later loss of synapses from a single motor unit were more synchronous. It would help if the authors provided a graph/plot illustrating synchrony vs. asynchrony at different stages.</p><p>5) The authors write: 'Overall, these data reveal a propagation pattern which indicates that the local neuromuscular environment (Moloney et al., 2014) and the intrinsic susceptibility of axonal branches contribute to NMJ loss.' It would be helpful if the authors were more explicit about the meaning of 'local neuromuscular environment' and 'intrinsic susceptibility' and the implications of these conclusions.</p><p>6) The authors compare their findings to those of Pun et al. (2006). Did Pun et al. limit their analysis to IIb and IIx muscle fibers or might the differences between the studies be due to data in the Pun et al. study from IIa muscle fibers?</p><p>7) Since motor units were more likely to expand in female than male SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice, and female mice showed a decline in grip strength earlier than male mice, do the authors believe – or have evidence – that the expansions are deleterious?</p><p>8) As the authors point-out, it is surprising 'that motor neurons failed to re-innervate their lost NMJs'. Indeed, one would expect motor axons, enveloped within a Schwann cell tube, would be constrained and directed back to original synaptic sites. Do the authors have data to indicate where the motor axons became 'lost'? Did the axons escape near the non-myelinating terminal Schwann cell or from myelinated tracks far from the synapse?</p><p>9) The authors write that 'Interestingly, sex-specific differences have been identified in other ALS mouse models and in patients, but they did not consistently point toward a faster or more severe disease in one sex'. This statement does not account for numerous studies showing that disease onset and death (more severe disease) occur earlier in male than female SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice.</p><p>References:</p><p>1. The authors cite Nguyen et al. (2002) to indicate that axons reinnervate original synaptic sites, but more appropriate references would be studies form McMahan and colleagues (Rotschenker, Letinsky, Marshall, Sanes) in the 1970s.</p><p>2) The authors write: 'This observation strongly suggests that strategies aimed at stabilizing NMJs or enhancing autologous re-innervation could be of great therapeutic benefit in ALS.' Surprisingly, the authors don't cite two studies that describe such strategies: Miyoshi et al. (2017) and Cantor et al. (2018).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The primary goal of this manuscript was to clarify whether neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are dismantled in a synchronous or asynchronous manner prior to motor-unit deterioration in ALS. Using the well-characterized SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> ALS mice expressing YFP in a subset of motor neurons, and through a thoroughly described and well-executed longitudinal imaging paradigm, the authors have firmly established that NMJs are lost in an asynchronous manner, and that this may proceed complete global motor unit degeneration by weeks. They note that while motor units continue to expand their axonal arbors over a long time period, they very infrequently re-innervate the NMJs that they have lost.</p><p>This paper is of great significance and adds greatly to our understanding of the temporal events occurring at NMJs prior to motor unit breakdown and motor neuron death in ALS. Of note is the in vivo rigorous analysis, which is not easy to do.

We have performed an extensive revision of the manuscript according to their comments as indicated below in the detailed rebuttal. As a result, the manuscript is now about 50% shorter (2852 words down from 4947; three fewer main figures down to six, and two fewer figure supplements and 11 fewer references, new total of 52). This condensed version focuses on our finding that NMJ loss is asynchronous within single motor units and is accompanied by extensive compensatory sprouting, and the non-essential details have been removed. Furthermore, we have carefully revised the manuscript to address all other specific recommendations made by the reviewers. Please find below the point-by-point rebuttal to those comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript from Robitaille and colleagues uses remarkable, sophisticated imaging to follow the same neuromuscular junctions for up to 76 days in mice in which denervation is driven by synthesis of an ALS-causing mutation in superoxide dismutase.

This abbreviated version focuses almost entirely on our finding that NMJ loss is asynchronous within single motor units and is accompanied by extensive axonal sprouting. The more detailed analyses and controls have either been removed or their importance in the text was greatly reduced as to not divert the attention away from the main findings. We believe that the retained analyses and controls (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5) are of importance as they show respectively that YFP expression did not affect motor neuron degeneration (thus that observations made on these neurons are not artefactual) and that NMJ loss seems to propagate, hinting towards a contribution of factors extrinsic to motor axons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Others (Lichtman/Sanes) raised a similar question in studying the mechanisms of synapse elimination during development and similarly found that the synapse behaves as the 'unit', as certain synapses from a single motor neuron are lost while other synapses from the same motor neuron are maintained (Keller-Peck et al., 2001). It would seem sensible to discuss the results reported here in light of these findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a short paragraph in the Discussion (fourth paragraph) to mention this similarity and a potential mechanistic link between the two phenomena.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reported findings are interesting and well-documented. I question however whether the findings are of broad interest and provide a sufficiently large advance in our knowledge and understanding of ALS to warrant publication in eLife.</p><p>1) The authors indicate that sub-saturating levels of fluorescent α-bungarotoxin were used to label and image nAchRs, but they provide no further information regarding how they determined that α-bungarotoxin binding was subsaturating and had no effect on the process of denervation.</p></disp-quote><p>This concentration of α-bungarotoxin (5 µg/mL for 10 minutes) is routinely used in our laboratory to label postsynaptic receptors for a variety of in vivoand ex vivo physiological experiments, including electrophysiological recordings of synaptic activity. We have never observed blockade of muscle contractions in these conditions (Arbour et al., 2015), and synaptic transmission can still be recorded (unpublished data). This concentration was determined based on those used by Jeff Lichtman’s and Wesley Thompson’s groups for their in vivostudies (Li et al., 2011; Turney et al., 2012).</p><p>By comparison, we use concentrations over 100 µg/mL to completely block muscle contractions in mice (unpublished data). This value is similar to those used by other groups to obtain complete blockade in vivoin rats (Love and Thompson, 1999) and frogs (Wines and Letinsky, 1991), and incubations had to be repeated to maintain the blockage. Of note, in the present study, α-bungarotoxin was applied on the first session and was only reapplied once, only when the labeling was too dim, usually on session 5 or 6 (8 – 10 weeks after).</p><p>A statement was added in the Materials and methods section to clarify this aspect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors report that some denervated synapses were reinnervated by the same motor unit. They should supply this number/percent in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The fact that motor axons seldom reinnervate their lost NMJs (autologous reinnervation) is first mentioned in the text in the section on asynchronous NMJ dismantlement (“Asynchronous NMJ dismantlement in SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice”) when describing the example provided in Figure 2A. No number/percent are provided here as the only purpose of that statement was to describe this particular MU and to illustrate that it was not globally degenerating. We elaborate more thoroughly on the frequency of these reinnervation events (number and percentages) in the section describing the contemporaneous sprouting of MUs (subsection “MUs expand their axonal arbor but do not reinnervate their lost NMJs”, Figure 4C, purple bars). The mention “see below for more details” was added after the first statement to clarify that this is an intended omission and that this result is fully presented in a more appropriate section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors indicate that they imaged IIb and IIx myofibers, leaving open the possibility that motor nerve terminals on slower IIa muscle fibers behave differently. Did the authors examine other muscles in which surface IIa muscle fibers could be imaged to answer this question?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, to our knowledge. no hindlimb muscle with surface IIa and I fibers in mice is suitable for the repeated in vivo imaging procedure. The <italic>Soleus</italic> muscle has a majority of surface type I and IIa fibers in mice and can be imaged in vivo, but the procedure to access it is very invasive and involves lifting the muscle with a spatula (Kang et al., 2014). This procedure can potentially induce muscle damage if repeated at two-week interval, which could affect the results. Furthermore, the surgery-induced fibrosis would likely limit our ability to accurately resolve NMJs on later sessions. This was already a limiting factor on some sessions when using a less invasive procedure (Figure 3B – “Not observable”). Alternatively, the <italic>Sternomastoid</italic>, a neck muscle, has some surface IIa fibers and has been frequently used by Sanes and Lichtman’s groups. However, the surgery is also very invasive, also involves lifting the muscle and requires the mice to be intubated. This intubation would not be well tolerated by aged symptomatic ALS mice if repeated every two weeks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors indicate that the later loss of synapses from a single motor unit were more synchronous. It would help if the authors provided a graph/plot illustrating synchrony vs. asynchrony at different stages.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We added the timeline presented in Figure 3, showing when asynchronous and synchronous losses were observed in each MU as a function of the age of the animal. This plot illustrates that asynchronous NMJ loss starts long before synchronous MU degeneration at the single MU level. However, asynchronous losses continued to be observed in surviving MUs, even at later stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors write: 'Overall, these data reveal a propagation pattern which indicates that the local neuromuscular environment (Moloney et al., 2014) and the intrinsic susceptibility of axonal branches contribute to NMJ loss.' It would be helpful if the authors were more explicit about the meaning of 'local neuromuscular environment' and 'intrinsic susceptibility' and the implications of these conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified the statement in the subsection “NMJ dismantlement seems to propagate”. The second paragraph of the discussion also now elaborates more clearly on this idea.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors compare their findings to those of Pun et al. (2006). Did Pun et al. limit their analysis to IIb and IIx muscle fibers or might the differences between the studies be due to data in the Pun et al. study from IIa muscle fibers?</p></disp-quote><p>We are unfortunately unsure which reference to Pun et al. (2006) the reviewer is referring to. We believe he is possibly alluding to the subsection “Local NMJ loss precedes global MU degeneration”. We do not believe differences between the studies are due to type IIa being considered in Pun et al. since certain muscle regions they studied only contained IIb/IIx fibers (Class 1 sub compartment), notably the surface of the TA. Their study showed that signs of compensatory sprouting were restricted to regions containing S (I fibers) and to some extent FR MUs (IIa fibers). However, we show here that compensatory sprouting and asynchronous NMJ loss occur concomitantly with a single MU at the surface of the TA, a region containing mostly FF MUs.</p><p>We are unsure as to why our results differ from those of Pun et al. (2006). One possible explanation for this difference is that they used SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice which progress much faster than SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice. Therefore, the time window to observe these changes may be narrower and their study may not have had the temporal resolution to observe these events. This difference may also arise from differences in the methodology used to evaluate compensatory sprouting: our repeated in vivoimaging vs. their immunohistochemistry at various timepoints.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Since motor units were more likely to expand in female than male SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice, and female mice showed a decline in grip strength earlier than male mice, do the authors believe – or have evidence – that the expansions are deleterious?</p></disp-quote><p>This is not relevant to the current version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) As the authors point-out, it is surprising 'that motor neurons failed to re-innervate their lost NMJs'.

Do the authors have data to indicate where the motor axons became 'lost'? Did the axons escape near the non-myelinating terminal Schwann cell or from myelinated tracks far from the synapse?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point. When the axon retracted, it seemed to retract back to the main axonal branch/tack. When MU expansions (heterologous reinnervation) occurred, motor axons mostly formed axonal sprouts from nearby axonal tracks/branches (presumably myelinated). Terminal sprouts through the terminal non-myelinating Schwann cells were rare events in our observations (8/75 expansions). Based on the images in Figure 3—figure supplement 2A2/B2 and A4/B4, it would seem that the new heterologous axon uses the old Schwann cell tube as it clearly follows a similar path. This behavior was also described by Nguyen et al. (2002 – Figure 4) in the rare occasions that the incorrect axon (heterologous) would reinnervate an NMJ after a nerve lesion. What was surprising to us was how frequently this occurred in ALS mice compared to autologous reinnervation. Possible explanations for this phenomenon are addressed the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors write that 'Interestingly, sex-specific differences have been identified in other ALS mouse models and in patients, but they did not consistently point toward a faster or more severe disease in one sex'.

They showed that motor axons reinnervated these synaptic sites (“original sites”) as opposed to forming entirely new synaptic contacts at other locations on the muscle fibers. However, these studies did not show that a single motor axon would reinnervate the same set of NMJs that originally belonged to its motor unit. This was first shown by Nguyen et al. (2002) using the <italic>thy1</italic>-YFP-H mouse (90% fidelity).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors write: 'This observation strongly suggests that strategies aimed at stabilizing NMJs or enhancing autologous re-innervation could be of great therapeutic benefit in ALS.' Surprisingly, the authors don't cite two studies that describe such strategies: Miyoshi et al. (2017) and Cantor et al. (2018).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestions.
