function of the adaptive immune system, and regulation of T cell entry into tissues is an effective therapy in autoimmune diseases. Little is known about the specific role of cytoskeletal effectors that mediate mechanical forces and morphological changes essential for migration in complex environments. We developed a new Formin-like-1 (FMNL1) knock-out mouse model and determined that the cytoskeletal effector FMNL1 is selectively required for effector T cell trafficking to inflamed tissues, without affecting naïve T cell entry into secondary lymphoid organs. Here, we identify a FMNL1-dependent mechanism of actin polymerization at the back of the cell that enables migration of the rigid lymphocyte nucleus through restrictive barriers. Furthermore, FMNL1-deficiency impairs the ability of self-reactive effector T cells to induce autoimmune disease. Overall, our data suggest that FMNL1 may be a potential therapeutic target to specifically modulate T cell trafficking to inflammatory sites.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>T cell</kwd><kwd>autoimmunity</kwd><kwd>FMNL1</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R56AI105111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacobelli</surname><given-names>Jordan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI125553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacobelli</surname><given-names>Jordan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI119932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>Rachel S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000901</institution-id><institution>Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, International</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5-2013-200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>Rachel S</given-names></name><name><surname>Jacobelli</surname><given-names>Jordan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AI007405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Scott B</given-names></name><name><surname>Waldman</surname><given-names>Monique M</given-names></name><name><surname>Estin</surname><given-names>Miriam L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000890</institution-id><institution>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP1775</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacobelli</surname><given-names>Jordan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

However, in the context of aberrant immune function, T cell entry into target tissues can be a driver of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sallusto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Magnuson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mellado et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, disruption of T cell trafficking by targeting integrins or chemotactic stimuli appears to be a promising approach to achieving immune regulation in some disease contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engelhardt and Kappos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luster et al., 2005</xref>). Many of the adhesion molecules and chemokines that orchestrate T cell trafficking have been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nourshargh and Alon, 2014</xref>). However, less is known about downstream effectors that directly mediate the cytoskeletal changes necessary to elicit the force generation and shape changes inherent to the migratory process and entry into tissues.</p><p>To exit blood vessels and enter tissues, T cells undergo the multistep process of transendothelial migration (TEM). T cells are initially captured from the blood flow to begin selectin-mediated rolling along the vascular endothelial wall, followed by firm adherence in a chemokine driven integrin-mediated process. After crawling along the endothelium probing for permissive sites for extravasation, T cells initiate the diapedesis step and squeeze through the vascular endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nourshargh and Alon, 2014</xref>). To undergo the stages of TEM, T cells rely on morphological changes and force generation mediated by remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon and Shulman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dupré et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ridley, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, deformation of the rigid lymphocyte nucleus is a rate-limiting step for migration through confined environments such as during TEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alon and van Buul, 2017</xref>). However, the contribution of specific downstream cytoskeletal effectors to the extravasation process and in mediating nuclear deformation during migration has only recently begun to be elucidated.</p><p>Actin networks in T cells consist of branched and linear filaments that are cross-linked by the motor protein non-muscle Myosin IIA (MyoIIA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dupré et al., 2015</xref>). We have previously shown that MyoIIA mediates squeezing of the nucleus during the diapedesis step of TEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacobelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wigton et al., 2016</xref>). Branched actin networks, which are generated by the Arp2/3 complex and its upstream regulator WASP, play a role in T cell trafficking as well as membrane protrusion generation during TEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Snapper et al., 2005</xref>). Linear actin polymerization is mediated by two major families in T cells: the Ena/VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) family and the formin family. The Ena/VASP family elongates actin filaments through anti-capping activity and recruitment of actin monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chesarone and Goode, 2009</xref>). We have recently shown that Ena/VASP proteins modulate α4 integrin expression and function in T cells to promote diapedesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Estin et al., 2017</xref>). Formins remodel the actin cytoskeleton by both nucleating new actin filaments and processively elongating them through recruitment of profilin-bound actin monomers and protection from anti-capping proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faix and Grosse, 2006</xref>). Two members of the formin family are highly expressed in T cells: Diaphanous-related formin-1 (mDia1, Diaph1) and Formin-like 1 (FMNL1, FRL1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomez et al., 2007</xref>). Previous studies have identified a role for mDia1 in promoting T cell trafficking out of the thymus and into peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eisenmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2003</xref>). While a specific role for mDia1 in T cell TEM has not been identified, we have recently shown that mDia1 promotes completion of diapedesis in B cell leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>). Unlike mDia1, which is expressed in a wide variety of cell types, FMNL1 expression is largely restricted to cells of the hematopoietic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yayoshi-Yamamoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yue et al., 2014</xref>). FMNL1 has previously been implicated in macrophage phagocytosis, membrane protrusion formation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yayoshi-Yamamoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Naj et al., 2013</xref>). In leukemia cells, FMNL1 has been suggested to be involved in membrane dynamics, proliferation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Favaro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2013</xref>). However, FMNL1 is not well characterized in T cells. Previous studies have suggested that FMNL1 contributes to the reorientation of the centrosome to the immune synapse and Golgi apparatus structure in Jurkat transformed T cells as well as the cytotoxic behavior of CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colón-Franco et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, FMNL1 expression has been reported to be transcriptionally upregulated by T cells in autoimmune contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Odoardi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Degroote et al., 2017</xref>). However, the role and potential mechanism of action of FMNL1 in the motility, trafficking and TEM of primary lymphocytes is unknown.</p><p>Since previous studies relied on RNAi approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Favaro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Naj et al., 2013</xref>) or myeloid specific deletion to investigate FMNL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2017</xref>), we developed a novel germline FMNL1 knockout (KO) mouse to investigate the requirement and mechanism of action of FMNL1 in primary lymphocyte migration. Here we report that while FMNL1 is dispensable for lymphocyte development and homeostatic naive T cell trafficking, it is important for activated T cell trafficking to inflammatory sites and for enabling T cell-mediated autoimmunity. Investigating the mechanism of the trafficking defect, we determined that FMNL1 deficiency impairs T cell TEM at the diapedesis step due to impaired actin network remodeling and transmigration of the nucleus across endothelial barriers. Furthermore, our data show that the requirement for FMNL1 in T cell migration is dependent on barrier restrictiveness, particularly in conditions that require nucleus squeezing and deformation through small openings. Finally, we determined that FMNL1 mediates actin polymerization at the back of the T cell to promote nucleus squeezing through confined environments and that the amount of lymphocyte migration through these barriers is dictated by the level of FMNL1 expression. Together, our data identify FMNL1 as a novel mediator of T cell trafficking and transmigration across restrictive endothelial barriers and a regulator of self-reactive T cell autoimmunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deletion of FMNL1 does not significantly alter major immune cell populations</title><p>To determine the role of FMNL1 in immune cell function, we generated FMNL1 KO mice by inserting a LacZ-neomycin cassette into the <italic>Fmnl1</italic> locus of C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Activated T cells are distinct from naive T cells in size, expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors, and trafficking patterns. Furthermore, while the vasculature of secondary lymphoid organs is permissive for lymphocyte entry (e.g. high endothelial venules, HEV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miyasaka and Tanaka, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bajénoff et al., 2008</xref>), the vasculature in other tissues and organs poses a more stringent barrier to extravasation. For example, extravasation into the pancreatic islets of Langerhans during type 1 diabetes can take over an hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sandor et al., 2019</xref>), whereas entry into secondary lymphoid tissues occurs within minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bajénoff et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the requirements for FMNL1 in activated T cell trafficking might be different than in naive T cells.</p><p>We first examined effector T cell trafficking to the pancreatic islets in the RIP-mOVA inducible model of type 1 diabetes, in which membrane bound Ovalbumin (mOVA) is expressed in beta cells under the rat insulin promoter (RIP). To avoid any potential differences in their activation we stimulated wild-type (WT) and FMNL1 KO T cells with a strong, antigen presenting cell (APC)-independent, stimulus ex vivo using anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. We found no major differences in the proliferation, the expression of canonical markers of activation and chemokine receptors, or the size of FMNL1 KO T cells compared to WT T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To establish specific inflammation in the islets, we transferred ovalbumin specific WT OT-I transgenic T cells into RIP-mOVA mice.

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Since type 1 diabetes is driven by destruction of beta cells by islet-infiltrating antigen specific T cells, we next investigated whether the observed trafficking defects in FMNL1-deficient T cells would affect their ability to induce diabetes. To test this, we activated control or FMNL1 KO OT-I and OT-II T cells ex vivo with their cognate peptides and then transferred these cells into RIP-mOVA recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Recipient mice were then monitored for 28 days for signs of diabetes (2 consecutive blood glucose readings &gt; 350 mg/dL).

For these experiments, we employed a previously established in vitro flow chamber system to visualize and quantify T cell TEM under shear flow using time-lapse microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacobelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wigton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Estin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>). After culturing an endothelial cell monolayer within the flow chamber, we perfused in differentially dye-labeled activated control and FMNL1 KO T cells and imaged them under physiological shear flow for 30 min.

Using differentially dye-labeled WT and FMNL1 KO T cells in the same flow chamber system as above, after 5 min of migration, we fixed the cells and quantified the position of the T cell nucleus relative to the endothelium. FMNL1 KO T cells were significantly impaired in their ability to transmigrate their nuclei, with only 7% of transmigrating T cells having migrated their nuclei below the endothelium compared to 32% for WT T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This finding is consistent with our earlier observation that FMNL1 KO T cells are able to initiate diapedesis but are substantially impaired in completing the process. Taken together with the localization data, these findings suggest that FMNL1 facilitates completion of diapedesis by promoting the transmigration of the rigid nucleus through the endothelial barrier.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>T cell migration through narrow pores is FMNL1 dependent</title><p>Based on our observations that FMNL1 deficiency impaired activated T cell trafficking selectively to tissues with restrictive endothelial barriers and impaired TEM specifically at the diapedesis step, we hypothesized that the requirement for FMNL1 in migration would be dependent on the physical restriction of the barrier. To test this idea, we performed transwell assays with inserts containing pore sizes of different diameters. In response to CXCL12, activated FMNL1 KO cells were impaired in their ability to migrate across 3 μm transwell inserts compared to activated WT T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, FMNL1 KO cells migrated to CXCL12 equivalently as WT T cells across 5 μm transwell inserts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This effect was not exclusive to CXCL12, in fact in response to CXCL10, FMNL1 KO T cells were similarly impaired in migrating across 3 μm, but not 5 μm transwell inserts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The nuclei of lymphocytes have been estimated to be approximately 5–7 μm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedl et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, our observation that FMNL1-deficient T cells are impaired in transmigration of their nuclei across endothelial barriers is consistent with our finding that FMNL1-deficient T cells are impaired in transmigrating through 3 μm but not 5 μm transwell pores. Neutrophils also express FMNL1 at similar levels to T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ericson et al., 2014</xref>) but are characterized by a multi-lobed, more flexible, nuclear structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mackarel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yadav et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether FMNL1-deficient neutrophils would be impaired in migrating through 3 μm transwell pores. In response to the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1, FMNL1 KO neutrophils displayed equivalent migration compared to WT neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

To further determine the mechanism by which FMNL1 regulates T cell TEM, we next examined the ability of activated FMNL1-deficient T cells to polymerize actin in response to chemokine using fluorescent phalloidin staining to quantify filamentous actin (F-actin). Unstimulated WT and FMNL1 KO T cells displayed similar baseline levels of F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In response to 15 s of CXCL12 stimulus, WT T cells increased their total polymerized actin an average of 1.8 fold, while FMNL1 KO T cell only increased their total polymerized actin an average of 1.4 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We also observed a similar impairment in FMNL1 KO T cell actin polymerization in response to CXCL10 stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, while FMNL1 KO T cells are capable of polymerizing actin in response to chemokines, their ability to respond is ~22% reduced compared to WT T cells. Given the presence of other actin polymerizing proteins such as Arp2/3 and mDia1, this partial rather than complete inhibition is not surprising but still highlights a contribution of FMNL1 in actin remodeling in response to chemokine signaling.</p><p>Furthermore, to quantitatively test the dependence of T cell transmigration on FMNL1 expression, we expressed FMNL1 in activated WT or FMNL1 KO T cells using retroviral constructs. As expected, FMNL1 KO T cells receiving a control construct were impaired in 3 μm transwell migration to CXCL12 compared to WT T cells receiving the same construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, re-expression of FMNL1 in FMNL1 KO T cells restored their ability to transmigrate through the 3 μm pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). To determine if there was a correlation between FMNL1 levels and the ability of T cells to transmigrate, in parallel, we measured the level of FMNL1 expression in WT and FMNL1 KO T cells receiving either the control or FMNL1-expressing constructs using western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We then compared the level of FMNL1 expression to the ability of cells from the same population to migrate in a 3 μm transwell assay. We found a strong positive correlation between the level of FMNL1 expressed by a given population of T cells and their ability to transmigrate through restrictive pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This finding further supports that FMNL1 regulates the ability of activated T cells to navigate restrictive barriers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>FMNL1 mediates posterior perinuclear actin polymerization to promote T cell migration through environmental constrictions</title><p>Having determined that FMNL1 promotes extravasation by facilitating nucleus passage through the endothelial barrier, we further investigated the mechanism by which FMNL1 promotes T cell migration through restrictive environments. Our data showed that during migration through endothelial barriers FMNL1 is enriched at the back of the T cell and that FMNL1-deficient T cell nuclei are impaired in translocating through the endothelial barrier. Therefore, we employed an in vitro system that would allow us to image actin dynamics during T cell migration in a well-defined environment through unconfined and confined spaces. To this end, we used microfabricated microchannels with defined channel size and constrictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Using this system, we imaged control and FMNL1 KO T cell migration within these microchannels and found that, similar to our transwell system results, FMNL1-deficient T cells were significantly impaired in migrating through the 3 µm constriction points in the microchannels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We next used T cells derived from control LifeAct-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riedl et al., 2010</xref>) or FMNL1 KO/LifeAct-GFP mice to determine actin dynamics during migration within the microchannels using time-lapse microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>). We measured the F-actin content at the front and back of T cells migrating in the unconfined portions of the microchannels and at the time their nucleus engaged a constriction. Our analysis shows that control T cells enrich their F-actin content around the back of the nucleus when it has to deform upon encountering a constriction. However, FMNL1-deficient T cells were impaired in their ability to generate this posterior perinuclear F-actin enrichment when encountering a constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>).

In the context of autoimmunity, the trafficking of self-reactive lymphocytes to the disease site is a key step in mediating autoimmune disease. The morphological changes and force generation inherent to the extravasation process are mediated by dynamic changes to the actin cytoskeleton, but the role and mechanism of action of specific cytoskeletal effectors in regulating these effects is not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nourshargh and Alon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon and Shulman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dupré et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we report a novel role for FMNL1 in mediating activated T cell trafficking into inflamed tissues by promoting transmigration of the nucleus through restrictive endothelial barriers. Furthermore, we found that FMNL1 deficiency impaired the ability of self-reactive T cells to induce autoimmune disease. Together, these findings identify a previously unknown FMNL1-dependent mechanism that enables T cells to enter non-lymphoid tissues to execute their effector functions, enabling autoimmune pathology.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first report of germline FMNL1 KO mice and the first investigation of the effects of FMNL1 deficiency in T cell migration and autoimmune disease in vivo. A prior report suggested that complete FMNL1 deficiency in mice would be embryonically lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2017</xref>). However, our FMNL1-deficient mice are viable and breed normally. This discrepancy may be due to differences in the targeting approach and use of a ubiquitously expressed Cre recombinase in the earlier approach. Our observation of normal populations of immune cells within the blood, spleen, and lymph nodes of FMNL1-deficient mice suggests that FMNL1 is dispensable for hematopoiesis. It is likely that other formins, such as mDia1, have a more predominant role in lymphocyte development and proliferation, and/or can compensate for the loss of FMNL1. Thus, our observations here present the opportunity to examine the function of FMNL1 in T cell trafficking and autoimmune disease without the potential confounding effects of altered lymphocyte development and proliferation.</p><p>The remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is critical for morphological changes and mechanotransduction throughout the TEM process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dupré et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon and Shulman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ridley, 2011</xref>). Anchoring of integrins to the actin cytoskeleton is critical for firm adhesion and crawling upon to the endothelial monolayer, while the generation of actin-rich membrane protrusions is important for probing the endothelial monolayer and initiating diapedesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon and Shulman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dupré et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ridley, 2011</xref>). Surprisingly, despite displaying reduced actin polymerizing capacity in response to chemokines, FMNL1-deficient T cells were equivalent to WT cells in their ability to adhere and crawl on to the endothelial monolayer and initiate diapedesis. These observations differ from previous studies of macrophages where FMNL1 was reported to promote the adhesion and migration of macrophages through the formation of membrane protrusions known as podosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yayoshi-Yamamoto et al., 2000</xref>). While similar membrane structures in T cells have been suggested to play an important role in sensing of chemokine and initiating diapedesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dupré et al., 2015</xref>), our observations of normal crawling and diapedesis initiation in FMNL1-deficient T cells suggest that FMNL1 may not be required for these functions in T cells. The cellular localization of FMNL1 also appears different between macrophages and T cells, with FMNL1 enriched in ventral podosomal structures in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2017</xref>) but enriched behind the nucleus in T cells during TEM as shown herein. These observations argue for a distinct or additional role for FMNL1 in T cells compared to macrophages.</p><p>Completion of diapedesis also relies on actin remodeling and force generation as our previous work with the actin polymerizing Ena/VASP proteins and the cytoskeletal motor protein MyoIIA has demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacobelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Estin et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to Ena/VASP proteins, FMNL1 is dispensable for the early stages of T cell TEM, instead being required for efficient completion of diapedesis. Our data also suggest that FMNL1, like Ena/VASP proteins, has a selective role in the trafficking of activated cells. Despite both Ena/VASP proteins and FMNL1 being propagators of linear actin filaments, they appear to have distinct mechanisms of action. Whereas Ena/VASP proteins mediate diapedesis through regulating the expression and function of α4 integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Estin et al., 2017</xref>), our data suggest that FMNL1 mediates diapedesis by promoting transmigration of the nucleus. Thus, while Ena/VASP deficiency impairs the trafficking of activated T cells to both lymphoid tissue and inflammatory sites, where α4 integrin can be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Issekutz, 1991</xref>), FMNL1 deficiency only impairs trafficking to non-lymphoid tissue sites with more restrictive endothelial barriers. These observations suggest that the nature of the vascular bed through which T cells transmigrate modulates the requirement for FMNL1 and can, in part, explain why FMNL1-deficiency affects effector T cells but not naïve T cells. Endothelial vascular barriers such as in HEVs in lymph nodes are more permissive compared to vascular barriers in peripheral tissues, which form more complex and restrictive tight junctions. This barrier difference likely requires additional force generation by the T cell to push its rigid nucleus through these restrictive barriers, a process that more heavily relies on FMNL1. This finding is supported by our transwell and microchannel migration data, in which the role for FMNL1 appears to be pore size dependent, consistent with the idea that FMNL1 is involved in promoting the transmigration of the rigid nucleus during migration through restrictive barriers.</p><p>MyoIIA has also been reported to facilitate nuclear transmigration in T cells, providing contractile force to deform the rigid nuclear structure during both TEM and in migration through restrictive environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacobelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedl et al., 2011</xref>). FMNL1 displays a perinuclear localization during TEM similar to MyoIIA, and we identified a role for FMNL1 in generating perinuclear actin structures during migration under confinement. Analogous to MyoIIA-deficient T cells, FMNL1-deficient T cells also have impaired nuclear transmigration and completion of diapedesis. Thus, FMNL1 may be acting either in parallel or in cooperation with MyoIIA to facilitate nuclear transmigration. One possibility is that FMNL1 is generating an actin network that is then crosslinked by MyoIIA to generate contractile force. Alternatively, FMNL1 may be generating different actin structures to provide propulsion force for nuclear transmigration. In addition to its actin polymerizing function, FMNL1 has also been implicated in actin bundling and severing activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 2006</xref>) and could remodel actin networks in various ways to promote TEM.</p><p>Previous investigations of mDia1, the other highly-expressed formin in T cells, observed defects in T cell development and trafficking to secondary lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eisenmann et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, in FMNL1-deficient mice we observed normal populations of both developmental and mature T cells and identified a selective requirement for FMNL1 extravasation through restrictive endothelial barriers and trafficking to inflamed tissues. Furthermore, while prior reports indicate that loss of mDia1 impairs chemotaxis even through non-restrictive barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakata et al., 2007</xref>), we observed that FMNL1 was selectively required for chemotaxis through narrow pores. Together these findings suggest a distinct and specific role for FMNL1 in mediating nuclear transmigration through restrictive endothelial barriers compared to a more general role for mDia1 in T cell motility.</p><p>The use of FMNL1 by T cells to promote transmigration of the nucleus may represent a unique mechanism compared to those employed by other immune cell types. For example, dendritic cells have been suggested to use actin polymerization by Arp2/3, instead of by formins, to facilitate nuclear deformation when migrating through restrictive environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thiam et al., 2016</xref>). Nuclear flexibility may also dictate the requirement for actin mediated nuclear manipulation. It has been reported that neutrophils, which have multi-lobed deformable nuclei, or cells with induced nuclear flexibility do not display perinuclear actin accumulation when encountering restrictive spaces, while cells with rigid nuclei do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thiam et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this literature, we observed that FMNL1 was dispensable for neutrophil migration through narrow pores, while in activated T cells, varying the level of FMNL1 expression strongly correlated with narrow pore transmigration. After activation, the nuclear volume of T cells increases but still maintains a rigid ovoid structure in contrast to the flexible segmented nuclear structure of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedl et al., 2011</xref>). However, similar to neutrophils, effector T cells must rapidly migrate into tissues to execute their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Masopust and Schenkel, 2013</xref>). Thus, we propose that FMNL1-driven perinuclear actin polymerization in activated T cells compensates for their increased nuclear size and rigidity by facilitating nuclear migration through constricted environments such as the restrictive endothelial barriers of non-lymphoid tissues.</p><p>Our observations of T cell induced EAE and type 1 diabetes models suggest that reduced trafficking by FMNL1-deficient T cells to sites of inflammation plays a role in impairing the induction of autoimmune disease. While we observed a partial but significant inhibition of trafficking, we observed complete disease protection in a subset of mice in both disease phenotypes. The differences between these findings may be due to the fact that in the activated T cell transfer disease models, no prior immune infiltration has occurred, and thus, the vascular endothelial barriers are much more impermissive compared to the trafficking models where inflammation and immune cell recruitment is ongoing. Furthermore, there may be a threshold effect whereby trafficking is reduced such that the number of FMNL1-deficient T cells capable of entering the tissue are not sufficient to induce disease. While, in this report, we have examined the function of FMNL1 in T cell TEM, it is also possible that, in these disease contexts, FMNL1 may have additional roles within the disease site or might impact migration within restrictive tissue parenchyma. It has been previously reported that knockdown of FMNL1 slightly impaired human CD8 T cell killing in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomez et al., 2007</xref>), thus FMNL1 deficiency may also play a role in OT-I T cell effector function in the RIP-mOVA model. Future study of FMNL1 function in T cells within tissues may identify additional mechanisms by which FMNL1 regulates T cell behavior.</p><p>Inhibition of T cell trafficking has shown therapeutic promise in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luster et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engelhardt and Kappos, 2008</xref>). Our observations that FMNL1 deficiency in T cells impairs their ability to traffic to autoimmune inflammatory sites and induce autoimmune disease in both EAE and type 1 diabetes suggest that FMNL1 may be a potential therapeutic target for autoimmune disease treatment. As immune cell development and homeostatic trafficking appear unaltered by global FMNL1 deficiency, targeting of FMNL1 may offer the possibility of selectively impairing activated T cell trafficking to specific tissue sites while leaving systemic immune surveillance intact. A recent report has suggested that selectively inhibiting activated T cell trafficking may be particularly beneficial in the context of graft-versus-host disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). While previously studied cytoskeletal effectors of T cell migration, such as Arp2/3, mDia1, MyoIIA and Ena/Vasp proteins are expressed in most tissues and cell types, FMNL1 expression is largely restricted to hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yayoshi-Yamamoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yue et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, FMNL1 expression has been reported to be transcriptionally upregulated by T cells that migrate to sites of autoimmune inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Odoardi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Degroote et al., 2017</xref>). This expression profile may offer the possibility of a more targeted approach to therapeutically alter cytoskeletal function in immune cells.</p><p>In conclusion, our observations have uncovered a new mechanism that promotes lymphocyte nucleus passage through constrictive environments. This process of FMNL1-dependent nucleus transmigration is key for the extravasation of effector T cells through the restrictive vascular endothelial barriers present in non-lymphoid tissues. Furthermore, FMNL1 deficiency in T cells impairs their ability to induce autoimmune disease, suggesting that targeting of FMNL1 may be therapeutically beneficial.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic Reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">FMNL1 KO</td><td valign="top">This Paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">FMNL1 deficient mouse on C57BL/6 genetic background</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic Reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">LifeAct-GFP</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Riedl et al., 2008</xref></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_EM:12427">IMSR_EM:12427</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Mice expressing LifeAct-GFP construct on C57BL/6 genetic background</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-FMNL1 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td valign="top">Cat#: sc-390466 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2847962">AB_2847962</ext-link> <break/>Clone A-4</td><td valign="top">IF (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA Reagent</td><td valign="top">FMNL1-IRES-GFP MMLV <break/>(plasmid)</td><td valign="top">VectorBuilder</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">pMMLV vector that expresses FMNL1 and GFP (under an IRES)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA Reagent</td><td valign="top">Control GFP MMLV and Control RFP MMLV <break/>(plasmids)</td><td valign="top">VectorBuilder</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Control pMMLV vectors that express GFP or RFP</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Microchannel fluidic devices</td><td valign="top">4DCell</td><td valign="top">Cat#s: MC011 and MC019</td><td valign="top">Microchannel devices with variable channel widths and constrictions</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">bEnd.3</td><td valign="top">ATCC <break/>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Montesano et al., 1990</xref>)</td><td valign="top">Cat#: <break/>CRL-2299 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0170">CVCL_0170</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Mouse endothelial cell line used in the TEM assays</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of FMNL1 KO mice</title><p>To obtain FMNL1 KO mice, we targeted the <italic>Fmnl1</italic> gene via homologous recombination by inserting, after exon 3 of <italic>Fmnl1</italic>, a strong splice acceptor and a LacZ tag followed by a Neomycin selection cassette into C57BL/6 embryonic stem (ES) cells. The targeting construct was purchased from EUCOMM. This construct also inserts loxP sites flanking exons 4 to 6 as well as FRT sites flanking the LacZ tag and Neomycin cassette. This can enable future conversion of the targeted allele into a conditional KO after crossing with Flp recombinase mice to eliminate the LacZ-Neomycin cassette and then crossing to mice expressing Cre recombinase to excise exons 4–6. To target the <italic>Fmnl1</italic> allele, C57BL/6N (JM8.F6) ES cells were electroporated with the targeting construct and selected using G418. Individual ES cell colonies were isolated, and putative positive homologous recombinants were identified using loss of allele analysis followed by long range PCR through both the 5’ and 3’ ends of the targeting construct into the <italic>Fmnl1</italic> locus. The homologous recombinant ES cell clones were chromosome counted, and clones with the best euploidy were microinjected into C57BL/6 albino blastocysts. High percentage male chimeras generated from these injections were bred to C57BL/6 albino females. Offspring with black coat color were genotyped for the desired <italic>Fmnl1</italic> targeting by PCR. Mice containing the <italic>Fmnl1</italic> targeted allele were selected as breeders to propagate the FMNL1 KO transgenic line. Targeting of the <italic>Fmnl1</italic> gene was further confirmed by western blot comparing lysates from T cells derived from control and homozygous FMNL1 KO mice, which show a complete loss of FMNL1 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mice</title><p>For characterization experiments and experiments with polyclonal T cells, FMNL1 KO mice were paired with age and sex matched WT C57BL/6 mice bred in house.

Cells were allowed to migrate for 1 hr at 37°C and then quantified as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Actin polymerization assay</title><p>Quantification of actin polymerization in response to chemokine was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Estin et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, ex vivo activated WT or FMNL1 KO T cells were stimulated with either no chemokine, 1 μg/mL CXCL12 or 100 ng/mL CXCL10 (Peprotech) for 5, 15, or 60 s at 37°C in imaging media. All conditions were set up in duplicate. The reaction was stopped using 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS and the cells were fixed for 10 min. T cells were then permeabilized with saponin buffer (as in microscopy experiments) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were stained with a 1:50 dilution of Phalloidin Alexa Fluor 647 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and fluorescence was quantified using a CyAn ADP flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Geometric mean fluorescence intensities (gMFI) were normalized to the values of the unstimulated samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>FMNL1 Re-expression</title><p>WT or FMNL1 KO T cells were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies as above and then on day two post-activation transduced with Maloney murine leukemia retrovirus (MMLV) constructs either expressing FMNL1 and GFP (under an IRES) or fluorescent protein alone. To maximize expression, cells were transduced a second time with the same virus on day 3 post-activation. On day four post-activation, GFP<sup>+</sup> T cells were sorted using an ICyte Synergy (Sony). After 24 hr of culture, cells were used in transwell assays or for western blot as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Microchannel migration imaging</title><p>PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) microchannel fluidic devices with constrictions were purchased from 4DCell (Montreuil, France). Microchannels with 8 µm or 12 µm channel widths and 3 µm constrictions were used. Five to six days after activation, 1−2 × 10<sup>5</sup> ex vivo activated control and FMNL1 KO T cells were fluorescently labeled and added to the central entry ports of the microchannel devices and CXCL10 (100 ng/mL) was added to the side ports. T cells were allowed to spontaneously enter the channels at 37°C for 1 hr. T cells crawling in the microchannels were then imaged on a spinning disk confocal at 37°C for 2–6 hr at intervals of 30 or 60 s. In a separate set of experiments to determine F-actin distribution during migration within microchannels with constrictions, control LifeAct-GFP or FMNL1 KO/LifeAct-GFP ex vivo activated T cells were labeled with Hoechst, to visualize their nuclei, and then added to microchannel devices as above. Image acquisition and analysis were done using Slidebook 6 software to quantify passage through constrictions and actin distribution relative to the T cell nucleus. T cell passage through constrictions and F-actin distribution scoring was performed in a blinded manner. F-actin distribution analysis was performed by generating a mask based on the fluorescence intensity of the LifeAct-GFP channel using a 2-fold over background threshold. The mask was then separated into front and back parts relative to the middle of the nucleus and the direction of migration. The mean fluorescence intensity of LifeAct-GFP in each mask was then determined and a back-to-front intensity ratio calculated. For each analyzed cell, the back-to-front F-actin ratio was determined during unconfined migration and at the initial timepoint at which the cell’s nucleus started engaging the 3 µm constriction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>GraphPad Prism 7.0 software was used to create graphs and to perform all statistical analyses. Specific statistical tests and n for each experiment are indicated in the corresponding figure legend. In experiments looking directly at WT or FMNL1 KO mice, such as the characterization experiments, the individual mice were considered to be the independent experimental unit (n). In experiments where WT or KO T cells were transferred into multiple recipient mice, the source mouse for transferred cells was considered the independent experimental unit and statistics were performed on the mean values from mice receiving the same source of cells. Similarly, for microscopy experiments, the source mouse was considered to be the independent experimental unit, and statistics were performed on the mean values from cells from the same source, except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref> in which statistics were performed on individual cell values.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank B Basta, O Castro-Villasano, K Dew, M Gebert, K Morgan, J Olivas, J Phares, E Rodriguez, D Tracy, and S Yannacone for technical help with mouse genotyping and colony maintenance; J Loomis and S Sobus for expert technical assistance with cell sorting and flow cytometer maintenance; J Loomis for microscope maintenance; Drs.

important contributions to unexpected differences in cytoskeletal machinery for entry of T cells into sites of inflammation. The work may, in the future, contribute to treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Formin-like 1 mediates effector T cell trafficking to inflammatory sites to enable T cell-mediated autoimmunity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: S. Celeste Morley (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Your work identifies an important function of formin-like 1 (FMNL1) in activated T cell transendothelial migration (TEM).You developed a FMNL1 KO mouse and this mouse showed amazingly no immune defects (particularly in T cell differentiation and activation) during homeostasis. You, however, utilized two autoimmune disease models, type 1 diabetes and EAE, and showed impaired trafficking of activated FMNL1 KO T cells to the site of inflammation and also reduced disease incidence. You then investigated the mechanisms that caused impaired trafficking of FMNL1 KO T cells to nonlymphoid tissues. FMNL1 KO T cells have impaired diapedesis during TEM because FMNL1 mediates posterior perinuclear actin polymerization during TEM. This is important for transmigration of the large nucleus in lymphocytes across endothelial barriers, allowing for diapedesis through restrictive openings.</p><p>Revisions potentially requiring new data:</p><p>1) It would be helpful information in interpreting baseline changes in naïve and effector T cells if they could provide immunoblots of detergent soluble and insoluble fractions of F-actin and total cellular actin in the supplementary data, to see if it is altered by FMNL-1 deficiency.

We have included data on the baseline levels of F-actin in unstimulated control and FMNL1 KO T cells (in Figure 6C). These data show similar baseline levels of F-actin in control and KO cells. The baseline F-actin data were obtained by Phalloidin staining and flow cytometry rather than biochemically as suggested. However, we believe that the addition of these baseline F-actin data in control and KO T cells should sufficiently address the reviewers’ question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors showed that there was no obvious defect when they stimulated polyclonal T cells from FMNL1 KO mice with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in vitro in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.

Specifically, we have included data from control and FMNL1 KO 2D2-TCR T cells, which also support that in the context of self-reactive T cells control and KO T cells are similarly activated in vitro. We have obtained similar results with OT-I and OT-II T cells but think that it would be redundant to add all these data in the paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
