We found that they interact to promote centriole duplication and form a hierarchy in which each is required to localize another to the centrosome, with CDK5RAP2 at the apex, and CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63 at sequentially lower positions. MCPH proteins interact with distinct centriolar satellite proteins; CDK5RAP2 interacts with SPAG5 and CEP72, CEP152 with CEP131, WDR62 with MOONRAKER, and CEP63 with CEP90 and CCDC14. These satellite proteins localize their cognate MCPH interactors to centrosomes and also promote centriole duplication. Consistent with a role for satellites in microcephaly, homozygous mutations in one satellite gene, <italic>CEP90</italic>, may cause MCPH. The satellite proteins, with the exception of CCDC14, and MCPH proteins promote centriole duplication by recruiting CDK2 to the centrosome. Thus, centriolar satellites build a MCPH complex critical for human neurodevelopment that promotes CDK2 centrosomal localization and centriole duplication.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07519.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07519.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07519.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a cell divides, the chromosomes that contain the genetic blueprint for the cell must be replicated and shared between the two new cells. A structure called the centrosome organizes the cellular machinery that separates the chromosome copies during cell division. At the center of each centrosome are two cylindrical microtubule-based structures called centrioles.</p><p>Mutations in certain proteins that interact with the centrosome cause a neurodevelopmental disorder called primary microcephaly. People born with microcephaly have unusually small heads and brains. As a result, they may have difficulties with mental tasks. Scientists do not know exactly how these ‘microcephaly-associated’ proteins normally interact with the centrosomes or what they do at the centrosomes, so it is difficult to work out what goes wrong in people with microcephaly. One idea is that the proteins help to duplicate the centrioles before a cell divides. If this duplication does not occur, a cell cannot divide properly; so, people with mutations that interfere with centriole duplication cannot grow enough brain cells.</p><p>Now, Kodani et al. have examined how these microcephaly-associated proteins work with ‘satellite’ proteins that congregate near the centrosome to duplicate centrioles. The satellite proteins help to recruit four microcephaly-associated proteins to the centrosome, where they are built into a ring. The microcephaly-associated proteins congregate at the centrosome in a particular order, with each protein recruiting the next one in the sequence. Once all four are in place near the centrosome, an enzyme that helps to duplicate the centrioles joins them.</p><p>Further experiments suggest that mutations that affect one of the satellite proteins—known as CEP90—may cause microcephaly. Future analysis of how microcephaly-associated genes work may reveal the cell biological mechanisms by which centrioles participate in brain development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07519.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07519.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>centriole</kwd><kwd>microcephaly</kwd><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>centriolar satellite</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>brain development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR054396</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reiter</surname><given-names>Jeremy F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 GM081879</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krogan</surname><given-names>Nevan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund (BWF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reiter</surname><given-names>Jeremy F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM095941</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reiter</surname><given-names>Jeremy F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007100</institution-id><institution>Sandler Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research (PBBR)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kodani</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBLI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HL007731</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kodani</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBLI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 HL089707</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krogan</surname><given-names>Nevan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>To control centriole duplication, centriolar satellite proteins assemble a microcephaly-associated protein complex at the centrosome and activate cyclin-dependent kinase 2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>At the heart of the centrosome, the principle microtubule-organizing center of a mammalian cell, are two centrioles. During S phase, centrioles are duplicated through the coordinated assembly of centriolar complexes near the proximal ends of the preexisting centrioles. Centriole duplication is coupled to the cell cycle preventing under- or over-duplication, either of which can disrupt spindle formation and chromosomal segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hinchcliffe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lacey et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meraldi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vidwans et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haase et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Within centrosomes, a pair of centrioles are surrounded by pericentriolar material and centriolar satellites, 70–100 nm diameter electron dense structures that participate in microtubule-based transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kubo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dammermann and Merdes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kodani et al., 2010</xref>).

Many of the genes mutated in MCPH encode centrosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bond et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kumar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guernsey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nicholas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sir et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). The association of MCPH proteins with the centrosome is evolutionarily conserved with <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delattre et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Strnad and Gonczy, 2008</xref>). Three MCPH proteins, CEP152, CEP135 and STIL, interact with and promote the centrosomal localization of SAS4 (also known as CPAP or CENPJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Strnad and Gonczy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cizmecioglu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dzhindzhev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sir et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). Failure to recruit SAS4 can attenuate centriole elongation and duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Comartin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). Together, these observations have raised the possibility that CEP152, CEP135 and STIL promote the recruitment of proteins to the centrosome to facilitate centriole duplication. However, how these MCPH-associated proteins localize to the centrosome and how they promote centriole duplication have remained largely elusive.</p><p>Apart from CEP152, CEP135, STIL and SAS4, the protein products of other MCPH-associated genes, including WDR62, CDK5RAP2 and CEP63, participate in centriole biogenesis and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nicholas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sir et al., 2011</xref>). Whether and, if so, how these proteins function together are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that these MCPH-associated proteins biochemically interact and cooperate in a shared mechanism of centriole biogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we identified interactors of each MCPH-associated protein and found that the MCPH proteins CDK5RAP2, CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63 physically associate with each other. Moreover, they form a hierarchy in which each is required to localize another to the centrosome, and that this stepwise assembly at the centrosome is essential to promote centriole duplication.</p><p>In addition to interacting with each other, the MCPH-associated proteins CDK5RAP2, CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63 each interacts with a cognate centriolar satellite proteins. Their associated centriolar satellite partners are required for the localization of the interacting MCPH-associated protein to the centrosome. Consistent with a role in building the MCPH protein complex at the centrosome, centriolar satellites, like their MCPH-associated proteins, are necessary for centriole duplication to occur efficiently. Thus, paralleling the hierarchy of MCPH-associated proteins, there is a hierarchy of satellite proteins, each of which participates in the centriolar localization of an MCPH-associated protein. We found that a homozygous, missense mutation affecting one of these centriolar satellite components, <italic>CEP90</italic>, is associated with microcephaly, further validating the functional connection between centriolar satellites and the function of the previously defined MCPH-associated proteins.</p><p>How do the centrosomal MCPH-associated proteins promote centriole duplication? We found that both the MCPH-associated proteins and their centriolar satellite partner proteins are required for the centrosomal localization of CDK2, a cyclin-dependent kinase with established roles in both cell cycle progression and centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hinchcliffe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meraldi et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, MCPH-associated proteins and centriolar satellites cooperate to ensure the stepwise recruitment to the centrosome of additional MCPH-assocated proteins, culminating in bringing CDK2 to the centrosome and duplicating the centrioles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MCPH-associated proteins interact and hierarchically localize to the centrosome</title><p>To determine which centrosomal proteins CDK5RAP2, CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63 associate with, we immunoprecipitated endogenous CDK5RAP2, CEP152, WDR62, and CEP63 from HeLa cells and identified co-precipitating proteins by LC-MS/MS. c-Myc, a non-centrosomal protein, served as a negative control in our immunoprecipitation experiments. While we detected a number of interacting proteins, we focused our study on proteins previously reported to localize to the centrosome and implicated in centriole duplication. Specifically, we used the data from Jakobsen et al. and Balestra et al. to identify likely centrosomal proteins and those required for centriole biogenesis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jakobsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balestra et al., 2013</xref>).

CDK5RAP2, CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63 co-fractionated with the centrosomal protein CP110 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that CDK5RAP2, CEP152, WDR62, and CEP63 interact with each other at the centrosome.</p><p>As MCPH-associated proteins localize to the centrosome, we investigated whether the interaction of CDK5RAP2, CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63 reflects a shared centrosomal function. Consistent with previous studies, depletion of <italic>CEP152</italic> or <italic>CEP63</italic> disrupted centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2013</xref>). In these, and other similar experiments described below, we observed a mixture of cells in S phase (as determined by nuclear Cyclin A localization) with two and three centrioles, instead of four centrioles as observed in scrambled control siRNA (SC)-transfected cells: the images presented in the figures are of cells in which three centrioles are observed. Similar to the depletion of <italic>CEP152</italic> and <italic>CEP63</italic>, knockdown of <italic>CDK5RAP2</italic> or <italic>WDR62</italic>, inhibited centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,E</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing a fusion between a truncated Cdk5rap2 and βGEO or decreased levels of Wdr62 exhibit centriole overaccumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that efficient depletion of CDK5RAP2 and WDR62 has different consequences than truncations or partial reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,F</xref>). To confirm that CDK5RAP2 (also called <italic>CEP215</italic>) is required for centriole duplication, we repeated <italic>CDK5RAP2</italic> knockdown using two previously published siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graser et al., 2007</xref>). Both of these <italic>CDK5RAP2</italic> siRNAs also reduced the percentage of S phase cells with two pairs of centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Instead of four centrioles, the majority of S phase <italic>CDK5RAP2, CEP152, WDR62</italic> or <italic>CEP63</italic>-depleted cells possessed only two or three centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, depicting instances of three centrioles). A reduced number of centrioles in S phase could be caused by either a failure or delay in centriole duplication. Therefore, we also examined the number of centrioles in mitotic SC, <italic>CDK5RAP2</italic>, <italic>CEP152</italic>, <italic>WDR62</italic> and <italic>CEP63</italic>-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Depleting MCPH-associated proteins also caused a significant decrease in the number of centrioles in mitosis, suggesting that these MCPH-associated proteins have a shared function in promoting centriole duplication.</p><p>As depletion of each of these four MCPH-associated proteins, CDK5RAP2, CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63, has similar effects on centriole duplication, we examined whether they co-localize. We discovered that, like CDK5RAP2, CEP152, and CEP63, WDR62 localizes to the interphase centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To more precisely identify where WDR62 localizes at the centrosome, we used structured illumination microscopy. Also like CDK5RAP2, CEP152, and CEP63, WDR62 is present in a toroidal structure with a diameter of 400–500 nm adjacent to SAS6, a component of the proximal end of procentrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Strnad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sir et al., 2011</xref>). We found that the appearance of CDK5RAP2 differed depending on whether it was imaged using SIM or diffraction limited microscopy, which may be attributable to the limitations of SIM in imaging low contrast samples such as the CDK5RAP2 outside of the toroidal structure.</p><p>Given their indistinguishable sub-centrosomal localization, we hypothesized that these MCPH proteins participate in each other's localization. Surprisingly, we found that there is a hierarchy by which they localize to the centrosome. CEP152, WDR62, and CEP63 failed to localize to the centrosome in the absence of <italic>CDK5RAP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, and quantitated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2 fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplements 2E, 7A</xref>). As this localization dependency differed from that reported by Firat-Karalar et al. we confirmed that the centrosomal localization of CEP152 depends on CDK5RAP2 using four non-overlapping siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, depletion of <italic>CEP152</italic>, <italic>WDR62</italic> or <italic>CEP63</italic> had no effect on CDK5RAP2 localization, indicating that CDK5RAP2 has a unique role in localizing other MCPH-associated protein to centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, and quantitated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A</xref>). The stability of CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63 was unaltered in <italic>CDK5RAP2</italic>-depleted cells, indicating that their mislocalization was not due to degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3 fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplements 3D, 6A</xref>).</p><p>CEP152 has previously been shown to be essential for the centrosomal localization of CEP63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lukinavicius et al., 2013</xref>). We confirmed this finding and extended it by finding that depletion of <italic>CEP152</italic> also prevented WDR62 from localizing to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, and quantitated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A</xref>). Consistent with a hierarchy of MCPH-assocated proteins, only CEP63 failed to localize to the centrosome in the absence of <italic>WDR62</italic>, while CDK5RAP2, CEP152 and WDR62 all properly localized to centrosomes in the absence of <italic>CEP63</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, and quantitated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A</xref>). Similar to the depletion of <italic>CDK5RAP2,</italic> the protein levels of all four proteins were unaltered in these MCPH protein knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Thus, CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63 have progressively more restricted roles in MCPH protein localization to centrosomes than does CDK5RAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have reported that CEP152 and CEP63 depend on each other to localize to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sir et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lukinavicius et al., 2013</xref>). In support of these findings, we confirmed that CEP63 failed to localize to the centrosome in <italic>CEP152</italic>-depleted cells with no detectable changes in protein stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Contrary to previous findings, we did not detect a decrease of centrosomal CEP152 in <italic>CEP63</italic>-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A</xref>).

(<italic>CEP63 NB</italic>) efficiently depleted CEP63 and disrupted centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7A,B</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>CEP63 NB</italic> also reduced the centrosomal localization of CDK5RAP2, CEP152 and WDR62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7C,D</xref>). <italic>CEP63 NB</italic> also reduced the protein levels of CDK5RAP2, CEP152 and WDR62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7E,F</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Whereas <italic>CEP63 NB</italic> destabilized CEP152, the other <italic>CEP63</italic> siRNAs used in this study did not, suggesting that depletion of CEP63 may not necessarily lead to CEP152 destabilization and reduced centrosomal CEP152.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that the centrosomal localization of CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63 depends on CDK5RAP2, localization of WDR62 and CEP63 depends on CEP152, and localization of CEP63 depends on WDR62, indicating a hierarchical localization scheme. As loss of any of these MCPH proteins disrupts centriole duplication or stability, we propose that the ordered accumulation of MCPH proteins at the centrosome is critical for centriole duplication or stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MCPH proteins interact with centriolar satellite components</title><p>In addition to MCPH-associated proteins, CDK5RAP2, CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63 copurified with other proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

These findings suggest that the centriolar satellite proteins CEP72 and SPAG5 interact with CDK5RAP2, stabilize each other and CDK5RAP2, and promote the localization of CDK5RAP2 to the centrosome.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that CEP72 and SPAG5 are each required for centrosome maturation during formation of the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oshimori et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>). Given that CEP72 and SPAG5 are required for CDK5RAP2 centrosomal localization, we hypothesized that, during interphase, CEP72 and SPAG5 may be important for centriole biogenesis. Therefore, we examined whether depletion of either <italic>CEP72</italic> or <italic>SPAG5</italic> phenocopies the effects of <italic>CDK5RAP2</italic> depletion on centriole duplication. Similar to the loss of CDK5RAP2, greater than 78% of <italic>CEP72</italic>-depleted and 83% of <italic>SPAG5</italic>-depleted S phase cells had fewer than four centrioles, indicating that these proteins may function together with CDK5RAP2 to promote centriole duplication or stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–I</xref>).</p><p>Because CEP72 and SPAG5 are required for the centrosomal localization of CDK5RAP2, and CDK5RAP2 is required for the centrosomal localization of other MCPH-associated proteins CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63, we examined whether the loss of SPAG5 or CEP72 altered the localization of the CDK5RAP2-dependent MCPH proteins.

The two affected boys (MC-701 and MC-702) were born to parents who were first cousins and who had a total of 12 pregnancies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). In addition to their two affected sons, they had four unaffected children, five miscarriages and one stillbirth at 6 months of gestation with multiple congenital anomalies. Both affected boys presented with a similar syndrome of microcephaly, intellectual disability, spasticity, and dysmorphisms. At birth, MC-701 measured 2.98 kg (18th percentile) for weight, 50 cm (48th percentile) for length and 33 cm (10th percentile) for head circumference. Global developmental delay was noted at 5 months of age; he toe walked at 3 years, later developed tetraplegia, and is wheelchair-bound. He exhibits spasticity especially in the lower extremities with scissoring and Achilles contractures, hyperreflexia, ankle clonus and a positive Babinksi sign. He suffers from severe intellectual disability and does not speak. His dysmorphic features include hypertelorism, large ears, broad nose, anteverted nares, thick lips and a large mouth, as well as pectus carinatum and kyphoscoliosis. His brother, MC-702, has a similar phenotype with a head circumference of 48.5 cm (4 standard deviations below the mean) at 14 years of age. Brain magnetic resonance imaging noted normal gross morphology with atrophy.</p><p>Whole exome analysis suggested that <italic>CEP90</italic> is one of two strong candidates to contribute to the phenotype observed in this family. Both affected boys possess a homozygous missense alteration in the second coding exon of the <italic>CEP90</italic> gene (chr13:73366597G&gt;C [hg19]), resulting in p.E89Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).

E89 is highly conserved, including 9/9 vertebrate species including <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish as well as much more distantly related species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D</xref>). The nonconservative p.E89Q alteration is strongly predicted by SIFT and Polyphen2 to be pathogenic (SIFT and Polyphen2 scores of 0 and 0.99, respectively). Both affected boys also have a homozygous intronic variant in <italic>AP4S1</italic> (rs185246578, NM_001254729:exon5:c.295-3C&gt;A), a gene in which truncating mutations have been reported to cause a phenotype that overlaps that described in this family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26a">Hardies et al., 2015</xref>). The variant detected in this family (rs185246578) is of uncertain significance, as it is an intronic SNP that was previously reported by the 1000 Genomes Project, is not strongly predicted to be pathogenic by splice prediction algorithms, and lies upstream of exon 5 of 6, which is skipped in one of the known <italic>AP4S1</italic> isoforms.</p><p>To test whether the observed <italic>CEP90</italic> mutation affects protein function, we engineered cDNAs corresponding to wild type and E89Q alleles and expressed the constructs in HeLa cells for 6 hr.

Interestingly, CEP90 E89Q interacted efficiently with PCM1, but did not bind CEP63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>).

These MCPH-associated proteins assemble in a step-wise hierarchical manner to form a toroidal ring at the proximal centriole. We also found that each of these MCPH-associated proteins interacts with distinct centriolar satellite components that are required for the ordered recruitment of its cognate MCPH protein to the centrosome. Therefore, the centriolar satellite proteins, like the MCPH proteins, have critical roles in promoting centriole duplication. Consistent with a role of centriolar satellites in the function of proteins previously associated with MCPH, we have found evidence that the centriolar satellite gene, <italic>CEP90</italic>, may be mutated in rare instances of MCPH.</p><p>The assembly of MCPH proteins culminates in CDK2 localization to centrosomes, a previously recognized regulator of centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hinchcliffe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matsumoto et al., 1999</xref>). In contrast to the other centriolar satellites components that promote MCPH-associated protein localization to the centrosomes and centriole duplication, CCDC14 opposes this pathway by limiting the centrosomal localization of CEP63 and its interactor CDK2. Thus, centriolar satellite proteins can have either positive or negative roles in controlling the centrosomal localization of MCPH-associated proteins and CDK2, and are thus critical for centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>).</p><p>Several previous studies in various organisms have demonstrated how proteins can recruit each other to the centrosome to promote centriole duplication. For example, the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> homologs of CDK5RAP2 and CEP152, Centrosomin and Asterless, interact with each other and Asterless is involved in the centrosomal localization of Centrosomin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conduit et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> centriole duplication is coordinated by SPD-2 (CEP192) recruitment of ZYG-1 (PLK4) which, in turn, localizes SAS-5 (STIL) and SAS-6 to the centrosome, culminating in the recruitment of SAS-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delattre et al., 2006</xref>). Our results indicate that ordered recruitment of MCPH-associated proteins to the centrosome extends beyond CDK5RAP2 and CEP152 to include WDR62 and CEP63. Moreover, the recruitment of centriole duplication proteins to the centrosome occurs in a step-wise fashion, with CDK5RAP2 being required for the recruitment of CEP152, which recruits WDR62, which in turn recruits CEP63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>).</p><p>While our mass spectrometry analysis of CEP152 detected interactions with CDK5RAP2, WDR62 and CEP131, we did not detect some previously reported interactors of CEP152, including CEP192, SAS4, CENTROBIN and PLK4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cizmecioglu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hatch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sonnen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Firat-Karalar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gudi et al., 2014</xref>). Immunoprecipitation of endogenous CEP152 may be less efficient than overexpressed CEP152, or the use of different cell lines or lysis conditions may account for the observed differences. Conversely, our in solution mass spectrometry preparations allowed us to detect an interaction between CEP152 and WDR62. These interaction data helped reveal that WDR62 localizes to the centrosome in a CEP152-dependent manner.</p><p>Interestingly, although CEP63 has been reported to be required for the localization of CEP152 to the centrosome, we detected only a minor decrease in the centrosomal accumulation of CEP152 in <italic>CEP63</italic>-depleted cells 48 hr post-transfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sir et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lukinavicius et al., 2013</xref>). The observed difference in dependence of localization is attributable to the loss of CEP152 protein stability upon knockdown of <italic>CEP63</italic> using the siRNA sequence used by Brown et al. The additional <italic>CEP63</italic> siRNAs used in this study efficiently deplete CEP63 but do not affect CEP152 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), suggesting that CEP152 centrosomal localization does not critically depend on CEP63.</p><p>The MCPH-associated protein CEP63 interacts with CDK2, a kinase which in addition to its well known roles in cell cycle progression, is also involved in centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hinchcliffe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matsumoto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loffler et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with a key role for CEP63 in recruiting CDK2, the other MCPH-associated proteins CDK5RAP2, CEP152 and WDR62 required for CEP63 localization to the centrosome are also required for CDK2 localization to the centrosome and centriole duplication. While the recruitment of CDK2 to the centrosome by MCPH-assoicated proteins can account for how these proteins participate in centriole duplication, our results do not exclude roles for the MCPH proteins in recruiting other effectors of centriole duplication to the centrosome.</p><p>We also found that the centriolar satellite components SPAG5, CEP72, CEP131, MNR, and CEP90 participate in centriole duplication by interacting with and localizing MCPH-associated proteins to the centrosome. Different satellite proteins interact with different MCPH proteins: CEP72 and SPAG5 interact with CDK5RAP2, CEP131 with CEP152, MNR with WDR62, and CEP90 with CEP63. By bringing MCPH-associated proteins to the centrosome, the centriolar satellite proteins are required to localize proteins to the centrosome even when no biochemical interaction was detected. For example, CEP72 and SPAG5 are required for all four MCPH-assocated proteins to localize to the centrosome, but they interact specifically with CDK5RAP2. While it is possible that the satellite proteins assemble the MCPH protein complex in the cytoplasm prior to its delivery to the centrosome, the most parsimonious model to explain these results is that centriolar satellite proteins bring individual interacting MCPH-associated proteins to the centrosome where the MCPH complex is assembled, and that this recruitment and assembly is required for the subsequent localization of other MCPH-associated proteins farther down the hierarchy. To extend our example, by bringing CDK5RAP2 to the centrosome, the centriolar satellite proteins CEP72 and SPAG5 are required for the centrosomal localization of the other three MCPH proteins despite not interacting with them biochemically. Thus, the centriolar satellite proteins form a hierarchy that parallels the MCPH protein hierarchy, with distinct satellite components interacting with and being required for the centrosomal localization of different MCPH-associated proteins.</p><p>Inhibiting centriolar satellite protein function not only prevents the interacting MCPH-associated protein from localizing to the centrosome, but it also prevents that MCPH protein from interacting with the other MCPH-associated proteins, indicating that it is critical for MCPH complex formation. These findings suggest that centriolar satellite proteins may bind their cognate MCPH-associated protein outside of the centrosome and deliver it to the centrosome where it can complex with other MCPH-associated proteins. Previous studies revealed that centriolar satellites transport cargo along microtubules in a dynein-dynactin dependent manner to deliver proteins to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kubo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kodani et al., 2010</xref>). Our finding that MCPH-associated proteins colocalize with the centriolar satellite protein PCM1 upon acute depolymerization of microtubules provides further evidence that the function of centriolar satellites is to transport proteins to the centrosome in a microtubule-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dammermann and Merdes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kodani et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, a critical function of centriolar satellite proteins may be to bring MCPH-associated proteins to the centrosome, thereby accumulating CDK2 and promoting centriole duplication. Recent evidence implicating centriolar satellites in various cellular processes such as cellular stress response, ciliogenesis and protein degradation, reveals that centriolar satellite function extends beyond promoting centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stowe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Villumsen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We identified a homozygous missense variant in the centriolar satellite gene, <italic>CEP90,</italic> in two boys with microcephaly and intellectual disability.

Therefore, we propose that hypomorphic mutations in <italic>CEP90</italic> are a rare cause of human microcephaly, and that defects in the function of centriolar satellites can cause the human disease microcephaly. It will be interesting to determine whether mutations in genes encoding other centriolar satellite components are also causes of microcephaly.</p><p>Depletion of <italic>CEP90</italic> reduces recruitment of CEP63 and CDK2 to the centrosome and abrogates centriole duplication. We hypothesize that microcephaly-associated mutation of <italic>CEP90</italic> causes defective centriole duplication, similar to depletion of CEP90 or of MCPH proteins such as CDK5RAP2, CEP152, WDR62 or CEP63.

It seems likely that centriole duplication is critical for spindle orientation and the regulation of neuronal progenitor number, but why centriole duplication is preferentially required for brain development remains unclear.</p><p>In contrast to the other MCPH protein-interacting satellite components, CCDC14 restrains supernumerary Centrin foci formation by limiting the centrosomal accumulation of its interacting protein CEP63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Firat-Karalar et al., 2014</xref>). We found that CCDC14 is also essential for limiting the centrosomal localization and activity of CDK2. As several satellite proteins are required for MCPH protein localization to the centrosome, but CCDC14 limits the centrosomal localization of CEP63 and CDK2, centriolar satellites may control the trafficking of proteins both to and away from the centrosome.</p><p>In summary, we have found that diverse centriolar satellite proteins control the localization of cognate MCPH-associated proteins to the centriole, where they assemble in a hierarchical step-wise manner, culminating in the recruitment CDK2 to the centrosome and centriole duplication. These findings help elucidate how satellites and ordered assembly coordinately build the complex centrosomal structure and how MCPH-associated proteins participate in the fundamental cell biological process of centriole duplication.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Polyclonal guinea pig antibodies to human CEP131 (aa. 1053–1083) and CCDC14 (aa. 194–211) were developed by Pierce Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL).

Lysates were clarified (13,000 r.p.m., 4°C, 10 min) and the protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). For each immunoprecipitation reaction analyzed by mass spectrometry, 5 mg of total lysate was incubated with 10 μg of antibody for 2 hr and then incubated with protein G-sepharose (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) for an additional 1.5 hr at 4°C. Immunocomplexes were washed three times in lysis buffer, once in detergent free lysis buffer and subsequently incubated with 0.2 M Glycine pH2.5 on ice for 10 min and quenched with 1 M Tris pH9. For smaller scaled immunoprecipitation reactions, 500 µg of total lysate was incubated with 2 µg of antibody for 2 hr and then incubated with protein G-Sepharose for an additional hour at 4°C. Complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and subsequently boiled in 2× Laemmli reducing buffer. To detect WDR62, samples were incubated in 2× Laemmli reducing buffer, but were not boiled. Samples were separated on 4–15% gradient TGX precast gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), transferred onto nitrocellulose (Whattman, Pittsburgh, PA) and then subjected to immunoblot analysis using ECL Lightening Plus (Perkin–Elmer, Waltham, MA). For quantifications, samples were blotted with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies and analyzed on a LiCOR Odyssey scanner. Specific protein signals were normalized to Actin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Centrosome isolation</title><p>Centrosomes from asynchronously growing HeLa cells were isolated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bobinnec et al., 1998</xref>). HeLa cells were treated with 2 μM nocodazole and 1 μg/μl of cytochalasin D for 1 hr to disrupt the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton respectively. Cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer (1 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) and clarified at 2500×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was layered atop a 60% sucrose cushion above a discontinuous sucrose gradient (70, 50 and 40% sucrose) and centrifuged at 40,000×<italic>g</italic> for 1 hr.

Following fixation; cells were incubated in blocking buffer (2.5% BSA, 0.1% Triton-X100, 0.03% NaN<sub>3</sub> in DPBS) overnight at 4°C. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with cells at room temperature for 1 hr. To detect CDK2 using anti-CDK2 (M2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cells were extracted with 0.1% Triton X-100 in a buffer consisting of 50 mM piperazine-1, 4-bis (2-ethanesulphonic acid) at pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 mM EDTA prior to fixation in chilled methanol for 3 min. Alternatively, cells were fixed in ice cold methanol:acetone (1:1) for 7 min to detect CDK2 using anti-CDK2 (22060-1-AP, Proteintech Group, Chicago, IL). Coverslips were mounted using Gelvatol mounting media and imaged with an inverted Axio Observer D1 (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY), image processing was completed with Adobe Photoshop. For fluorescence quantifications, specified sized regions of interest were selected and quantified using Fiji. The signal of the MCPH proteins were normalized to Centrin signal in HeLa or U2OS cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Mass spectrometry analysis</title><p>To analyze proteins by LC-MS/MS, immunocomplexes were digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) overnight at 37°C, denatured in 2 M urea, 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, 2 mM DTT for 30 min at 60°C, and alkylated with 2 mM iodoacetamide for 45 min at room temperature.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This work by Kodani and colleagues from the Reiter lab explored interactions between different microcephaly-associated proteins and between microcephaly-associated proteins and centriolar satellite proteins. The authors seek to make the point that centriolar satellites are crucial for centrosome biogenesis and functionally link satellite proteins to MCPH. The paper is descriptive and functional studies are at the level of dependence of one protein for the localization of another. In spite of the title there is no data showing that satellites bring microcephaly proteins to centrosomes. The paper is difficult to read and will be a challenge for anyone not directly involved in this field. Perhaps a model or diagram would help to graphically illustrate the data.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) The hierarchical centrosome recruitment model has not been established thoroughly:</p><p>A) The authors showed that depletion of centriolar satellite proteins SPAG5, CEP72, CEP131, MNR, and CEP90 disrupted centriole duplication. They claimed that these five centriolar satellite proteins participate in centriole duplication by interacting with different MCPH proteins and delivering them to centrosome. However, they failed to show any insightful mechanisms accounting for the recruitment and function. More specifically, the authors failed to provide direct evidence to support that SPAG5, CEP72, CEP131, MNR, and CEP90 participate in centriole duplication through interaction with MCPH proteins. The binding sites essential for these interactions could be mapped and the binding deficient mutants should be expressed in cells with knockdown background to test whether the interactions are the main reason for the phenotype.</p><p>B) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: since <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows that the four MCPH proteins interact with each other, the IPs of CEP72 and SPAG5 should be probed as well for CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63, to test if these two satellite proteins interact exclusively with CDK5RAP2, as suggested, or also with the other 3 MCPH proteins.</p><p>C) To support their sequential recruitment model, the authors need to demonstrate that CEP152, WDR62, and Cep63 are not co-depleted after Cep72 or SPAG5 RNAi. If they are, this may argue against the recruitment model and it would just be an issue of total protein level. Similar control experiments apply to the IPs and depletions of the other satellite proteins shown in subsequent figures.</p><p>D) It is important to test interaction of the 4 MCPH proteins upon depletion of any of their respective centriolar satellite proteins. This would be required to test whether the recruitment hierarchy occurs at the centrosome, as proposed, or already in the cytoplasm, at the level of a pre-assembled large complex, for example. The authors could repeat the IPs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> in the absence of SPAG5, CEP72, CEP131, MNR, or CEP90, to test whether the interactions between the 4 MCPH are maintained and, if not, which interactions become disrupted.</p><p>2) None of the immunofluorescence data that investigate centrosome localization, and which extends over multiple figures, have been quantified. This is particularly problematic in cases in which the presented data clearly contradicts previously published work. Here it will be crucial to establish that the current data is correct. In addition, quantification of centrosome staining intensities in multiple cells and experiments should be shown after RNAi; this is standard in the field and required to determine how strongly one component depends on another and how variable the phenotype is.</p><p>3) Centriole duplication was scored in cells that were in S-phase. That only S phase cells were scored may actually overestimate the phenotype, which could simply be a delay in duplication rather than a real duplication defect.</p><p>4) The authors discuss acute vs. prolonged depletion to explain the fact that they see a role for CDK5RAP2 in centriole duplication, which was not observed in previous studies. However, depletion of CDK5RAP2 (also known as Cep215) by RNAi has been used in previous studies, but centriole duplication defects were not been described. Rather CDK5RAP2 seems to have a role in regulating centrosome cohesion and centriole engagement. To support their finding, the authors should perform depletion experiments with siRNA and cells used in previous studies to see whether they can reproduce the duplication defect. This could also be used to confirm the dependency of Cep152 on CDK5RAP2. The same applies to Cep63 depletion. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2013</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sir et al., 2011</xref>, CEP63 was shown to be required for CEP152 localization to the centrosomes in different cell types, in conditions of genomic deletion but also RNAi.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>: what is the phenotypical consequence for the cells of expressing the mutant CEP90? Is centriole duplication indeed impaired? I propose that the authors deplete CEP90 and try to rescue the effects of the depletion with the WT CEP90 or with the mutant, analyzing the localization of CEP63 and centriole number.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2013</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sir et al., 2011</xref> showed that CEP63 was required for CEP152 localization to the centrosomes in different cell types, upon RNAi knockdown and genomic deletion. In the current manuscript CEP63 depletion does not seem to affect CEP152. The argument in the discussion that acute vs. prolonged treatment may explain discrepancies with previous work is not valid, since acute depletion was also used in some of the previously published experiments. It is important that the authors rigorously address issues regarding previously published, conflicting data. The authors should test siRNA and cells that were previously tested.</p><p>7) To confirm the general relevance of their study, and perhaps address inconsistencies with other studies (see #6), the authors should demonstrate that at least some key findings are not only valid in HeLa cells but also in other unrelated cell types.</p><p>8) There is human patient data (sequence and phenotype), but it is not clear whether this is IRB approved or exempt.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>, the localization/pattern of CDK5RAP2 is entirely different from the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. The authors need to provide better images or explain the differences.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, in the DMSO panel, CDK5RAP2 appears more focused than on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. This needs to be clarified. In the nocodazole panel, the signal intensity for each of the 4 MCPH proteins appears brighter than in the DMSO panel. Is there indeed more protein co-localizing with PCM1 or is this just due to increased exposure/brightness settings? Here the signal of each protein at the centrioles (centrin marker) versus satellite (PCM1 marker) should be quantified for each condition in a number of cells, to show that there is a de-localization upon nocodazole treatment.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>, there is a reference to a CCDC14 siRNA #3, which doesn't appear before (only #1 and #2). This needs to be clarified. Another issue is that when CCDC14 is depleted, the CEP63 signal is restricted to the centrioles, contrary to what is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>4) The single letter/number abbreviations for protein names used as labels for the IF panels are not very intuitive, since letters/numbers from random positions of the protein names are used, it is difficult to guess what “C”, “2” etc. means.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7–figure supplement 5</xref>: the channel color legend is missing.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the authors use U2OS cells instead of HeLa (which were used in the previous experiments), without any reference to why the change in cell line.</p><p>7) It is a bit confused why CEP135, STIL and SAS4 are not included in this study. Do these MCPH proteins also associate with centriolar satellite partners as proposed in this study?</p><p>8) It is intriguing to propose the pairing hypothesis. However, the criteria for the paring proteins identified through MS are not revealed? For example, why CEP250 and CEP170 are not examined in this study? How to exclude the possibility of that these centriolar satellite proteins affect the hemostasis of centriolar satellite rather than the proposed protein-protein interaction?</p><p>9) It will be more convincing to include another centrosome protein like CP110 in every panel of IP result as a proper negative control.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Centriolar satellites assemble centrosomal microcephaly proteins to recruit CDK2 and promote centriole duplication” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>The reviewers of your revised manuscript are satisfied with the experimental aspects, however, one reviewer requests that you address the following item in your Discussion.</p><p>This reviewer had raised this issue in the first round of review (reviewer #1 point 1D). The concern is with your proposal of the recruitment model by demonstrating that the sequential interactions between CDK5RAP2, CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63 occur at the centrosome rather than in the cytosol. In this reviewer's opinion the provided immunoprecipitations of MCPH proteins from soluble cell extract in the absence of specific satellite proteins support his/her speculation that the centrosomal recruitment of the MCPH proteins occurs in the form of large complexes that are pre-assembled in the cytosol, in a sequential manner and dependent on the respective satellite protein partner, rather than MCPH proteins being delivered by their satellite partner one by one to the centrosome. The reviewer is concerned with your conclusion that sequential assembly occurs at the centrosome?</p><p>The reviewer assumes that the IPs were performed with soluble cell extracts that did not contain centrosomes (because these would end up in the pellet fraction when clearing the extract by high speed centrifugation). Or do you have data indicating the presence of centrosomes in your IPs? If centrosomes are not present during the IPs then the data clearly shows that all 4 MCPH proteins interact in the cytosol, and that the formation of this large complex depends on the sequential recruitment of each MCPH protein by its satellite partner. CDK5RAP2 could be considered the platform onto which all others sequentially and hierarchically assemble. And all of this can occur in the cytosol, in the absence of centrosomes. Obviously this will result in a hierarchical centrosome localization effect, as a result of changes in the pre-assembled cytosolic complexes. Unless you can exclude this possibility, the description and discussion of the recruitment data (and thus the model) needs to be changed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07519.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>This work by Kodani and colleagues from the Reiter lab explored interactions between different microcephaly-associated proteins and between microcephaly-associated proteins and centriolar satellite proteins.

Unfortunately, we have found that low levels of expression of centriolar satellite proteins using minimal amounts of DNA leads to the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates, even in knockdown backgrounds. The aggregates started to form after less than 12 hours of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>), insufficient time for cells to go through a centriole duplication cycle, and caused the mislocalization of PCM1, thus making it difficult to interpret the results. Due to the failure to localize as endogenous proteins do, we are hesitant to make any conclusion from these experiments. We are continuing to troubleshoot the expression levels, and we apologize that we were unable to complete this experiment in the two months allotted for revisions.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07519.039</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07519.039">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07519.039</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07519-resp-fig1-v4.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>B)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>: since</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>shows that the four MCPH proteins interact with each other, the IPs of CEP72 and SPAG5 should be probed as well for CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63, to test if these two satellite proteins interact exclusively with CDK5RAP2, as suggested, or also with the other 3 MCPH proteins.</italic></p><p>To further investigate whether CEP72 and SPAG5 interact exclusively with CDK5RAP2, we examined whether they could co-precipitate CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63, as suggested.

Following depletion of CEP131, MNR or CEP90, immoprecipitation of CEP152, WDR62 or CEP63, respectively, demonstrated that they were no longer able to co-precipitate the other MCPH-associated proteins. For example, CEP152 was unable to bind to CDK5RAP2 or WDR62 in the absence of CEP131. Similarly, WDR62 could not bind CEP152 or CEP63 in MNR-depleted cells and CEP63 failed to bind WDR62 in the absence of CEP90. Together, these data suggest that, in accordance with a possibility raised by the reviewers, the recruitment hierarchy of four MCPH-associated proteins occurs at the centrosome.

This is particularly problematic in cases in which the presented data clearly contradicts previously published work. Here it will be crucial to establish that the current data is correct. In addition, quantification of centrosome staining intensities in multiple cells and experiments should be shown after RNAi; this is standard in the field and required to determine how strongly one component depends on another and how variable the phenotype is.</italic></p><p>As advised, we quantified the fluorescence intensities of the immunostaining of MCPH-associated proteins at centrosomes in cells depleted of MCPH-associated proteins or their cognate centriolar satellite protein.

However, depletion of CDK5RAP2 (also known as Cep215) by RNAi has been used in previous studies, but centriole duplication defects were not been described. Rather CDK5RAP2 seems to have a role in regulating centrosome cohesion and centriole engagement. To support their finding, the authors should perform depletion experiments with siRNA and cells used in previous studies to see whether they can reproduce the duplication defect. This could also be used to confirm the dependency of Cep152 on CDK5RAP2. The same applies to Cep63 depletion.

Unfortunately, even misexpression of wild-type or mutant CEP90 with a weak promoter (EF1alpha) for less than a cell cycle leads to the formation of large cytoplasmic aggregates of CEP90.

Given that the human <italic>CEP90</italic> mutation is not central to the main points of the paper, we are happy to remove these data and publish them in a subsequent work in which the phenotypical consequences can be more fully elucidated if that is the opinion of the reviewers.

In the current manuscript CEP63 depletion does not seem to affect CEP152. The argument in the discussion that acute vs. prolonged treatment may explain discrepancies with previous work is not valid, since acute depletion was also used in some of the previously published experiments. It is important that the authors rigorously address issues regarding previously published, conflicting data. The authors should test siRNA and cells that were previously tested.</italic></p><p>We investigated whether our hierarchy model held true for CEP63 using siRNAs reported by Brown et al. While we would have liked to confirm the experiments from Sir et al., Dhamacon has discontinued the SMARTpool siRNA product referred to in their Nature Genetics paper, and was unable to tell us the siRNA sequences. We found that depletion of CEP63 using the siRNA that they call <italic>CEP63 NB</italic> disrupted centriole duplication, centrosomes failed to accumulate CDK5RAP2, CEP152, and WDR62, in accordance with what they reported and in contrast to our findings using other ways of depleting CEP63. Examining protein levels revealed that the <italic>CEP63 NB</italic> siRNA depleted endogenous CEP63 protein levels and also led to the co-depletion of CDK5RAP2, CEP152, and WDR62, again in contrast to our findings using other ways of depleting CEP63. The independent siRNAs <italic>CEP63 #1</italic> and <italic>#2</italic> deplete endogenous CEP63 to an equivalent degree but do not cause the co-depletion of these other proteins<italic>.</italic> Throughout this work, we have been careful to report only phenotypes that are caused by siRNAs that both efficiently deplete the target protein, and show phenotypes that are caused by multiple independent siRNAs. While our model would predict that destabilization of CDK5RAP2, as occurs upon knockdown with <italic>CEP63 NB</italic>, will cause a failure to recruit CEP152 to the centrosome, we are hesitant to make this conclusion as it is only observed with the use of this siRNA. These data are included as a Figure 1–figure supplement 8 and described the results in the subsection “MCPH-associated proteins interact and hierarchically localize to the centrosome”.</p><p><italic>7) To confirm the general relevance of their study, and perhaps address inconsistencies with other studies (see #6), the authors should demonstrate that at least some key findings are not only valid in HeLa cells but also in other unrelated cell types.</italic></p><p>As suggested, we tested key findings using an unrelated cell type. We confirmed that CDK5RAP2, CEP72 and SPAG5 are required for centriole duplication in U2OS cells. We also confirmed that the protein stability of CDK5RAP2 depends CEP72 and SPAG5 in U2OS cells. We were also able to confirm that the centrosomal localization of CDK5RAP2 depends on CEP72 and SPAG5 where it serves as a scaffold to recruit CEP152, WDR62, and CEP63. We have included these new data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref> and included this in the subsection “Centriolar satellite proteins CEP72 and SPAG5 are required for MCPH-associated protein CDK5RAP2 to localize to the centrosome”.</p><p><italic>8) There is human patient data (sequence and phenotype), but it is not clear whether this is IRB approved or exempt.</italic></p><p>The human patient data is IRB approved and this approval is described in the Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>Other points:</italic></p><p><italic>1) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 3</italic></xref><italic>, the localization/pattern of CDK5RAP2 is entirely different from the one shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref><italic>. The authors need to provide better images or explain the differences.</italic></p><p>The appearance of CDK5RAP2 localization does differ using diffraction limited microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) versus structured illumination microscopy (SIM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>). The difference is attributable to the properties of SIM. The low contrast staining of CDK5RAP2 outside of the toroidal structure at the center of the centrosome creates a situation for SIM very similar to the in-focus image surrounded by out-of-focus light. In the resulting point spread function, the data from the neighboring fluorophores outnumbers the data from the central fluorophore and the SIM algorithm’s high-pass filters cannot assign the data from these fluorophores in reciprocal space to coordinates based on where the light originated from. Thus, low contrast images are not distinguishable from noise even with the use of different Wiener filter values in SIM. This is a known limitation of the use of SIM with low contrast samples. SIM is more appropriate use with high contrast, structured images. Thus, we have limited our use of SIM to imaging the region of CDK5RAP2 at the toroidal structure which, unlike the surrounding CDK5RAP2 domain, is both high contrast and highly structured.

We were careful to image the DMSO and nocodazole-treated samples at the same exposure settings and process all images in parallel and in the same way.

To further assess the accumulation of CEP63 to Centrin positive foci in <italic>CCDC14</italic>-depleted cells, we quantified the fluorescence intensity of CEP63 and the other three MCPH-associated proteins and found that only CEP63 co-localized with the majority of the Centrin positive foci.

We made note of this rationale in subsection “Centriolar satellite component CCDC14 restrains the centrosomal accumulation of CEP63 and CDK2”.</p><p><italic>7) It is a bit confused why CEP135, STIL and SAS4 are not included in this study. Do these MCPH proteins also associate with centriolar satellite partners as proposed in this study?</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that CEP135, STIL and SAS4 would have been nice to include in this study. However, because we do not have reagents of sufficient quality to fully assess whether CEP135, STIL and SAS4 associate with still other centriolar satellite proteins, we will need to work on developing better tools. It is possible that CEP135, STIL and SAS4 bind cognate centriolar satellite proteins similar to CDK5RAP2, CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63, but for this work, we focused on the four MCPH-associated proteins that we were confident biochemically interacted with each other, and the six satellite proteins that we were confident interacted with them.</p><p><italic>8) It is intriguing to propose the pairing hypothesis. However, the criteria for the paring proteins identified through MS are not revealed? For example, why CEP250 and CEP170 are not examined in this study? How to exclude the possibility of that these centriolar satellite proteins affect the hemostasis of centriolar satellite rather than the proposed protein-protein interaction?</italic></p><p>The criteria for our focusing on the proteins we identified were twofold: we focused on proteins that both localized to the centrosome and which were previously implicated in centriole duplication. While both CEP250 and CEP170 localize to the centrosome, neither was strongly required for centriole duplication in our hands. Whereas CEP250 and CEP170 have roles in centriole cohesion and subdistal appendage organization, respectively, we were not able to discern any roles for them in MCPH-associated protein function, and thus were not included in this study. Inhibition of the function of centriolar satellite proteins may well be affecting aspects of centrosomal biology beyond the interaction with MCPH-associated proteins, including homeostasis of the centriolar satellites. However, we have focused on the aspects of centrosomal function for which we have positive evidence, and will continue to assess whether these centriolar satellite proteins participate in other aspects of centrosomal function in the future. A more complete description of these possibilities is now included in the Discusssion.</p><p><italic>9) It will be more convincing to include another centrosome protein like CP110 in every panel of IP result as a proper negative control.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting these sets of experiments.

The concern is with your proposal of the recruitment model by demonstrating that the sequential interactions between CDK5RAP2, CEP152, WDR62 and CEP63 occur at the centrosome rather than in the cytosol. In this reviewer's opinion the provided immunoprecipitations of MCPH proteins from soluble cell extract in the absence of specific satellite proteins support his/her speculation that the centrosomal recruitment of the MCPH proteins occurs in the form of large complexes that are pre-assembled in the cytosol, in a sequential manner and dependent on the respective satellite protein partner, rather than MCPH proteins being delivered by their satellite partner one by one to the centrosome. The reviewer is concerned with your conclusion that sequential assembly occurs at the centrosome?</italic></p><p><italic>The reviewer assumes that the IPs were performed with soluble cell extracts that did not contain centrosomes (because these would end up in the pellet fraction when clearing the extract by high speed centrifugation). Or do you have data indicating the presence of centrosomes in your IPs? If centrosomes are not present during the IPs then the data clearly shows that all 4 MCPH proteins interact in the cytosol, and that the formation of this large complex depends on the sequential recruitment of each MCPH protein by its satellite partner. CDK5RAP2 could be considered the platform onto which all others sequentially and hierarchically assemble. And all of this can occur in the cytosol, in the absence of centrosomes. Obviously this will result in a hierarchical centrosome localization effect, as a result of changes in the pre-assembled cytosolic complexes. Unless you can exclude this possibility, the description and discussion of the recruitment data (and thus the model) needs to be changed.</italic></p><p>Our data show that each MCPH protein cannot interact with other MCPH proteins in the absence of its cognate centriolar satellite interactor, and that there is a sequential MCPH protein recruitment to the centrosome.</p><p>Our immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with soluble cell extracts that likely contain the majority of centrosomal proteins aside from the salt-insoluble centriole core (Schnackenberg 1999, Flory 2000, Schnackenberg 1998). As most non-centriolar components are extracted off of the centrosome by the combination of salt and detergent that we use, we surmise that the MCPH components are part of the soluble cell extract used in our IPs. Thus, while centrosomes are not present in our lysates, many centrosomal proteins are.</p><p>We concur with the reviewer that, based on the available information, it is not possible to discriminate between formation of the MCPH protein complex at the centrosome and pre-assembly into a complex in the cytoplasm prior to being delivered to the centrosome. We agree that it is possible that the failure to assemble the MCPH complex in the cytoplasm could result in the failed hierarchical assembly at the centrosome. Because we cannot definitively distinguish between assembly of the MCPH complex in the cytoplasm and at the centrosome, we have refined the Discussion and the legend for the final model figure to specifically discuss both possibilities.</p></body></sub-article></article>
