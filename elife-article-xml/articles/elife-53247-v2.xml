the state and fate of stem and progenitor cells. Recent advances in metabolomics illustrate that various metabolic pathways are also important in regulating stem cell fate. However, our understanding of the metabolic control of the state and fate of progenitor cells is in its infancy. Using <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoietic organ: lymph gland, we demonstrate that Fatty Acid Oxidation (FAO) is essential for the differentiation of blood cell progenitors. In the absence of FAO, the progenitors are unable to differentiate and exhibit altered histone acetylation. Interestingly, acetate supplementation rescues both histone acetylation and the differentiation defects. We further show that the CPT1/whd (<italic>withered</italic>), the rate-limiting enzyme of FAO, is transcriptionally regulated by Jun-Kinase (JNK), which has been previously implicated in progenitor differentiation. Our study thus reveals how the cellular signaling machinery integrates with the metabolic cue to facilitate the differentiation program.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Stem cells are special precursor cells, found in all animals from flies to humans, that can give rise to all the mature cell types in the body. Their job is to generate supplies of new cells wherever these are needed. This is important because it allows damaged or worn-out tissues to be repaired and replaced by fresh, healthy cells.</p><p>As part of this renewal process, stem cells generate pools of more specialized cells, called progenitor cells. These can be thought of as half-way to maturation and can only develop in a more restricted number of ways. For example, so-called myeloid progenitor cells from humans can only develop into a specific group of blood cell types, collectively termed the myeloid lineage.</p><p>Fruit flies, like many other animals, also have several different types of blood cells. The fly’s repertoire of blood cells is very similar to the human myeloid lineage, and these cells also develop from the fly equivalent of myeloid progenitor cells. These progenitors are found in a specialized organ in fruit fly larvae called the lymph gland, where the blood forms. These similarities between fruit flies and humans mean that flies are a good model to study how myeloid progenitor cells mature.</p><p>A lot is already known about the molecules that signal to progenitor cells how and when to mature. However, the role of metabolism – the chemical reactions that process nutrients and provide energy inside cells – is still poorly understood. Tiwari et al. set out to identify which metabolic reactions myeloid progenitor cells require and how these reactions might shape the progenitors’ development into mature blood cells.</p><p>The experiments in this study used fruit fly larvae that had been genetically altered so that they could no longer perform key chemical reactions needed for the breakdown of fats. In these mutant larvae, the progenitors within the lymph gland could not give rise to mature blood cells. This showed that myeloid progenitor cells need to be able to break down fats in order to develop properly.</p><p>These results highlight a previously unappreciated role for metabolism in controlling the development of progenitor cells. If this effect also occurs in humans, this knowledge could one day help medical researchers engineer replacement tissues in the lab, or even increase our own bodies’ ability to regenerate blood, and potentially other organs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>beta -oxidation</kwd><kwd>hemocyte progenitor</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>lymph gland</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009053</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA/S/17/1/503100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mandal</surname><given-names>Lolitika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001332</institution-id><institution>CSIR</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tiwari</surname><given-names>Satish Kumar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011652</institution-id><institution>Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mandal</surname><given-names>Lolitika</given-names></name><name><surname>Mandal</surname><given-names>Sudip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and molecular analyses reveal the decisive role of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) acting downstream to the ROS-JNK circuit essential for hemocyte progenitor differentiation in <italic>Drosophila.</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent studies have highlighted how metabolism regulates the state and fate of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito and Suda, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shyh-Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shyh-Chang and Ng, 2017</xref>). Besides catering to the bioenergetic demands of a cell, metabolic intermediates can also alter the fate of stem cells via epigenetic mechanisms like histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atlasi and Stunnenberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saraiva et al., 2010</xref>). Studies on diverse stem cell scenarios, primarily in Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs), have established that at various developmental stages, stem cells have different metabolic requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kohli and Passegué, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Suda et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, the metabolic demand of progenitors, the immediate descendants of stem cells, is yet to be fully elucidated.</p><p>Studies to date have evidenced that glucose metabolism impacts the onset and magnitude of HSC induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shyh-Chang and Ng, 2017</xref>), as well as HSC specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Oburoglu et al., 2014</xref>). Another major metabolic state that is active in stem and progenitor cells is fatty acid oxidation (FAO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knobloch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito et al., 2012</xref>). Enzymatic activities of the members of FAO lead to the shortening of fatty acids and the production of acetyl-CoA in mitochondria. The acetyl-CoA thus produced can not only generate NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> through TCA cycle but also can be utilized in acetylation of various proteins including histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Houten and Wanders, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McDonnell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wong et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The primary goal of this study was to ascertain whether FAO regulates any aspect of the hemocyte progenitors in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval hematopoietic organ, lymph gland. The lymph gland is a multilobed structure consisting of a well-characterized anterior lobe (primary lobe) and uncharacterized posterior lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>).

This construct allows the visualization of G1, G2, and M-phase cells by GFP expression. The second probe is a fusion of Red Fluorescent Protein (mRFP.nls) and CycB moiety.

Given the fact that JNK signaling regulates FAO, which in turn provides the acetyl moiety for histone acetylation, our study provides a new dimension in JNK’s role for histone acetylation in an FAO dependent manner. As a result, despite having high ROS levels, the hemocytes fail to differentiate if FAO is attenuated. Thus, the current work provides a metabolic link between JNK and epigenetic regulation of gene expression.</p><p>Our results show that upon disruption of FAO, hematopoietic progenitors adopt glycolysis to overcome the G2-M arrest but fail to initiate differentiation. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of glycolysis in the FAO mutant restores their cell cycle defect but fails to facilitate their differentiation. The glycolytic surge in FAO mutants is not capable to take them through the differentiation process. This indicates that for the process of differentiation, the acetyl moiety derived from FAO plays a key role to facilitate hemocyte progenitor differentiation.</p><p>A recent study has demonstrated that alteration in acetyl-CoA levels can affect proteome and cellular metabolism by modulating intracellular crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dieterich et al., 2019</xref>). It is intriguing to see that restoring acetylation level by the acetate supplementation is capable of rescuing hematopoietic defects in the lymph gland progenitors of FAO mutants. The acetate supplemented is converted into the end product of FAO: acetyl-CoA, the metabolite that is essential for histone acetylation. The involvement of acetyl-CoA in facilitating differentiation is further evidenced when on genetically downregulating AcCoAs (the major enzyme in acetyl-CoA generation) from the progenitor leads to a halt in their differentiation. Our study thus establishes that for hemocyte progenitor differentiation, the metabolic process FAO involves its metabolite acetyl-CoA for epigenetic modification. Earlier studies in diverse model systems have demonstrated that compromised in vivo histone acetylation defects can be rescued by acetate supplementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soliman et al., 2012</xref>). A similar finding in <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis signifies the relevance of acetate supplementation across taxa. In light of this study, it would be interesting to see whether metabolite supplementation of FAO can modulate pathophysiological scenarios like certain forms of cancer which rely on fat oxidation.</p><p>FAO has been implicated in HSCs maintenance downstream of the PML-Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito et al., 2012</xref>). Mechanistically, the PML-PPARδ-FAO pathway regulates HSC maintenance by controling asymmetric division. In FAO inhibition, HCSs undergo symmetric divisions, which lead to exhaustion and depletion of the stem cell pool resulting in their differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito et al., 2012</xref>). Another study in mice shows that upon short term starvation, there is a decline in the number of HSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Takakuwa et al., 2019</xref>). Since the HSC maintenance is FAO dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito et al., 2012</xref>), a loss in number might be attributed to heightened fat oxidation during starvation.

manuscript, Mandal and colleagues explore the function of FAO (fatty acid oxidation) in differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval hematopoietic organ, lymph gland (LG). They show that supplementation with acetate rescues the phenotype associated with defective FAO, and that FAO is downstream of JNK, a known regulator of differentiation, providing insights into how metabolic pathway may be intertwined with differentiation pathway.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Fatty acid β-oxidation regulates hemocyte progenitor homeostasis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval lymph gland&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yukiko M Yamashita (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Should they be able to address all substantive comments and choose to consider <italic>eLife</italic>, a fresh submission can be examined, without any guarantees.</p><p>Our consultation made every effort to understand the important assertions made and whether they were borne by the data presented. While the reviewers started with different perspectives, we have converged to a common position. We suggest that the authors go through our preamble, which captures this converged view, and also the specific concerns of each reviewer. While some of our major concerns can be addressed by substantive re-writing, cutting down generalisations and over-interpretation others require experimental attention.</p><p>One important issue, which was reiterated in our consultations, is exemplified by the following statement and related data &quot;We show that the self-renewing hemocyte progenitors prefer glycolysis while the quiescent progenitors adopt Fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) for their differentiation. Perturbation of β-oxidation in progenitors results in loss of quiescence….&quot; Though the authors' primary question is centered on distinguishing metabolic states within progenitors, the authors do not identify these. Generic results are interpreted as applying to specific populations and extended to homeostasis.</p><p>Staging larvae and using appropriate established Gal4 drivers is, of course, acceptable, but the authors have not done this properly. Unlike, for example, the wing and eye discs, the larval LG do not have a uniform, reproducible structure or pattern. One cannot delineate zones morphologically or by using a single marker. Progenitor sub-populations (dome negative pre-progenitors, dome<sup>+</sup> progenitors and dome<sup>+</sup>Pxn<sup>+</sup>hml<sup>+</sup> intermediate progenitors) (reviewed in Banerjee et al., Flybook2019) and the three types of differentiated cells (plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes) are functionally and metabolically different. However, the authors do not distinguish between these populations in their analysis. For example, mitochondrial analysis is shown at low resolution and in an undefined population (Figure 1L, M) and hml&gt;GFP is used only as a marker of differentiation (Figure 4).</p><p>The assertion of the manuscript is that they are distinguishing between progenitor types, which they call self-renewing and quiescent. This can be done only upon identifying and characterising subpopulations. Further, since they incorrectly use the presence or absence of proliferation marks as a readout for self-renewal and quiescence, it is not clear how the claim that these are two metabolically distinct precursor states is valid. Rather, based on the analysis done (EdU, Figure 1B,C) they are simply proliferating or non-proliferating cells (which may or may not be progenitors), the latter poised for, or in the process of differentiation. Expectedly, their metabolic states differ- and the authors show that these are glycolysis for the former and FAO for the latter. Figure 1B,C: TepIV and EdU labelling – it looks as if there are co-labeled cells, but these are ignored. Also TepIVGAL4 reporter does not label the entire progenitor pool. The existence of self-renewing or quiescent progenitors has not been formally demonstrated in the LG- if the authors had demonstrated their existence, this would have been very interesting indeed.</p><p>The metabolic fluctuations we are concerned about are intra-LG. This is a major challenge in characterizing metabolic states of heterogeneous progenitors. Since all analysis is done only with one progenitor marker at a time (mainly dome) which is also expressed in early stages of differentiation, or with no marker at all, (Example Figure 1 ; Figure 1—figure supplement 1, compare panels A and C) claims regarding metabolic differences are not substantiated. As is also evident from the images in Figure 1, the same tissue from the same genotype and stage varies greatly in terms of size, shape and organisation, hence rigorous quantitation with additional markers is essential.</p><p>The authors seem confused about what the focus of their study is. They state in the Abstract that the major outcome of the study is coupling FAO with epigenetic modifications linking to regulation of differentiation by JNK- while this part of the study has merit, it is not very relevant to the primary question they pose about blood cell progenitor homeostasis.</p><p>The reviews give a very detailed analysis, including comments for almost every panel of Figure 1. However, some examples are expanded on a couple of specific cases below.</p><p>Figure 1D, E states that self-renewing early stage progenitors exhibit elevated levels of glucose uptake compared to late-stage quiescent progenitors. In D there is no marker for progenitors or differentiated cells- clearly there are varying intensities of signal. How can one assume that all 2-NBDG cells are progenitors, early or late? Further, given variation between preps, how does one compare levels between second and third instar without having a control to normalise it or assess relative levels between progenitors and differentiated cells? Assuming second and third instar preps were stained and imaged in the same experiment, how much variation is seen? A graph representing this is essential as the lymph gland morphology can vary greatly depending on the status of the larval cultures. Additionally, a proliferation assay is required along with the uptake or demarcation of the MZ/CZ boundaries to show reduced uptake in the pro-hemocyte pool of the 3rd instar lymph gland.</p><p>Figure 1F, G – To say that there is high Glut-1 GFP in proliferating progenitors of the second instar, labelling with a proliferation marker, progenitor marker, and differentiation marker is required along with quantitation to show that High Glut 1-GFP is expressed in proliferating progenitors.</p><p>Figure 3E-G, the authors claim a higher number of EdU incorporation is seen in the progenitors, however, the images provided show higher EdU signal at the periphery; also CZ/MZ boundary is not demarcated, and progenitor markers are not used.</p><p>If the results about FAO and its downstream effects in the LG are de-linked from progenitor sub-types and homeostasis, this would be more acceptable. Currently, two parts of the manuscript (progenitor types and metabolic status connecting to signaling) are not well connected. The authors may want to consider that they are perhaps best dealt separately and not in the same manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study by Mandal and colleagues studied the role of metabolic circuitry in stem cell maintenance/differentiation. General impacts of metabolism on cell fates, particularly those between stem cells and their progenies, have increasingly drawn researchers' attention in recent years. By using <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoietic progenitors (in lymph gland), the authors explored the role of metabolic circuitry in this lineage. The main conclusion is that actively proliferating stem cells utilize glycolytic pathway whereas quiescent stem cells favor fatty acid β-oxidation, which promotes differentiation.</p><p>Furthermore, they propose that FAO generates acetyl-CoA, which not only generates energy through TCA cycle, but can contribute to protein (e.g. histone) acetylation. Perturbation of FAO leads to defects in quiescence (progenitor starts proliferating and cannot differentiate). Upregulation of FAO leads to stem cell quiescence and precocious differentiation. The authors link this observation to histone acetylation and thus epigenetic regulation.</p><p>Figure 1: Does blocking glycolysis have any impact on differentiation? Does it only affect progenitor proliferation without impacting later differentiation?</p><p>Figure 2: blocking FAO by means of whd knockdown resulted in increased progenitors and decreased differentiating cells. Further in Figure 3, they show that loss of FAO also increases progenitor proliferation and thus progenitors are not entering quiescence. Collectively these results indicate that FAO is required for progenitors to enter quiescence, and thus their “differentiation defect” is secondary to their inability to enter quiescence. These results are quite clear, but when I was reading the description for Figure 2, I was misled to think that FAO blocks differentiation. Any ways to make this transition (Figure 2 to Figure 3) a bit less misleading?</p><p>In Figure 4, they show that upregulation of FAO is sufficient to induce quiescence and subsequent differentiation in progenitors.</p><p>Figure 5 demonstrate the inter-relationship between glycolysis and FAO. Defective FAO led to sustained glycolysis.</p><p>Figure 6-7 slightly shift in the focus and now addresses FAO's function in histone acetylation. The authors now suggest that it is the key to differentiation.</p><p>Figure 8 talks about JNK pathway in progenitor differentiation.</p><p>Although the authors' claims are well supported in general, Figures 6-8 make me wonder whether FAO contributes to progenitor cell differentiation through metabolic aspects at all. Although each piece of discoveries in this paper is important, I don't know if the authors can claim that FAO regulates progenitor differentiation through BOTH metabolic regulation and histone acetylation. Especially because Figure 7 shows that acetate supplementation is enough to rescue whd mutant phenotype, one has to wonder whether “metabolic” aspect ever contributes to self-renewal/differentiation choices. And if this is all about histone acetylation, what is the importance of glycolysis in self-renewing progenitors? Of course, it is an intriguing possibility that this is nature's elegant solution, natural shifts in metabolism also triggers epigenetic programming. I am not asking to do experiments to tell apart the possibilities, but the fact that their data do not necessarily show the requirement of FAO regulating metabolism per se in regulating differentiation, and the possibilities have to be carefully discussed.</p><p>I understand it might be technically difficult, but can they tell that histones are less acetylated in self-renewing progenitors compared to quiescent progenitors?</p><p>I think that Figure 8 is unnecessary. This does not add to the major message of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Tiwari et al. present data that they claim suggests a potential role for FAO in metabolic regulation of progenitors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval lymph gland. They interpret their data to say that self-renewing and quiescent progenitors in the LG differ in their metabolic state. The latter exhibit FAO which results in acetylCoA production and thereby increase in histone acetylation and altered gene expression. Pharmacological increase in acetylation has the same effect whereas reduced histone acetylation maintains progenitor self-renewal. They state that the major outcome of the study is coupling FAO with epigenetic modifications linking to regulation of differentiation by JNK.</p><p>The metabolic state of blood cell progenitors has been studied extensively in vertebrates and to a limited extent in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This study further characterizes progenitor sub-populations for their metabolic status. However, a major shortcoming of the manuscript is the misinterpretation of literature on which their hypothesis and analyses are based. As a result, the fundamental question being addressed about self-renewal and quiescence in LG progenitors is flawed. Further, there are systemic problems with the methods used to analyze, present and quantify data in this manuscript that make it impossible for me to judge the validity of their conclusions. Controls are rarely presented and cell sub-populations are not identified or marked. It is standard practice to include a control for all gene expression especially when reported for the first time and also to identify and distinguish between cell sub-populations when differences in their properties are claimed. Furthermore, the data in this paper are difficult to interpret and I am confused by how the authors came to their conclusions.</p><p>There is a general lack of quantification that would be required to make the interpretations presented.</p><p>Hence the first part (Figure 1) that emphasizes self-renewal and quiescence distracts from the main findings and the data are unclear and analyses questionable. Since the role of JNK in LG differentiation and its connection to metabolism are already established, the results presented here are only incremental to our understanding of LG progenitor maintenance. Further, a lot of the experiments related to this section will have to be repeated with appropriate markers and controls and quantitated rigorously to be convincing. Hence I think the present manuscript is not suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>A detailed review is provided below:</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The authors seem to be unaware that of the different hematopoietic populations in vertebrates and how they compare with that of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. A major problem is the idea that there are self-renewing and quiescent progenitors in the larval LG. It is important to keep in mind that the LG is a powerful but limited model of vertebrate hematopoiesis. Hence a one-on-one correlation between cell types, states and metabolic status should not be made. The Abstract should be corrected to avoid the use of terms such as self-renewal and quiescence. The authors start the Introduction with the aim of testing the relation between metabolic intermediates and histone modifications but deviate to self-renewal and quiescence.</p><p>Introduction section</p><p>Studies on various stem cell scenarios primarily in Hematopoietic Stem Cells(HSCs) have established that various states adopted by stem cells like, quiescence, proliferation, and differentiation are liable to different metabolic requirements…</p><p>This suggests that a stem cell can occur in multiple states and is dynamically switching between them. However, this is not the case. Note that the references cited are for multiple sub-populations of vertebrate HSC. There has been no formal demonstration of stem cells in the LG nor of self-renewal. However, the authors interpret all their data in the context of self-renewal and quiescence and hence this is incorrect and misleading. Further, the experimental evidence does not support the conclusions (see below).</p><p>Introduction paragraph two</p><p>The blood progenitors found in <italic>Drosophila</italic> late larval lymph gland are akin to the vertebrate common myeloid progenitors (CMP)(Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009). They are quiescent, have high levels of ROS (Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009), lack differentiation markers, and can give rise to all <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood lineages.</p><p>This again is a misinterpretation. Firstly, CMPs are not quiescent, only long-term repopulating HSCs are proven to be quiescent. LG progenitor quiescence has not been conclusively demonstrated either. The authors interpret lack of proliferation as quiescence, these are two very different cellular states and associated with different gene expression profiles as well as cell phenotype. Finally, unlike in vertebrate studies, the ability of a LG progenitor to give rise to &quot;all <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood lineages&quot; has not been demonstrated.</p><p>Introduction paragraph three:</p><p>This should be edited to indicate that not all transcription factors are conserved between the two systems.</p><p>The authors equate proliferation with self-renewal- these are two different processes that share gene networks. EDU labelling indicates proliferation not self-renewal. Self-renewal is a very special property of stem cells that can also differentiate. Similarly, absence of EDU label indicates the cells are not proliferating or are cycling slowly- quiescence requires existence in the G0 phase, which has not been demonstrated in the LG.</p><p>Introduction paragraph four:</p><p>Dynamic states of self-renewal, quiescence and differentiation.</p><p>Note that a single cell does not switch between these phenotypic states. Differentiation is normally a one-way street down the lineage through each state, and necessitates metabolic shifts.</p><p>The data do not provide evidence that the progenitors primed to differentiate rely on FAO, this is merely correlative.</p><p>General comments on results:</p><p>Pharmacological treatments: This is another major point that the rest of the paper relies on, yet the authors again show no controls and inadequate quantification. While the entire paper rests on analysis of a few hundred cells in the LG, the Western blot analysis is done with the whole larva and results are interpreted in the context of the LG.</p><p>The authors claim that there are metabolic differences between progenitor sub-populations that correlate with potential to differentiate. However pharmacological treatments such as acetate feeding is done at the level of the whole animal. How much of acetate is sensed by the progenitors in question? how does a general increase in acetylation affect histone in various tissues including the LG? As systemic signals are key to maintaining blood progenitor homeostasis, the effects seen could be due to cell extrinsic factors. The conclusion that this treatment proves the role of FAO and histone acetylation in progenitor quiescence is far-fetched. Further there is no evidence of that glycolytic and FAO metabolizing sub-population are differentially affected.</p><p>It is similarly unclear in which progenitor sub-populations whd and JNK signaling are affected. Quantification is required for differentiation checked by P1 and progenitor status should be checked by dome; also differentiation to crystal cells and lamellocytes should be examined. This is the first report of metabolic requirement for progenitor maintenance; a thorough analysis of various differentiation markers is essential.</p><p>Figure wise comments</p><p>Figure 1 is fraught with misinterpretations. (Results paragraph one and two). Further there is no quantitation whatsoever and a lack of controls. Two different developmental stages are compared and cell identity is arbitrarily assigned. No markers are used for self-renewing or quiescent cells and it is not clear how the authors identify these. Edu positive cells are only a subset of the second instar LG (these could be differentiating) and seen only in the CZ of the third instar.</p><p>Figure 1D, E states that self-renewing early stage progenitors exhibit elevated levels of glucose uptake compared to late stage quiescent progenitors. In this case a proliferation assay is required along with markers to demarcate the MZ/CZ boundaries to show that the uptake is less in the prohemocyte pool of the 3rd instar lymph gland. It is likely that the 2NBDG labeled cells could be late progenitors in the second instar that persist in CZ. Without appropriate markers this cannot be distinguished. Further third instar progenitors may be slower proliferating or arrested in the cell cycle- this is not quiescence. A cell cycle analysis needs to be done through L2 and L3 to resolve the two states, so called self-renewal and differentiation.</p><p>What the authors call quiescence is likely a non-proliferative state that precedes differentiation, which is well documented in many developmental contexts. Similarly, as mentioned in Results paragraph two, glycolysis is seen in rapidly proliferating cells, such as cancer cells. This is not necessarily self-renewal.</p><p>GlutGFP expression is patchy (Figure 1F, G) and not clear whether it is in or around the cells, this looks more like background. A no primary antibody control and a Glut RNAi control are required. MZ should be marked by dome or DEcad and perform EdU labeling in order to show that High Glut 1-GFP is expressed in proliferating progenitors. Similarly, aldolase expression (supplement 1A, B) is not convincing and is seen only in the periphery of the second instar.</p><p>Figure 1 H, I imaging plane is unclear. It is not clear what the authors are trying to show. Imaging parameters are not uniform.</p><p>Figure 1 K: Which area of the LG is shown? Nuclear staining should be included.</p><p>Figure 1 L-O', it is impossible to comment on the status of mitochondrial network with this analysis. Which part of the LG is shown? High resolution images with live tracking and video microscopy are required to analyze mitochondrial morphology, length and dynamics. Without detailed information regarding these parameters in L2 and L3 progenitors and in differentiated CZ cells, one cannot make any comparisons as there is a large variation in mitochondrial size and morphology within any population. This needs co-analysis with progenitor and differentiation markers and thorough quantitation- CZ/ MZ mitochondrial pattern needs to be mapped first.</p><p>There is no data to show mitobiogenesis.</p><p>Figure 1Q, R: the accumulation/increase of Lsd-2 in the 3rd instar lymph gland would be clear if 2nd instar images are presented for Nile Red.</p><p>Figure 1 requires quantification and insets indicating region of interest; double labeling with progenitor marker and or CZ markers or EdU labeling is essential.</p><p>Figure 2: Dapi staining or demarcation of LG boundary as well as MZ/CZ marker staining should be shown.

They first combine fluorescent glucose uptake analysis, expression of metabolic enzymes and glucose transporters and exposure to a glucose antagonist to present evidence that early but not late lymph glands make use of glucose to grow. They next combine genetic analysis and pharmacological treatments to present functional evidence that a metabolic switch to FAO is required in late lymph gland cells to differentiate. FAO requirement does correlate with a change in the protein levels of Ci but appears to act downstream of the differentiation signal ROS. Genetic or pharmacological premature induction of FAO in early lymph glands is sufficient to drive progenitor cells into differentiation and the use of glucose is an absolute requirement for progenitor cells to keep proliferating in the absence of FAO. At the end of the manuscript, experimental data indicate that FAO is required in differentiated cells for histone acetylation downstream of ROS-induced JNK signaling.</p><p>The paper is well written (even though grammar should be improved), figures self-explanatory and the main message (from a metabolic to a developmental switch) and experimental setting (combination of genetics and pharmacology) is timely and appropriate for a journal like <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Fatty acid β-oxidation is required for the differentiation of larval hematopoietic progenitors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Authors combine a great variety of tools (drugs, reporters, inhibitors) together with powerful genetics (RNAi, CRISPR, mutants) to draw a line from JNK to Whd expression, from Whd to FAO, and from FAO to histone acetylation through the production of acetlyCoA. The present manuscript is a revised version of a previous one submitted to <italic>eLife</italic> and has improved in many aspects (experimental setting is very elegant, the combination of genetics and drugs/reporters is extraordinary and the epistatic analysis to demonstrate their claims is very robust). Others (writing, figure presentation, cartoons, etc) should be seriously improved in order to attract the attention of the general reader. While we strongly support publication of this manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic>, the following issues should be thoroughly addressed. Otherwise, even though the science is excellent, the quality of the manuscript will not be deserving to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While the data are generally of good quality, there are significant gaps that need to be filled. The results must be seen in the context of what we already know – the link between JNK and FAO is known, as is the role of acetyl CoA in epigenetic modification. Tiwari et al. show that this also occurs in and is essential for blood progenitor differentiation. However, the same has been shown in vertebrate HSC. The authors conflate two very different cell types and approaches. Vertebrate HSCs have been extensively characterized and their quiescence, multipotency and repopulating ability has been demonstrated unambiguously. The same is not true for <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis – unfortunately several studies try to force cellular parallels between the two. This is not required and <italic>Drosophila</italic> is an excellent hematopoietic model even though it does not have HSC.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Authors should talk to non-<italic>Drosophila</italic> colleagues to help them in thoroughly revising the following aspects of the manuscript:</p><p>1) Abstract is not well written and should be improved, specially the last two sentences. It does not summarize the major aspects of the work and will not attract the attention of any reader that has not a special interest in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> LG.</p><p>2) Cartoon depicted in Figure 1A and explanation in the Introduction do not have anything to do with each other (CZ only explained in the text and others only in the figure) in the figure and does not clarify anything.

References to the JNK/ROS axis are lacking. Jnk itself is not introduced. Again, this part of the manuscript is intended to attract the non-expert community</p><p>4) First part of the results: the why of using two developmental stages and different markers (pvf2, Dome, Hml, etc) is not clearly explained anywhere.

Is dietary lipid content a regulator of this as has been shown in vertebrates for regulation by FAO?</p><p>Mere carnitine supplementation is not sufficient as carnitine is not an essential nutrient, is abundant in the body under regular diet and carnitine deficiency results from mutations in its transport machinery. As the claim is that whd links JNK to FAO, and is transcriptionally regulated by JNK, a genetic rescue experiment with whd is essential, especially as Foxo overexpression increases differentiation. This manuscript often relies on compound treatment strategies alone despite having a genetically tractable model. Yet the role and effect of endogenously generated systemic cues is completely disregarded.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Fatty acid β-oxidation is required for the differentiation of larval hematopoietic progenitors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

They show that supplementation with acetate rescues the phenotype associated with defective FAO, and that FAO is downstream of JNK, a known regulator of differentiation, providing insights into how metabolic pathway may be intertwined with differentiation pathway. They use abundant genetic models (mutants, reporters) to support their claim.</p><p>The revised manuscript by Tiwari et al. has addressed all the comments made on the previous version. The authors have repeated experiments, included controls, or done additional experiments where required. Importantly, progenitors have been correctly identified and analyzed. Also, progenitor-specific genetic analysis (perturbation of glucose uptake; downregulation of withered; upregulation of FAO in JNK depletion) has been done. The data are of good quality, presented clearly and gaps in analysis have been filled satisfactorily. The Discussion is much improved. This manuscript is significantly improved over the last submission and is an important contribution to the field.</p><p>However, there are still issues with the writing as following, which should be addressed prior to publication. Most of comments can be addressed by modifying writing, but some possible experiments are suggested : these experiments are just suggestions (in case they already have data) and not intended to be “essential” for revision, under the new editorial policy at <italic>eLife</italic> during the covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) In the Introduction, the authors contrast hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in mammals with <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoietic progenitors, assuming that studying <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoietic progenitors will provide insights into how mammalian non-HSC progenitors are regulated by FAO. However, given that <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not have HSCs, and whether they represent HSCs or progenitors remain unclear (or whether it's comparison to mammalians HSC vs. progenitor is more relevant). In mammalian HSCs, FAO is required for stem cell maintenance, whereas in <italic>Drosophila</italic> LG, FAO is required for differentiation. I see that this difference may have driven the authors to make the above contrast, but I don't think it's a well-grounded argument and they should modify the Discussion accordingly.</p><p>2) Figure 1—figure supplement 1C shows reticular mitochondria as an indication of high FAO. Ideally, they should show less reticular mitochondria in other cell types in comparison.</p><p>3) Figure 4: to nail down the pathway, the epistasis analysis would be ideal, such as combination of genetic mutations (inhibit differentiation, such as whd mutant) and L-carnitine (drive differentiation).

Rather, based on the analysis done (EdU, Figure 1B,C) they are simply proliferating or non-proliferating cells (which may or may not be progenitors), the latter poised for, or in the process of differentiation. Expectedly, their metabolic states differ- and the authors show that these are glycolysis for the former and FAO for the latter. Figure 1B,C: TepIV and EdU labelling – it looks as if there are co-labeled cells, but these are ignored. Also TepIVGAL4 reporter does not label the entire progenitor pool.

General impacts of metabolism on cell fates, particularly those between stem cells and their progenies, have increasingly drawn researchers' attention in recent years. By using <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoietic progenitors (in lymph gland), the authors explored the role of metabolic circuitry in this lineage. The main conclusion is that actively proliferating stem cells utilize glycolytic pathway whereas quiescent stem cells favor fatty acid β-oxidation, which promotes differentiation.</p><p>Furthermore, they propose that FAO generates acetyl-CoA, which not only generates energy through TCA cycle, but can contribute to protein (e.g. histone) acetylation. Perturbation of FAO leads to defects in quiescence (progenitor starts proliferating and cannot differentiate). Upregulation of FAO leads to stem cell quiescence and precocious differentiation. The authors link this observation to histone acetylation and thus epigenetic regulation.</p><p>Figure 1: Does blocking glycolysis have any impact on differentiation? Does it only affect progenitor proliferation without impacting later differentiation?</p></disp-quote><p>Although the focus of the current paper is differentiation and β-oxidation, we, however, have done this experiment. Glycolysis inhibition by 2-DG supplemented feeding affects progenitor proliferation without having much effect on Hml<sup>+</sup> Cortical Zone.

We intend to put together a separate manuscript on Glycolysis and progenitor homeostasis on a later date.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: blocking FAO by means of whd knockdown resulted in increased progenitors and decreased differentiating cells. Further in Figure 3, they show that loss of FAO also increases progenitor proliferation and thus progenitors are not entering quiescence. Collectively these results indicate that FAO is required for progenitors to enter quiescence, and thus their “differentiation defect” is secondary to their inability to enter quiescence. These results are quite clear, but when I was reading the description for Figure 2, I was misled to think that FAO blocks differentiation.

Although each piece of discoveries in this paper is important, I don't know if the authors can claim that FAO regulates progenitor differentiation through BOTH metabolic regulation and histone acetylation. Especially because Figure7 shows that acetate supplementation is enough to rescue whd mutant phenotype, one has to wonder whether “metabolic” aspect ever contributes to self-renewal/differentiation choices. And if this is all about histone acetylation, what is the importance of glycolysis in self-renewing progenitors? Of course, it is an intriguing possibility that this is nature's elegant solution, natural shifts in metabolism also triggers epigenetic programming. I am not asking to do experiments to tell apart the possibilities, but the fact that their data do not necessarily show the requirement of FAO regulating metabolism per se in regulating differentiation, and the possibilities have to be carefully discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to draw the attention of the reviewer to the fact that the metabolic signal ROS is known to trigger JNK in the progenitors to elicit their differentiation (Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009).

The levels of acetyl COA required for acetylation in proliferating progenitors of the second instar are not compromised owing to the high glycolytic index at this stage. Later on, in development, glycolysis dampens, and FAO picks up to provide the Acetyl COA moiety required for histone acetylation in the progenitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think that Figure 8 is unnecessary.

(Results paragraph one and two). Further there is no quantitation whatsoever and a lack of controls. Two different developmental stages are compared and cell identity is arbitrarily assigned. No markers are used for self-renewing or quiescent cells and it is not clear how the authors identify these.

In this case a proliferation assay is required along with markers to demarcate the MZ/CZ boundaries to show that the uptake is less in the prohemocyte pool of the 3rd instar lymph gland.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to draw your attention to the fact that there is a technical constraint in performing any antibody assay or proliferation assay with 2-NBDG. Mild fixation is essential for 2 – NBDG assay. Upon normal fixation or more extended washing (required for Antibody staining) 2-NBDG signal quenches. The restricted peripheral signal of 2-NBDG in HmldsRed suggests that the maximum uptake is in the peripheral hemocytes instead of the inner ones (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is likely that the 2NBDG labeled cells could be late progenitors in the second instar that persist in CZ. Without appropriate markers this cannot be distinguished. Further third instar progenitors may be slower proliferating or arrested in the cell cycle, this is not quiescence. A cell cycle analysis needs to be done through L2 and L3 to resolve the two states, so called self-renewal and differentiation.</p><p>What the authors call quiescence is likely a non-proliferative state that precedes differentiation, which is well documented in many developmental contexts. Similarly as mentioned in Results paragraph two, glycolysis is seen in rapidly proliferating cells, such as cancer cells, this is not necessarily self renewal.</p><p>GlutGFP expression is patchy (Figure 1F, G) and not clear whether it is in or around the cells, this looks more like background. A no primary antibody control and a Glut RNAi control are required. MZ should be marked by dome or DEcad and perform EdU labeling in order to show that High Glut 1-GFP is expressed in proliferating progenitors. Similarly aldolase expression (supplement 1A, B) is not convincing and is seen only in the periphery of the second instar.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the input.

As the claim is that whd links JNK to FAO, and is transcriptionally regulated by JNK, a genetic rescue experiment with whd is essential, especially as Foxo overexpression increases differentiation. This manuscript often relies on compound treatment strategies alone despite having a genetically tractable model. Yet the role and effect of endogenously generated systemic cues is completely disregarded.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to draw your attention to a genetic manipulation that we had done in the previously submitted manuscript (Figure 8D-H). Genetic removal of one copy of whd was sufficient to prevent the precocious differentiation observed in progenitor specific overexpression of FOXO. To endorse our claim further in the current manuscript, we done a converse experiment. We have overexpressed whd in the progenitors, which lacked JNK (dome-Gal4. UAS-GFP&gt;UAS-bsk<sup>DN</sup>, whd-OE). Our results show that the progenitors that were unable to differentiate upon loss of JNK, resume their differentiation, with whd overexpression. Please see Figure 8—figure supplement 1L-P.</p><p>From both the genetic data we can conclude that FAO acts downstream of JNK to facilitate differentiation.

However, given that <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not have HSCs, and whether they represent HSCs or progenitors remain unclear (or whether it's comparison to mammalians HSC vs. progenitor is more relevant). In mammalian HSCs, FAO is required for stem cell maintenance, whereas in <italic>Drosophila</italic> LG, FAO is required for differentiation. I see that this difference may have driven the authors to make the above contrast, but I don't think it's a well-grounded argument and they should modify the Discussion accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the Introduction and Discussion accordingly in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1—figure supplement 1C shows reticular mitochondria as an indication of high FAO.

For reasons unknown to us HmlΔ-GAL4 is unable to drive UAS-mito-HA-GFP, which we had employed to assay the status of mitochondria in the progenitors. We, had therefore, used streptavidin labeling to visualize the mitochondrial status in the differentiated hemocytes. Interestingly, differentiated hemocytes (HmlΔ-GAL4&gt; UAS-GFP) show less reticular mitochondria, in comparison to the progenitors (Hml&gt;GFP negative). We have included this result in the revised version (please refer to Figure 1—figure supplement 1D-D').</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 4: to nail down the pathway, the epistasis analysis would be ideal, such as combination of genetic mutations (inhibit differentiation, such as whd mutant) and L-carnitine (drive differentiation). Especially, they conduct similar experiments in Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure 8.</p></disp-quote><p>Although this could have been an ideal experiment, we did not carry out this analysis previously. Since whd null mutant and carnitine, both are part of the carnitine shuttle that imports carnitine fat moiety into mitochondria. CPT1/whd is the enzyme present in the outer mitochondrial membrane, which converts fatty acyl-CoA into fatty acyl-carnitine by utilizing the carnitine moiety. Therefore, we rationalized that upregulation of FAO by carnitine supplementation in whd null homozygous mutants would not aid in the epistatic analysis.</p><p>However, we have now used whd1 heterozygous, which incidentally also gives an impressive phenotype (more progenitor, less differentiation compared to control). L-carnitine feeding to the heterozygous restores differentiation to a great extent. We have included this in the revised version (please refer to Figure4—figure supplement 1A-E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5I-L, 2-DG treatment rescues G2/M arrest defects in whd mutant, but does not seem to rescue differentiation defect. Any discussions?</p></disp-quote><p>We had mentioned this aspect in the Result section. Now in the revised version we have expanded this thought and included it in the Discussion, as “The glycolytic surge in FAO mutants is not capable to take them through the differentiation process. This indicates that for the process of differentiation the acetyl moiety derived from FAO plays a key role to facilitate hemocyte progenitor differentiation”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
