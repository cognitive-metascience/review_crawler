The cerebellum expresses several autism-linked genes, including <italic>GABRB3</italic>, which encodes GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor β3 subunits and is among the maternal alleles deleted in Angelman syndrome. We tested how this <italic>Gabrb3</italic> m-/p+ mutation affects CbN physiology in mice, separating responses of males and females. Wild-type mice showed sex differences in synaptic excitation, inhibition, and intrinsic properties. Relative to females, CbN cells of males had smaller synaptically evoked mGluR1/5-dependent currents, slower Purkinje-mediated IPSCs, and lower spontaneous firing rates, but rotarod performances were indistinguishable. In mutant CbN cells, IPSC kinetics were unchanged, but mutant males, unlike females, showed enlarged mGluR1/5 responses and accelerated spontaneous firing. These changes appear compensatory, since mutant males but not females performed indistinguishably from wild-type siblings on the rotarod task. Thus, sex differences in cerebellar physiology produce similar behavioral output, but provide distinct baselines for responses to mutations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07596.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07596.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07596.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cerebellum is a part of the brain that plays a role in controlling movement, coordination and balance. It also contributes to cognitive processes that do not relate to movement. Changes in the cerebellum are often seen in individuals with autism spectrum disorders, and many genes implicated in autism are active in the cerebellum. One of these genes encodes part of a receptor for the signaling molecule GABA, and is called <italic>GABRB3</italic> in humans. Each person usually inherits one copy of the <italic>GABRB3</italic> gene from each parent. However, if a mother does not pass on this gene, her child may develop Angelman syndrome. Those affected by this disorder show impaired movement and cognitive abilities, and often show signs of autism.</p><p>To explore how neural signals in the cerebellum might change in Angelman syndrome, Mercer et al. compared mice that lack a copy of the mouse equivalent of the gene (called <italic>Gabrb3</italic>) from their mothers to “control” mice with two intact copies of the gene. The experiments unexpectedly revealed that key brain cells in the cerebellum of male control mice were different from the same cells in female mice. The cells in males had lower baseline levels of electrical activity and responded differently to signals from other cells. The differences arose partly because a group of receptors – called metabotropic glutamate receptors – were more easily activated in the brain cells in females than in males. Nevertheless, both male mice and female mice did equally well at learning to balance on a rotating rod, which is a skill that is controlled by the cerebellum. In other words, the cerebellum works differently in male and female mice but produces the same output.</p><p>Mutant male mice performed just as well as non-mutant, control males at learning to balance on the rotating rod. By contrast, female mutants did not improve during training on the same task. Measuring the activity of cells in the cerebellum showed that the metabotropic glutamate receptors in cells from mutant male mice had changed so that they responded more like those of females. However, the responses of mutant female mice did not change compared to control female mice. This result suggests that the changes in the brain cells of male mutant mice helped compensate for the <italic>Gabrb3</italic> mutation. It also shows that baseline differences in the brains of male and female animals can make them respond differently to mutations associated with genetic disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07596.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07596.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>metabotropic glutamate receptor</kwd><kwd>cerebellar nuclei</kwd><kwd>Purkinje</kwd><kwd>sexual dimorphism</kwd><kwd>Angelman syndrome</kwd><kwd>group I mGluR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFARI grant 33026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raman</surname><given-names>Indira M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-NS039395</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raman</surname><given-names>Indira M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-MH095248</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woolley</surname><given-names>Catherine S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Male and female mice differ in basal cerebellar physiology, including the magnitude of synaptic excitation by metabotropic glutamate receptors, kinetics of synaptic inhibition, intrinsic properties, and responses to autism-linked mutations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons in the cerebellar nuclei (CbN) form the final stage of cerebellar processing. They integrate synaptic inhibition from Purkinje neurons of the cerebellar cortex with synaptic excitation from mossy fibers and inferior olivary fibers, thereby generating the sole output of the non-vestibulocerebellum. Consequently, disruptions in intrinsic or synaptic signaling anywhere in the cerebellar circuit are likely to manifest themselves in CbN cell activity, either as altered or compensatory responses. Recent work has drawn attention to the fact that many genes disrupted in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are expressed in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fatemi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that, regardless of the etiology of the phenotypes associated with the condition, cerebellar processing may be affected. Indeed, cerebellar abnormalities are consistently found in post-mortem examinations of autistic brains, which reveal decreases in size and number of Purkinje and/or CbN cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bauman and Kemper, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arin et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bailey et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kemper and Bauman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Whitney et al., 2008</xref>). Mice with the 15q11-13 duplication, a model for one form of autism, show defects in cerebellar learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Piochon et al., 2014</xref>), and mutation of <italic>Tsc1</italic> in Purkinje cells alone can recapitulate several autism-like behaviors in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). Studying the cerebellum in mouse models of autism may therefore yield insight into how cerebellar output is generated and to what extent cerebellar processing is plastic or disrupted in the face of genetic abnormalities.</p><p><italic>GABRB3,</italic> which encodes the β3 subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R), is an autism-linked gene with cerebellar expression. It is among the genes affected in Angelman syndrome, a condition in which patients show developmental delay, motor stereotypy, and movement disorders, among other symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Williams et al., 2006</xref>). These patients have a microdeletion of the 15q11-13 region of the maternal chromosome, which spans multiple genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knoll et al., 1989</xref>), of which <italic>UBE3A</italic> and <italic>GABRB3</italic> have been the most extensively studied. Mice lacking maternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> recapitulate many but not all phenotypes expected for an animal model of Angelman syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jiang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allensworth et al., 2011</xref>). Mice lacking only the maternal copy of <italic>Gabrb3</italic> (m-/p+), however, also show many of these phenotypes. Regarding cerebellar function, adult <italic>Gabrb3 </italic>m-/p+ mice display deficits in motor learning as measured by the accelerating rotarod task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DeLorey et al., 2011</xref>). In the cerebellum, β3 is expressed in Purkinje and granule cells, with low expression in the cerebellar nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Laurie et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fritschy and Mohler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hörtnagl et al., 2013</xref>). Since β3 slows the kinetics of GABA<sub>A</sub>R currents in expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hinkle and Macdonald, 2003</xref>), IPSC kinetics of neurons that express GABA<sub>A</sub>R β3 are predicted to be accelerated in <italic>Gabrb3</italic> m-/p+ mice, which should disinhibit those cells and alter signaling through the cerebellum. Since all such changes must ultimately be funneled through the cerebellar nuclei, we examined synaptic properties of large, likely glutamatergic, premotor CbN neurons in cerebellar slices from wild-type and <italic>Gabrb3</italic> m-/p+ mice.</p><p>Because of a reported sex difference in motor behavior of m-/p+ mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DeLorey et al., 2011</xref>), we also compared electrophysiological responses in males and females. These comparisons revealed that, even in wild-type mice, a wide range of basal synaptic and intrinsic properties of CbN cells differ between the sexes. Males and females also respond differently to the <italic>Gabrb3</italic> m-/p+ mutation, which triggers an augmentation of mGluR1/5 responses and intrinsic firing rates in male but not female mutant mice, which is apparently compensatory on a motor learning task.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Since expression of the β3 subunit is expected to be reduced in <italic>Gabrb3</italic> m-/p+ mice, we first tested for direct effects of the mutation on synaptically evoked GABA<sub>A</sub>R responses. Male and female <italic>Gabrb3 </italic>m-/p+ mice and littermate controls were considered separately because of sex differences reported in behavioral responses to the mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DeLorey et al., 2011</xref>). Whole-cell recordings were made from large CbN cells in cerebellar slices from P17-P24 mice, and voltage-clamped synaptic currents were evoked with 100-Hz, 200-ms trains of electrical stimuli to evoke Purkinje cell-mediated IPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Telgkamp and Raman, 2002</xref>). Because these stimulus trains necessarily also elicit glutamate release from excitatory mossy fibers, AMPA and NMDA receptors were blocked by 5 µM DNQX and 10 µM CPP. The trains evoked outward synaptic currents dominated by GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated current from Purkinje cell stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Telgkamp and Raman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). During trains, the synaptic current did not decay fully, so that with the onset of the next stimulus, the additional 'phasic' current, i.e., synaptic current evoked by release elicited by a single stimulation, summed with the preceding 'tonic' current, i.e., residual or accumulating synaptic current from previous release events. The tonic component is of interest because it is largely responsible for suppressing intrinsic firing by CbN cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Telgkamp and Raman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Person and Raman, 2012</xref>). In wild-type males and females, the phasic components largely overlaid one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; repeated-measures ANOVA p<italic>=0.78</italic>). In contrast, the synaptic current decayed to a greater extent in females, leading to a tonic component that was more than 3-fold larger in wild-type males than females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, +/+ males n=11, +/+ females n=10, p<italic>=0.005</italic>). This result was replicated in C57BL/6 males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), demonstrating that elements of basal synaptic transmission in the CbN of mice differ between the sexes, even in pre-pubertal animals.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07596.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sex differences in CbN synaptic currents and sex-specific responses to the <italic>Gabrb3</italic> m-/p+ mutation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 100-Hz trains of synaptic currents evoked in CbN cells from male and female wild-type mice, normalized to the first peak.

Consequently, cells from mutant males had a smaller tonic component than wild-type males (m-/p+ males n=11, p<italic>=0.029</italic>), but wild-type and mutant females did not differ (m-/p+ females n=11, p<italic>=0.94</italic>). Thus, the <italic>Gabrb3 </italic>m-/p+ mutation leads to a change in tonic synaptic current in males but not in females, eliminating the sex difference present in wild-type animals.</p><p>To test whether the differences in tonic current arose directly from differences in GABA<sub>A</sub>R kinetics, we measured the decay kinetics of synaptic currents evoked by single stimuli. The weighted τ<sub>decay</sub> was 2.3 ± 0.1 ms in wild-type males (n=22) and 1.8 ± 0.2 ms in wild-type females (n=9, p<italic>=0.07</italic>). Similar values were seen in cells from C57BL/6 mice, and combining the datasets demonstrated that cells from females indeed had significantly slower IPSC decay times than males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, males 2.4 ± 0.1, n=33; females 1.8 ± 0.2, n=21; p<italic>=0.008</italic>). Despite the fact that GABA<sub>A</sub>R β3 expression is expected to slow the deactivation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hinkle and MacDonald 2003</xref>), the mean time constants in cells from m-/p+ mice were indistinguishable from those of wild-type, for both males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, solid symbols; m-/p+ males 2.5 ± 0.2 ms, n=16, p<italic>=0.5 vs.</italic> +/+; m-/p+ females 1.8 ± 0.2 ms, n=6, p<italic>=1.0 vs.</italic> +/+). This similarity suggests that the kinetics of evoked synaptic currents in large CbN cells do not depend strongly on GABA<sub>A</sub>R β3, possibly because <italic>Gabrb3 </italic>m-/p+ does not actually result in reduced cerebellar expression, or because the GABA<sub>A</sub>R β3 subunit is not strongly expressed in the cerebellar nuclei even in wild-type mice.</p><p>We therefore measured β3 subunit expression in CbN tissue in C57BL/6 male and female mice, and compared it to β3 subunit expression in the cerebellar cortex. Indeed, β3 subunit expression was relatively low in the CbN; β3 expression in the cerebellar cortex was about twice that in the cerebellar nuclei, in both males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, males, n=2, p<italic>=0.02,</italic> females, n=2, p<italic>=0.004</italic>). These data corroborate previous results from immunostaining and in situ hybridization that report cerebellar GABA<sub>A</sub>R β3 expression to be primarily in granule cells and Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Laurie et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fritschy and Mohler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hörtnagl et al., 2013</xref>). Next, to test whether GABA<sub>A</sub>R β3 levels are detectably reduced in <italic>Gabrb3 </italic>m-/p+ mice, we compared expression in the cerebellar cortex across all four groups of mutants and wild-type siblings of both sexes. Consistent with a gene dosage effect, loss of the maternal <italic>Gabrb3</italic> allele significantly reduced GABA<sub>A</sub>R β3 expression to about half in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, males, n=3, p<italic>=0.001</italic>; females, n=3, p<italic>=0.005</italic>). In wild-type animals, expression in the cerebellar cortex was indistinguishable in males and females, in both <italic>Gabrb3</italic> sibling controls (n=3, p<italic>=0.21</italic>) and in C57BL/6 mice (n=6, p<italic>=0.37</italic>). GABA<sub>A</sub>R β3 expression in the cerebellar nuclei was also significantly reduced in mutant males and females (p<italic>≤0.001,</italic> both sexes). Thus, the lack of changes in IPSC decay times in CbN cells of <italic>Gabrb3</italic> m-/p+ mice is more likely to result from sparse GABA<sub>A</sub>R β3 expression in wild-type mice, rather than a failure of the mutation to reduce expression.</p><p>Moreover, the similarity of IPSC decay times for sex-matched wild-type and mutant CbN cells suggests that factors other than GABA<sub>A</sub>R decay kinetics must account for differences in tonic currents between wild-type and mutant males. To test the extent to which IPSC decay times were predictive of tonic currents, we calculated the expected tonic current based on IPSC decay times and compared it to the measured tonic current. The decay time constants, however, lengthened during the train, such that the last IPSC was significantly longer than the first for wild-type males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, open symbols; weighted τ<sub>decay</sub> for last IPSC, +/+ males, 4.4 ± 0.7 ms, n=10, p<italic>=0.013 vs.</italic> 1<sup>st</sup> IPSC; m-/p+ males, 3.2 ± 0.8 ms, n=11, p<italic>=0.36</italic>; +/+ females, 2.3 ± 0.3 ms, n=10, p<italic>=0.21</italic>; m-/p+ females, 3.1 ± 0.8 ms, n=11, p<italic>=0.17</italic>). Although the basis for this change is unknown, it is consistent with a decreasing synchrony of neurotransmitter release time as the train progresses, e.g., associated with changing action potential waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bischofberger et al., 2002</xref>). We therefore incorporated this gradual change in τ<sub>decay</sub> into our calculations (<italic>Materials and Methods</italic>) and estimated the tonic current for each group. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, for wild-type males, the predicted and measured currents were closely matched (<italic>solid and open black triangles</italic>), indicating that IPSC kinetics are sufficient to account for the tonic synaptic current. For mutant males and both female groups, however, the IPSC decay times consistently predicted a tonic current that is smaller than in wild-type males but still <italic>larger</italic> than the measured values (<italic>open vs. solid symbols</italic>), suggesting an additional factor either reducing the total outward tonic current or contributing a tonic inward current.</p><p>One possibility arose from the fact that in the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, only fast excitatory transmission was blocked. Previous work, however, shows that glutamate release from mossy fibers can activate group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1/5) in CbN neurons, which in turn can increase tonic <italic>inward</italic> currents through multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang and Linden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng and Raman, 2011</xref>). We therefore tested the effect of CPCCOEt (100 µM), which effectively blocks group I mGluRs in CbN cells in a manner that is mimicked by a combination of the selective mGluR1 antagonist JNJ16259685 and mGluR5 antagonist MPEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng and Raman, 2011</xref>). When trains of IPSCs were evoked, CPCCOEt increased the net outward tonic current, consistent with activation of group I mGluRs in CbN cells of wild-type and mutant mice of both sexes (+/+ males n=11, females n=11; m-/p+ males n=12, females n=9, p<italic>&lt;0.001</italic>). Importantly, CPCCOEt also eliminated the sex difference between wild-type male and female tonic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,</xref> p<italic>=0.93</italic>). Additionally, the tonic currents in mutant cells were indistinguishable from those of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, males, p<italic>=1.0;</italic> females, p<italic>=0.93</italic>), suggesting that the observed sex difference in wild-type synaptic currents results from a larger mGluR1/5 response in females than in males. The difference in tonic current in control and CPCCOEt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) provides a measure of the differential contribution of group I mGluRs.

This effect on even a single stimulus suggests that group I mGluRs may be basally activated in a manner that shortens synaptic currents, e.g., by inhibition of presynaptic Ca currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu-Friedman and Regehr, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined the mGluR1/5 current directly. In these experiments synaptic inhibition was blocked by SR95531 (10 µM) and strychnine (10 µM), and NMDA receptors were blocked by CPP (10 µM). After a recording was established, the excitatory amino acid transporter blocker <sc>dl</sc>-TBOA (50 µM) was added to the bath. TBOA increases glutamate spillover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brasnjo and Otis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2004</xref>) and augments the evoked responses of group I mGluRs in the CbN of ~2-week-old rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang and Linden, 2006</xref>). In the present experiments, however, application of TBOA had a striking effect even in the absence of synaptic stimulation: it evoked a large standing current of a few hundred pA at -40 mV, which was largely reversed by group I mGluR antagonists. The remaining current was not further altered by a return to control solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Consistent with an action at mGluR1/5, the magnitude of the effect of CPCCOEt (n=10) was indistinguishable from that of combined JNJ16259685 (0.2 µM) and MPEP (40 µM, n=29, p<italic>=0.63</italic>) and the data were pooled. To test whether the effect of TBOA resulted from glutamate released in an action-potential-dependent manner, 1 µM TTX was added to the bath in a subset of experiments. The TBOA-induced current was indeed reversed by TTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, C57BL/6 male mice; control -305 ± 99 pA; TBOA -570 ± 139 pA, <italic>p=0.033 vs.</italic> control; TBOA+TTX -338 ± 43 pA, p<italic>=0.2 vs.</italic> control), and the variance of the standing current was reduced. The data are consistent with the idea that spontaneously firing nearby cells continuously release glutamate. In the presence of TBOA, the released glutamate reaches and activates group I mGluRs on CbN cells, which in turn couple to other channels; at this voltage, the inward current is likely carried primarily through L-type Ca channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng and Raman, 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07596.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Differences in mGluR1/5-dependent currents depend on glutamate access to receptors rather than receptor expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Increase in holding current in a +/+ male mouse by TBOA reversal by group I mGluR antagonists.

These results suggest that the differences in evoked mGluR1/5-dependent currents do not necessarily result from fewer receptors or diminished properties of downstream targets in wild-type males. Instead, the reduced response to evoked release in wild-type males may stem from the accessibility of glutamate to mGluRs when transport is intact, i.e., owing to differences in the efficacy of uptake or proximity of receptors. Moreover, the <italic>Gabrb3 </italic>m-/p+ mutation does not apparently alter the maximal mGluR1/5 response, as measured with transporter blockers, in males or females.</p><p>To examine the voltage-dependence of the mGluR1/5-dependent current, we applied a voltage ramp to CbN cells from all four groups of <italic>Gabrb3</italic> mice. From an initial holding potential of -40 mV, the voltage was stepped to -20 mV for 100 ms and then ramped down to -80 mV over 250 ms. The ramp revealed a standing inward current that increased in amplitude until about -35 mV, decreased from -35 mV to -50 mV, and then increased monotonically until the end of the ramp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This current profile reflects what has previously been identified as an L-type voltage gated Ca current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng and Raman, 2011</xref>) and a cationic leak current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang and Linden, 2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raman et al., 2000</xref>). Both currents are active during the initial depolarization, and both increase in amplitude as the voltage is ramped down and the driving force increases. With further hyperpolarization, however, the L-type current deactivates, decreasing the current amplitude, until only the leak current remains. Application of TBOA increases the current amplitude between -80 and -35 mV in all four groups, consistent with both currents being potentiated by mGluR1/5 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The magnitude of the current increase varied widely across cells, and differences were not statistically significant despite different mean values (repeated-measures ANOVA p<italic>=0.66</italic>, males n=10, females n=8). Likewise, among <italic>Gabrb3</italic> mutants, neither male nor female mutants were statistically different from wild-type mice (males p<italic>=0.92</italic>, n=11; females p<italic>=0.92</italic>, n=9).</p><p>Group I mGluR antagonists partly blocked the TBOA-induced current increase in each group. Wild-type males and females showed a similar response to application of mGluR1/5 antagonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, +/+ males <italic>vs.</italic> females p<italic>=0.99</italic>). In fact, mGluR1/5 antagonists blocked little TBOA-induced current evoked below -50 mV, a voltage-dependence consistent with that of L-type Ca channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng and Raman, 2011</xref>). Mutant females were indistinguishable from wild-type females (p<italic>=0.96</italic>), but mutant males showed a trend toward more current that was sensitive to mGluR1/5 antagonists (p<italic>=0.086 vs.</italic> +/+ males). In mutant males, the TBOA-induced current was blocked by mGluR1/5 antagonists at a wider range of voltages than the other groups, suggesting that in these mice transporter blockade also increased the leak current in an mGluR1/5-dependent manner.</p><p>Since the sex- and mutation-specific differences in mGluR1/5-dependent current are largely eliminated by blockade of glutamate uptake, then they may be independent of differences in group I mGluR expression. We tested this idea with Western blots for both mGluR1 and mGluR5 in the cerebellar nuclei of wild-type mice (both <italic>Gabrb3</italic> sibling +/+ and C57BL/6) and <italic>Gabrb3 </italic>m-/p+ mice of both sexes. Indeed, neither mGluR1 nor mGluR5 protein levels differed significantly between wild-type males and females, or between wild-type males and mutant males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Expression of mGluR1 did not differ between any of the four <italic>Gabrb3</italic> groups (n=3, one-way ANOVA p<italic>=0.61</italic>); the lack of a detectable sex difference was confirmed in C57BL/6 wild-type mice (n=6, p<italic>=0.61</italic>). Likewise, expression of mGluR5 did not differ among any of the <italic>Gabrb3</italic> groups, n=3, p<italic>=0.82</italic>) or between C57BL/6 males and females (n=6, p<italic>=0.19</italic>). In conjunction with the electrophysiological data in TBOA, these results support the idea that the smaller evoked mGluR1/5-dependent currents observed in wild-type males, relative to wild-type females or mutant males, arise largely from access of glutamate to group I mGluRs.</p><p>In the same cells, we examined evoked excitatory synaptic transmission and its alteration by TBOA. Afferents to CbN cells were stimulated at 100 Hz, in SR95531, strychnine, and CPP, as above. AMPARs were left unblocked so that AMPAR-mediated EPSCs could serve as evidence that glutamate release was evoked. The initial peak EPSC was decreased in TBOA by about 50% in all groups but wild-type females (+/+ males p<italic>=0.008</italic>, n=7; m-/p+ males p<italic>=0.047</italic>, n=7; +/+ females p<italic>=0.65</italic>, n=6; m-/p+ females p<italic>=0.006</italic>, n=8).

Additionally, attributes of these targets differ between the sexes, as well as between wild-type and mutant females.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07596.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Group I mGluR-dependent and -independent effects of TBOA on evoked EPSCs.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) Sample traces from a CbN cell from a m-/p+ male of EPSCs elicited by 100 Hz stimulus trains, in control, TBOA, and TBOA + mGluR1/5 antagonist(s), normalized to the peak of the first EPSC.

When normalized to the initial amplitude, EPSCs from all four groups depressed by about 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>) by the end of the train. In wild-type males, however, TBOA reduced synaptic depression (+/+ males, control 38 ± 7%, TBOA 52 ± 7%, p<italic>=0.012</italic>), and, unlike the change in initial EPSC amplitude, the effect of TBOA on synaptic depression was blocked by group I mGluR antagonists (+/+ males with antagonist 42 ± 6%, p<italic>=0.002</italic>). This observation lends support to the idea that the lack of detectable evoked mGluR1/5-dependent current in wild-type males depends on intact glutamate transport. The results in mutant males resembled those of wild-type males, in that mean synaptic depression was reduced in TBOA, but responses were more variable across cells, occasionally even showing facilitation (m-/p+ males, control 49 ± 7%, TBOA 70 ± 16%, p<italic>=0.14</italic>). In mGluR1/5 antagonists, currents were restored to control values (m-/p+ males, with antagonist 55 ± 7% p<italic>=0.20 vs.</italic> control). In contrast, in both female groups, TBOA had no detectable effect on synaptic depression (+/+ females p<italic>=0.81</italic>, m-/p+ p<italic>=0.22</italic>). Thus, although many variables interact to generate the profiles of currents, the data are consistent with sex-specific differences in mGluR currents activated when glutamate transporters are blocked: (1) an mGluR1/5-<italic>independent</italic> decrease in initial evoked EPSC amplitude, evident in both male groups as well as in mutant females, and (2) an mGluR1/5-<italic>dependent,</italic> sex-specific decrease in synaptic depression in males only, which is relatively unaffected by the <italic>Gabrb3</italic> mutation.</p><p>The observation of sex differences in basal synaptic properties, as well as the unanticipated link between the loss of an allele encoding a GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit and changes in group I mGluR-mediated responses, raises the possibility that other aspects of excitability also differ between the sexes and/or are differentially regulated by the mutation. We therefore measured spontaneous firing rates in CbN cells, with fast excitatory transmission blocked by 5 µM DNQX and 10 µM CPP. Indeed, CbN cells fired more slowly in wild-type males (65 ± 7 spikes/s, n=14) than in females (98 ± 9 spikes/s, n=16; p<italic>=0.02</italic>), again reflecting a sex difference in basic CbN cell properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). CbN cells from mutant males tended to fire somewhat faster than from wild-type males (92 ± 9 spikes/s, n=11, p<italic>=0.08</italic>), whereas cells from mutant females had the same firing rates as those from wild-type females (96 ± 10 spikes/s, n=20, p<italic>=0.9</italic>). Action potential half-widths, however, were indistinguishable among all four groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, p<italic>=0.3</italic>). Thus, the sex differences in basal cerebellar physiology and in response to the <italic>Gabrb3</italic> m-/p+ mutation may extend beyond synaptic activation of mGluRs. These differences in CbN cell spontaneous rates mirror the differences in synaptic responses, raising the possibility that chronic activation of group I mGluRs may contribute a depolarizing current that affects firing. The experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, however, demonstrated that holding currents at -40 mV were not different across the four groups of mice (+/+ males -565 ± 40 pA; m-/p+ males -491 ± 59 pA; +/+ females -406 ± 83 pA; m-/p+ females -424 ± 49 pA, p<italic>=0.26</italic>). It therefore seems unlikely that the slower firing rates in wild-type males arose from mGluR1/5 activation, and instead are more likely to reflect differences in intrinsic currents.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07596.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Sex differences in spontaneous firing rates and evoked rebound firing, and sex-specific responses to the <italic>Gabrb3</italic> m-/p+ mutation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sample traces of spontaneous action potentials in CbN cells.

Specifically, after periods of spike suppression either by hyperpolarization or by trains of IPSCs, CbN neurons have been shown to increase their firing above their intrinsic rates for a few hundred milliseconds. This phenomenon of 'prolonged rebound firing' depends partly on recovery of intrinsic conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aman and Raman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sangrey and Jaeger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tadayonnejad et al., 2010</xref>) and partly on mGluR1/5 potentiation of L-type Ca currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng and Raman, 2011</xref>). If the increase in train-evoked mGluR1/5-dependent current observed in neurons from male mutants and all female mice leads to a greater potentiation of L-type currents, the extent of CPCCOEt-sensitive prolonged rebound firing should be greater in neurons from these animals than from wild-type male mice.</p><p>We therefore evoked prolonged rebound firing before and after application of CPCCOEt in CbN cells from wild-type and <italic>Gabrb3</italic> m-/p+ mice. In CPP and DNQX, CbN cells were current-clamped and enough hyperpolarizing holding current was applied to reduce regular intrinsic firing to a frequency near 40 Hz. When 100-Hz, 500-ms stimulus trains were applied, firing either slowed or ceased, consistent with the outward currents seen in voltage clamp. In all cells, firing rates for the 300 ms just after the stimulus were faster than firing rates during the 500 ms just before the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To quantify these changes and account for small differences in the pre-stimulus baseline firing rates across cells, we calculated the percent change in rate from the ratio of the post-stimulus to the pre-stimulus rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Consistent with an upregulation of mGluR1/5 responses, the firing rate acceleration in CbN cells was greater in m-/p+ than wild-type males. Moreover, in the same cells, this difference disappeared when group I mGluRs were blocked. In females, cells from both wild-type and mutant mice showed prolonged rebound firing that was reduced on average by CPCCOEt.</p><p>To quantify the contribution of group I mGluRs, the difference in the percent change in control and CPCCOEt solutions was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This mGluR1/5-dependent increase in prolonged rebound firing did not differ between female wild-type and m-/p+ mice (+/+ 39 ± 35%, m-/p+ 25 ± 22%, p<italic>=0.74</italic>). In contrast, in CbN cells from wild-type males, only 7 ± 14% of the firing rate increase after inhibition can be attributed to group I mGluRs, while for cells from m-/p+ males, 53 ± 13% is CPCCOEt-dependent (p<italic>=0.03</italic>). This small effect of CPCCOEt on prolonged rebound firing in wild-type males correlates with the low magnitude of evoked mGluR1/5-dependent current in these animals. The larger CPCCOEt effect in mutant males is consistent with the idea that the upregulation of the mGluR1/5 response indeed generates a larger potentiation of L-type currents. In females, a CPCCOEt effect was evident in both wild-type and mutant mice, consistent with the voltage-clamp measurements, but responses were generally more variable than in males, suggesting that factors in addition to mGluR1/5 activation may affect prolonged rebound firing in females.</p><p>The sex differences both in basal synaptic physiology of cerebellar output neurons and in their responses to the <italic>Gabrb3</italic> mutation raise the question of whether and how these differences are manifested in cerebellar behavior. Since several genetic disruptions that alter cerebellar output have been demonstrated to change performance on the accelerating rotarod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caston et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lalonde et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gerlai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galliano et al., 2013</xref>), we tested mice from all four groups on this motor task. Experiments were done on P22 mice (on day 1 of training) to permit valid correlations of behavior with electrophysiological data. Notably, despite the differences in basal physiology, wild-type males and females performed the task equivalently (p<italic>=0.21</italic>). This observation demonstrates that the larger mGluR1/5 responses and faster firing rates seen in CbN cells of females do not directly translate to enhanced rotarod performance per se, instead illustrating that wild-type brains of different sexes may use different synaptic and cellular mechanisms to achieve a common behavioral output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Vries, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Comparing the responses of mutant mice to sex-matched controls showed that mutant males performed indistinguishably from wild-type male siblings: both groups remained on the rotarod for a similar duration on Day 1 (+/+ 102 ± 14; m-/p+ 101 ± 10 s, p<italic>=0.9,</italic> for all groups n=8) and improved their performance by Day 7 (+/+ 142 ± 11; m-/p+ 133 ± 12 s; change over training assessed by repeated measures ANOVA, +/+, <italic>p=0.02;</italic> m-/p+, p<italic>=0.03</italic>).

Given the long but replicable latency to fall on Day 1 of female mutants, the lack of increase in fall latency over training indicates an enhanced initial ability coupled with either a failure to improve, or a saturation of performance that precludes further improvement.

Wild-type and mutant males performed similarly, with Δ latencies of 46 ± 17 s and 43 ± 12 s, respectively (p<italic>=0.9</italic>). In females, however, wild-type mice increased their latency by 71 ± 13 s, while the latency of mutant mice decreased by 8 ± 11 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, p<italic>&lt;0.001</italic>). The differences observed in rotarod performance was independent of body mass, as mutant females weighed the same as wild-type females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, p<italic>=0.23</italic>). In weanling mice, therefore, the <italic>Gabrb3 </italic>m-/p+ mutation had no discernible effect on rotarod performance in males, but altered it in females. Previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DeLorey et al., 2011</xref>) has shown the opposite results in adult mice (10–35 weeks old): m-/p+ males, but not females, fail to increase their latency to fall. We therefore tested older mice, which confirmed that the effect of the mutation varies with age as well as sex, with mutant male performance degrading in adult animals, and adult mutant female performance resembling that of wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The present behavioral data therefore suggest that the mutation-dependent electrophysiological changes in weanling males were likely to be part of an effective compensation, preventing them from displaying behavioral abnormalities. Interestingly, however, the same mutation, which led to fewer, more variable changes in the measured electrophysiological parameters, altered rotarod behavior in females, suggesting that changes in other cerebellar signals or effects elsewhere in the brain ultimately produced a deviation from normal. Nevertheless, with a global mutation, the observed changes in behavior cannot be directly attributed to changes in synaptic input to the cerebellar nuclei. Therefore, based on the observation that GABA<sub>A</sub>R β3 is expressed more strongly in the cortex than the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), we repeated the tests of rotarod performance in mice lacking maternal <italic>Gabrb3</italic> in Purkinje cells only (referred to as 'Purkinje-specific mutant' or 'Pkj m-/p+', and wild-type siblings as 'Pkj +/+'). These mice, however, were of a different strain than the global mutants; the former were bred on a 129S background whereas the latter were on a C57BL/6 background. Subjecting Pkj +/+ mice to the acceleration protocol used previously (30 rpm over 4 min) did not result in a prolonged latency to fall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>), consistent with reported observations that 129S mice are generally less capable of motor learning than C57BL/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kelly et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Homanics et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Contet et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Võikar et al., 2001</xref>). We therefore tested a series of acceleration protocols to identify one in which wild-type mice on a 129S background improved their performance over the duration of training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>Like the global mutants, Purkinje-specific mutant males did not differ from wild-type males (Δ latency for Pkj +/+ males 12 ± 4 s, n=10; Pkj m-/p+ males 8 ± 3 s, n=11; p<italic>=0.40</italic>), while Purkinje-specific mutant females had a significantly reduced Δ latency when compared to wild-type females (Δ latency Pkj +/+ females 16 ± 4 s, n=10; Pkj m-/p+ females -1.4 ± 4 s, n=9; p<italic>=0.004</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). To directly compare the performance of each group in the Purkinje-specific <italic>Gabrb3</italic> experiment with the corresponding group in the global <italic>Gabrb3</italic> experiment, despite the different acceleration speeds of the two protocols, we plotted the change in performance (days 5–7 minus day 1) as the change in revolutions per minute (Δ rpm) at the time of fall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The results indicate that the Δ rpm across all four groups (wild-type and mutant males and females) for Purkinje-specific <italic>Gabrb3</italic> mice strongly resembles that of the global <italic>Gabrb3</italic> mutation. Thus, disrupting <italic>Gabrb3</italic> expression in Purkinje cells alone is sufficient to cause the behavioral alterations observed in mutant females, but not males.</p><p>The question remains, however, whether loss of the maternal allele only in Purkinje cells is sufficient to elicit the electrophysiological changes observed in the global mutants. We therefore, repeated the experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref> in the Purkinje-specific <italic>Gabrb3</italic> mice. As before, a basal sex difference was evident, as the tonic outward current produced by a 100-Hz train stimuli was higher in wild-type males than in wild-type females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-7D</xref>, tonic current for last IPSC, Pkj +/+ males 7.3 ± 2.5%, n=8; Pkj +/+ females 1.5 ± 2.1%, n=9; repeated measures ANOVA <italic>p=0.06</italic>). In addition, the Purkinje-specific mutant males had less tonic current than wild-type males (Pkj m-/p+ males 0.04 ± 1.5%, n=8, p<italic>=0.02 vs.</italic> Pkj +/+), consistent with an upregulation of mGluR1/5-dependent current. In contrast, wild-type and mutant females had similar levels of tonic current (Pkj m-/p+ females -2.8 ± 2.0%, n=7, p<italic>=0.14 vs.</italic> Pkj +/+). In addition, measurements of IPSC decay kinetics were similar in the Purkinje-specific and global mutants. IPSCs in CbN cells on the 129S background were again slower in wild-type males than in wild-type females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, Pkj +/+ males τ<sub>decay</sub> = 3.1 ± 0.6 ms, n=6; Pkj +/+ females 1.8 ± 0.2 ms, n=7, p<italic>=0.02</italic>), and neither mutant males nor mutant females differed from their sex-matched controls (Pkj m-/p+ males 2.2 ± 0.6 ms, n=3, p<italic>=0.19 vs.</italic> Pkj +/+; Pkj m-/p+ females 1.5 ± 0.2 ms, n=5, p<italic>=0.61 vs.</italic> Pkj <italic>+/+</italic>). Together, the data illustrate that the Purkinje-specific mutation reproduces the enhanced tonic inward current in mutant males but not females, as well as the cerebellar behavioral alteration in mutant females but not males. These results support the hypothesis that the upregulation of evoked mGluR1/5-dependent current in CbN cells of mutant males arises indirectly from the reduced GABA<sub>A</sub>R β3 subunit in the cerebellar cortex, and strongly suggest that this upregulation serves a compensatory role in cerebellar motor learning tasks.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07596.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Differences in CbN cell tonic current depend on GABA<sub>A</sub>R β3 expression only in Purkinje cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 100-Hz trains of synaptic currents evoked as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in CbN cells from Purkinje-specific <italic>Gabrb3</italic> +/+ and m-/p+ male mice, normalized to the first peak.

With the <italic>Gabrb3</italic> m-/p+ mutation, which is predicted to increase inhibitory drive from Purkinje cells, CbN neurons in male mice upregulate their mGluR1/5 responses to synaptic stimulation, whereas females do not. This change in the mGluR1/5 response appears to be a direct response to changes in Purkinje cell input, since restricting the m-/p+ mutation to Purkinje cells is sufficient to elicit it, and it also appears compensatory, since mutant male mice perform indistinguishably from wild-type males in a motor learning task that involves the cerebellum. In contrast, mutant females, which do not upregulate their mGluR1/5 responses, perform differently from wild-type females. Thus, sex differences in electrophysiological properties are present in a brain region in which such differences have not been extensively investigated.

Such indirect effects of reduced GABA<sub>A</sub>R β3 expression could be an exacerbation of or a compensation for disrupted synaptic physiology elsewhere in the circuit. Since the GABA<sub>A</sub>R β3 subunit is expected to prolong IPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hinkle and Macdonald, 2003</xref>) in cells that express it, i.e., Purkinje and cerebellar granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Laurie et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fritschy and Mohler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hörtnagl et al., 2013</xref>), reduced GABA<sub>A</sub>R β3 expression in m-/p+ mice is predicted to disinhibit granule and Purkinje cells during behaviors that normally engage cerebellar cortical interneurons. The simplest mode of counterbalancing the resulting elevation of inhibition to CbN cells would be by increasing the net excitatory drive and/or raising intrinsic excitability. Indeed, evidence for both changes were observed in male m-/p+ mice. The larger mGluR1/5-dependent currents evoked by stimulation of excitatory afferents serve to counteract much of the tonic outward current elicited by concurrent stimulation of inhibitory afferents, and the increased activation of group I mGluRs is sufficient to raise excitability, as evident by the facilitation of prolonged rebound firing relative to wild-type cells. In addition, the increase in spontaneous firing rates in mutant males, which occurs without a measurable increase in holding current when cells are voltage-clamped, suggests that one or more intrinsic ion channels may also be modulated by the mutation. Independently of mechanism, the observed increase in mGluR1/5-dependent current and intrinsic excitability in male <italic>Gabrb3</italic> m-/p+ CbN cells is well suited to compensate for the predicted increase in inhibitory drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <italic>top</italic>).

The difference in rotarod behavior between wild-type and mutant weanling females in the global and Purkinje-specific <italic>Gabrb3</italic> mice suggests that this absence of an indirect response has behavioral consequences.</p><p>The disruption in rotarod performance in mutant females is unusual: naïve mutant females show prolonged latency to fall on Day 1, and fall latency is not prolonged by subsequent training. Interestingly, previous studies have reported enhanced initial performance on accelerated rotarod by naïve mice with a mutation in a protein repair methyltransferase; these mice were also hyperactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vitali and Clarke, 2004</xref>).

For example, in the <italic>pcd</italic> and <italic>lurcher</italic> mutations, loss of inhibitory input to CbN neurons from degeneration of Purkinje cells triggers structural and physiological changes that increase the efficacy of the residual inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sultan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Linneman et al., 2004</xref>).

Finally, eliminating large conductance Ca-activated K channels, expected to reduce Purkinje cell firing, results in a reduction of climbing fiber activity, which should potentiate excitatory inputs to Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Sex differences in the cerebellum</title><p>Sex differences are evident in three dimensions of CbN cell physiology, including synaptic excitation, synaptic inhibition, and intrinsic properties. Specifically, males and females have (1) different magnitudes of evoked mGluR1/5-dependent currents, possibly owing to differential access of glutamate to receptors, (2) different IPSC decay kinetics, and (3) different spontaneous firing rates. Although the etiology of these differences has yet to be fully examined, they seem likely to arise from a sex difference in neuronal properties rather than from modulation by circulating gonadal hormones, since they are present in pre-pubertal mice. This idea is compatible with other reports of sexually dimorphic molecular and cell biological attributes of cerebellar neurons in juvenile rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dean and McCarthy, 2008</xref>). For instance, calbindin expression in Purkinje neurons is higher in weanling females than males; this difference is determined by sex chromosome complement, regardless of gonadal sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2011</xref>). Another example of pre-pubertal cerebellar sex differences comes from rat pups, in which the inflammation-associated prostaglandin PGE2 can activate aromatase, and the resulting estradiol synthesis within the cerebellum leads to reduced Purkinje cell dendritic arborization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakamoto et al., 2001</xref>). A decrease in Purkinje cell capacitance, as a proxy for arborization, can be mimicked by exogenous estradiol in males but not females, even in juvenile rodent brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dean et al., 2012</xref>). Precedent also exists for the idea that genetic mutations in the cerebellum are differentially manifested between the sexes; the <italic>reeler</italic> and <italic>staggerer</italic> mutations, which both lead to Purkinje cell degeneration, have earlier and/or more extreme effects in heterozygous males than females, with differences evident in animals as young as one month old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hadj-Sahraoui et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doulazmi et al., 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Group I mGluRs in the cerebellar nuclei</title><p>Metabotropic glutamate receptors and their downstream targets have varied effects in the cerebellar nuclei, such that changes in mGluR1/5-dependent current may alter cerebellar output. Potentiation of L-type Ca channels by group I mGluRs can accelerate prolonged rebound firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng and Raman, 2011</xref>), and group I mGluRs can also generate a slow EPSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang and Linden, 2006</xref>). In the present study, the relative amplitudes of inward and outward synaptic currents reported are specific to the experimental conditions. In vivo, processed sensory signals from mossy fibers are expected to excite CbN cells and activate the granule cell-Purkinje cell pathway that concurrently releases GABA onto the same CbN neurons. Thus, the amplitude of mGluR1/5-dependent currents relative to IPSCs is likely to regulate CbN cell firing in vivo. Moreover, the role of group I mGluRs in the cerebellum may differ between the sexes, as has been shown in other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boulware et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tabatadze et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Group I mGluRs are also implicated in long term synaptic plasticity in the cerebellar nuclei. Specifically, induction of long-term depression (LTD) of mossy fiber EPSCs in CbN cells requires activation of mGluR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang and Linden, 2006</xref>). Conversely, long-term plasticity (LTP) of mossy fiber EPSCs in the cerebellar nuclei is inhibited by flux through L-type Ca channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pugh and Raman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Person and Raman, 2010</xref>), which are regulated by group I mGluRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng and Raman, 2011</xref>). In all these studies of cerebellar physiology in juvenile mice, however, data were gathered from both sexes and analyzed together.

Voltage- and current-clamp recordings were made with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier and pClamp acquisition software. During recordings, slices were perfused with oxygenated ACSF solution with the following compounds, as noted: 5 µM DNQX (dinitrofiquinoxaline-2,3-dione) to block AMPA receptors, 10 µM CPP [(RS)-3-(2-carboxy-piperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid] to block NMDA receptors, 10 µM SR-95531 to block GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, 10 µM strychnine to block glycine receptors, 1 µM tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block voltage-gated sodium channels, 50 µM <sc>dl</sc>-TBOA (DL-<italic>threo</italic>-β-benzyloxyaspartic acid) to block excitatory amino acid transporters, 100 µM CPCCOEt (7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[<italic>b</italic>]-chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester) to block group I mGluRs, 0.2 µM JNJ16259685 ((3,4-dihydro-2<italic>H</italic>-pyrano[2,3-<italic>b</italic>]quinolin-7-yl)-(<italic>cis</italic>-4-methoxycyclohexyl)-methanone) to block mGluR1, and 40 µM MPEP hydrochloride (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride) to block mGluR5.

We are including the detailed comments of the reviewers for your information, and for you to use to guide your revision.</p><p>Thank you for the reviews on our manuscript. We have tried to address both the letter and spirit of the reviews by conducting many additional experiments, further analysing existing data, adding data from C57BL/6 mice to confirm and further test sex differences seen in wild-type <italic>Gabrb3</italic> sibling controls, and rewriting the manuscript substantially. We apologise for the delay in resubmission; our mouse colony collapsed owing to construction outside the animal facility and had to be re-established from cryopreserved mice and mice imported from other universities, which delayed us by many months. To summarise, the new data incorporated into the manuscript include the following:</p><p>1) TBOA and antagonist experiments. We recorded the mGluR1/5 currents directly by addition of TBOA. These results opened up an additional line of experiments, which demonstrated the following:</p><p>a) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-3E</xref>: With transport blocked, all 4 groups of animals (males/females; wt/mutants) showed very large standing currents that were largely blocked by mGluR1/5 antagonists. Together the results suggest that the basis for the smaller mGluR1/5 currents seen in wild-type males is likely to come from reduced access of glutamate to its receptors, e.g. because of transporters or receptor location, rather than downstream changes or differences in receptor expression (see also points 2 and 3 below).</p><p>b) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: These experiments also allowed a comparison of evoked EPSCs, through AMPARs and mGluR1/5, in all four groups (measured in control, TBOA, and mGluR1/5 blockers). The results permit further specification of sex differences and changes with the mutation.</p><p>c) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>: These experiments also permitted us to test whether the effects of CPCCOEt could be mimicked by the specific mGluR1 antagonist JNJ16259685 combined with the specific mGluR5 antagonist MPEP. In cells tested with the combination of specific antagonists, the results were indistinguishable from data obtained in cells tested with CPCCOEt, lending support to interpretations of the original pharmacological experiments.</p><p>2) mGluR1 and mGluR5 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and 3G</xref>). We also performed Western blots to test whether the basis for the difference between the sexes and changes with the mutation were likely to result from changes in receptor expression. The data demonstrate that the expression of mGluR1 and mGluR5 are comparable between the sexes and with the mutation, ruling out changes in expression as a primary basis for the differences seen. The most strongly supported alternative remains access of glutamate to receptors (from the TBOA experiments).</p><p>3) GABA<sub>A</sub>R expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and 1G</xref>). We also did Western blots that demonstrated that GABA<sub>A</sub>R β3 in the cerebellum is expressed more heavily in the cortex than the nuclei, that expression is comparable in males and females, and is equivalently reduced in m-/p+ animals. These data also help provide a baseline for more mechanistic interpretations.</p><p>4) Further analysis of GABA<sub>A</sub>R kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). We also examined the changes in IPSC kinetics over trains of stimulation and calculated the extent to which IPSCs were sufficient to account for changes in tonic current. These data provide a clearer rationale for the investigation of non-GABA<sub>A</sub>R contributions to the differences in synaptic responses.</p><p>5) C57BL/6 experiments. Owing to a limited source of mutant mice, we repeated several experiments in C57BL6 mice, both for sex differences in physiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), in protein expression, and the mechanism of TBOA action in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These data corroborate the data obtained in male and female mice that were wild-type siblings of the m-/p+ mice, and support the conclusions regarding sex differences.</p><p>6) Purkinje-specific m-/p+ experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). To strengthen the link between the physiological experiments done in CbN cells and the behavioural results, which admittedly could have a wide range of origins given the global mutation, we repeated both sets of experiments on mice lacking the maternal allele of <italic>Gabrb3</italic> exclusively in Purkinje cells. The results with the Purkinje-specific deletion replicate not only the behavioural differences but also the physiological difference in tonic synaptic current seen with the global mutation. These results provide a stronger framework for interpreting the changes seen in male</p><p> <italic>The following issues should be addressed in the revision: 1) Perform new experiments with direct recording of the mGluR1/5 currents (and ideally also experiments with a different antagonist to CPCCOEt). We view these as controls to buttress the conclusions of the manuscript.</italic></p><p>We have done the requested experiments. As suggested, we made recordings in control solutions, washed on TBOA, followed by mGluR1/5 antagonists (in the continued presence of TBOA). The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A-E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and are discussed in the Results section, paragraphs 8-14. Large mGluR1/5-dependent currents are elicited in TBOA. Together the data support the idea that wild-type male mice have smaller evoked mGluR1/5 currents than the other groups. The data also suggest that the basis for this difference is the accessibility of glutamate to mGluR1/5. In these same experiments, we have also used a combination of the selective mGluR1 antagonists JNJ16259685 and mGluR5 antagonist MPEP (n=29), which had the same effect as CPCCOEt (n=10). These results are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and are discussed in the text, Results section paragraph 8 and subsection “Electrophysiological recording”. These results are consistent with a previous comparison of these antagonists that we did previously (Zheng and Raman 2011), which is also now stated explicitly in the manuscript (Results section paragraph 6).</p><p> <italic>2) Strengthen the link between the slice data and the behavioural results (e.g. reporting mouse-by-mouse physiology:behaviour correlations if these data are available).</italic></p><p>We addressed this point by repeating both behavioural and electrophysiological experiments in mice with the <italic>Gabrb3</italic> allele deleted from the maternal chromosome in Purkinje cells only. For the rotarod test, 40 total mice were tested. The data show that the Purkinjespecific deletion is sufficient to recapitulate the behavioural differences seen with the global mutation. Moreover, the electrophysiology, done in 32 cells, illustrates that the same changes in tonic current in CbN cells are seen with the Purkinje-specific mutation, and support the idea that the changes seen in mutant male mice are compensatory, in a manner that would offset the expected increase in inhibition to CbN cells owing to the mutation. The data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and discussed in the text Results section, paragraphs 21-23. These results strengthen the interpretation that the mutation-dependent changes in Purkinje cells trigger alterations in CbN cell physiology, which in turn are linked to the measured behavior.</p><p>3) Do some editorial revisions to clarify the conclusions; possibly develop a mechanistic hypothesis for how sex-specific mGluR differences contribute to the observed behavioural differences; importantly address and explain differences with the prior literature. Please step back from the manuscript and help the reader navigate the large number of conditions (sex, developmental time, etc.)</p><p>The manuscript has been largely rewritten to clarify the description of experimental results, strengthen the conclusions, and place the work in context of the literature; this has been facilitated by the additional experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, and 7. In addition, we have measured expression of mGluR1, mGluR5, and GABA<sub>A</sub>R β3, which demonstrate that changes or differences in receptor expression are unlikely to account for the physiological differences observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F, 3G</xref>). We have included a diagram illustrating the proposed compensation for increased inhibition by mGluR1/5 upregulation in males but not females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, Discussion section paragraphs 2-3). Please note that the difference from the literature noted by the reviewers does not take into account the developmental changes that we have observed, as it involved comparing weanling animals (this study) with adult animals (the published work of DeLorey et al.). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> includes an illustration of changes in rotarod performance with age which resolves the apparent discrepancies with DeLorey et al., discussed in the Discussion section paragraph 20.</p></body></sub-article></article>
