Their cells host a variety of compartments, with each having a specific role. For example, mitochondria are tasked with providing the energy that powers most of the processes that keep the cell alive. Membranes delimit these compartments, as well as the cells themselves.</p><p>Iron is an element needed for chemical reactions that are essential for the cell to survive. Yet, the byproducts of these reactions can damage – ‘oxidize’ – the lipid molecules that form the cell’s membranes, including the one around mitochondria. Unless enzymes known as peroxidases come to repair the oxidized lipids, the cell dies in a process called ferroptosis. Scientists know that this death mechanism is programmed into the cells of humans and other complex eukaryotes.</p><p>However, Bogacz and Krauth-Siegel wanted to know if ferroptosis also exists in creatures that appeared early in the evolution of eukaryotes, such as the trypanosome <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>. This single-cell parasite causes sleeping sickness in humans and a disease called nagana in horses and cattle. Before it infects a mammal, <italic>T. brucei</italic> goes through an ‘insect stage’ where it lives in the tsetse fly; there, it relies on its mitochondrion to produce energy.</p><p>Bogacz and Krauth-Siegel now show that if the parasites in the insect stage do not have a specific type of peroxidases, they die within a few hours. In particular, problems in the membranes of the mitochondrion stop the compartment from working properly. These peroxidases-free trypanosomes fare better if they are exposed to molecules that prevent iron from taking part in the reactions that can harm lipids. They also survive more if they are forced to create large amounts of an enzyme that relies on iron to protect the mitochondrion against oxidation. Finally, using drugs that prevent ferroptosis in human cells completely rescues these trypanosomes. Taken together, the results suggest that ferroptosis is an ancient cell death program which exists in <italic>T. brucei</italic>; and that, in the insect stage of the parasite's life cycle, this process first damages the mitochondrion.</p><p>This last finding could be particularly relevant because the role of mitochondria in ferroptosis in mammals is highly debated. Yet, most of the research is done in cells that do not rely on this cellular compartment to get their energy. During their life cycle, trypanosomes are either dependent on their mitochondria, or they can find their energy through other sources: this could make them a good organism in which to dissect the precise mechanisms of ferroptosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Trypanosoma brucei</kwd><kwd>trypanothione</kwd><kwd>ferroptosis</kwd><kwd>tryparedoxin peroxidase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Kr1241/5-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krauth-Siegel</surname><given-names>R Luise</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Kr1241/8-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krauth-Siegel</surname><given-names>R Luise</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ferroptosis is an evolutionary ancient process that is counterbalanced by distant peroxidases, GPx4 in mammals and tryparedoxin peroxidases in trypanosomes, and can be induced at distinct subcellular membranes depending on the individual cell type.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ferroptosis is characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of cellular lipid hydroperoxides to lethal levels. This form of regulated cell death has been implicated in the pathology of degenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s and Parkinson’s diseases), cancer, ischemia-reperfusion injury and kidney degeneration (for recent reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doll and Conrad, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stockwell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Galluzzi et al., 2018</xref>]). The term ferroptosis was coined in 2012 to describe a form of death in cancer cells induced by the small molecule erastin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dixon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao and Dixon, 2016</xref>). Consequence is an inhibition of glutathione biosynthesis and thus of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) activity. Of the eight glutathione peroxidases in mammalian cells, GPx4 is the only one that is able to detoxify lipid hydroperoxides even within membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thomas et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seiler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brigelius-Flohé and Maiorino, 2013</xref>). Inactivation of GPx4 by chemicals like for example RSL3 induces ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2014</xref>); and inducible GPx4-deletion in mice revealed that ferroptosis is a pervasive and dynamic form of cell death also in non-transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014</xref>). Heat-stressed plants can also undergo a ferroptosis-like cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Distéfano et al., 2017</xref>). A hallmark of a cell death occurring exclusively by ferroptosis is its suppression by iron chelators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>) or lipophilic antioxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seiler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krainz et al., 2016</xref>) as well as by the depletion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doll et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kagan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>African trypanosomes (<italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> species) are the causative agents of human sleeping sickness and Nagana cattle disease. The obligate free living protozoan parasites multiply as bloodstream (BS) form in the mammalian host and as procyclic (PC) form in the tsetse fly vector. BS <italic>T. brucei</italic> rely exclusively on glycolysis for energy supply and have an only rudimentary mitochondrion, whereas in the PC stage, the single mitochondrion is fully elaborated and the parasites gain ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. Trypanosomes have an unusual thiol redox metabolism that is based on trypanothione [N<sup>1</sup>, N<sup>8</sup>-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine, T(SH)<sub>2</sub>)] and the flavoenzyme trypanothione reductase (TR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krauth-Siegel and Leroux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manta et al., 2018</xref>). The trypanothione system delivers the reducing equivalents for a variety of crucial pathways. Most of the reactions are mediated by tryparedoxin (Tpx), an essential distant member of the thioredoxin protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Comini et al., 2007</xref>). Trypanosomes lack catalase. Hydroperoxides are detoxified by 2-Cys-peroxiredoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tetaud et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Budde et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilkinson et al., 2003</xref>) and non-selenium glutathione peroxidase-type (Px) enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hillebrand et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilkinson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schlecker et al., 2005</xref>). Whereas the peroxiredoxins use hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite as main substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thomson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Trujillo et al., 2004</xref>), the Px-type enzymes preferably detoxify lipid-derived hydroperoxides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diechtierow and Krauth-Siegel, 2011</xref>). With NADPH as ultimate electron donor, the reducing equivalents flow via TR, T(SH)<sub>2</sub>, and tryparedoxin onto the peroxidases which therefore have been named tryparedoxin peroxidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castro and Tomás, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krauth-Siegel and Comini, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krauth-Siegel and Leroux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manta et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Tandemly arranged genes encode three virtually identical Px-type enzymes (Px I, II, and III) in <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hillebrand et al., 2003</xref>). RNA-interference against the Px-type enzymes results in a severe growth defect in both BS and PC <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilkinson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schlecker et al., 2005</xref>). Proliferation of the Px-depleted BS parasites can, however, be restored by supplementing the medium with the vitamin E-analog Trolox [(±)−6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diechtierow and Krauth-Siegel, 2011</xref>). The same is true for cells lacking GPx4, the closest related enzyme in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seiler et al., 2008</xref>). Selective knockout (KO) of the gene encoding the mitochondrial Px III has only a mild and transient effect on the in vitro proliferation of BS <italic>T. brucei</italic> and the mutant parasites are fully infectious in the mouse model. In contrast, cells that lack the cytosolic peroxidases Px I and II die after transfer into Trolox-free medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diechtierow and Krauth-Siegel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hiller et al., 2014</xref>). The lethal phenotype of the BS parasites starts at the lysosome and is closely linked to the endocytosis of iron-loaded host transferrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hiller et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the PC insect stage of <italic>T. brucei,</italic> the presence of either the cytosolic or the mitochondrial peroxidases is sufficient for viability. However, deletion of the complete peroxidase (<italic>px I-III</italic>) locus is lethal. The cell death can be reverted by exogenous Trolox, deferoxamine (Dfx) or MitoQ which suggested an iron-induced lipid peroxidation that may start at the mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaffroth et al., 2016</xref>). Here we show that the death program in the peroxidase-deficient PC <italic>T. brucei</italic> closely resembles ferroptosis in mammalian cells. Integrity and viability of the parasites are preserved by known ferroptosis inhibitors. Strikingly, sensors for mitochondrial oxidants and chelatable iron as well as overexpression of an iron-dependent superoxide dismutase in the mitochondrion attenuate cell lysis. Transmission electron microscopy of the Px I-III knockout (KO) cells reveals mitochondrial matrix condensation and formation of enlarged cristae. Our data show that oxidants and iron in the mitochondrial matrix play a critical role in the process and that ferroptosis is an evolutionary ancient cell death program that is prevented by distant thiol peroxidases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ferroptosis inhibitors protect Px I-III-deficient PC <italic>T. brucei</italic> from cell death</title><p>The Px-type tryparedoxin peroxidases protect African trypanosomes against fatal membrane damages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diechtierow and Krauth-Siegel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hiller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaffroth et al., 2016</xref>). In PC <italic>T. brucei,</italic> deletion of the <italic>px I-III</italic> locus is lethal but the mutant cells proliferate like wildtype parasites if the medium is supplemented with either 100 µM of Trolox or Dfx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaffroth et al., 2016</xref>). The minimum concentration to ensure full viability of the Px I-III KO cells is 50 µM Trolox and 100 µM Dfx, respectively. 10 µM Trolox and 20 µM Dfx alone are not sufficient but in combination, restore cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Evidently, partial complexation of iron by Dfx lowers the concentration of Trolox that is required to protect the cells. The concerted action of Dfx and Trolox is probably related to the fact that free iron ions react with hydroperoxides generating highly deleterious alkoxy radicals. The protective effect of radical trapping agents is usually associated with their reactivity towards peroxy radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shah et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, this reaction would regenerate hydroperoxides and thus, in peroxidase-deficient cells maintain the vicious cycle. As shown recently, Trolox is a more powerful scavenger of alkoxy radicals compared to peroxy radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberto et al., 2013</xref>). The reaction converts alkoxy radicals into the respective alcohols which more likely explains the protecting effect of Trolox and probably other radical trapping agents as well.</p><p>At 1 µM, α-Tocopherol (α-Toc) fully reverts the lethal phenotype of mammalian cells lacking GPx4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seiler et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we asked if the biologically most active form of vitamin E is also more efficient than Trolox in protecting the Px I-III KO cells. Unexpectedly, even 100 µM α-Toc was not sufficient to fully prevent cell lysis. In a second approach, the cells were pre-loaded with 10 µM α-Toc in the presence of 100 µM Trolox and then transferred into Trolox-free medium ± α-Toc. In this case, the Px I-III KO cells even slightly proliferated within the 6 hr observation time, remarkably also in the absence of further exogenous α-Toc. Apparently, uptake of α-Toc by the parasites is slow compared to Trolox, but after proper incorporation, indeed α-Toc is the superior protecting agent. If this is due to the ability of α-Toc to integrate in the phospholipid bilayer of biological membranes is not clear. As reported recently, an analog in which the isoprenoid side chain is truncated to a methyl group proved to be an even better antioxidant than α-Toc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zilka et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The finding that lysis of the Px I-III KO <italic>T. brucei</italic> was prevented by either a lipophilic antioxidant or an iron chelator was reminiscent of ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doll and Conrad, 2017</xref>). Most potent inhibitors of this regulated cell death described so far are ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) and liproxstatin-1 (Lpx-1) which protect mammalian cells at nanomolar concentrations. Indeed also in trypanosomes, 100 nM Fer-1 or 200 nM Lpx-1 completely abolished the lethality of the Px I-III KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Mechanistically, the compounds act as radical-trapping agents which in phospholipid bilayers are significantly more potent antioxidants than α-Toc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zilka et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37503.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ferroptosis inhibitors protect the Px I-III KO cells.</title><p>The mutant cells were either kept in Trolox-supplemented medium or transferred into medium containing 100 µM Dfx, 100 nM ferrostatin-1 or 200 nM liproxstatin-1 or no addition.

This may, at least partially, be due to the fact that the parasite peroxidases have an active site cysteine instead of the selenocysteine in GPx4.

The activity of TR remained constant ruling out any inactivation of the reductase. Next, the effect of RSL3 on the peroxidase cascade was studied. The mixture of NADPH, T(SH)<sub>2</sub>, TR, Tpx and Px was treated with RSL3. After different times, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added and NADPH consumption was followed. Finally, a mixture containing all components except the peroxidase was incubated with RSL3 and the reaction started by adding Px and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In both approaches, RSL3 caused a time-dependent decrease of the activity but the degree of inactivation was identical irrespective of the presence or absence of the peroxidase in the pre-incubation mixture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This strongly suggested that RSL3 is a time-dependent inhibitor of Tpx. The parasite-specific essential oxidoreductase is a distant relative of thioredoxins and glutaredoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Comini et al., 2007</xref>). Tpx transfers reducing equivalents from trypanothione not only to the peroxidases but also methionine-sulfoxide reductase and, probably most importantly, ribonucleotide reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dormeyer et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, inhibition of Tpx likely affects the synthesis of DNA precursors which may be the main reason for the trypanocidal action of RSL3.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The Px I-III-deficient cells encounter mitochondria-specific membrane damages</title><p>The PC Px I-III KO cells were incubated in medium ± Trolox, treated with the mitochondrial membrane potential-sensitive MitoTracker Red or propidium iodide (PI), as indicator of plasma membrane integrity, and subjected to flow cytometry. When kept for 4 hr in the presence of Trolox or directly after transfer into standard medium (0 hr – Trolox), the majority of cells displayed normal forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). After 1 or 2 hr in the absence of a protecting agent, most of the cells had reduced SSC and slightly increased FSC probably due to their reduced motility and altered morphology. From 2 hr onwards, a third population arose that comprised severely damaged or dead cells. In accordance with previous fluorescence microscopy studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaffroth et al., 2016</xref>), already 1 hr after Trolox-withdrawal, the MitoTracker Red signal was reduced and after 2 hr had reached the minimal value. In contrast, the PI fluorescence remained at the basal level. Only when the cells were kept for ≥3 hr without the antioxidant the PI staining strongly increased. Taken together, in the Px I-III-deficient cells, loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential clearly precedes plasma membrane disintegration.</p><p>To elucidate if/how the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential affects the morphology of the organelle, the Px I-III KO cells were studied by immunofluorescence microscopy. After 1 hr in Trolox-free medium, many cells still displayed a proper MitoTracker signal but surprisingly weak immune staining for the mitochondrial matrix 2-Cys-peroxiredoxin (mtTXNPx) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). After 2 hr in the absence of Trolox, the majority of cells had lost the MitoTracker signal and the mtTXNPx antibodies visualized some bright spots in addition to the faint mitochondrial staining. Respective observations were made when antibodies against two other matrix proteins, lipoamide dehydrogenase and acetate-succinate-CoA-transferase, were used (not shown). The reasons for the impaired and later punctuated staining of mitochondrial matrix proteins in the fixed and permeabilized cells are not clear. One may speculate that the antibody penetration was hampered and later, upon progressive condensation of the matrix, the proteins became concentrated within distinct areas. When antibodies against the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) were used, this phenomenon was not observed. Instead, cells that after 1 hr in the absence of Trolox had already lost their MitoTracker Red signal, retained the VDAC staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Even after 2 hr, when the majority of cells no longer showed MitoTracker staining and had an overall swollen cell body, the antibodies against the outer mitochondrial membrane protein still visualized the tubular mitochondrion.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37503.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Px I-III KO cells are affected in mitochondrial matrix – but not outer membrane – immuno-staining.</title><p>The parasites were incubated for 1 or 2 hr in medium ± Trolox, treated with MitoTracker (red) and subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies against (<bold>A</bold>) mtTXNPx (green) or (<bold>B</bold>) VDAC (green).

Cells kept in the presence of Trolox or for only 30 min in Trolox-free medium were indistinguishable from wildtype parasites. These cells are characterized by a highly elongated cell body with densely packed cytoplasm and distinguishable subcellular structures such as the nucleus, mitochondrion, Golgi apparatus, ER, acidocalcisomes, glycosomes and lipid droplets. Staining of the mitochondrion and cristae was comparable or even lighter than that of the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). When the Px I-III KO cells were incubated for ≥1 hr in Trolox-free medium, cells appeared that still had an elongated shape, but, compared to the controls, lighter cytoplasm and a more electron-dense mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both morphological changes appeared to be linked as cells with darkened mitochondrion but normal cytosol or, vice versa, with normal mitochondrion but lighter cytosol were hardly or not detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Other organelles were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The lighter cytosol is probably due to the gradual increase of the cell volume. Indeed, upon prolonged incubation in the absence of the antioxidant, light microscopy of the Px I-III KO cells revealed an increase of swollen cells (not shown). The dark mitochondria contained a growing number of less electron-dense area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These white structures appeared within the organelle but were never found to protrude out into the cytosol. Notably, high magnification revealed three membranes that surrounded the white bleb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, insert). This strongly suggested that the outer mitochondrial membrane remained intact and the blebs were dilated cristae. The phenotype was reminiscent of a condensed matrix and enlarged intermembrane space as observed in isolated mitochondria after transfer into high osmotic medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cortese et al., 1991</xref>).

Cells in Trolox-supplemented medium showed a very small single red dot which co-localized with the DAPI signal for the kinetoplast and thus binding of some probably photo-oxidized sensor to the mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, upper panel).

In agreement with data published for other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2007</xref>), the treatment resulted in a 5-fold fluorescence increase (not shown). The Px I-III KO cells were then treated ± MitoSOX in Trolox-supplemented medium, transferred into medium ± Trolox, incubated for up to 5 hr and treated with DAPI. When kept in the presence of Trolox, the MitoSOX-loaded cells displayed a basal fluorescence comparable to the auto-fluorescence of entirely untreated cells (-Trolox, - MitoSOX). Incubation in Trolox-free medium resulted in increased red fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left). After 3 or 5 hr, the cells displayed a 3-fold higher MitoSOX fluorescence than the Trolox-supplemented control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, after 5 hr in the absence of Trolox but presence of MitoSOX, just a minute fraction of cells showed increased DAPI fluorescence. Only when incubated in the absence of both Trolox and MitoSOX, the cells incorporated DAPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, right). To further evaluate the putative protecting effect of MitoSOX, light scattering of the Px I-III KO cells was followed. As expected, cells kept in the presence of Trolox had normal FSC and SSC (P1 population) whereas those in standard medium showed low FSC and SSC (P3) due to severe damage. When pre-loaded with MitoSOX, indeed, a considerable portion of the Px I-III KO cells in Trolox-free medium remained in the P1 or P2 fractions even after 5 hr of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we wanted to dissect which cell fraction was mainly responsible for the oxidant production. After 5 hr in Trolox-free medium, all three sub-populations had increased MitoSOX fluorescence but only the P3 fraction showed high DAPI fluorescence in accordance with the presence of severely damaged or dead cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The strongest increase in MitoSOX fluorescence was observed for the P2 population which suggests that oxidant production was highest in cells with impaired motility and/or morphological alterations but still intact plasma membrane (DAPI-negative). The data indicate that in the peroxidase-deficient parasites production of soluble oxidants starts within the mitochondrial matrix and then rapidly spreads all over the cell and MitoSOX acted as both oxidant sensor and protecting antioxidant.</p><p>Finally, putative changes in the cellular ATP level were measured. The first analysis was carried out in SDM-79 medium. This could be the reason why lysis of the Px I-III KO cells in the absence of a protecting agent was slightly delayed when compared to studies in MEM-Pros medium. After 2 hr in the absence of Trolox, the ATP level had dropped by more than 50%, but virtually all cells retained normal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). When only highly motile cells were considered, the loss in ATP essentially mirrored the decline in the cell number. Since flagellar movement requires high levels of ATP, motility is expected to be rapidly affected upon ATP depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Langousis and Hill, 2014</xref>). Thus, a substantial fraction of parasites ceased to move but retained a virtually normal shape even though the ATP level was already significantly decreased. On the other hand, a small number of cells appeared to be swollen but still had a beating flagellum. This may be due to the degree to which the ATP level drops in different areas of the highly elongated cell. In an individual parasite, ATP depletion may primarily affect flagellum beating, which originates at its tip, or the ion pumps in the plasma membrane. To rule out any bias upon cell counting, the experiment was repeated using MEM-Pros medium and PI staining to follow cell viability. After 1 hr in Trolox-free medium, the cellular ATP had dropped by 50% but no PI staining was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). After 3 hr, the cells incorporated PI. At this time point the remaining ATP level was diminished to 20% of the control. Taken together, in the absence of a protecting agent, PC Px I-III KO cells rapidly lose ATP. This correlates with an impaired motility and altered morphology of the cells but not an immediate plasma membrane leakage.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37503.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Cellular ATP levels rapidly decrease when Px I-III KO cells are in medium lacking a protecting agent.</title><p>The cells were incubated ± Trolox in (<bold>A</bold>) SDM-79 medium or (<bold>B</bold>) MEM-Pros medium.

The ectopic expression of SODA may lower the concentration of free iron either by diminishing the damage of iron sulfur clusters or because of the overexpression of an iron-containing protein. In any case, the data indicate a crucial role of mitochondrial matrix iron in the cell death of the Px I-III-deficient parasites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Mitochondrial iron plays a crucial role in the cell death of Px I-III-deficient parasites</title><p>The involvement of iron is the primary characteristic of cells undergoing ferroptosis, however the subcellular site of iron that triggers the death program is not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doll and Conrad, 2017</xref>). RPA is a mitochondria-targeted iron sensor. It is composed of a hydrophobic cationic rhodamine B moiety that mediates the uptake into mitochondria and a phenanthroline part that reacts with Fe (II). Quenching of the RPA fluorescence is a selective indicator of mitochondrial chelatable iron in intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Petrat et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rauen et al., 2007</xref>). RPAC has the same fluorophore and linker but lacks iron-chelating capacity and can serve as control. Preliminary experiments revealed that RPAC-treated parasites had a much higher fluorescence than cells loaded with RPA. Therefore, in experiments following the fluorescence, the cells were treated with different concentrations of the fluorophores. Px I-III KO cells were loaded with 150 nM RPA or 10 nM RPAC in PBS, followed by 15 min incubation in Trolox-containing medium to ensure the selective uptake of the sensor into the mitochondrion. Afterwards, the cells were stained with MitoTracker Green and subjected to fluorescence microscopy. The RPA and RPAC fluorescence coincided with the MitoTracker signal confirming a mitochondrial localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Next, the cells were loaded with 150 nM RPA or 10 nM RPAC and then incubated in medium ± Trolox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). When the cells were kept in the presence of Trolox, both sensors displayed clear mitochondrial localization. After 2 hr in the absence of Trolox, the RPA-treated cells were virtually unaffected (not shown) whereas the RPAC-treated sample displayed swollen cells with comparably faint and unspecific fluorescence. When kept for 3 hr in Trolox-free medium, most of the RPA-loaded cells appeared swollen and highly fluorescent while the majority of RPAC-treated parasites were rounded up and had lost their fluorescence. This time-dependent increase of RPA fluorescence and decline of RPAC fluorescence probably reflects leakage of the sensors to the extra-mitochondrial space caused by the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37503.014</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Mitochondrial iron is involved in the death phenotype of Px I-III-deficient cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cells were pre-loaded with 150 nM RPA or 10 nM RPAC in PBS, re-transferred into Trolox-supplemented medium, stained with MitoTracker Green and subjected to life cell imaging.

To analyze this in more detail, the Px I-III KO cells were pre-loaded with different concentrations of RPA, transferred into Trolox-free medium and cell viability was followed for 6 hr by counting living cells. The presence of 150 nM RPA slowed down cell lysis; and 1.5 µM RPA exerted a protecting effect comparable to that observed with 50 µM Dfx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The parasites were then stained with 150 nM RPA or RPAC, incubated for 3 hr ± Trolox and inspected by light scatter analysis. Indeed, after loading with RPA, but not with RPAC, a large portion of cells retained normal FSC and SSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) indicating that chelation of mitochondrial iron by RPA protected the cells.</p><p>Next the cells were loaded with 50 nM RPA or 1 nM RPAC and then incubated for different times in medium ± Trolox and subjected to flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). At this concentration, RPA exerted an only minor protecting effect. When the Px I-III KO cells were kept for ≥2 hr in the absence of protecting agent, the RPA fluorescence strongly increased and the RPAC signal decreased. That both 3 hr + Trolox probes had a higher fluorescence compared to the respective 0 hr – Trolox time points is probably a technical artifact as the 3 hr samples were treated with the dyes immediately after thawing the fluorescent compounds whereas the other samples were loaded later depending on the respective incubation times. Clearly, when comparing the fluorescence of the 3 hr ± Trolox samples, the RPA fluorescence was shifted to higher and the RPAC signal to lower values. Taken together, the fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry data indicate that upon loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, the sensors leak out into the cytosol where the RPA fluorescence is de-quenched due to the lower iron concentration compared to the mitochondrion and that of RPAC is low due to dilution or loss.</p><p>To determine the fluorescence of the maximally quenched and de-quenched probe, respectively, Px I-III KO cells were pre-incubated in medium with Trolox ± Fe(III)/HQ complex, Fer-1 or Dfx, washed and loaded with 50 nM RPA. In the presence of Trolox or Fer-1, the cells displayed the same low fluorescence suggesting that the sensor was largely quenched by the mitochondrial chelatable iron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). When the cells were pre-treated with Fe(III)/HQ, a highly membrane-permeable complex that intracellularly is rapidly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rauen et al., 2007</xref>), the RPA fluorescence was shifted to even lower values which probably represents the maximally quenched signal. When instead of the lipophilic antioxidants, Dfx was used as protecting agent, the RPA fluorescence was strongly increased. This indicates that Dfx causes a decline of the mitochondrial iron available for reaction with RPA. Hoyes and Porter showed a time-dependent strong accumulation of radiolabeled Dfx in the soluble/cytosol fraction of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoyes and Porter, 1993</xref>). This is further supported by our own data that in contrast to free Dfx, starch-coupled Dfx, which is restricted to the endosomal/lysosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang and Lemasters, 2013</xref>), is unable to protect the PC Px I-III KO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaffroth et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we studied if overexpression of mitochondrial SODA affects the mitochondrial iron level. Px I-III KO/SODA-myc cells, that were cultured for 20 hr in the presence or absence of Tet, were loaded with 50 nM RPA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>, the fluorescence of the induced cells was slightly higher when compared to the non-induced cells. The only minor shift is probably due to the fact that the cultures are not homogenous but contain cells that express SODA to various levels (as seen in the immunofluorescence analysis). Even so, the reproducibly observed shift to higher fluorescence suggests that overexpression of the iron-protein in the mitochondrial matrix lowers the iron available for chelation by RPA. Taken together, the data show that mitochondrial iron plays a crucial role in the death program of the peroxidase-deficient cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we report that trypanosomes that lack the lipid hydroperoxide-detoxifying tryparedoxin peroxidases undergo a cell death which is suppressed by iron chelation (Dfx) or lipophilic antioxidants (Trolox, α-Toc, Lpx-1, Fer-1) and involves accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides and thus fulfils all criteria defining ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stockwell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Galluzzi et al., 2018</xref>). The first alterations observed after transfer of Px I-III-deficient PC parasites into medium without protecting agent were mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, drop of cellular ATP and production of mitochondrial oxidants indicating that in these cells the ferroptosis-type death started at the mitochondrion. The implication of mitochondria in ferroptosis is still highly controversial and debated in the mammalian system. Human cancer cells undergoing erastin-induced ferroptosis retain normal ATP levels; and cells that lack a functional electron transport chain or are depleted of mitochondria can experience ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gaschler et al., 2018</xref>). Clearly, an active mitochondrial electron transport chain is not a prerequisite for a cell to undergo ferroptosis. Yet, even in these cells, morphological changes such as the formation of smaller mitochondria with increased membrane density were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>GPx4-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Pfa1 cells) show a breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seiler et al., 2008</xref>), but initial lipid peroxidation occurs outside the mitochondrial matrix and involves a disruption of the outer mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014</xref>). In redox phospholipidomics, GPx4-inactivated Pfa 1 cells revealed increased levels of oxygenated derivatives for all major classes of phospholipids, with the exception of cardiolipin and lipid peroxidation was found to take place predominantly in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kagan et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, serum-induced ferroptosis in MEFs under amino acid starvation causes ATP depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2015</xref>) and erastin-induced ferroptosis in neuronal cells is accompanied by a loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Neitemeier et al., 2017</xref>). Strikingly, GPx4-deficient kidneys display a time-dependent formation of peroxidized cardiolipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014</xref>) and mitochondria-targeted nitroxides are able to inhibit ferroptosis in a variety of tissue types and across multiple growth conditions demonstrating that mitochondrial lipid oxidation is critical in promoting the ferroptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krainz et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The mitochondrial phenotype of the peroxidase-deficient PC <italic>T. brucei</italic> is not a specialized property of these protozoa and their single mitochondrion. In the mammalian bloodstream form – which relies exclusively on glycolysis for energy supply and acquires iron by endocytosis of host transferrin – lack of the cytosolic peroxidases triggers an iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and cell death that originates at the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hiller et al., 2014</xref>). A respective phenotype has been reported for human fibrosarcoma HT 1080 cells or lung cancer Calu-1 cells which are protected from erastin toxicity by inhibitors of lysosomal activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Torii et al., 2016</xref>). Our results strongly suggest that ferroptosis can be initiated at distinct subcellular sites. The role of mitochondria in ferroptosis execution appears to depend on the individual cell type and even the culture conditions such as the use of high glucose medium. A crucial factor could be that rapidly proliferating cells such as many cancer and embryonic cells rely more on glycolysis whereas differentiated cells primarily use oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production. In addition, ferroptosis starting at one cellular compartment may rapidly spread to other sites. Lipid transport proteins disseminate oxidative stress between compartments by preferably trafficking peroxidized lipids to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kriska et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vila et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>After loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, Px I-III-deficient cells still displayed a tubular staining for VDAC, an integral protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane. The most prominent alterations revealed by electron microscopy were a condensation of the mitochondrial matrix and appearance of white blebs which probably reflect enlarged cristae. A rupture of the outer membrane, described for mammalian cells after inactivation of GPx4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doll et al., 2017</xref>), was not observed. In accordance with the situation in ferroptotic mammalian cells, other subcellular structures, and in particular the nucleus, remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stockwell et al., 2017</xref>). In the absence of a protecting agent, the cytosol of the Px I-III-deficient parasites became progressively lighter due to swelling of the cell body which finally resulted in cell death. That mitochondrial membrane peroxidation is an early event in the death of the peroxidase-deficient cells is supported by the finding that MitoPerOx presented a faster oxidation kinetic than the untargeted BODIPY C11 sensor. The inner mitochondrial membrane is particularly susceptible to oxidative damage because of its very large surface area and the proximity to the superoxide-producing respiratory chain and the high content of peroxidation-sensitive unsaturated fatty acids in its phospholipids, notably cardiolipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prime et al., 2012</xref>). A comparative study on different phospholipids revealed cardiolipin with its two phosphate groups and thus most anionic phospholipid, as strongest binder of GPx4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cozza et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>T. brucei</italic> is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, with C22:4–6 and C20:2–5 as the most abundant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Richmond et al., 2010</xref>) and also one of the cardiolipin species identified in isolated mitochondria contains a C22:6 fatty acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guler et al., 2008</xref>). This clearly creates a vulnerability of trypanosomes for membrane oxidation.</p><p>As a characteristic feature of cells prone to ferroptosis, the Px I-III-deficient cells retain full viability in the presence of an iron chelator but the subcellular site of the iron involved remained elusive. PC <italic>T. brucei</italic> lack a transferrin receptor but take up iron from ferric complexes via a 2-step mechanism in which ferric iron is reduced to ferrous iron and is subsequently transported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mach et al., 2013</xref>). The parasites possess Mit1, a homolog of the iron transport protein mitoferrin-1 in the inner mitochondrial membrane of vertebrate cells. Mit1 is essential in PC <italic>T. brucei</italic> and depletion of its mRNA specifically affects the mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mittra et al., 2016</xref>). Here we present several lines of evidence that mitochondrial matrix iron triggers the cell death in the PC Px I-III-deficient trypanosomes. RPA, an iron-chelating sensor that is targeted to the mitochondrion, prolonged viability of the parasites. In Dfx-treated cells the sensor was de-quenched indicating that Dfx lowers the iron available for chelation by RPA. Radiolabeled Dfx was demonstrated not to be retained in the endosomal/lysomal compartments but to accumulate in the soluble/cytosolic fraction of mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoyes and Porter, 1993</xref>). This is supported by our own data. Whereas free and starch-coupled Dfx equally protect BS <italic>T. brucei</italic> which lack the cytosolic peroxidases and show a lysosomal lethal phenotype, only free, but not starch-coupled Dfx, is able to protect the PC peroxidase-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hiller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaffroth et al., 2016</xref>). It is very likely that Dfx exerts its iron chelating and thus protecting effects in the cytosol. This could significantly alter our view on the mechanisms of ferroptosis that are partially based on the assumption that Dfx is membrane-impermeable and restricted to the lysosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao and Dixon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gaschler et al., 2018</xref>). Upon incubation of the Px I-III KO cells without any protecting agent, the RPA fluorescence became de-quenched, most probably because, due to breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential, the sensor leaks out into the cytosol where the chelatable iron concentration is expectedly lower than in the mitochondrial matrix. Further support for the role of matrix iron in the process came from the finding that overexpression of the mitochondrial iron-SODA lowered the Dfx concentration required to protect the peroxidase-deficient cells. Three putative protecting mechanisms could be envisaged: an attenuated generation of free iron from FeS clusters by superoxide, a diminished level of reactive iron by affecting the recycling of Fe<sup>2+</sup> from Fe<sup>3+</sup> and incorporation of iron into the newly expressed mitochondrial protein. Each of these mechanisms would lower the reactive iron level in the mitochondrial matrix. To our knowledge this is the first study in which the subcellular site of iron triggering ferroptosis has been identified.</p><p>Mechanisms that result in increased levels of poly-unsaturated fatty acids or cellular iron as well as those that decrease the capacity of the cell to detoxify peroxidized lipids such as depletion of GSH or GPx4 are able to trigger ferroptosis. Enzymatic effectors for example lipoxygenases can drive ferroptotic oxidation of poly-unsaturated fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seiler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stockwell et al., 2017</xref>). However, the lipoxygenase-mediated lethal effect is observed under GSH depletion conditions but not if ferroptosis is induced by GPx4 inactivation demonstrating that the presence of a lipoxygenase is not essential for the cell death program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). As shown recently for diverse types of lipoxygenase inhibitors, there is a correlation between the anti-ferroptotic activity and reactivity as radical-trapping agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shah et al., 2018</xref>). Clearly, ferroptosis can be triggered spontaneously for instance by a rise in peroxidized lipids. There is a close link between the cellular lipid composition and ferroptosis sensitivity. ACSL4 (acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4) is a critical determinant of the membrane lipid composition and sensitizes cells to ferroptosis whereas cells lacking ACSL4 show marked resistance to ferroptosis induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doll et al., 2017</xref>). The <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome encodes at least five acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSs). One of the four enzymes studied so far (ACS1) accepts arachidonic acid and 22:6 fatty acids as preferred substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jiang and Englund, 2001</xref>) and the so far uncharacterized ACS5 (Tb927.10.3260) has been annotated as putative long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA-ligase. An interesting aspect of future studies will be the putative role of long-chain ASCs in triggering ferroptosis in these protozoa.</p><p>As shown here, ferroptosis is not restricted to mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seiler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stockwell et al., 2017</xref>) and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Distéfano et al., 2017</xref>). The regulated cell death occurs in trypanosomes, one of the earliest branching eukaryotes. The incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into cell membranes was probably highly advantageous during evolution, allowing to modulate the membrane fluidity and functionality of membrane proteins and cells to adapt to different environments and temperatures. This is particularly important for African trypanosomes which during their digenetic life cycle switch between the 37°C bloodstream of a mammalian host and the 27°C midgut of the tsetse fly vector. The presence of poly-unsaturated fatty acids in the membranes, however, requires sophisticated antioxidant systems. In most cells this is achieved by the GSH/GPx4 couple. Trypanosomes developed a defense system that is coupled to the unique trypanothione/tryparedoxin system and replaces the GSH/glutathione peroxidase GPx4 pair.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Tryparedoxin peroxidase-deficiency commits trypanosomes to ferroptosis-type cell death&quot; for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Scott J Dixon (Reviewer #2); Brent R Stockwell (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The overall consensus is that this is a very timely and interesting manuscript study providing first evidence that loss of the whole tandem gene locus of <italic>T. brucei</italic> tryparadoxin peroxidases I-III (Px, the closest orthologues of mammalian glutathione preroxidase-4, GPx4) causes cell death in the procyclic stage. Notably, this form of cell death displays many features of a novel form of iron-dependent cell death, called ferroptosis, first described in the mammalian system by inactivation of the key ferroptosis regulator GPx4. Hence, it seems that ferroptosis can occur in evolutionarily distant organisms, and that ferroptosis inducing agents may be useful therapeutics for targeting these trypanosomes. Since these trypanosomes are the cause of African sleeping sickness and Nagana cattle disease, this could have relevant implications for human and cattle health.</p><p>In general, this is a timely and quite important paper on ferroptosis in a distantly related organism. The manuscript is presented in a straightforward and logical fashion, and the quality of the experiments is sound and robust. Yet the reviewers have raised some concerns about the specificity of certain inhibitors and probes, the potential involvement of mitochondria in the ferroptotic death process and the conceptual advancement beyond on what has been published by the same group earlier (Schaffroth et al., 2016). Nonetheless, the key message conveyed by this study is that ferroptosis is a highly conserved, &quot;ancient&quot; cell death mechanism which besides in humans can also occur in highly specialized unicellular organisms, such as trypanosomes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The implication of mitochondria in ferroptosis is still highly controversial and debated in the mammalian system. Indeed, a fair bit of evidence suggests that mitochondrial ROS and mitochondrial morphological alterations are neither necessary nor sufficient for the execution of ferroptosis in mammalian cells. For example, mammalian cells lacking a functional electron transport chain show no differences in susceptibility to ferroptosis compared with wild-type cells (e.g. see Dixon et al., 2012); oxylipidomic results from the Kagan group indicate that the primary mitochondrial phospholipid – cardiolipin – is not oxidized in mammalian cells undergoing ferroptosis; and recent results from the Stockwell lab show that biochemical elimination of all mitochondria from the mammalian cell do not prevent the execution of ferroptosis, and slow this process only slightly. Therefore, a careful and thorough discussion is needed. For instance, is the crucial function of mitochondria in trypanosome ferroptosis (if so) a conserved phenomenon, or is it a specialized property in trypanosomes? There is a single mitochondrion in the unicellular trypanosome, so mitochondrial function and regulation of metabolism in the organelle are probably highly distinctive/specialized in trypanosomes, compared to that in other organisms.</p><p>2) The authors use a number of redox-sensitive probes and antioxidants which always harbor the risk to lead to over-interpretations (or even wrong conclusions). For instance, MitoSOX is not necessarily specific for mitochondrial ROS and should either be validated as such or used as a general ROS probe. This is particularly relevant as Figure 4 suggests that MitoSOX has a protective effect against cell death, most likely by acting as a radical scavenger itself. Since interpretation of these data are confounded by the fact that MitoSOX itself prevents the cell from dying, would it not make sense to employ a different probe of mitochondrial ROS that might be independent of such confounding effects? Similarly, the mitochondrial specific localization of MitoPerOx needs to be confirmed.</p><p>3) It further seems that there are clear species-specific differences when it comes to the death inducing activity of RSL3. For instance, in Supplementary file 1 the author studied the effect of RSL3 on bloodstream <italic>T. brucei</italic>. The result show that RSL3 can ablate <italic>T. brucei</italic> viability, and RSL3 racemate with Trolox have even lower EC<sub>50</sub> compared to RSL3 racemate alone. Based on these results the authors conclude that the trypanocidal activity of RSL3 is not due to the inhibition of Px I-III. Does it mean that trypanocidal activity of RSL3 is not through ferroptosis? It thus seems that the lack of selenocysteine in Px renders these enzymes clearly more resistant to RSL3 induced inactivation as shown for mammalian GPx4. Testing whether more selective inhibitors such as ferrostatin-1 and liproxstatin-1 can inhibit the trypanocidal activity of RSL3 will be helpful. In an in vitro system the authors actually confirmed that RSL3 is not able to inhibit Px, but they found that RSL3 inhibited Tpx. So the question is, would Tpx deficiency induce ferroptosis in BS <italic>T. brucei</italic>, or is Tpx inhibition the reason behind the trypanocidal activity of RSL3? Some further clarification would certainly help to improve the current manuscript.</p><p>4) The data in Figure 5 on ATP depletion are consistent with the primarily mitochondrial lethal mechanism of action. However, ATP depletion is not a hallmark of ferroptosis in other systems (e.g. see Dixon et al., 2012; Ingold et al., 2018). Along the same line, in Figures 1 and 7 the authors quantified normal vs. dead cells based on certain morphological features (e.g. elongated cells as viable cells, and otherwise dead cells) and ATP-based measurements, which might not be the preferred methods. More direct methods for the measurement of cell death, such as PI (propidium iodide) staining, would be appropriate and should be included.</p><p>5) In Figure 8, why were different amounts of the mitochondrial iron chelator (RPA) and control compound (RPAC) used – 150 nM versus 10 nM? It is suggested they demonstrate a “clear mitochondrial localization&quot;, but no co-localization data is shown with a bona fide mitochondrial marker. Critically, does RPA prevent the decrease in cell density seen with other inhibitors? The descriptions in the text (subsection “Mitochondrial iron plays a crucial role in the cell death of Px I-III-deficient parasites”) focus on changes in probe fluorescence and cell size from FSC measurements, but the key effect on cell viability (e.g. like in Figure 1A) is not directly reported. If the general model is correct, RPA should behave like Dfx or ferrostatin-1 in the viability assay and completely prevent cell death, one would think. In Figure 8A, it is not clear why different numbers of cells and different time points are shown for different treatment conditions. This figure also needs legends to explain what the two different views of the representative images represent.</p><p>6) In Figure 7, the authors claim the specific expression of SODA in the mitochondria, which is hard to judge from the current figures.</p><p>7) There are a number of grammatical issues and inaccuracies that should be checked and addressed through careful reading and editing.</p><p>– What is the evidence that ferroptosis is involved in &quot;carcinogenesis&quot; (e.g. cancer initiation)?</p><p>– &quot;Consequences in the inactivation of GPx4&quot; needs to be re-phrased.</p><p>– Introduction: ferroptosis-like, not ferroptosis-type.</p><p>– Subsection “Px I-III-deficient cells generate mitochondrial oxidants and lose ATP”, first paragraph: as a 'proof' not 'prove' of principle.</p><p>– Discussion, fifth paragraph: &quot;Does not&quot; or should this be &quot;does&quot;, since the paper referenced shows that inhibiting all LOX enzymes has an effect?</p><p>– &quot;increased DAPI fluorescence&quot;: is it DAPI that is being examined here? Or is it PI?</p><p>– The sentence (subsection “The Px I-III-deficient cells encounter mitochondria-specific membrane damages”, end of last paragraph) that the cell death may assume features of necroptosis (Stockwell et al., 2017) is not correct. It is not clear what in the 2017 Stockwell review on ferroptosis this is referring to. Is this supposed to say 'necroptosis' or ferroptosis? In case for necroptosis, can necroptosis inhibitors mitigate Px I-III deficiency-induced cell death?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37503.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The implication of mitochondria in ferroptosis is still highly controversial and debated in the mammalian system.

We also cite the work by Kagan et al. (2017) that cardiolipin peroxidation was not observed in Pfa-1 cells subjected to ferroptosis but also the work of Friedmann-Angeli et al. (2104) who showed that GPx4-deficient kidneys display time-dependent formation of peroxidized cardiolipin. Our data strongly suggest that the individual cell type largely determines the site where ferroptosis starts. This is especially obvious in the trypanosomal system. The mitochondrial phenotype displayed by the peroxidase-deficient procyclic <italic>T. brucei</italic> described here is not a specialized property of trypanosomes and their single mitochondrion. In bloodstream parasites – which also have a single mitochondrion but, in contrast to the insect form, rely exclusively on glycolysis, lack an active mitochondrial respiratory chain and take up iron via receptor-mediated endocytosis of host transferrin – the lysosomal membrane is the primary site affected when the cytosolic peroxidases are missing (Hiller et al. 2016). We restructured and expanded the Discussion and included additional references to clarify these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors use a number of redox-sensitive probes and antioxidants which always harbor the risk to lead to over-interpretations (or even wrong conclusions).

Similarly, the mitochondrial specific localization of MitoPerOx needs to be confirmed.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that the subcellular localization of mitochondria-targeted sensors is not restricted to the mitochondrion. However, e. g. MitoSOX has been shown to be highly enriched in the mitochondrion (Jauslin et al., 2003; Robinson et al., 2008) which suggests that also a putative protecting activity is more pronounced in the mitochondrion. To our knowledge, virtually all commercially available small molecule sensors for reactive oxygen species irreversibly react with the metabolite(s) they sense. This should lower the effective concentration of the reactive species and thus lead to a partial protection. We are currently cloning vectors to express roGFP-based sensors in the cytosol and mitochondrion of the parasites to overcome this problem. We studied MitoSOX and MitoPerOx-treated parasites by life cell imaging with MitoTracker Green as mitochondrial marker and Hoechst 33342 to visualize nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. As long as the cells retained their normal morphology, MitoSOX visualized a single small dot which coincided with the Hoechst signal for the kinetoplast and thus binding of the sensor to the mitochondrial DNA. A nuclear DNA staining was not observed (new Figure 4A). MitoPerOx revealed a perfect overlay with MitoTracker Green (new Figure 6A). The data strongly suggest that both sensors are highly enriched in the mitochondrion. The text has been modified accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It further seems that there are clear species-specific differences when it comes to the death inducing activity of RSL3. For instance, in Supplementary file 1 the author studied the effect of RSL3 on bloodstream T. brucei. The result show that RSL3 can ablate T. brucei viability, and RSL3 racemate with Trolox have even lower EC<sub>50</sub> compared to RSL3 racemate alone. Based on these results the authors conclude that the trypanocidal activity of RSL3 is not due to the inhibition of Px I-III. Does it mean that trypanocidal activity of RSL3 is not through ferroptosis? It thus seems that the lack of selenocysteine in Px renders these enzymes clearly more resistant to RSL3 induced inactivation as shown for mammalian GPx4. Testing whether more selective inhibitors such as ferrostatin-1 and liproxstatin-1 can inhibit the trypanocidal activity of RSL3 will be helpful. In an in vitro system the authors actually confirmed that RSL3 is not able to inhibit Px, but they found that RSL3 inhibited Tpx. So the question is, would Tpx deficiency induce ferroptosis in BS T. brucei, or is Tpx inhibition the reason behind the trypanocidal activity of RSL3? Some further clarification would certainly help to improve the current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data, indeed, indicate that RSL3 lethality of the parasites is not through ferroptosis as the trypanocidal activity of RSL3 was unaffected in the presence of Trolox, and, as shown in the revised Supplementary file 1, also of Fer-1 and Lpx-1. All three radical-trapping antioxidants failed to prevent the cytotoxicity of RSL3 strongly suggesting that the peroxidases are not the targets. This lack of sensitivity may at least partially be explained by the fact that the parasite enzymes have an active site cysteine. As shown by Ingold et al. (2018), replacement of the selenocysteine-containing GPx4 by a cysteine mutant renders mammalian cells resistant towards RSL3. Our in vitro assays showed that RSL3 inhibits Tpx. This distant relative of thioredoxins and glutaredoxins is the general and essential oxidoreductase that transfers reducing equivalents from trypanothione not only to the peroxidases but also methionine-sulfoxide reductase and, probably most importantly, ribonucleotide reductase. Thus, inhibition of Tpx should affect the synthesis of DNA precursors which could be the main reason for the trypanocidal action of RSL3. We included the new data in Supplementary file 1 and modified the text to improve and clarify this section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The data in Figure 5 on ATP depletion are consistent with the primarily mitochondrial lethal mechanism of action.

We now studied the ATP levels also in comparison to PI staining. The data corroborated that ATP depletion precedes damage of the cell membrane (new Figure 5B). To corroborate the cell counting data for the SODA-overexpressing cells we also studied the cells by flow cytometry after PI treatment. The results confirmed that overexpression of SODA or a low concentration of Dfx slows down cell lysis and that in combination the Px I-III KO cells are more efficiently protected. In the absence or presence of Dfx, overexpression of SODA improved the cell viability (new Figure 7D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 8, why were different amounts of the mitochondrial iron chelator (RPA) and control compound (RPAC) used – 150 nM versus 10 nM?

In the fluorescence microscopy, at the shortest exposure time, the signal for 150 nM RPAC was already oversaturated. To follow a putative increase or quenching of the fluorescence by flow cytometry, again different concentrations of RPA and RPAC had to be applied. To show that RPA, but not RPAC, had a protecting effect we used the compounds at an equal concentration of 150 nM because only light scattering of the cells was studied. We modified the text to make this point clearer. We co-stained the RPA- and RPAC-treated cells with MitoTracker Green which confirmed the mitochondrial localization of the compounds (new Figure 8A). We also followed the viability of the peroxidase-deficient cells after treating them with RPA and show that pre-loading with RPA slowed down cell lysis (new Figure 8C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 7, the authors claim the specific expression of SODA in the mitochondria, which is hard to judge from the current figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We improved the IF pictures to make the co-localization of SODA and MitoTracker and the lack of overlay with a cytosolic marker protein clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There are a number of grammatical issues and inaccuracies that should be checked and addressed through careful reading and editing.</p><p>– What is the evidence that ferroptosis is involved in &quot;carcinogenesis&quot; (e.g. cancer initiation)?</p></disp-quote><p>The expression “carcinogenesis” was used by Stockwell et al.
