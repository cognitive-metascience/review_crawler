Hundreds of lineages across animal phylogeny have secondarily lost larval forms, instead producing offspring that directly develop into adult form without a distinct larval ecological niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Raff, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Strathmann, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thorson, 1950</xref>). Indirect development in the sea is typically planktotrophic: females produce large numbers of small offspring that require exogenous planktonic food to develop before metamorphosing into benthic juveniles. Direct development is typically lecithotrophic: females produce a smaller number of larger eggs, each developing into a juvenile without the need for larval feeding, provisioned by yolk. Evolutionary theory suggests that these alternative developmental strategies represent stable alternative fitness peaks, while intermediate states are disfavored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christiansen and Fenchel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Havenhand, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Strathmann, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vance, 1973</xref>). Transitions from planktotrophy to lecithotrophy thus represent radical and coordinated transformations of life-history, fecundity, ecology, dispersal, and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duda and Palumbi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jeffery and Emlet, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McEdward and Miner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Raff, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Romiguier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wray, 1995</xref>). Here we dissect this transition in the polychaete annelid <italic>Streblospio benedicti</italic>, a genetically tractable species that harbors both states as heritable variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Levin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levin et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zakas and Rockman, 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>Streblospio benedicti</italic> is a common and widespread benthic polychaete found in estuaries throughout North America. Females brood fertilized embryos in dorsal brood pouches and release larvae into the water column. Larvae remain pelagic until they are competent to metamorphose and return to the benthos. Females fall into two classes exhibiting classic life-history trade-offs: planktotrophic mothers produce small (~100 um) eggs that develop into obligately feeding larvae that spend weeks in the plankton. These larvae grow larva-specific swimming chaetae that are thought to deter predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blake, 1969</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Lecithotrophic mothers produce large (~200 um) eggs that develop into larvae that do not require exogenous food and quickly leave the water column as benthic juveniles. These larvae lack swimming chaetae and a second type of larva-specific morphological structure, anal cirri containing bacillary cells, which are distinctive cells that contain rhabdites of unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gibson et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). There are also differences during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCain, 2008</xref>) and organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gibson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pernet and McHugh, 2010</xref>), where accelerated development of juvenile features and truncated development of larval features occurs in lecithotrophs. Despite these developmental and larval differences, adults are indistinguishable at the level of gross morphology. There are no known behavioral differences between the adults, though it is possible that preferences in mating or habitat choice occur. Unlike examples of polyphenism, environmental factors do not substantially alter egg size or subsequent offspring type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levin and Bridges, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Levin and Creed, 1986</xref>). Natural populations consist of only one of the two phenotypic extremes, often occurring in close geographic proximity but rarely directly overlapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Levin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schulze et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zakas and Wares, 2012</xref>), and larval mode in the population does not correlate with any known environmental gradient. Despite the persistence of these two dramatically different strategies in nature, they can be crossed in the lab producing an array of morphological and developmental intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levin et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zakas and Rockman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Stable populations of different larval modes suggest that migration-selection balance on small ecological scales is acting to maintain both types in the larger population.</p><p>We genetically dissected developmental mode by crossing a lecithotrophic male from Long Beach, California, and a planktotrophic female from Bayonne, New Jersey. Studies of these populations have found them to be homogeneous in larval mode but little differentiated from one another across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rockman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zakas and Rockman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zakas and Rockman, 2015</xref>), consistent with ongoing gene flow between larval modes in their native East Coast range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zakas and Wares, 2012</xref>). West Coast populations, including Long Beach, are exclusively lecithotrophic and result from a 20<sup>th</sup> century introduction from an East Coast source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zakas and Wares, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Genetic models for evolutionary transitions from planktotrophy to lecithotrophy require traversal of intermediate states in multivariate phenotype space, which are predicted to be suboptimal with respect to fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vance, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Whitlock et al., 1995</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The simplest scenario is that co-adapted trait combinations are affected by shared alleles, either by pleiotropy (for example, ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hall et al., 2006</xref>]) or tight linkage (e.g., a supergene with suppressed recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Joron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yeaman, 2013</xref>]). The necessity to coordinate maternal traits (larval size) with zygotic traits (larval morphology) adds additional constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kirkpatrick and Lande, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wade, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wolf and Brodie, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wolf and Wade, 2016</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows that alternative paths from planktotrophy to lecithotrophy make different predictions about the correlations among genetic effects. In particular, the presence of facultative planktotrophy (i.e., larvae can feed but do not require food) in lecithotrophic <italic>S. benedicti</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen and Pernet, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pernet and McArthur, 2006</xref>) provides one suggestion that evolution could traverse the larval-size axis, from small to large, prior to traversing the larval morphology axis, from âcomplexâ feeding larvae to âsimpleâ non-feeding larvae with accelerated development of juvenile features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wray, 1996</xref>). Nevertheless, in natural populations we observe only the two extremes: large, âsimpleâ lecithotrophs, and small, âcomplexâ planktotrophs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37143.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>S. benedicti</italic> larval morphology.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild populations occupy two extremes of larval size and form: planktotrophic larvae (bottom) carry larva-specific chaetae and anal cirri, while lecithotrophic larvae (top) lack these traits and are capable of adopting a benthic habit without feeding.

As expected for a maternal trait, G<sub>2</sub> larval size showed no linkage to G<sub>2</sub> genotype. Every other phenotype implicated a small number of large-effect loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, the loci are almost entirely independent: the maternal-effect loci shaping G<sub>3</sub> larval size are unlinked to the zygotic-effect loci shaping G<sub>2</sub> larval morphology. The morphology loci are also largely independent, with a major-effect anal cirri locus on LG5 and loci uniquely affecting number and length of swimming chaetae on LG8 and LG9. The two chaetal traits also share a common locus on LG3. Each QTL has a large effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and explains a large proportion of trait variance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), and the effects are largely additive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The two exceptions to additivity are in chaetae length at the LG3 locus (the chaetae-shortening allele is dominant) and larval size, where there is significant epistasis between the two maternal-effect loci on LG6 and LG7.

This raises the possibility that maternal effects can allow for the accumulation of standing genetic variation in a population by masking unfit genotypic combinations from strong selection.

This suggests the lecithotrophic larval strategy evolved through the stepwise accumulation of multiple genetic changes throughout the genome. Maternally-determined larval size has an independent genetic basis from other traits that are perfectly correlated in natural populations. While the most direct evolutionary path from plantkotrophy to lecithotrophy involves pleiotropic mutations that move populations diagonally across the size/shape space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we observe that mutational effects are at right angles to one another. The lack of strong correlated effects among alleles is compatible with the evolution of lecithotrophy via a facultatively planktotrophic intermediateÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wray, 1996</xref>); that is, large larval size may have evolved prior to the loss of larval morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Under a broad range of assumptions, theory predicts that local adaptation in the face of ongoing gene flow should ultimately lead the causal alleles to converge at one or a few genomic loci, as opposed to an accumulation of genetic differences throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kirkpatrick and Barton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yeaman and Whitlock, 2011</xref>), particularly in the context of maternal-by-zygotic epistasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wade, 1998</xref>). Our genetic results are therefore consistent with one component of the theoretical expectations: individual traits are influenced by one or two genomic regions of large-effect, which could in turn represent clusters of underlying genes. However, the overall modularity of these phenotypes is unexpected as the loci affect discrete traits rather than the larval syndrome as a whole. Loci affecting different traits are located on different chromosomes, indicating that correlated life-history phenotypes are genetically separable. We identified six chromosomes with large effects for four traits, implying that <italic>S. benedicti</italic> populations can segregate 3<sup>6</sup> = 729 possible genotypic combinations, most of which would produce combinations of intermediate phenotypes that are expected to be maladaptive.</p><p>Finally, we found that the evolutionary transition to lecithotrophic development requires the interaction of two genotypes, the mother and offspring. Because of this dual control of larval phenotype, the likely fitness of a zygotic allele depends on the probability it occurs in a favorable maternal genetic background. This genetic architecture provides an explanation for the phenotypic homogeneity of natural populations. The independent genetic basis of maternal and zygotic genetic effects on development shapes the accumulation of variation necessary for selection and local adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cross design</title><p>We crossed a single outbred Bayonne planktotrophic female to a Long Beach lecithotrophic male to generate F<sub>1</sub>s.

For non-sex-linked contigs that contain multiple SNPs, we manually recoded each contig, when possible, to be a single intercross marker, with inferred P<sub>0</sub> genotypes AA x BB. These inferences are straightforward given multiple SNPs per contig and our data from a panel of F<sub>1</sub>s and four half-sib G<sub>2</sub> families. In some cases, individual G<sub>2</sub> families segregated haplotypes that were not all distinguishable. For example, if P<sub>0</sub> haplotypes were AB x AC, segregation in G<sub>2</sub> families descended from AC x BC F<sub>1</sub> parents is fully resolvable, but segregation from AA x BC F<sub>1</sub> parents is not, because the P<sub>0</sub> origin of A haplotypes in the G<sub>2</sub> is ambiguous. In such cases, we assigned partial genotypes in the relevant families (i.e., we treated them as dominant rather than codominant markers). However, we only recoded multi-SNP contigs for which segregation in at least one G<sub>2</sub> family was fully resolvable. Note that the assignment of genotypes to the maternal vs. paternal P<sub>0</sub> is arbitrary because we lack genotypes for those individuals. To call a marker genotype for an individual worm, we required that all SNPs in the contig marker had to have genotype calls that conform to an intact P<sub>0</sub> haplotype; this adds a layer of stringency in excluding genotypes that contain any erroneous SNP calls. Most multi-SNP contigs contain two or three SNPs, but one contained 16 SNPs spread across multiple sequencing reads.

Inclusion of non-intercross markers</title><p>Returning to the original 1,389-SNP dataset, we replaced the intercross marker genotypes with those from step 1 (i.e., replacing multi-SNP contig SNPs with their inferred intercross genotypes, converting 420 genotypes to missing data, and removing the four individuals inferred to have high genotype error rates). For the remaining non-intercross SNPs, we imputed the genotypes of the five F<sub>1</sub> parents by likelihood, as described, and we used lepmap2Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rastas et al., 2015</xref>) (v.0.2, downloaded March 5, 2017) to assign markers to linkage groups. The input dataset includes 288 individuals (47 F<sub>1</sub>s and 241 G<sub>2</sub>s in four families) and 1,111 markers. Processing steps included <italic>ParentCallGrandparents</italic> with XLimitÂ =Â 8 and ZLimitÂ =Â 8, <italic>Filtering</italic> with epsilonÂ =Â 0.02 and dataToleranceÂ =Â 0.0001, <italic>SeparateChromosomes</italic> with lodLimitÂ =Â 15, and <italic>JoinSingles</italic> with lodLimitÂ =Â 10 and lodDifferenceÂ =Â 5. This analysis assigned 676 markers to 10 autosomes and 97 markers to two sex-linked chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). An additional 25 markers were assigned to 10 small linkage groups (one sex-linked) with two to four markers each, and 313 markers were not assigned to linkage groups. The ten major autosomal linkage groups mapped uniquely to the ten identified using the intercross markers above at step 1.</p><p>To order the autosomal markers, we used <italic>OrderMarkers2</italic> in lepmap3Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rastas, 2017</xref>) (v.0.1, downloaded March 5, 2017). For each linkage group, we ran 100 iterations with randomPhaseÂ =Â 0 and 100 iterations with randomPhaseÂ =Â 1, and we then repeatedly ran <italic>OrderMarkers2</italic> with the evaluateOrder option on the highest likelihood results for each approach to search for higher likelihood reconstructions. We then selected the result with the highest likelihood overall and retained the reconstructed genotypes (outputPhasedDataÂ =Â 1) for that run.</p><p>We next converted these reconstructed genotypes to conventional intercross genotypes by mapping the intercross-marker genotypes onto them and retaining the phase with the highest likelihood. We renamed the linkage groups to sort them by genetic map length and the result is Sb676. The intercross map from step 1, with linkage groups named accordingly, is Sb271.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Step 3. Sex-linked markers</title><p>For each of the 1,389 SNPs in the original dataset, we estimated the likelihood of each possible autosomal or sex-linked segregation pattern. We identified 32 SNPs with clean X-linked segregation (AAxBY or BBxAY) and none with Z-linkage. The X-linked SNPs mapped to one major and one minor sex-linked linkage group in the lepmap analysis at step two above. The other major lepmap-defined sex-linked linkage group contained only SNPs that segregate as fixed differences between X and Y chromosomes (i.e., the maximum likelihood segregation patterns are <sup>X</sup>A<sup>X</sup>A x <sup>X</sup>A<sup>Y</sup>B and <sup>X</sup>B<sup>X</sup>B x <sup>X</sup>B<sup>Y</sup>A). These are uninformative for the genetic map.</p><p>We next examined the multi-SNP contigs that contain any SNP whose sex-linkage p-value is less than 0.01, and where possible we recoded these SNPs as single multi-SNP markers, converting impossible genotypes to missing data, as done for autosomal markers in step 1. This resulted in a total of 26 markers (10 multi-SNP and 16 single-SNP). These markers were then ordered in Rqtl as in step 1. A group of three markers, which form a separate, minor sex-linked linkage group in our lepmap analysis at step 2, here form a distantly linked piece of the X chromosome (min.lodÂ =Â 6, max.rfÂ =Â 0.33). The final map, incorporating 702 markers, is Sb702.</p><p>The maps produced at each of the three steps are provided as Rqtl cross objects in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Step 4. Inference of founder haplotypes</title><p>As noted above, we were unable to recover genotypes from the founding parents of the cross or from the F<sub>1</sub> worms that contributed to the G<sub>2</sub> generation, and we therefore lack information about which autosomal alleles derive from which founder. To assign parental origins to genotypes, we tested the two possible orientations using population-genomic data. We showed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zakas and Rockman, 2015</xref>) that slight allele frequency differentiation between Long Beach and Bayonne populations is sufficient for population assignment. To assign the haplotypes from our cross to these populations, we generated Pool-seq libraries of each population in duplicate by pooling DNA of 25 adult females for each population, making four pool-seq libraries in total. The worms contributing to these pools were collected in 2018 from the same Long Beach and Bayonne localities as our cross founders. DNA was extracted with the Qiagen DNeasy kit and libraries were constructed with a Nextera DNA kit. These four libraries were sequenced on one lane of an Illumina NextSeq flow cell in High-Output mode. Reads were mapped to the draft reference genome, which was constructed from Bayonne individuals, using BWA and samtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>) and variants were called using <italic>GATK</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>) with a low quality-filtering threshold of QDÂ &lt;1.0 and MQÂ &lt;30.0.</p><p>Using this population sequence data, we calculated the likelihoods for the two possible genotype assignments for each autosome. To calculate likelihoods, we considered only SNPs that we inferred to be homozygous for alternate alleles in the founders of our cross (Step 1 above). Population allele frequencies were estimated from read counts in the pooled population sequence data. To account for the presence of zero counts of reads of some alleles in either population, which can be due to true absence or to low read coverage, we added one read to every allele count and then used these modified count proportions as population frequency estimates. In total, we used data from 110 SNPs (4 to 27 per chromosome).</p><p>For the hypothesis that founder genotype one derives from Bayonne and founder genotype two from Long Beach, we calculate the likelihood as L(H<sub>1</sub>):</p><p>P(genotype 1 | Bayonne allele frequencies) * P(genotype 2 | Long Beach allele frequencies),</p><p>assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within each population. We then calculated the likelihood of the alternative assignment (H<sub>2</sub>). We report the log<sub>10</sub> likelihood ratio as a statistic.</p><p>For every chromosome, one genotype assignment was favored over the alternative assignment by a factor ofÂ &gt;300 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). Under the favored orientations, QTL effects are all in the expected directions (for example, large egg and short chaetae alleles derive from the lecithotrophic Long Beach founder), and these polarities are those reported in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> genetic maps and analyzed throughout the paper.</p><table-wrap id="table4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37143.010</object-id><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>Log10 likelihood ratio in favor of founder genotype assignments.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Autosome</th><th valign="top">Log<sub>10</sub> (L(H<sub>1</sub>)/L(H<sub>2</sub>))</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">9.4</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">23.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">3</td><td valign="top">2.6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">4</td><td valign="top">13.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5</td><td valign="top">9.2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">22.9</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">7</td><td valign="top">11.0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">8</td><td valign="top">10.8</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">26.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">10</td><td valign="top">4.4</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>QTL Mapping</title><p>Annotated R scripts that reproduce all linkage mapping and phenotypic analyses in the paper are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code file 1</xref>.</p><p>We performed interval mapping in Rqtl to identify QTL. To accommodate the family structure in the data, we performed genome scans separately in each G<sub>2</sub> family and summed the lod scores. To determine genome-wide significance thresholds, we generated a null distribution of maximum lod scores by applying the same structured genome scans to 1000 datasets in which phenotypes have been permuted among individuals within (but not among) G<sub>2</sub> families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Churchill and Doerge, 2008</xref>). We used a per-trait threshold of p=0.05. All traits were mapped assuming a normal model, except for the presence or absence of anal cirri, for which we used a binary (logistic) model.</p><p>Our linkage mapping approach tests for loci that differ between the founding Long Beach and Bayonne parents of the cross, and QTL that are heterozygous in the P<sub>0</sub> founders may be overlooked. Such loci should manifest as genetic differences among the four G<sub>2</sub> families. We tested for family effects in each trait, and found no evidence for variation among the four G<sub>2</sub> families for number of chaetae (p=0.06), presence of anal cirri (p=0.70), or G<sub>3</sub> offspring size (p=0.80). We identified family effects for the length of the larval chaetae (p=0.0003) and G<sub>2</sub> size (p=10<sup>â7</sup>).</p><p>The observed differences among G<sub>2</sub> families may be due to one or more of (1) environmental maternal effects, including familial experimental counfounders such as the exact age of full-sib larvae at the time they were measured; (2) maternal or zygotic genetic effects that segregate among the F<sub>2</sub> families due to heterozygosity in the P<sub>0</sub> founders; and (3) genetic effects that differ among F<sub>2</sub> families due to differential segregation distortion or chance allele frequency variation but not due to heterozygosity in the P<sub>0</sub>s. Because G<sub>2</sub> size is a maternal-effect trait, the family effect for this phenotype can only be due to environmental maternal effects among the F<sub>1</sub> mothers or segregating maternal effect factors that were heterozygous in the P<sub>0</sub>s. However, in the latter case, we expect the family effect to recur as variation among the G<sub>2</sub> families in G<sub>3</sub> offspring size. We observe no such effect, implying that the G<sub>2</sub> families do not differ in their genotype distributions at maternal-effect offspring-size loci. For larval chaetae length, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the variation among G<sub>2</sub> families is due to QTL that were heterozygous in P<sub>0</sub>s. In a model including the significant QTL (detailed below), G<sub>2</sub> family explains 5.7% of total variance in the larval chaetae length phenotype, while the two significant QTL explain 47.0%.</p><p>To model the genetics of each trait using the Rqtl <italic>fitqtl</italic> function, we tested for pairwise interactions between detected QTL across linkage groups and for effects of G<sub>2</sub> family. In each case we compared a model of additive and dominant within-locus effects to models that incorporated the additional terms, and we used likelihood ratio tests to determine the statistical significance of improvements in model fit. We estimate the effect size for QTL using the best-fitting model, as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code file 1</xref>. For chaetae number and presence of anal cirri, the prefered model includes QTL effects only. For chaetae length, the model includes an effect of G<sub>2</sub> family. For G<sub>3</sub> offspring area, the model includes an interaction between two QTL. Effect estimates are reported below in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>.</p><p>We find that chaetae number and length are correlated, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zakas and Rockman (2014)</xref>, (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>Â =Â 0.22, p&lt;0.001).

The approach searches for regions of the genome with significant effects in the three-dimensional space defined by variation in these three traits.

The fixed effects are the intercept, G<sub>2</sub> family identity, and two vectors coding the additive and dominance variables for a single genetic marker. At each marker, we fit this model and compared it to a model with intercept and G<sub>2</sub> family as the only fixed effects, calculating a p-value from the Pillai-Bartlett statistic.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Magnus Nordborg as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor.

Rather than &quot;super-genes&quot; determining life-history strategy, separate genetic loci with different modes of inheritance were found to influence egg size and larval morphology.</p><p>This is a substantial and well-written contribution addressing a biological question of broad interest.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There were two major issues that could lead to over-interpretation of the results. First, fitness effects are implied but not measured, and this is not always clear from the writing. A hypothetical fitness landscape is shown in Figure 1B, and it is clearly stated in the figure legend that this landscape is hypothetical. However, at several other points in the text, sentences are worded in a way that implies that fitness may have actually been measured, rather than inferred based on direction of phenotypic effects. This could be fixed by more cautious phrasing. For example:</p><p>In Abstract, original text: &quot;The fitness of zygotic alleles depends upon their maternal background, creating a positive frequency-dependence that may homogenize local populations.&quot;</p><p>More conservative wording: &quot;The likely fitness effects of zygotic alleles depends upon their maternal background, creating a positive frequency-dependence that may homogenize local populations.&quot;</p><p>Even more conservative wording: &quot;The phenotypic effects of zygotic alleles on a hypothetical fitness landscape depends upon their maternal background, creating a positive frequency-dependence that may homogenize local populations.&quot;</p><p>In the Discussion, original text: &quot;We identified six chromosomes with large effects for four traits, implying that <italic>S. benedicti</italic> populations can segregate 729 possible genotypic combinations, most of which are maladaptive.&quot;</p><p>More conservative wording: &quot;We identified six chromosomes with large effects for four traits, implying that <italic>S. benedicti</italic> populations can segregate 729 possible genotypic combinations, most of which would produce combinations of intermediate phenotypes that are likely to be maladaptive.&quot;</p><p>In the Discussion, original text: &quot;Finally, we found that the evolutionary transition to lecithotropic development requires the interaction of two genotypes, the mother and offspring. The fitness of a zygotic allele depends on the probability it occurs in a favorable maternal genetic background&quot;</p><p>More conservative: &quot;Finally, we found that the evolutionary transition to lecithotropic development requires the interaction of two genotypes, the mother and offspring. Because of this dual control of larval phenotype, the likely fitness effects of a zygotic allele depends on whether it occurs in a favorable maternal genetic background.&quot; etc.</p><p>The second point is more difficult to address. Due to failed genotyping, the genotypes of the P0 grandparents of the existing cross, or the F1 parents used to make F2s, are not known. Thus the direction of the allelic effects in the cross is actually not known, although the paper is generally written as if they went in the expected direction (again, the information is in the paper, but it is very easy to miss on a first reading). This is not a trivial point, and it affects the conclusions of the paper. For example, the difficulty contrasting alleles would have invading different genetic backgrounds is less of an issue if existing planktotrophic and lecithotropic populations already harbor lots of alleles with non-concordant phenotypic effects.</p><p>This issue could be addressed by carrying out additional genotyping to try to confirm whether the planktotrophic and lecithotropic alleles segregating in the cross do in fact come from either the planktotropic and lecithotropic grand parental populations. Note that the additional genotype calls would only be in the regions harboring key QTLs, rather than on a whole genome basis. With a focused genotyping effort, it may be possible to determine these key genotypes on limited or poor quality material still available from the original grandparents.

Unfortunately, we were not able to add genotypes from the original parents due to the limited, degraded DNA. We instead used a population genetic approach to infer the source population for the alternative haplotypes in our genetic map. We collected 25 individuals from each population and used Pool-seq methods to estimate allele frequencies in each. We then calculated the likelihood of alternative population assignments for each founder chromosome. We find strong support from the allele frequencies for a specific population assignment for each founder haplotype, and the inferred assignments are consistent with the directional effects described in our manuscript. This has important implications for interpretation because it demonstrated that the QTL effects are acting in the direction we expected; they are complementary not contrasting effects. We have added the details of our analysis to the mapping part of the Materials and methods section and we provide the underlying data and analysis scripts as part of Supplementary file 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Less substantially, please clarify in what sense Figure 4 shows maternal &quot;masking&quot;, and in general improve description, i.e. clearly label what exactly is the offspring of one cross, how many individuals were scored for each chaetae number.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the figure legend to clarify the cross distributions. The offspring in these 30 crosses have a different maternal background from the rest of our dataset (which have F<sub>1</sub> mothers), but we see the same pattern where the number of chaetae depends on the zygotic genotype at the two QTL. At the same time, we would predict that because of the maternal planktotrophic contribution that all of these offspring would develop some chaetae, but some that have lecithotrophic paternal alleles do not, demonstrating the incomplete zygotic penetrance of this trait.</p></body></sub-article></article>
