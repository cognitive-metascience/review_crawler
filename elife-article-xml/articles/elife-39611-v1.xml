Our X-ray structures confirm that TnpA is a member of the serine recombinase (SR) family, but the chemically-inactive quaternary structure of the dimer, along with the N-terminal location of the DNA binding domain, are different from other SRs. TnpA dimers from IS<italic>1535</italic> cooperatively associate with multiple subterminal repeats, which together with additional nonspecific binding, form a nucleoprotein filament on one transposon end that efficiently captures a second unbound end to generate the paired-end complex (PEC). Formation of the PEC does not require a change in the dimeric structure of the catalytic domain, but remodeling of the C-terminal α-helical region is involved. We posit that the PEC recruits a chemically-active conformer of TnpA to the transposon end to initiate DNA chemistry.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA transposition</kwd><kwd>serine recombinase</kwd><kwd>nucleoprotein complex</kwd><kwd>Helicobacter pylori</kwd><kwd>Mycobacteria tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>Sulfolobus islandicus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM038509</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Wenyang</given-names></name><name><surname>Mandali</surname><given-names>Sridhar</given-names></name><name><surname>Hancock</surname><given-names>Stephen P</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Pramod</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Reid C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic, structural, and biochemical analyses of IS607-family transposons shows that the DNA translocation reaction proceeds very differently from other reactions promoted by serine recombinases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although sometimes thought of as DNA parasites, transposable elements (TE) are widely recognized as playing prominent roles in the evolution of genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biémont, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brunet and Doolittle, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Volff, 2006</xref>). TE-derived sequences make up almost half of the human genome, and in some organisms like Maize, make up the vast majority of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Springer et al., 2009</xref>). TEs can be usurped or ‘domesticated’ to perform critical functions, such as promoting DNA rearrangements essential for immunity in mammals or in the development of the micronucleus in ciliated protozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baudry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kapitonov and Jurka, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nowacki et al., 2009</xref>). In bacteria, mobile DNA elements promote horizontal spread of pathogenicity determinants and antibiotic resistance genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frost et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hooper et al., 2009</xref>). TEs are also exploited for genome engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ivics and Izsvák, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woodard and Wilson, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Transposases have been reported to be the most frequently occurring functional group of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aziz et al., 2010</xref>). Among the four major classes of DNA transposases, the large and diverse DDE/D family that contain an RNase H fold and typically transpose through a cut-and-paste mechanism has been the most intensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hickman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yuan and Wessler, 2011</xref>). Recently, the mechanism of transposition by HUH-family elements, which undergo a rolling circle replicative mechanism of DNA transfer, has been elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2015</xref>). The tyrosine- and serine-family of recombinases, which have been extensively studied in the context of site-specific recombination reactions, also promote DNA transposition. Respectively, these enzymes splice DNA through a sequential pair of single-strand exchanges or through double strand breaks, generating a transient covalent linkage between the cleaved DNA end and a tyrosine or serine on the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rubio-Cosials et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stark, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wood and Gardner, 2015</xref>). In this study, we investigate the mechanism by which the IS<italic>607</italic>-family of serine recombinases transpose DNA. As described below, IS<italic>607</italic>-family TEs have a number of properties that are unusual among TEs, and the serine transposase structure has features unlike other serine recombinases.</p><p>Serine recombinases (SRs) have been broadly classified into three subfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith and Thorpe, 2002</xref>). The small SRs (smSR) typically catalyze highly regulated recombination reactions between specific DNA sites that are usually on the same DNA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rice, 2015</xref>). The serine integrase or large SR (LSR) subfamily typically promote phage integration and excision between specific sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Van Duyne and Rutherford, 2013</xref>), but certain members promote DNA translocation reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannam et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). SmSRs and LSRs have their DNA binding domains (DBDs) at the C-terminal end of the protein, albeit the LSRs have a more elaborate C-terminal DNA binding and regulatory domain. The SRs found in IS<italic>607</italic>-family transposable elements, however, are distinguished by the location of their DBDs at their N-termini (experimentally confirmed below). This domain architecture is paradoxical because studies on smSRs imply that an N-terminally located DBD would be incompatible with the formation of active tetramers, which is the critical regulatory step of these reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rice, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stark, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The founding member of the IS<italic>607</italic> family was first described by Berg and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kersulyte et al., 2000</xref>), who also noted the relationship between the <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> IS<italic>607</italic> element and annotated insertion sequence elements like IS<italic>1535</italic> in the <italic>Mycobacteria tuberculosis</italic> genome sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cole et al., 1998</xref>). IS<italic>607</italic>-family elements have been subsequently found in a wide range of bacterial species, including cyanobacteria, and in archea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Filée et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuno et al., 2010</xref>). IS<italic>607</italic>-related sequences have also been found in eukaryotic genomes and viruses, probably primarily through horizontal DNA transfer events, and have been described as the most widely distributed transposon in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Filée et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilbert and Cordaux, 2013</xref>).</p><p>IS<italic>607</italic> elements encode two <italic>orfs</italic>, which often overlap in their coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). OrfA exhibits homology with SRs and is sufficient to mediate transposition of IS<italic>607</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic> (this paper and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kersulyte et al., 2000</xref>). The OrfB sequence bears a clear relationship with RuvC and Cas9, and is also present in some IS<italic>200</italic>/IS<italic>605</italic> family members, some eukaryotic transposons, and as standalone genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao and Jurka, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kapitonov et al., 2015</xref>). Surprisingly, the DNA sequences at the termini of individual IS<italic>607</italic> elements are not related, but an inverted repeat sequence, often imperfect, is present near but at different distances from the ends of the element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A common feature of the ends of IS<italic>607</italic> elements is the presence of short directly-repeated motifs, which are positioned at different spacings with respect to each other and to the host DNA junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). An additional unusual feature is that the IS<italic>607</italic> transposition reaction does not create target site duplications (this paper and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blount and Grogan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kersulyte et al., 2000</xref>). The absence of target site duplications may make IS<italic>607</italic> elements useful as vehicles for delivering and subsequently removing genes from chromosomes without generating a genetic scar, similar to applications of the TE <italic>piggyBac</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Woltjen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woodard and Wilson, 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39611.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IS<italic>607</italic>-family transposons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overall structure of IS<italic>607</italic>-family transposons with lengths given for the <italic>orfA</italic> and <italic>orfB</italic> coding regions (amino acid residues) of elements discussed in this paper.

Transposition onto λ was measured after phage induction in a <italic>recA E. coli </italic>λ lysogen, and the resulting λ lysates were used for transduction selecting tetracycline resistance. λ::IS<italic>607-tet</italic> transpositions were obtained for IS<italic>607orfA</italic> at a frequency of 1 × 10<sup>−7</sup>/pfu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), but no confirmed transposition events were obtained with IS<italic>607orfAB</italic>. We note that the relative expressions of <italic>orfB</italic> and <italic>orfA</italic> in the IS<italic>607</italic> constructs are likely to be different than in the native element; nevertheless, these results indicate that OrfA is sufficient for promoting transposition and that OrfB is inhibitory, as concluded earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kersulyte et al., 2000</xref>). No transposition events were obtained when OrfA contained a glycine substituted for the predicted active site serine (residue 72), consistent with OrfA catalyzing the transposition reaction through an SR mechanism.

The dimerization interface of the core domains of TnpA is between helices B and D of each subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), which do not share contacts in the smSR dimer structures (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The 961 Å<sup>2</sup> (TnpA<sup>IS1535</sup>) and 924 Å<sup>2</sup> (TnpA<sup>ISC1926</sup>) dimer interfaces within the core are relatively flat and hydrophobic, but there are a few polar connections between the subunits. By contrast, smSR subunits are associated in the dimer via their helix E regions through almost exclusively hydrophobic contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Although the overall configurations of the TnpA<sup>IS1535</sup> and TnpA<sup>ISC1926</sup> dimers are similar, there are significant differences in the details of the dimer interfaces within the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The TnpA<sup>ISC1926</sup> subunits are shifted apart by about 3 Å relative to TnpA<sup>IS1535</sup>, the TnpA<sup>ISC1926</sup> D helices are angled by about 15° rather than being parallel, and the TnpA<sup>ISC1926</sup> B helices are one turn longer than in TnpA<sup>IS1535</sup>.</p><p>The active site serines of each TnpA dimer (TnpA<sup>IS1535</sup> residue 59 and TnpA<sup>ISC1926</sup> residue 74) are separated by 28.6 and 31.5 Å (Cα atoms), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). This is a much longer distance than would be predicted to catalyze cleavage of scissile phosphates across the minor groove of B-DNA, assuming a 2 bp staggered cleavage (~14 Å separation) that is common to other SRs. An even longer separation between active site serines is present in the catalytically-inactive dimers of γδ resolvase and Sin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mouw et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang and Steitz, 1995</xref>).</p><p>The helix E regions of the TnpA dimer structures are also completely different from those of other SRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). After β4 in the TnpA dimers, a poorly structured 9 – 10 residue peptide travels along one side of the active site to connect to the helix E region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The E helices are interrupted by a four residue β-turn (GRRG in TnpA<sup>IS1535</sup> and GMRS in TnpA<sup>ISC1926</sup>) and fold into an antiparallel structure. The split E helices from each subunit associate into a 4-helix bundle, with the C-terminal segments of TnpA<sup>IS1535</sup> helix E rotated 35° relative to those of TnpA<sup>ISC1926</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The helix E region excludes a total of about 3685 Å<sup>2</sup> of solvent accessible surface area in both proteins and would sterically prevent DNA from associating with the active sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> C F). The helix E conformation and the separation of active site serines indicate that this dimer conformation cannot be active for DNA chemistry (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boocock and Rice, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The structures of the IS<italic>1535</italic> and ISC<italic>1926</italic> TnpA dimers are very similar to SRs from <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic> (PDB code 3LHK;) and <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> (PDB codes 3ILX and 3LHF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>), which have been discussed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boocock and Rice, 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, because the quaternary structures of the TnpA-like proteins are so different from other SRs and because these differences have profound functional implications, we tested aspects of the dimeric structure by cysteine crosslinking. Cysteines were substituted at TnpA<sup>IS1535</sup> residues within the catalytic core and helix E region where they would be proximal and oriented appropriately for intersubunit disulfide formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>). F126C, located just before the start of helix D, and Q138C at the C-terminal end of helix D efficiently formed dimers after oxidation. Within the helix E bundle, L162C generated substantial amounts of covalently-linked dimers and A182C generated a small amount of dimers after oxidation. These solution results substantiate the dimeric structures observed by crystallography.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Binding of TnpA to the transposon ends</title><p>DNA binding by full-length TnpA proteins of IS<italic>607</italic>, IS<italic>1535</italic>, and ISC<italic>1926</italic> to their respective transposon ends was observed by gel mobility shift assays (EMSAs).

Formation of a slowly migrating complex is accompanied by loss of the free LE probe. We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> (lanes 2 – 10) that the slowly migrating complex contains two LE DNA segments (i.e., a pair-end complex, PEC) by incubating TnpA with the radiolabeled 140 bp probe plus excess unlabeled 240 bp LE fragments. This results in formation of a supershifted complex, demonstrating the presence of both the labeled and unlabeled LE DNA fragments. Most of the LE probe associates into PECs with &lt;10 nM TnpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). A much lower level of a complex (complex 1) that accumulates with increasing TnpA concentration is also evident, and a small amount of an additional complex (complex 2) is formed at high TnpA concentrations. Appearance of complex 2 is accompanied by a similar decrease of PECs. Formation of PECs is strongly enhanced by Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, or spermidine; in the presence of EDTA, PEC levels severely decrease and complex 1 coordinately increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). A time course of PEC assembly on left ends by 10 nM TnpA indicates that PECs form relatively slowly, requiring about 30 min to reach maximum levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).

For example, the weaker stop at LE 8 near the host boundary is nearly lost at long digestion times, and longer digestion times on the bottom strand result in loss of the LE 78/77 stop, increasing amounts of the LE 68/67 stop, and a new product at LE 59/58. Taken together, the Exo III and DNase I footprinting results indicate that strong TnpA binding to the LE occurs between approximately LE 18 and LE 67 with weaker binding extending at least 10 bp in both directions. Both footprinting methods indicate weak, if any, binding over and adjacent to the transposon-host boundary.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>TnpA<sup>IS1535</sup> binds only over the two motifs on the IS<italic>1535</italic> RE</title><p>As described above, TnpA binding to the IS<italic>1535</italic> RE primarily forms a complex I product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

The ends of IS<italic>607</italic> elements are not bordered by terminal inverted repeated sequences, and there are no duplications of target sequence at the transposon-host DNA borders; however, multiple short sequence motifs internal to the ends are present (this paper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blount and Grogan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kersulyte et al., 2000</xref>).

Residues implicated in catalysis by SRs are well conserved within IS<italic>607</italic>-family TnpA proteins, and we demonstrate here that the presumed active site serine is required for transposition. Strikingly, however, the dimeric structure is radically different from other SRs.

We show that TnpA<sup>IS1535</sup> binds in a robust and highly cooperative manner to multiple binding sites within the LE of the element and can efficiently recruit a second LE to generate a paired-end complex. Binding nucleates over four 9 bp directly-repeated motifs that are positioned in a helically-phased manner from about 20 to 60 bp from the IS<italic>1535</italic> LE terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Transposon sequences beginning at motif <italic>a</italic> (LE bp 21) through the conserved half of motif <italic>d</italic> (LE bp 54) are essential for efficient paired-end complex formation. However, additional non-specific DNA sequences extending to about 84 bp from the left end are required for efficient PEC assembly. Likewise, additional DNA extending from motif <italic>a</italic> to shortly beyond the transposon-host junction improves the efficiency of PEC assembly. Although this region contains motif <italic>e</italic>, which is spaced one bp closer to motif <italic>a</italic> than the spacing between motifs <italic>a-d,</italic> the presence of the motif <italic>e</italic> sequence has little discernable effect on PEC assembly. We find it surprising that the sequence identity of the terminal 19 bp of the LE does not significantly influence PEC formation.</p><p>Footprinting data on LE-TnpA<sup>IS1535</sup> PEC complexes are consistent with the LE resections. TnpA<sup>IS1535</sup> strongly binds over motifs <italic>a-d,</italic> but the overall region of binding extends from before motif <italic>e</italic> to about 75 bp from the LE terminus. Significantly, only very weak binding is evident at sequences surrounding the transposon-host junction where DNA chemistry must occur. PECs formed with LE substrates containing nonspecific sequences downstream of motif <italic>a</italic> actually exhibited greater protections from DNase I cleavage over the region that would be positioned at the transposon border, possibly implying that the native sequence near the LE terminus may be suboptimal for TnpA dimer binding. The boundaries of TnpA binding within LE PECs revealed by Exo III digestion support a model whereby multiple TnpA proteins coat long segments of the left ends. Initial Exo III stops indicate TnpA binding from 8 to 78 bp from the left end terminus. Profiles obtained upon increasing Exo III digestion are consistent with the exonuclease removing TnpA molecules bound to units of about 10 bp, revealing borders of the TnpA nucleoprotein filament from 8 and 18 (major) bp from the host junction extending to 78, 68 (major) and 59 bp within the element.</p><p>In contrast to the LE, the IS<italic>1535</italic> RE is a poor substrate for TnpA binding. Only a small amount of RE-RE PECs or RE-LE PECs are detectable, although a complex 1 species is formed at high protein concentrations. Exo III footprinting shows that the RE complex 1 contains TnpA bound only to the two sequence motifs that are present between bp 10 and 28 from the RE-host junction. The significance of the differences in the IS<italic>1535</italic> ends on its transposition reaction remains to be determined. However, the distribution of sequence motifs, along with our preliminary end binding experiments with TnpA from IS<italic>607</italic> or ISC<italic>1926</italic>, suggests that this disparity is not present in these elements and thus may not be a general feature of IS607-family transposons.</p><p>The structures of the IS<italic>607</italic>-family TnpA catalytic domain dimers pose a number of questions with respect to how DNA binding and catalysis occur, especially in the light of the radically different oligomeric conformations of other SR family members. Whereas the catalytic domains of the smSRs oligomerize via interactions between their helix E regions, TnpA catalytic domains dimerize over their B and D helices. The helix E regions of TnpA dimers are split and folded into a physically separate four helix bundle that is attached to the catalytic domains by a flexible polypeptide linker. The helix E bundle would sterically exclude DNA from associating with the active site. Therefore, minimally, a reconfiguration of the helix E region would be required to enable DNA catalysis. In addition, the active site is located on the opposite side of the subunit from its DNA binding domain (see models below), raising the possibility that cleavage of the synapsed transposon end and/or target DNA may be in trans with respect to the DNA to which the N-terminal DBD is bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boocock and Rice, 2013</xref>), a recurring feature of transpososome structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hickman and Dyda, 2015</xref>). By contrast, smSRs cleave the half site to which they are bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boocock et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2005</xref>). An additional paradoxical feature with respect to catalysis is that the active site serines in the TnpA dimer structures are separated by &gt;25 Å, much too far to cleave on either side of the GG dinucleotide at the transposon ends and host target in a manner consistent with other SRs. These and other comparative features with smSRs make it likely that a large conformational change in the oligomeric structure of TnpA precedes DNA cleavage and exchange.</p><p>Nevertheless, we show here that the quaternary structure of the catalytic domain is active for assembling PECs, as evidenced by the robust formation of PECs by IS<italic>1535</italic> TnpA dimers covalently crosslinked over the core subunit interface. However, the inability of dimers with covalently-linked E helices to cooperatively bind the LE and form PECs provides strong evidence that the helix E region does undergo conformational rearrangement during PEC assembly. An attractive model is that the helix E regions from adjacent dimers remodel to interact with each other during the cooperative loading of proteins along the transposon end. IS<italic>1535</italic> TnpA proteins deleted for the entire helix E region appear competent to form PECs at very high protein concentrations, supporting a role for a remodeled helix E in promoting cooperative binding between dimers bound laterally along the transposon ends. The finding that a small amount of PECs appear to still form when the entire helix E region is deleted suggests that helix E is not directly required for synaptic interactions.</p><p>Proteolysis experiments and structure modeling suggests that winged-helix DNA binding domains are linked to the N-terminal end of the catalytic domain by peptide chains ranging in length from just three residues (ISC<italic>1926</italic>) to about 10 residues (IS<italic>1535</italic>).

In this model, additional dimers would bind in a similar manner to adjacent motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) with binding stabilized by remodeling of the helix E regions to generate intermolecular contacts between dimers (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). This dimer binding configuration accounts for the cooperative assembly of TnpA units covering about 10 bp each, as evidenced in the Exo III footprints. Most importantly, it accounts for the near simultaneous recruitment of both DNA ends into a PEC; a TnpA dimer array on a single transposon end will have an array of appropriately spaced free DBDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) ready to capture a second unbound transposon end with high affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). The parallel arrangement of ends in the PEC is consistent with PEC assembly by a substrate containing two inverted copies of IS<italic>1535</italic> LEs separated by only 80 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We suggest that complex 1, which is formed in vitro at high TnpA concentrations and does not appear to be a precursor to the PEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>), has a TnpA dimer bound in the conformation depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>.

The presence of complex 2 is correlated with a decrease of PECs as the TnpA to transposon end ratio increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B,F</xref>). We propose that this complex has dimers bound along individual LEs as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>, but unbound transposon ends are unavailable to generate a PEC, consistent with a model whereby TnpA bound to one end captures a second unbound end.

However, some transposases utilize multiple binding sites within longer end segments, and in some cases, contain distinct DNA binding domains. For example, each subunit of the <italic>Mos1</italic> Mariner-family transposase dimer binds to one transposon terminus and additional separate DNA binding domains associate with two subterminal binding sites on the other transposon end within the active complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richardson et al., 2009</xref>). Assembly of the phage Mu transpososome, which contains four copies of the Mu A protein, is more complex as it involves interactions with a remote enhancer-like element by a distinct DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harshey, 2014</xref>). <italic>hAT</italic>-family transposons often have many subterminal repeats at variable spacings and orientations, which in some elements, can be located hundreds of base pairs from the transposon termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atkinson, 2015</xref>).

The presence of subterminal repeats on <italic>hAT</italic>-family elements bears some similarity to the sequence motifs of IS<italic>607</italic>-family transposon ends, but the manner of transposase binding and synapsis proposed here for IS<italic>1535</italic> is different.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Current understanding of the IS607-family transposition reaction</title><p>We propose the following pathway for formation of the paired-end complex that is expected to be a critical early intermediate in the IS<italic>607</italic>-family transposition reaction. Multiple TnpA dimers are initially targeted to DNA motifs that can be located over 60 bp from the transposon end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the case of the IS<italic>1535</italic> LE, four dimers cooperatively bind over four helically-phased motifs beginning 20 bp from the end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), and the nucleoprotein filament continues to spread in a largely sequence-neutral manner to cover at least 70 bp. The active sites are positioned well away from the DNA in the filament, avoiding any spurious cleavage. The single-end complex then captures an unbound end to generate a stable PEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,E</xref>). Because formation of the PEC is relatively slow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), we imagine that initial binding to a IS<italic>1535</italic> LE limits the rate of PEC formation, but once the single-end filament is formed, an unbound end is rapidly captured. Although we illustrate this complex as two parallel transposon ends, a more interwrapped structure may form. No quaternary change in the dimer structure over the catalytic core domain is required for PEC assembly, but our evidence indicates that the helix E region remodels to facilitate cooperative assembly of the nucleoprotein filament. Most all IS<italic>607</italic>-family transposon ends have multiple motifs (the IS<italic>1535</italic> RE is an exception with only two), but they are not always spaced by increments of 10 – 11 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The flexible peptide linkers between the DBD and catalytic domains and between the catalytic domains and helix E regions may enable similar nucleoprotein filaments to assemble, even if some of the recognition motifs are not in helical phase.</p><p>Whereas an 80 bp segment within the IS<italic>1535</italic> LE beginning near the transposon terminus is required for maximally efficient PEC assembly, only very weak TnpA binding is observed over the transposon-host DNA junction where TnpA-mediated chemistry on DNA must occur. For the reasons discussed above, and because the active sites in the solution dimer are not positioned appropriately with respect to the terminal GG cleavage sites, an alternate conformation of TnpA is almost certainly required for DNA catalysis. Recruitment of TnpA in a catalytically-active conformer may be a key regulatory step and could require co-translational synthesis or folding localized to a preformed PEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duval-Valentin and Chandler, 2011</xref>). This could explain the requirement in vivo for the IS<italic>607 tnpA</italic> gene to be located close to the transposon ends for transposition to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kersulyte et al., 2000</xref>) (W.C. and R.C.J., unpublished). Thus, correct assembly of the PEC, with the two transposon ends in correct register, may be a prerequisite or checkpoint for recruiting catalytically-active subunits to bind to the junction, or alternatively, for allosterically activating weakly bound subunits over the junction.</p><p>In addition to the structure of the recombination complex, the steps of DNA exchange by serine transposases may also be quite different from other SRs. A subunit rotation mechanism for strand exchange on the complex depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> would lead to an intramolecular inversion, not transposition. Instead, we suggest that the element may excise from the donor site and then insert into a target locus using serine chemistry without strand transfer coupled to subunit rotation. It is also possible that capture of the target locus could be a prerequisite for DNA cleavage. Because both transposon ends need to recombine into a single GG target, it seems likely that the strand transfer reactions must occur sequentially. As none of these DNA cleavage–transfer steps would necessarily require a subunit rotation reaction, the structure of chemically-active TnpA oligomers may be very different from other SRs that have been trapped in tetrameric structures competent for DNA exchange by subunit rotation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>)</td><td>IS<italic>1535 orfA/tnpA</italic></td><td>H37Rv <break/>genome DNA</td><td>Gene ID: RV0921</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>) <break/></td><td>IS<italic>607 orfA/tnpA</italic></td><td>synthetic gene</td><td>NCBI protein <break/>ID: AAF05600.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>)</td><td>IS<italic>607 orfB</italic></td><td>synthetic gene</td><td valign="bottom">NCBI protein <break/>ID: WP_001274345.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Sulfolobus islandicus</italic>)</td><td>ISC<italic>1926 orfA/tnpA</italic></td><td><italic>S. islandicus</italic> genome <break/>DNA, PMID: 15612937</td><td valign="bottom">NCBI protein <break/>ID: AAV87873.1</td><td><italic>S. islandicus</italic> <break/> <italic>pyrE::ISC1926</italic> <break/>Dennis Grogan, University of <break/>Cincinnati</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, <break/>strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>RJ1224</td><td>Laboratory collection</td><td><italic>recA56, srl, Δ(pro-lac), ara, rpsL</italic>, <break/>λ<italic>bbnin</italic> [λ <italic>cI857,b515, b519, nin5, Sam7</italic>]</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, <break/>strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>Hfl-1</td><td>PMID: 4352176</td><td><italic>hfl-1, fhuA2::IS2,</italic> <break/><italic>lacY1, tsx-1, glnX44,</italic> <break/><italic>gal-6, xyl-7, mtlA2, mut-14</italic></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, <break/>strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>LE392</td><td>PMID: 6291786</td><td><italic>hsdR514 (rk–, mk+),</italic> <break/><italic>glnX (supE44), tyrT (supF58), Δ(codB-lacI)3, galK2, galT22, metB1, trpR55</italic></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, <break/>strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>BW14879</td><td>PMID: 2160940</td><td>pMW11 Mu<italic>c62 Δ(lac)X74,</italic> <break/><italic>Δ(phoA532 Pvull)</italic> <break/><italic>phn(EcoB),</italic> <break/><italic>arcA1655, fnr-1655</italic></td><td>B.

Your article has been reviewed by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an important and well-executed paper on IS607 family transposition. Both the experimental work and its description are well-done, clear, and of a high standard. The manuscript represents an important contribution to the field.</p><p>Overall, the quality and thoroughness of the science in this paper is first rate. Some revision based on the comments of the reviewers will strengthen the manuscript in how the results are interpreted and how the models are to be favored or disfavored. The work sets the stage for further testing of models and examining mechanisms for IS607 family transposition. Although the list of comments is extensive, that authors should note that none of the reviewers have insisted on any further experiments by the authors; if they can supply any more experimental information that they may have on the points made by the reviewers (e.g., the activity of LE-LE complexes), then addition of such data would improve the paper, but is not essential.</p><p>Otherwise, despite the longer than normal list of comments below, the authors should be aware that most of the questions arose from an interest in their work, rather than from skepticism of their conclusions. In the end, all of the changes required are simply additions or clarifications of the text (e.g., the Discussion section). Consequently, it should be relatively easy for the authors to modify the text to accommodate these suggestions and improve the manuscript within two months.</p><p>[Please note that it was difficult to summarize the reviewers' comments without including most of the full review to provide the proper context of their comments. Consequently, what follows is an atypical <italic>eLife</italic> review of a manuscript that is in principle acceptable for publication and, instead of an editorial summary, contains the verbatim comments of the reviewers. The discussion amongst the reviewer is a summary of the major points that should be clarified in the revised manuscript, although the authors should consider the full scope of the reviewers’ comments.]</p><p>Summary of reviewers' discussion and the specific comments to be addressed (please see the full set of comments by the reviewers for context):</p><p>1) Both reviewers 1 and 3 were in complete accord with principal comments 1-3 as expressed by reviewer 1 (see related comments by reviewer 3).</p><p>2) Both reviewers 1 and 3 agree that the foot-printing data is extensive and thorough, and characterizes the interactions of TnpA dimers with individual binding elements within each transposon end, and the allosteric/cooperative contributions to binding. One concern is whether this binding characterization is sufficient to draw strong conclusions regarding paired end complex (PEC) formation (or synapsis of the ends), which is the principal question that the authors set out to solve.</p><p>3) Both reviewers 1 and 3 found the model for cooperative TnpA assembly at the left end followed by capture of the unbound right end somewhat unsubstantiated by the experimental data. Of course, this is a model at this stage. Both reviewers 1 and 3 were not sure that the present results rule out PEC formation by TnpA-bound left and right ends, with the pairing stabilizing the TnpA dimers bound to the right end. This should be addressed or the conclusions qualified.</p><p>4) Both reviewers 1 and 3 thought that the authors may want to restate their position on why they consider rotation unlikely rather than rule out this possibility. Although they agree with the authors that subunit rotation is unlikely, they nonetheless, agree that subunit rotation cannot be dismissed as a mechanism based on the data presented. Perhaps the authors could expand this discussion a bit by explaining their reasoning and noting that their data do not rule it out. In this context, the authors should consider: (1) The dimerization interface does not involve helix-E and therefore subunit rotation would have to occur via a different interface compared to superfamily members with C-terminal DBDs. (2) I don't see why anything needs to rotate when the transposon is excised from the host.</p><p>5) Both reviewers 2 and 3 agree that the comments on Figure 8 by reviewer 2 models based on affinity differences in binding.</p><p>6) Both reviewers 2 and 3 agree thought that the role (or lack thereof) for helix E in PEC formation is worth consideration from the structure perspective.</p><p>7) The question of the functional competence of identical sequences at left and right ends of the transposon placed in the proper orientation is a relevant question that all three reviewers raise.</p><p>8) Finally, an additional topic that the authors may want to briefly discuss at the end is how their model might accommodate binding to target DNA. Presumably, another catalytic dimer equivalent needs to be provided. This would be speculative, but would relate the results of the paper back to the overall transposition pathway for readers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Chen et al. report characterization of the transposase-DNA interactions involved in transposition by members of the IS607 family of transposons, along with two new structures of transposase catalytic domains.</p><p>This is an excellent manuscript which provides substantial and much-needed information about how IS607-family serine transposases interact with their transposon ends to promote strand transfer. The work is presented very clearly and the manuscript is very well written throughout. Also, some difficult experimental work has been carried out to a high standard – in particular, the footprinting data are very nice. I think that the manuscript will be an important contribution to the field that will be very useful to others who wish to investigate these unusual transposition systems further. I have some comments on specific issues which I hope the authors will address (see below), but these are all of a relatively minor nature.</p><p>1) Much of the biochemical analysis is done on an IS1535 paired-ends complex (PEC) comprising two left ends (LE) bound together by the transposase. However, one would expect that for natural transposition, the active complex would be LE-RE, which is apparently less stable in the authors' assays. Is there any evidence that the LE-LE PEC is an active intermediate? For example, can transposition of an artificial element with two LEs be observed?</p><p>2) Results section and Discussion section. The authors propose that a single-end complex captures an unbound end to generate a PEC. Could the authors make their justification of this hypothesis clearer? Can they exclude both ends being bound by transposase? If their proposal is correct, formation of the PEC should be inhibited by higher concentrations of TnpA.</p><p>3) Last paragraph of Discussion section. The authors propose that excision and integration by this family of transposases might not involve a 'subunit rotation' mechanism as is proposed for related serine site-specific recombinases – which may be true, but I don't think that any of the data presented here argue strongly against a rotation mechanism.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting paper that represents an advance in understanding how IS607 family transposition occurs. The experimental support for formation of a TnpA nucleoprotein filament on LE DNA and a much smaller complex on RE DNA are strong. The data showing highly cooperative PEC formation between two LEs is also convincing.</p><p>The models in Figure 8 suggest that the IS607 serine recombinases acting at 'accessory sites' do so in a manner that is quite different from what the catalytic dimers must be doing. This isn't the case for the other small SR dimers, which all bind DNA in roughly similar ways, regardless of whether or not they are catalytic. Since the catalytic dimers of TnpA likely function as well-positioned, but non-specific nucleases in the excision reaction, perhaps this explains why the active sites are kept away from DNA on the filament (according to the model proposed).</p><p>One implication of the Figure 8 models is that 8A must not be much higher affinity vs 8B. If this weren't the case, I don't see how a LE complex could ever form; the intramolecular wHTH-DNA interactions would dominate. It seems like this should be a testable prediction.</p><p>I was surprised that the E-helices are not required for PEC formation; this was an important result that limits the types of interactions likely to occur on the filament vs between LE and RE.</p><p>With a strong focus on complexes formed on and between LE DNA, I was surprised that the activity of LE alone was not mentioned. Is a LE-TnpA-tet-LE(inv) construct active or toxic in vivo? Is there any sign of cleavage or covalent intermediate in the PECs formed at high TnpA?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper by Chen et al., is a detailed structural and biochemical analyses of the DNA-protein interactions involved in the assembly of the high-order structures that mediate IS607 family transposition. This family of transposons deviates from the classical definition of transposons in that they do not harbour the canonical 'inverted repeat sequences' at their termini, and do not generate target site duplications at their insertion points. Transposition requires a single protein dimer (the transposase), coded for the transposase, that forms functional oligomers on cognate DNA elements. The catalytic pocket of the transposase is typical of well characterized serine site-specific recombinases, which carry out the strand cleavage and strand joining steps of recombination by transesterification chemistry. By contrast, the classical transposases perform strand cleavage by hydrolysis, and strand transfer (joining) by transesterification. The consensus dinucleotide (GG) at the insertion site in the recipient DNA (also the left and right junctions of the insertion) is consistent with the typical serine recombination mechanism in which the exchanged region is 2 bp long.</p><p>The principal conclusion from this study is that oligomeric assembly of the transposase at one end of the transposon containing multiple binding elements captures the other end containing fewer such elements to form a paired end complex (PEC), or a 'transpososome'. PEC formation does not require a change in the dimeric structure of the C-terminal catalytic domain, even though some remodeling of the E-helix within this domain seems to be necessary. The chemical activity of the transposase would involve some significant movement within the observed dimer structure (without DNA) in which the catalytic serine residues are too far apart to attack their target phosphodiester bonds.</p><p>This is a well written paper with an extensive set of data presented clearly in figures and text, and interpreted carefully. The structural view of the transposition complex emerging from the present studies will certainly provide the foundation for further testing mechanistic models for the chemical steps of the reaction carried out by this complex. The following comments may be considered if the authors wish to view their system from the broader perspective of phosphoryl (nucleotidyl) transfer by transesterification chemistry rather than from the narrower perspective of transposition.</p><p>1) The lack of target DNA duplication in the IS607 family is interesting from a purely transposition point of view, and based on precedent. The length of the duplication reflects the spacing of the nucleophiles (3'-hydroxyls in canonical transposition) and in turn the staggered insertion of the transposon ends at the target site. Depending on the extent of replication/repair, the nucleotides spanning the gap generated by the insertion, or these nucleotides plus the entire transposon, can be duplicated to give either a simple insertion or a co-integrate. Since the length of the duplication varies among different families, a few bp to as many as ~30 bp for CRISPRs, why not think of the IS607 family as a '0 bp' duplication family?</p><p>2) In some sense, the differences between conservative site-specific recombination, DNA transposition and even homologous recombination are often less marked than they are purported to be, if considered from a purely mechanistic standpoint. Given the rather limited chemical repertoire available for biological catalysis, how many different ways can one break or form a phosphodiester bond in DNA or RNA-rather few. Topoisomerases, conservative site-specific recombinases, enzymes that carry out homologous recombination and DNA/RNA polymerases illustrate he limited number of ways that this chemistry can be performed under different biological contexts. Juggling these mechanisms to reach similar genetic outcomes, or using the same mechanism to bring about distinct genetic rearrangements, is expected to be the rule rather than the exception. The authors may wish to tone down their characterization of IS607 family as an outlier among transposons.</p><p>3) Given that the transposase uses a serine nucleophile-based mechanism, the strand cleavage and the strand transfer steps of transposition must follow transesterification chemistry. Hence the reaction is more akin to site-specific recombination. One could think of the insertion of the transposon as recombination-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE), although a non-standard one. The donor cassette (transposon) is flanked by two recombination sites as in normal RMCE, but the target site has only one equivalent site, so the excised cassette in exchange for transposon insertion is a '0 bp cassette' (on par with 0 bp target duplication during transposition).</p><p>I believe that the 'cut-and-paste' mechanism that authors propose in the 'Discussion' is more or less the same as the non-reciprocal RMCE. An implication of this mechanism is that the donor DNA is likely to be repaired efficiently without addition or loss of DNA. Is this true from in vivo assays? It is probably known and mentioned here, and I might have somehow missed it.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>1) Summary: Is the last sentence 'We posit-PEC recruits a chemically-active conformer of TnpA -.' justified by the data? Is it not possible that the TnpA dimer (tetramer?) adjacent to the scissile phopshates acquires cleavage competence within the assembled PEC? The sentence, as it stands now, suggests that there are inactive and active TnpA dimers in solution and the assembled PC selectively enlists active dimers to the cleavage site.</p><p>2) Figure 2 and Figure 3 (figure supplements) and text on structural data. The domain characterization of TnpA, the structural determination (C-terminal domain) and the relevant comparisons to serine recombinase catalytic domains are nicely organized and quite helpful. The wide spacing between the catalytic serine residues within the dimer unbound to DNA is not surprising, given prior examples.</p><p>In the Discussion section, there is a suggestion that the cleavage might occur in trans. Does this refer to cleavage within the transposon ends or cleavage of a transposon end and the target? Will the serine arrangement in the dimer seen in the structure be consistent with the latter mode of cleavage?</p><p>3) Figure 4 to Figure 8 (and figure supplements) and corresponding text. This section represents the heart of the paper, with extensive characterization of TnpA binding to the repeat elements of the left and right ends by EMSA, DNase I and exonuclease foot printing etc. The conclusion from the cumulative assays is the formation of the nucleation of a TnpA filament at the left end followed by capture of the right end to form the transposition synapse (paired end complex; PEC).</p><p>Figure 3 and supplements show the ability of left end to form PEC, as well as theinability of the right end to do so. The assay uses two separate DNA fragments, one as the radio-labeled probe for binding the second as an unlabeled fragment for capture into PEC. If two right ends are present on the same DNA fragment, do the ends come together in a PEC?</p><p>Are all the binding elements a-d present at the left end required for PEC formation with right end? If the left end is replaced by a copy of the right end, will transposition occur?</p><p>Will additional binding elements at the right end be inhibitory to PEC formation and transposition? Here, one would expect filament formation at both ends.</p><p>4) Continued from 3. According to the PEC model, the ends are bridged by a series of TnpA dimers initially lined up at the left end. Do the present results exclude the possibility that the PEC formation is mediated via dimers of TnpA dimers, bound at the left and the right ends?</p><p>Is it possible to think of the extra binding elements abutting those next to the scissile phosphates as accessory sites, by analogy to Tn3 resolvase? In such a scenario, the TnpA dimers bound to the accessory sites may allosterically activate the TnpA dimers that perform DNA cleavage/transfer. The positioning of the TnpA dimers within one of the two ends cannot possibly form a high-order topological arrangement. However, a functionally relevant inter-wrapping of DNA between the bound ends would seem plausible, and is rather fleetingly alluded to by the authors.</p><p>5) Target capture? While the authors have presented detailed arguments to highlight the importance of the PEC in initiating the chemistry of transposition, the potential means of target capture and the mechanism of cleavage at the insertion site is rather unclear. In the PEC-target complex, is there a TnpA dimer at the target site, or is target cleavage accomplished by TnpA associated with the PEC? Obviously, the experiments presented here do not address this question directly. However, it would be helpful to think about target capture/cleavage in light of existing transposition models.</p><p>Perhaps an additional figure expanding on the mechanistic implications of the binding model shown in Figure 8 in cleavage and strand transfer may be appropriate (even if speculative). For example, are the cut-out of the transposon, insertion into the target, and healing of the donor concerted events? Or, does transposon excision from the donor precede its integration into the target?</p><p>The authors seem to rule out DNA rotation following cleavage as part of the strand transfer event. Is this inference consistent with interface of the TnpA dimer in the structure? Can one ignore the possibility of rotation between cleaved transposon ends and target ends?</p><p>6) In summary, this is an important study that reveals a mode of transpososome assembly in the IS607 family that differs from the more conventional mechanisms of assembly that we are currently aware of. Many of the implications of the model proposed will be tested by in vitro reactions, which the authors are eminently capable of successfully performing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39611.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer 1's comments 1-3 are addressed below in the context of the Editor's summary comments 1, 3, and 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Both reviewers 1 and 3 were in complete accord with principal comments 1-3 as expressed by reviewer 1 (see related comments by reviewer 3).</p><p>3) Both reviewers 1 and 3 found the model for cooperative TnpA assembly at the left end followed by capture of the unbound right end somewhat unsubstantiated by the experimental data. Of course, this is a model at this stage. Both reviewers 1 and 3 were not sure that the present results rule out PEC formation by TnpA-bound left and right ends, with the pairing stabilizing the TnpA dimers bound to the right end. This should be addressed or the conclusions qualified.</p><p>4) Both reviewers 1 and 3 thought that the authors may want to restate their position on why they consider rotation unlikely rather than rule out this possibility. Although they agree with the authors that subunit rotation is unlikely, they nonetheless, agree that subunit rotation cannot be dismissed as a mechanism based on the data presented. Perhaps the authors could expand this discussion a bit by explaining their reasoning and noting that their data do not rule it out. In this context, the authors should consider: (1) The dimerization interface does not involve helix-E and therefore subunit rotation would have to occur via a different interface compared to superfamily members with C-terminal DBDs. (2) I don't see why anything needs to rotate when the transposon is excised from the host.</p></disp-quote><p>1) The most important comment, reiterated by the editor, concerns the chemical activity of the IS<italic>1535</italic> TnpA complexes. This is an area of considerable ongoing effort for us. We have tried quite hard to obtain evidence of transposition of various <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> IS<italic>1535</italic> transposon derivatives in <italic>E. coli</italic>, including <italic>LE-tnpA-tet-RE</italic> and <italic>LE-tnpA-tet-LE</italic> constructs. Unfortunately, sequence analyses of the rare candidates have thus far failed to confirm any true transposition events. Also, despite considerable effort, we have not yet obtained evidence for chemical activity in vitro (comment 4 of reviewer 2). There could be a number of reasons for this. As elaborated in the Discussion, our current thinking is that catalytically-active TnpA in an alternate folded state must be recruited onto the PEC at the transposon-host junction. This step may require co-translational or chaperone-assisted folding onto the PEC. This would have to occur in the heterologous <italic>E. coli</italic> cells in our in vivo assays. It is also possible that a host factor required for IS<italic>1535</italic> transposition is missing in <italic>E. coli</italic> or that IS<italic>1535 tnpA</italic> has become catalytically inactive over time, even though it retains the normal constellation of residues around the active site that are believed to be important for SR chemistry. For example, IS<italic>1535</italic> TnpA it may not be able to fold into the chemically-active conformation.</p><p>2) Are the footprinting assays really probing the PEC? Comparisons of the PEC assembly reactions with increasing TnpA by EMSAs (Figure 3) and by DNase I protections or Exo III stops in the footprinting reactions (Figure 4) show a close correspondence. Nevertheless, we directly assayed complexes formed in the footprint reactions by EMSA (removed an aliquot for EMSA from the footprint binding reactions immediately before nuclease digestion) and provided an example in Figure 4 figure supplement 1 in the original version. Note that at the amount of TnpA where the DNA is near fully protected from DNase digestion over the core motifs (Figure 4A), almost all of the DNA is within a PEC by EMSA (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We could provide a similar EMSA example for a footprint reaction on LE: v54-20v (Figure 6), but believe this would be redundant (a standard EMSA for this mutant is presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). It is possible that footprint signals at low TnpA concentrations, particularly in the more sensitive Exo III assays, may arise from some single-end coated complexes that may not be stable to electrophoresis in the EMSAs.</p><p>3) The reviewers (reviewer 1 principal comment 2) would like us to better justify why we propose that a single-end complex captures an unbound end to generate a PEC. Specifically, reviewer 1 asks whether high TnpA over end DNA concentrations inhibit PEC formation, which would be a direct prediction of the model. This prediction is born out in Figure 3A, and we noted this on p. 8: &quot;Appearance of complex 2 is accompanied by a [similar] decrease of PECs&quot; and have added a sentence emphasizing this point in the Discussion section. To better illustrate this point we have substituted Figure 3B with a plot that quantifies the complete TnpA titration range, showing a decrease in the number of PEC at high TnpA concentrations with a corresponding increase in the amounts of complex 2 (proposed to be single-end bound complexes). An expanded view of the lower end of the titration range that highlights formation of the PEC and was given in the original Figure 3B is now an insert within the Figure 3B panel.</p><p>We note in the Results section and elaborate in the Discussion section, that there is no evidence for a kinetic intermediate in the formation of the PEC, although one could argue that two bound ends could rapidly associate into a PEC and preclude detection at low TnpA concentrations. We believe the structural arguments for a single-end complex capturing an unbound end elaborated in the Discussion section and illustrated in Figure 8 add additional support. These considerations, together with points discussed in our response to principal comments 5 and 6, lead us to believe that our proposed PEC assembly model whereby one TnpA-bound end captures a free end is the most parsimonious explanation for the current information, but a more structurally complex model of synapsis by collision of two bound sites cannot be ruled out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Both reviewers 1 and 3 agree that the foot-printing data is extensive and thorough, and characterizes the interactions of TnpA dimers with individual binding elements within each transposon end, and the allosteric/cooperative contributions to binding. One concern is whether this binding characterization is sufficient to draw strong conclusions regarding paired end complex (PEC) formation (or synapsis of the ends), which is the principal question that the authors set out to solve.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors may want to restate their position on why they consider rotation unlikely rather than rule out this possibility. We emphasize that we do not &quot;rule out&quot; the possibility of subunit rotation. We write: &quot;We suggest that the element may be excised from the donor site and then insert into a target site using serine chemistry without strand transfer coupled to subunit rotation.&quot; As the reviewers would no doubt agree, any discussion on the nature of the target capture and strand transfer steps is speculation at this point. We currently have no data regarding the structural nature of the chemically-active protein, the target capture step, and the chemistry of transposon end cleavage and strand transfer reactions. In the absence of any data-driven basis for discussion, we question the value of describing multiple hypothetical scenarios for these steps. Nevertheless, we have re-written the last paragraph to slightly expand the discussion on target capture and implications for strand exchange by a subunit rotation reaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Both reviewers 2 and 3 agree that the comments on Figure 8 by reviewer 2 models based on affinity differences in binding.</p></disp-quote><p>The Figure 8A complex must not be much higher affinity than the Figure 8B complex. We agree and emphasize throughout that complex 1 is only observed at high TnpA concentrations. We imagine that a TnpA dimer dynamically associates with DNA in solution in the configuration represented by Figure 8B, but this complex is not stable to gel electrophoresis. However, in the context of multiple helically-phase motifs, a single dimer as in Figure 8B recruits other like dimers to form the filament represented by Figure 8C, which, in the absence of free LE DNA, is complex 2 that is at least somewhat stable to gel electrophoresis. Complex 1, which we are proposing to be represented by Figure 8A, appears on gels at much higher TnpA concentrations than required for PEC formation, even though by computer this dimer conformation readily docks onto DNA, and one might predict would be relatively stable. Complex 1 does not appear to effectively compete with PEC formation on LEs by EMSAs or by Exo III (solution) assays. We believe that there are important kinetic features at play in the assembly of the PEC: the slow step may be the initial nucleation of the array of dimers on a single end. Once the array with its constellation of unsatisfied binding sites is formed, it rapidly associates with a naked end to form a stable PEC. We have added this to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Both reviewers 2 and 3 agree thought that the role (or lack thereof) for helix E in PEC formation is worth consideration from the structure perspective.</p></disp-quote><p>Consider the role (or lack thereof) for helix E in PEC formation. We believe the Reviewers are thinking about a potential model by which synapsis of two pre-bound ends occurs by an association of (remodeled) helix E regions, which could be considered unlikely because of weak PEC formation by the helix E deletion mutant. We agree and have added this point at the end of the Results section and in the Discussion section. The experimental evidence disfavoring this possible mechanism for PEC assembly is in line with our favored model of a single bound end capturing a free end.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The question of the functional competence of identical sequences at left and right ends of the transposon placed in the proper orientation is a relevant question that all three reviewers raise.</p></disp-quote><p>What is the functional competence of identical sequences at left and right ends of the transposon? Although we have discussed making IS<italic>607</italic> derivatives with two left or right ends to test the functional consequence of two identical ends on transposition in vivo, it has not been done. This is a good point, and we will now make testing this a priority. We note, however, that most IS607-family elements have multiple motifs variably distributed over relatively large segments at each end (e.g., Figure 1B) and that it is possible that the poor right end in IS<italic>1535</italic> may be an anomaly, as hinted at in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Finally, an additional topic that the authors may want to briefly discuss at the end is how their model might accommodate binding to target DNA.

This would be speculative, but would relate the results of the paper back to the overall transposition pathway for readers.</p></disp-quote><p>Target DNA binding and strand transfer into target DNA.
