Here, we gained novel functional insight about heterochromatic PTMs by analyzing histone H3 purified from the heterochromatic germline micronucleus of the model organism <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>. Mass spectrometric sequencing of micronuclear H3 identified H3K23 trimethylation (H3K23me3), a previously uncharacterized PTM. H3K23me3 became particularly enriched during meiotic leptotene and zygotene in germline chromatin of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Loss of H3K23me3 in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> through deletion of the methyltransferase Ezl3p caused mislocalization of meiosis-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to heterochromatin, and a decrease in progeny viability. These results show that an evolutionarily conserved developmental pathway regulates H3K23me3 during meiosis, and our studies in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> suggest this pathway may function to protect heterochromatin from DSBs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02996.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02996.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02996.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside the nucleus of a cell, the DNA is wound around histone proteins. This forms a structure called chromatin that allows the long DNA strands to fit inside the cell. Variations in chromatin structure also help the cell to control the functional properties of DNA. For example, a large proportion of chromatin in the cell is in the form of heterochromatin, which is very densely packed, and is associated with many roles such as gene silencing and keeping DNA intact during reproduction.</p><p>Many animals and plants have two copies of each DNA molecule: one inherited from the mother, and one from the father of the organism. Reproductive cells undergo a process called recombination when they form, where the matching copies of each DNA molecule break in a number of places and rejoin to form a new ‘blend’ of their mother's and their father's DNA, which is passed on to their own offspring. In contrast, most heterochromatin is inherited without recombining, preserving it in an unaltered form. This is important since recombination in heterochromatin can create genetic abnormalities.</p><p>Adding small chemical modifications—such as methyl groups—to the histone proteins at the core of the chromatin can change how the DNA is packed. However, the histone modifications that yield different chromatin structures, and the effect of these modifications, are not very well understood.</p><p>Papazyan et al. have taken advantage of a distinct feature of the protozoan <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>: a single-celled organism that divides its chromatin into two different nuclei. The smaller micronuclei contain only heterochromatin, and Papazyan et al. discovered that the histone H3 protein in the micronuclei is modified by methyl groups at a specific site that had not been studied before. Furthermore, this protozoan makes more of these modifications when it reproduces. An enzyme called Ezl3p adds these methyl groups, and without this enzyme <italic>T. thermophila</italic> reproduces more slowly and has offspring that are less likely to survive and more likely to be infertile. Papazyan et al. provide evidence that these characteristics arise because the cells without the histone modification are unable to prevent DNA breaks from occurring in heterochromatin during recombination.</p><p>The same histone modification also occurs when the microscopic worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> reproduces, suggesting that this method of DNA protection has been conserved throughout evolution. Papazyan et al. propose that the histone modification may prevent another enzyme that induces DNA breaks from accessing the heterochromatin in reproductive cells; but more work is required to support this hypothesis.</p><p>These findings reveal the importance of a new histone modification during reproduction, and could provide new directions for infertility research.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

genomes are organized around histone and non-histone proteins into at least two major functionally distinct states of chromatin that can be epigenetically inherited: heterochromatin, which is highly compacted and transcriptionally repressive; and euchromatin, which is relatively open and transcriptionally permissive. Heterochromatin, in addition to helping control transcription, plays regulatory roles in a wide variety of biological processes including DNA replication, recombination, and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dernburg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lukas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabert and Groth, 2012</xref>)<bold>.</bold> Accordingly, characterizing factors that regulate heterochromatin formation and maintenance is important for advancing studies on health and human disease, as well as for appreciating basic biology.</p><p>While heterochromatin was described cytologically in 1928 as intensely stained parts of chromosomes that remain condensed over the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heitz, 1928</xref>), molecular definitions of heterochromatin remain elusive. Of particular interest is the complement of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that occur on histone proteins within this transcriptionally ‘off’ environment. Studies of histone PTMs such as methylation, acetylation, or phosphorylation have shown they assist in regulation of chromatin activity, which has helped usher in a modern understanding of different varieties or sub-domains of this compact chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Strahl and Allis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Turner, 2000</xref>). ‘Constitutive’ heterochromatin is found at structural or highly repetitive stretches of the genome such as pericentric or subtelomeric regions, is enriched in Su(var) (suppressors of position effect variegation) proteins and trimethylation on lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">James et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannister et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacobs et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peters et al., 2001</xref>). Regions of ‘facultative’ heterochromatin are also condensed; however, they are enriched in H3K27me3, and can become activated or silenced in response to different cellular environments, such as the inactive X chromosome in mammalian females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simon and Kingston, 2009</xref>). Despite being generally repressed, much of heterochromatin can be transcribed and processed into non-coding RNA, which in turn has been linked to trans-generational deposition of histone modifications and epigenetic silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Djebali et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gu et al., 2012</xref>). Further characterization of PTMs associated with heterochromatin will be necessary to appreciate its subtle distinguishing features and overall regulation.</p><p>To gain insight into histone PTM states enriched in heterochromatin, we took advantage of the nuclear dimorphism characteristic of the ciliated protozoan <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>. While most cells from higher eukaryotes have a single nucleus, where euchromatin and heterochromatin are intermingled on contiguous stretches of chromosomes, <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> maintain two functionally distinct nuclei within a common cytoplasm: a transcriptionally inert, heterochromatic micronucleus and a transcriptionally active, euchromatic macronucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The micronucleus contains the complete <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> genome whereas the genomic complexity of the macronucleus (derived from the micronucleus during sexual reproduction) is reduced by ∼33% through programmed DNA elimination (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/Tetrahymena/MultiHome.html">http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/Tetrahymena/MultiHome.html</ext-link>). Most of the eliminated, micronuclear-limited sequences are repetitive, centromeric, or otherwise non-coding DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chalker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schoeberl et al., 2012</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02996.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Purification of histone H3 from heterochromatic micronuclei and analysis of the associated PTM states.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Co-immunofluorescence staining of Tetrahymena.

Sequences of H3<sup>S</sup> and H3<sup>F</sup> are shown up to K27 since no modifications were detected on residues 28–50. Each row in the table represents a single, discrete, and uniquely modified H3 N-terminal peptide, and each dotted horizontal line beneath a bolded residue represents a site where the specified modification was identified. The relative abundance of each peptide, or multiple isobaric peptides identified within the same spectrum (grouped by brackets on the right), is highlighted by the number of asterisks. For example, peptides with four asterisks are more abundant than peptides with one asterisk.

Further evidence in support of this interpretation was provided by immunoFISH assays combining α-γH2A.X and a DNA probe against the Tlr1 element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wells et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reddy et al., 2008</xref>). A number of micronuclear-limited sequences, including Tlr1, are repetitive in nature and are enriched in centromere-proximal regions, whereas genes are enriched more distally on the chromosome arms (EP Hamilton and RS Coyne, personal communication). The Tlr1 probe we generated was highly specific for micronuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In wild type meiotic micronuclei, we detected minimal overlap between the α-γH2A.X and Tlr1 probe signals.

The <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad is essentially organized into two physically and functionally distinct regions. Germ cells near the distal tip cell of the gonad are maintained as a mitotically dividing population through Notch-like (<italic>glp-1</italic>) signaling; however, as germ cells migrate proximally, they enter meiosis and differentiate into sperm or oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colaiacovo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kimble and Crittenden, 2007</xref>). By indirect immunofluorescence, H3K23me3 was nearly absent in the mitotic region of the gonad, although a small number of mitotic nuclei in this region were positive for the PTM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In striking contrast, H3K23me3 staining became robust in meiotic cells within the gonad, beginning at the leptotene/zygotene transition zone that marks meiotic entry, and plateauing through the rest of meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Compared to H3K27me3, H3K9me3, and H3K4me3 distribution in the gonad, H3K23me3 was the only PTM that became enriched as germ cells entered the transition zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Under high magnification, H3K23me3 and other PTMs also exhibited comparatively different sub-nuclear staining patterns within meiotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Notably, H3K23me3 appeared relatively punctate across the entire nucleus rather than being enriched on either the autosomes (such as H3K4me3) or the silenced Xs (such as H3K27me3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kelly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bender et al., 2004</xref>).

Remarkably, in the GLP-1 gain-of-function mutant <italic>glp-1(gf),</italic> which prevents entry of mitotic germ cells into meiosis and causes their proliferation, H3K23me3 levels were significantly reduced throughout the gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Moreover, Western blot analysis of <italic>glp-1(gf)</italic> whole-worm-extracts showed that H3K23me3 levels are also dramatically reduced, further indicating the vast majority of H3K23me3 signal in adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> is confined to meiotic germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).

Furthermore, in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, we show that H3K23me3 plays a role in a previously unknown pathway maintaining genome stability during meiosis, and that mutants lacking H3K23 methylation incur a reduction in progeny viability.

The location of recombination hotspots in budding yeast and mice is positively correlated with the euchromatic PTMs H3K4me3 and acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lichten and de Massy, 2011</xref> and references therein; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kota and Feil, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamada et al., 2013</xref>). H3K4me3 and histone acetylation may enhance recruitment of the opportunistic, sequence-independent DSB endonuclease Spo11 to specific sites in the genome by loosening local chromatin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, the heterochromatic PTM H3K9me3 is thought to play a role in inhibiting meiotic DSBs and crossover events through compaction of specific genomic regions, like pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres, thus limiting Spo11 access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2009</xref>).

Furthermore, depletion of H3K23me3 induces meiotic DSBs at non-coding, centromere-proximal regions of the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> germline that are occupied by H3K23me3 in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In analyzing <italic>ΔSPO11</italic> cells, which lack meiotic DSBs and γH2A.X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mochizuki et al., 2008</xref>), we found that H3K23me3 levels remained at wild type levels during meiosis, supporting a role for H3K23me3 that is upstream of DSB formation (data not shown). To this end, we favor a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) in which H3K23me3 helps to organize a specialized compact heterochromatin structure, distinct from H3K9me3-associated heterochromatin, that can protect non-coding/highly repetitive regions of the genome from Spo11 activity. The mechanism in <italic>ΔEZL3</italic> mutants that leads to an enrichment of early meiotic DSBs at pericentric regions, rather than a global derepression of DSBs, is unclear. Notably, in <italic>Su(var)3-9</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> flies, which lack H3K9 methylation, DNA damage is also predominantly increased in heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peng and Karpen, 2009</xref>). ChIP-based (chromatin immunoprecipitation) efforts to further refine genomic localization of DSB in H3K23me3 <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> mutants were problematic (data not shown), likely due to the repetitive nature of the DNA surrounding centromeres. Since H3K23me3 is also found in some mitotic chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig7">Figures 1 and 7</xref>), an intriguing link may exist between this PTM and homologous recombination events outside of meiosis.</p><p>The decrease in progeny viability for the <italic>ΔEZL3</italic> cells missing H3K23me3 is also similar in scope to reported infertility and increased spermatocyte apoptosis in male mice missing both copies of the H3K9me3 methyltransferases, Suv39h1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peters et al., 2001</xref>). The phenotype of <italic>Suv39h</italic> dn mice was largely attributed to a loss of H3K9me3 at pericentric heterochromatin causing a significant amount of genome instability in both germline and somatic cells. Similarly, the obvious shift of DNA damage to pericentric regions in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> mutants lacking H3K23me3 may also underlie their decreased progeny viability. Future analysis of changes in the piRNA-like scanRNA population and genome-wide localization studies of DSBs in <italic>ΔEZL3</italic> mutants will further resolve the relationship between histone PTMs and genome instability.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Combinations of histone modifications within <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> heterochromatin</title><p>With close to 200 sites and types of individual histone PTMs described, attention is now turning toward how multiple PTMs function together within the context of their physiological chromatin template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ruthenburg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taverna et al., 2007b</xref>). Mass spectrometry data describing the physical linkage of histone PTMs is sparse in relation to their biological context, yet such information is necessary to understand the proposed ‘epigenetic/histone code’ (Strahl et al., 2000). Our HILIC-MS/MS data demonstrate that H3K23me3 is located within the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> germline, and primarily co-exists with H3K27me3 on the proteolytically clipped H3<sup>F</sup> isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

However, the mislocalization of meiotic DSB in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> was only observed in H3K23me3 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In this regard, the functional significance of the combination of K23 and K27 methylation within the germline remains unclear. Previously, proteolysis of H3 N-termini was observed during differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells and also linked to H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duncan et al., 2008</xref>), although we did not detect H3K23me3 on truncated H3 from mouse or <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and data not shown). Interestingly, a small proportion of H3K23me3 and H3K27me3 are also found in the presence H3S10ph, which is a well-documented PTM that marks mitotic and, to a lesser extent, meiotic chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wei et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prigent and Dimitrov, 2003</xref>). Minimally, this physical linkage suggests that some amount of H3K23me3 can be retained on chromatin throughout the process of cell division, and thus can be inherited.</p><p>Finally, we speculate that as yet unknown protein complexes specifically interact with H3K23me3 in vivo, perhaps in the presence of H3K27me3, or other distinct PTM combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ruthenburg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taverna et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moore et al., 2013</xref>).

The samples were fixed for 1 min in 100% methanol at −20°C, followed by 5 min in 2% EM grade paraformaldehyde in 100 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.2 at room temperature. The samples were blocked for at least 30 min with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20 (PBTw) with 10% Normal Goat Serum. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBSTw as follows: rabbit α-H3K23me3 (1:70); mouse α-H3K9me3 (1:100; 39285; Active Motif); mouse α-H3K27me3 (1:100; 39536; Active Motif); mouse α-H3K4me3 (1:250; ab1012; Abcam). Secondary antibodies were goat α-rabbit or α-mouse conjugated with Cy3 or Alexa-488 diluted at 1:200 in PBTw (Jackson Immunoresearch and Invitrogen). Primary antibody incubations were kept overnight at 4°C; secondary antibody incubations were kept for 2 hr at room temperature. For peptide competition experiments, α-H3K23me3 was incubated with 5 <bold>μ</bold>g/ml of indicated peptides for 1 hr on ice, and immune complexes were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. Preabsorbed primary antibodies were applied to the tissue samples for 1 hr at room temperature followed by secondary antibody incubation for 1 hr at room temperature. Before imaging, DNA was counterstained with DAPI.</p><p>Microscopy for worm slides: confocal images were acquired with a Cascade QuantEM 512SC camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) attached to a Zeiss Axioimager microscope with Yokogawa spinning disk confocal scanner and Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). Maximal-intensity projections encompassing a single layer of nuclei were generated by the Slidebook software. Image processing was performed in Adobe Photoshop CS4.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Observation of small RNAs in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic></title><p>Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer's procedures and precipitated in ethanol.

Reverse strand synthesis was carried out using poly dT primers, procedures and reagents from the Superscript II RT kit (Life Technologies). <italic>EZL3</italic> specific primers (Forward -AATGGTCTATGCTAAAGGTGG; Reverse -TTTGAGAGTTCCTTGTCCATC) were used to assess transcript levels and primers that target the ribosomal protein RPL21 (Forward -AAGTTGGTTATCAACTGTTGCGTT and Reverse -GGGTCTTTCAAGGACGACGTA; sequence obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aronica et al., 2008</xref>) were used as controls in end-point PCR assays. Quantitative PCR was employed to assess the levels of <italic>EZL3</italic> expression during conjugation. Total RNA of conjugating cells was harvested at the indicated time points during conjugation and processed following procedures described above. qPCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, 4376600) with StepOne Software v2.1 and Power SYBR Green (Life Technologies, 4367659) to quantify relative mRNA abundance. <italic>EZL3</italic> specific primers used are shown above. mRNA levels were normalized to time point zero.

The <italic>EZL3</italic> gene was amplified from micronuclear genomic DNA using the forward primer (5′ -CACCTATAAAATGAGAAGAGTTAGATAAAATAAATG) and the reverse primer (5′ -GATATCTTTCCTTTTTTTTTATTTTATTAAATTTTAATTTTTAGCAG) and cloned into the pENTR-TOPOD (Life Technologies). This plasmid was used as the template for the site directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) reaction that introduced the H599A mutation. The primers for mutagenesis were: forward primer (5′ -GCAGATTCATGAATGCTTCAAAAAGCAAAG) and reverse primer (5′ -CTTTGCTTTTTGAAGCATTCATGAATCTGC). The resultant plasmids (pENTREZL3wt and pENTR-EZL3[H599A]) were then cloned into the pBS-ICY-gtw destination vector using the LR recombination reaction as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Motl and Chalker, 2011</xref>).

The activity of a methyltransferase <italic>in vitro</italic> does not unambiguously define enzyme lysine preference <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>In vitro</italic> site specificity for methyltransferases (as is the case with most other chromatin-associated enzymes) can vary depending on the substrate, reaction conditions, the stability of the protein, and the associated complex members present in the assay. The EZH2 class of methyltransferases (and by extension, the homologous <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> EZL methyltransferases) can be particularly sensitive to <italic>in vitro</italic> assay conditions since other PRC2 complex members are essential for activity. Despite these limitations of the <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemistry approaches, we have spent over two years attempting to purify the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> Ezl3 methyltransferase and complex using <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> cells, as well as heterologous cell systems.</p><p>Recombinant Ezl3 does not purify in a soluble form, and while we have previously tagged and purified endogenous Ezl1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2007</xref>, and data not shown), our efforts to similarly tag endogenous Ezl3 have failed to produce viable strains. In the revised manuscript we have tried to soften language throughout regarding direct modification of H3K23 by Ezl3. Since our exhaustive efforts to characterize Ezl3 <italic>in vitro</italic> have been hindered by insurmountable technical barriers that will likely take many additional months or years to overcome, and given the scope of this manuscript, we ask that the reviewers provide some leeway in their suggested biochemical experiments. We also point out that EZH methyltransferases are well-documented histone methyltransferases, and ascribing Ezl3 as the key enzyme responsible for H3K23 methylation is the Occam's razor model for our data. Moreover, as knockdown of Ezl3 does not change any other histone methylation site, there is no evidence that Ezl3 causes an indirect, cascade effect that leads to H3K23 methylation. Accordingly, we hope it will not be viewed as a major detraction to exclude this data.</p><p><italic>2) In the revised study, you and co-authors should present a statistical analysis of the results. Are they significantly different as they stand? More importantly, you and co-authors should prepare some additional wild-type and mutant strains and add those to the analysis. In</italic> Tetrahymena<italic>, it should be very straightforward to generate a set of mutants to compare with the wildtype</italic>.</p><p>For our revised manuscript, we generated and mated a larger group of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> strains, and performed statistical analysis on our progeny viability results. This data (in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) supports our original conclusion that progeny viability is indeed significantly reduced in cells missing H3K23me (p-value &lt; 0.005). The revised figure includes 10 new wild type crosses, and 6 newly generated and crossed mutant strains. We thank the Reviewers for these suggestions as they further support an important point of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) It is also very important to demonstrate in the revised manuscript more directly that there are new DSBs in the pericentric heterochromatin</italic>.</p><p>We were able to develop an assay combining FISH and IF (immunoFISH) on <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> (as suggested by the Reviewers) to provide additional evidence that meiotic DSBs become enriched in pericentric regions in cells missing H3K23me3, and we include this new data in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. A FISH probe for the germline-limited highly-repetitive Tlr1 sequence, which is present in hundreds of copies at pericentric regions in the micronucleus, has a pattern of strong overlap with γH2AX signal in cells that are missing H3K23me3, in contrast to the non-overlapping pattern of these markers in wild type cells. We have also moved the model figure to Figure 6–figure supplement 3, as unambiguous validation of this molecular model is not experimentally possible at this time.</p><p><italic>4) The mouse data, and to some degree the</italic> C. elegans <italic>data, are definitely out of place. Please either further develop this data per the reviewers' suggestions (as included below) or just cut this portion out of the paper and just go with the</italic> Tetrahymena <italic>portion of the study.</italic></p><p>We agree with the Reviewers that the mouse data is not as developed as our <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> data. In the original draft, we had analyzed mouse germ tissue to strengthen the link between H3K23me3 and pericentric or otherwise heterochromatic DNA regions that we observed in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, since these sequences are not well characterized in the ciliate model. We feel the new immunoFISH analysis of meiotic <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> chromatin that we include in our revised submission better resolves the localization of pericentric regions, and we will remove the mouse data from this submission as per the Reviewers’ request (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, we feel that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> data remains valuable to maintain in this manuscript since the multicellularity and morphology of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and our analysis of the available meiotic mutants, all provide critical support of our central claim that the majority of H3K23me3 is confined to meiotic chromatin. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> data also underscores that biological roles of H3K23me3 are likely to be distinct from other heterochromatic histone PTMs like H3K27me3 and H3K9me3. These major points would be less convincing if our data was limited to the single-celled <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> model. Also, we were not attempting to suggest that our data proves that H3K23me impacts <italic>C. elegans</italic> DSB localization, and the confusing language has been removed in our revised draft.</p></body></sub-article></article>
