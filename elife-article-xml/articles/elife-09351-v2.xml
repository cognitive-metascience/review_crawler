However, the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between these two cytoskeletal systems, particularly in cell shape control, remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that introduction of the MyTH4-FERM tandem into KCBP (kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein) during evolution conferred novel functions. The MyTH4 domain and the FERM domain in the N-terminal tail of KCBP physically bind to MTs and F-actin, respectively. During trichome morphogenesis, KCBP distributes in a specific cortical gradient and concentrates at the branching sites and the apexes of elongating branches, which lack MTs but have cortical F-actin. Further, live-cell imaging and genetic analyses revealed that KCBP acts as a hub integrating MTs and actin filaments to assemble the required cytoskeletal configuration for the unique, polarized diffuse growth pattern during trichome cell morphogenesis. Our findings provide significant insights into the mechanisms underlying cytoskeletal regulation of cell shape determination.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09351.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09351.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09351.002</object-id><title>elife digest</title><p>Within a cell, a structure called the cytoskeleton provides a scaffold that supports the cell's shape. In both plant and animal cells, this scaffold is largely made of tube-like structures called microtubules and a web of filaments made of a protein called actin.</p><p>In a plant called <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, specialized hair-like cells usually protrude from the surface of leaves. These cells—called trichomes—are widely used to study how the cytoskeleton influences plant cell shape. Microtubules are required to regulate the number of branches these trichomes have. The actin filaments control the length of the trichomes, but it is not known how the two elements of the cytoskeleton interact to determine the overall shape of the trichomes.</p><p>One protein that might help to co-ordinate microtubules and actin filaments is called kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein (or KCBP for short). This protein is a type of motor protein known as a kinesin and can move along microtubules, but it also contains a section called the MyTH4-FERM domain, which is found in another type of motor protein. When KCBP is removed from <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the leaf trichomes are shorter and blunter than normal and have fewer branches. Here, Tian et al. investigated the role of KCBP in trichome development using a combination of genetic and microscopy techniques.</p><p>The experiments show that the MyTH4-FERM domain of KCBP allows the protein to bind to both actin filaments and microtubules. During trichome formation, KCBP associates with the microtubules that are attached to the membrane that surrounds the cell. Particularly, high levels of the protein accumulate at the sites where branches will form and at the tips of developing branches. These branch tips have few microtubules but have many actin filaments.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that KCBP acts as a hub that brings together microtubules and actin filaments to modulate the cytoskeleton during trichome formation. Tian et al.'s findings provide new insights into how the cytoskeleton influences plant cell shape. A future challenge is to understand how KCBP prevents microtubules forming at the tips of growing branches during trichome formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09351.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09351.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cell shape determination</kwd><kwd>trichome</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>actin filament</kwd><kwd>kinesin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31171294</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>Zhaosheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Startup funding of Hundred Talents Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>Zhaosheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant # 2015B0129-02 of the State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>Zhaosheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein integrates microtubules and F-actin to assemble the cytoskeletal configuration needed for trichome formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant cells assume an amazing diversity of cell shapes that enable these cells to execute unique physiological functions, and the study of plant cell shape determination has remained an intriguing part of plant biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith and Oppenheimer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Szymanski, 2009</xref>). The plant cytoskeletal system, composed of microtubules (MTs) and actin filaments (F-actin), plays a central role in cell morphogenesis in both tip-growing and diffuse-growing cell types. In particular, the cortical MTs play pivotal roles in plant cell growth and directionality, mainly by orienting the deposition of nascent cellulose microfibrils during biosynthesis of the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paradez et al., 2006</xref>). F-actin plays central roles in polarized cell elongation, mainly by regulating intracellular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hussey et al., 2006</xref>). However, despite emerging evidence that cortical MTs and F-actin coordinately regulate plant cell morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petrasek and Schwarzerova, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sampathkumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sambade et al., 2014</xref>), the molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between these two cytoskeletal systems remain largely unknown.</p><p>The <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> leaf trichome, a single cell bearing three or four branches on top of a stalk, has long been a model system for investigating the role of the cytoskeleton in defining plant cell shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Szymanski, 2009</xref>). The trichome phenotype indicates the cytoskeletal homeostasis inside the plant cell. For example, cortical MTs mainly affect initiation of trichome branches, and disruption of genes encoding MT-associated proteins usually produces trichomes with abnormal numbers of branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oppenheimer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krishnakumar and Oppenheimer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burk et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buschmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakamura and Hashimoto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kong et al., 2010</xref>). By contrast, actin filaments mainly affect elongation of trichomes, and disruption of genes encoding actin-related proteins, such as components of the ARP2/3 actin nucleation complex and the upstream WAVE/SCAR regulatory complex (W/SRC), usually results in impaired trichome elongation but with normal branch number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mathur et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deeks et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">El-Assal Sel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El-Din El-Assal et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szymanski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Djakovic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, theoretically, mutation in a gene that participates in both processes would lead to trichome defects in both branching and elongation and would assist in the elucidation of the crosstalk between the MTs and the F-actin. However, such a central player, which directly links and integrates MTs and F-actin and further establishes the required cytoskeletal systems for trichome cell shaping, remains to be identified.</p><p>KCBP (kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein) occurs solely within the plant kingdom, and uniquely in the kinesin superfamily. KCBP has a C-terminal motor head, beyond which locates a calmodulin-binding domain (CBD) at the extreme end of the C-terminus; besides KCBP, the CBD is only found in the sea urchin kinesin KinC. KCBP also contains a MyTH4-FERM tandem, which only occurs in several myosin families outside the plant kingdom, in its tail region at the N-terminus (NT); thus, KCBP has long been regarded as a chimera of kinesin with a myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel-Ghany et al., 2005</xref>). Using biotinylated calmodulin as a probe, KCBP was firstly isolated as a novel calmodulin-binding protein with a kinesin motor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reddy et al., 1996</xref>). In vitro biochemical assays showed that the CBD of KCBP binds calcium/calmodulin, which negatively regulates KCBP motor activity, and that the N-terminal tail, including the MyTH4-FERM domain, could co-sediment with MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Narasimhulu and Reddy, 1998</xref>). Interestingly, genetic analysis of the <italic>zwichel</italic> (<italic>zwi</italic>) mutants, which have a shortened stalk and only two branches, revealed that the <italic>ZWICHEL</italic> (<italic>ZWI</italic>) gene encodes the KCBP protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hülskamp et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oppenheimer et al., 1997</xref>). KCBP was detected in mitotic MT arrays such as the preprophase band, the spindle, and the phragmoplast in various plants, indicating that it may play a role in cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowser and Reddy, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smirnova et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Preuss et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buschmann et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, loss of function in <italic>KCBP</italic> only produces a noticeable phenotype in trichomes, which are less-branched and contain shortened stalks and swollen, stunted branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oppenheimer et al., 1997</xref>), providing a hint of clue that KCBP possibly plays the role involving in both cortical MTs and F-actin. However, whether KCBP localizes to cortical MTs in trichome cells is still an open question, cellular basis of defects in <italic>kcbp</italic> trichomes needs to be examined, direct evidence linking KCBP and F-actin is currently missing, and the role of the mysterious MyTH4-FERM domain remains to be unraveled.</p><p>Here, we show that the N-terminal tail comprising the MyTH4 domain strongly binds to MTs, and the FERM domain physically binds to F-actin. During trichome morphogenesis, KCBP localizes to cortical MTs, distributes in a specific gradient, and is concentrated at the branching sites and the apexes of elongating branches. KCBP orchestrates the MT-actin interplay and is required to assemble the specific cytoskeletal configuration for trichome branching, elongation, and tip sharpening. Our findings build the direct link between the MT-based KCBP motor and the actin cytoskeleton, unravel the cellular basis controlling trichome cell shaping, and provide significant insights into the mechanisms of cytoskeletal regulation of cell shape determination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KCBP localizes to cortical MTs in the non-processive mode</title><p>To determine whether KCBP localizes to cortical MTs, we performed live-cell imaging using a functional, GFP-tagged KCBP fusion under the control of its endogenous regulatory elements; this construct fully rescued the typical <italic>zwichel</italic> trichome defects in the <italic>kcbp-1</italic> (Salk_031704 in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Biological Resource Center; see ‘Materials and methods’) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Humphrey et al., 2015</xref>), which was also designated as <italic>zwiA</italic> (N531704 in the Nottingham <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Stock Centre; see ‘Materials and methods’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buschmann et al., 2015</xref>).

Most GFP-KCBP proteins dwell on or move along cortical MTs as discrete particles for a short time (15.9 s, n = 647); only a small portion of GFP-KCBP particles remain immobilized on MTs for longer times (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Kymograph analysis further confirmed the short-lived and poorly processive nature of KCBP movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), which is the characteristic of non-processive motors of the kinesin-14 subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fink et al., 2009</xref>). We then quantified the distributions of the velocity and the run-length observed for GFP-KCBP. The distributions indicated that, upon fitting to an exponential line, the motor moved at an average velocity of 0.68 μm/min (n = 647) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), and at an average run length of 0.18 μm (n = 647) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Taken together, these results indicated that KCBP likely acts as a non-processive motor to facilitate crosslinking or bundling during MT organization.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09351.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>KCBP colocalizes with cortical MTs in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GFP-labeled kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein (KCBP) localizes along cortical microtubules (MTs) (mCherry-TUB6) in a punctate pattern in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> epidermal pavement cells.

Indeed, we observed that KCBP largely colocalizes with cortical MTs in developing trichomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Intriguingly, KCBP forms a gradient in the elongating trichome branch, with the highest density at the extreme apex, which is devoid of MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because the signal of mCherry-labeled MTs is much weaker than that of GFP and undergoes rapid photobleaching, it is extremely hard to detect in trichomes due to their three-dimension geometry; therefore, to ensure an accurate comparison, we further observed KCBP and MTs using the GFP-KCBP-expressing line and the GFP-TUB6-expressing line, respectively. We observed punctuate KCBP localization in the cortical gradient in developing trichomes, with the highest density at the extreme apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). In GFP-TUB6-expressing trichomes at identical developmental stages, we observed transversely aligned MT arrays (transverse MT rings) in a similar gradient with higher MT density towards the branch tip, but forming a MT-depleted zone at the extreme apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,E,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). In consistent with the result from the double-labeling imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), KCBP largely colocalizes with cortical MTs along the trichome branch, but shows highest levels in the MT-depleted zone at the branch apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>).

To further validate the presence of the MT-depleted zone, we used GCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), a component of the MT nucleation complex, as a control. Interestingly, we observed that, similar to MTs, GCP2 shows a tip-directed gradient, but with a GCP2-depleted zone at the extreme apexes of elongating branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09351.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Spatio-temporal distribution of GFP-KCBP in developing wild-type trichomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>F</bold>) Localization of KCBP and spatial organization of the cytoskeleton in stage 2/3 trichomes.

The MyTH4 domain and the FERM domain are usually found in a tandem in myosins of the Myosin VII, X, and XV families, which differ substantially from the Myosin VIII and XI families found in the plant lineage. Myo VII contains a pair of MyTH4-FERM tandem domains, the second FERM domain of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Myo VIIa binds to actin at high density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). Unlike Myo VII, the MyTH-FERM tandem of Myo X, but not either of the isolated domains, was shown to bind to MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kerber and Cheney, 2011</xref>) and also binds its cargo proteins, including β-integrins and the axonal guidance receptor DCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wei et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> myosin XV Sisyphus, the MyTH4 domain binds to MTs, whereas the FERM domain binds to various cargos including the MT-severing protein, Katanin p60 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). In the present study, by single-molecule imaging, we dissected the functional domain of the N-terminal tail and demonstrated that the NT plus the MyTH4 domain functions as a second MT-binding region besides the motor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), and the FERM domain physically binds to F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Thus, this work provides the first direct evidence linking the MT-based KCBP motor with the actin cytoskeleton, and further indicates that KCBP functions as a hub protein to mediate the interplay between MTs and actin filaments. Most importantly, our work solves the long-standing mystery of the function of the unique MyTH4-FERM domain in KCBP. We propose that the introduction of the MyTH4-FERM domain into the N-terminal tail region of a Kinesin-14 motor during evolution conferred the novel functions of KCBP: the NT and the MyTH4 domain act synergistically to bind strongly to MTs, but still maintain the MT-binding activity of the individual domains, and the FERM domain carries out the novel actin-binding activity, thus, orchestrating the interaction between MTs and the actin cytoskeleton.</p><p>Our speculation is supported by the genetic evidence that the KCBP containing the NT-MyTH4 truncation could not rescue the <italic>kcbp-1</italic> phenotype, but either the NT-truncated version of KCBP or the MyTH4-truncated version could fully complement the <italic>kcbp-1</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These findings indicate that the second MT-binding domain (NT+MyTH4) is essential for trichome morphogenesis, yet either the NT or the MyTH4 domain is fully functional, and compensate each other to bind to MTs. Surprisingly, either the FERM-truncated KCBP or the MyTH4-FERM-truncated KCBP could rescue the <italic>kcbp-1</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This unexpected finding indicates that the FERM domain is dispensable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), despite its actin-binding activity. However, our spatio-temporal observation revealed that loss-of-function mutation of <italic>KCBP</italic> results in defects in both MTs and F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3, 4</xref>). Moreover, the interaction between KCBP and the actin cytoskeleton was genetically highlighted by the phenotype of plants expressing the dominant-negative rigor-KCBP construct, which show twisting, swollen trichome phenotype, similar to aberrant trichome morphology in a class of mutants of actin-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, we proposed that KCBP indeed regulates actin dynamics, yet its actin-related function is redundant with other proteins in a same pathway. One explanation is that KCBP may function redundantly with KCH kinesins in the same kinesin-14 subfamily, which is extremely expanded in plants. KCH kinesins not only are minus-end-directed kinesins as with KCBP but bind to both MTs and F-actin, acting as dynamic linkers between MTs and actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Preuss et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petrasek and Schwarzerova, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schneider and Persson, 2015</xref>). So, further live-cell imaging and genetic analyses are required to investigate the potential functional redundancy between KCHs and KCBP. Another possibility is that KCBP may be partially redundant with the actin nucleator ARP2/3 complex as well as the W/SRC complex. The second scenario is supported by previous findings that KCBP acts in the same genetic pathway with DIS1/ARP3, a member of the ARP2/3 complex, and IBT1/SCAR2, a subunit of the W/SRC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwab et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2005b</xref>), and that ARP2/3 partially colocalizes with MTs in pavement cells and the W/SRC subunit ABIL3 binds to cortical MTs when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jorgens et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, ARP2/3 and BRK1, a subunit of the W/SRC complex, were shown to specifically accumulate at the branch apex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dyachok et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yanagisawa et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, most likely, KCBP functions redundantly with ARP2/3 and W/SRC complexes to organize the cortical F-actin at the branch apex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>KCBP assembles the required cytoskeletal configuration for trichome branching, elongation, and tip sharpening</title><p>Trichome morphogenesis represents a unique growth mode comprising trichome branching and highly polarized diffuse growth of branch elongation accompanied by a tip-sharpening process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beilstein and Szymanski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sambade et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yanagisawa et al., 2015</xref>).

Here, we provided live-cell images in high quality, showing the spatio-temporal dynamics and 3-D reconstruction of cytoskeletal organization during trichome morphogenesis. Our observations clearly showed that the transverse MT rings encircling elongating branches and the MT-depleted zone at the extreme apexes are required for trichome elongation and tip sharpening, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beilstein and Szymanski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yanagisawa et al., 2015</xref>).

By immunostaining, despite the very dim signal, the cortical F-actin cap was detected as roughly showing a transverse pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2005a</xref>), but phalloidin staining showed a clear F-actin cap mainly in a longitudinal pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yanagisawa et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we acquired high-quality images in live trichomes using ABD2-GFP labeling, and these clearly showed the F-actin cap mainly in a transverse pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2, 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). We consider that live-cell imaging with ABD2-GFP gives a weaker signal, but should reflect the natural scenario. We also note that the fine F-actin cap at trichome branch tips is distinct from the actin fringe that is seen in a longitudinal pattern at the subapical domain of pollen tubes, which undergo tip growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lovy-Wheeler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Su et al., 2012</xref>). Instead, the specific cytoskeletal configuration, especially for the MT-depleted zone and the cortical F-actin cap near the trichome branch tip, may be associated with the unique, polarized diffuse growth of trichome branch elongation accompanied by tip sharpening during trichome cell shaping.</p><p>Strikingly, in <italic>kcbp-1</italic> trichomes, these specific cytoskeletal systems are compromised or disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3, 4</xref>), indicating the essential role of KCBP in assembly of the required cytoskeletal systems for trichome cell shape control. This notion is further supported by our important discovery that KCBP exhibits a cortical gradient along elongating branches and concentrates at the extreme apexes, where are colonized by the MT-depleted zone and the cortical F-actin cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our findings indicated that KCBP is required for establishing the transverse MT rings to promote branch elongation, and that, through the FERM domain, KCBP may dominantly bind to cortical F-actin. This binding occurs at higher density at the extreme apex, as suggested by previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2009</xref>), and plays a critical role in the assembly of the F-actin cap, which then facilitates the maintenance of the MT-depleted zone to promote rapid elongation of trichome branches and tip sharpening (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Recent work showed that ARP2/3 and BRK1, a subunit of the W/SRC complex, specifically accumulate at the branch apex, and plasma-membrane associated ARP2/3 and W/SRC complexes likely nucleate cortical F-actin at the branch apex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dyachok et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yanagisawa et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, most likely, KCBP functions in concert with the ARP2/3 complex as well as the W/SRC complex to assemble the specific cytoskeletal configuration near the branch tip region during trichome cell shaping. It would also be interesting to examine whether a local MT disassembly machinery occurs at the extreme branch apex to generate the MT-depleted zone, but an intriguing hypothesis is that KCBP might recruit the Katanin p60 subunit via its FERM domain, as suggested by the previous finding from the MyTH4-FERM-containing Sisyphus myosin motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2008</xref>), to locally disassemble MTs.</p><p>During trichome branching, we propose that once the branching program initiates, by a yet-unknown mechanism, the branching site becomes an isotropic zone with randomized sparse MT network; then, KCBP is required to rapidly colonize that area and organize the new transverse MT rings and the cortical F-actin cap to prime the initiation and subsequent elongation of the incipient branch. Previous studies showed that treatment with the MT stabilizing drug taxol can produce second branches in <italic>kcbp</italic> trichomes, albeit at the relatively low frequency of 5.5%, indicating that transient stabilization of MTs could compensate for the loss of KCBP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mathur and Chua, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buschmann et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, we revealed that KCBP exhibits non-processive movement by the live-cell, single-molecule (particle) motility assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), and that the second MT-binding domain is essential, based on the genetic complementation tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); our data further support the bundling or crosslinking role of KCBP in the formation of the MT rings at the branching site. KCBP may further function in concert with AN1, a CtBP/BARS protein implicated in Golgi membrane trafficking and interacts with KCBP both physically and genetically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Folkers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Minamisawa et al., 2011</xref>), to integrate cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane trafficking to promote trichome branch initiation.</p><p>In conclusion, KCBP acts as a central player or a hub integrating the MT and actin cytoskeleton and further orchestrates their interplay to generate a specific cytoskeletal configuration that is required for trichome branching, elongation, and tip sharpening (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Our findings reveal the in vivo function of the plant unique kinesin KCBP and further provide significant insights into molecular and cellular mechanisms that will close the knowledge gap between the cytoskeletal regulation and cell shape control, especially for the shaping of leaf trichome cells, which represents a unique growth mode comprising trichome branching, polarized branch elongation, and tip sharpening.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p><italic>A. thaliana</italic> ecotype Columbia (Col-0) was used as the genetic background in this study.

Previous analyses of trichome phenotypes caused by mutations in either microtubules or actin gave contrasting phenotypes, i.e. those lacking microtubules gave fewer branches and those lacking actin gave stubby branches. A publication in 1997 indicated that plants that lacked expression of KCBP (for Kinesin-like Calmodulin-Binding Protein, i.e. mutants of <italic>Zwichel</italic>) had a trichome phenotype that was suggestive of both a microtubule (MT) and actin problem, but no particular follow up with respect to the possible bridging role between MTs and actin was ever published. Here the authors study KCBP, which contains numerous domains. They show that two of the novel domains near the N-terminus bind microtubules (the MyTH4 domain) or actin (the FERM domain), and because of this they suggest that KCBP might provide the link (hub protein) needed to coordinate microtubules and actin during trichome development. They use fluorescent-tag imaging to show where this protein is localized in trichomes, i.e. in a gradient and concentrated at branching sites and tips of elongating branches, where there are not MTs but where there is cortical F-actin. They then use a series of deletion constructs to determine the roles of the different domains of the constructs, by introducing them into the kcbp mutant background - from these studies they eliminate a role for the calmodulin-binding domain, but surprisingly, also eliminate a role for the FERM domain. That is, it is mostly the N-terminus and the MyTH4 domain that are needed to complement the mutant phenotype.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) What is the ‘unique tip-directed diffuse growth during trichome cell morphogenesis’ that the authors talk about? Where have the authors come across this unique growth? How is it possible to achieve this kind of growth? Trichomes in arabidopsis grow by diffuse growth which allows their tip region to be extended. Previous published descriptions of trichome development mention outgrowth, extension growth and branching. There is no tip-directed growth as observed in tip-growing pollen tubes or root hairs. Since they use their observations of a transverse cortical F-actin cap to propose association with the unique tip-directed diffuse growth, and because other conclusions and the model presented rely heavily on this supposed unique growth pattern, the authors must provide clear evidence that such a growth pattern actually exists.</p><p>2) The tip of a developing trichome is one of the oldest parts of the trichome cell. The region produces autofluorescence and the images provided do not distinguish autofluorescence and curvature-induced impression of a green signal from actual fluorescence of their probes. Perhaps a control should be included to convince.</p><p>3) It is not clear why they don't use the name zwichel, which is the name previously used for this gene. They state that they use the <italic>kcbp-1</italic> (SALK_031704) mutant for their studies. Which allele of <italic>zwi</italic>? Please provide a clear reference for this and discuss. Are the observations true for other alleles of <italic>zwi</italic>? If this has been checked it would strengthen their observations and conclusions. If not checked then there is a concern about the various zones of depletion and suggested interactions proposed by the authors.</p><p>4) It was confusing as to why a construct missing both MyTH4 and FERM were needed to “not rescue” the phenotype - i.e. lacking the ability to bind to one or the other binding partner of an important bridging protein should both give the “not rescue” answer, no? This needs more discussion/explanation. They do make a point mutation in the motor region (so-called rigor mutation) that they use to argue for a connection with actin. Can the argument about redundancy in the discussion be strengthened?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Orchestration of Microtubules and the Actin Cytoskeleton in Trichome Cell Shape Determination by a Plant Unique Kinesin” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and a Reviewing editor.

The term “linked to” might imply a genetic linkage. Furthermore, the discussion (in the response to reviewers) about the other <italic>zwi</italic> alleles and their issues should be included in the manuscript, so it is clear to that reader that this gene is also called <italic>zwichel</italic> (was it first called <italic>zwichel</italic> or first called <italic>KCBP</italic>?), that other alleles exist, but that they have problems, so a null is better, etc.</p><p>2) As mentioned before, <italic>eLife</italic> does not have page or word limits, so it is unclear why you chose to include a clarifying figure and video in the response to the reviewer comment about a needed control but did not insert this information into the manuscript. i.e. You state in the response letter:</p><p>“Finally, as suggested, we used GCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), a component of the MT nucleation complex, as a control.

We totally agree with your opinion that “There is no tip-directed growth as observed in tip-growing pollen tubes or root hairs”. By tracking the beads that had been placed on the surface of elongating trichome branches, the extension of trichome branches had been established to occur along the whole cell surface, clearly indicating that trichome branches grow in the mode of diffuse growth. Interestingly, the experiments meanwhile showed that diffuse-growing trichome branches elongate in a polarized manner, the distal regions of the branch grows at significantly faster rates than the branch base (please see Figure 4 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwab et al., 2003</xref>; please also see Figures 1c and 1d in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yanagisawa et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the growth mode of trichome branches is definitely diffuse growth, but in a highly polarized manner towards the tip. Thus, this growth mode is often referred to as “tip-biased diffuse growth” or “highly polarized diffuse growth” in literatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Szymanski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sambade, et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yanagisawa et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In our manuscript, we only wanted to use the “tip-directed diffuse growth” to describe the unique growth mode, which combines the highly-polarized diffuse growth with the tip sharpening process, during trichome branch elongation. In addition, we didn’t mean that we found the tip growth based on the observation of the transverse cortical actin cap. Instead, we speculated that the transverse cortical actin cap and the microtubule (MT)-depleted zone are tightly associated with the tip sharpening.</p><p>To avoid the confusion and to precisely describe the unique growth mode of trichome morphogenesis, we replaced the “tip-directed diffuse growth” with the “polarized diffuse growth” in the revised version. We also corrected the confusing descriptions through the manuscript, and emphasized that KCBP acts as a central player or a hub protein to assemble the required cytoskeletal configuration for trichome branching and highly polarized branch elongation accompanied by tip sharpening.</p><p><italic>2) The tip of a developing trichome is one of the oldest parts of the trichome cell. The region produces autofluorescence and the images provided do not distinguish autofluorescence and curvature-induced impression of a green signal from actual fluorescence of their probes. Perhaps a control should be included to convince</italic>.</p><p>Thanks for your valuable suggestions. First, as mentioned earlier, the tip regions of the elongating branch grows at significantly faster rates than the branch base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwab et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yanagisawa et al., 2015</xref>). The wall thickness measurements by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that there is a tip-to-base wall thickness gradient in elongating trichomes and the tip region is the thinnest part; another signal intensity analysis using propidium iodide further confirmed the wall thickness gradient (please see Figures 2g, 2h and 2i in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yanagisawa et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, in elongating trichomes, the cell wall autofluorescence at the tip should be weaker than that at the base, and should not affect the observation of KCBP localization pattern. Otherwise, we couldn’t detect the MT-deplete zone at the extreme apexes of elongating branches in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>Second, to remove your concern that the accumulation of KCBP at the tip region might be the curvature-induced impression, we displayed the image serials that were used to make the Z-projections and 3-D reconstructions. These original images also clearly show that KCBP is concentrated at tip regions where show very weak signal of MTs (please see the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, as suggested, we used GCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), a component of the MT nucleation complex, as a control. Interestingly, we observed that, similar to the MTs, GCP2 shows a tip-directed gradient, but with a GCP2-depleted zone at the extreme apexes of elongating branches (please see the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref> and the <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Author response Video 1</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09351.030</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Localization of GCP2 in stage 2/3 wild-type trichomes.

Are the observations true for other alleles of zwi? If this has been checked it would strengthen their observations and conclusions. If not checked then there is a concern about the various zones of depletion and suggested interactions proposed by the authors</italic>.</p><p>We understand your concern. Among the KCBP mutants of the <italic>zwichel</italic> (<italic>zwi</italic>) serial, the <italic>zwi-3</italic> mutant and <italic>zwi-w2</italic> mutant were frequently used in previous reports. The <italic>zwi-3</italic> mutant still produces a truncated ZWI protein (KCBP) lacking the coiled-coil and motor domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oppenheimer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krishnakumar and Oppenheimer, 1999</xref>); and the <italic>zwi-w2</italic> mutant still contains a peptide fragment of the first 72 amino acids of the KCBP protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Folkers et al., 2002</xref>). Although both <italic>zwi-3</italic> and <italic>zwi-w2</italic> are loss of function alleles, we had the same concern as you proposed, i.e., the remaining truncated version of KCBP may interact with other partners and interfere with the complementation effects. So the best choice is using a null allele for the genetic complementation tests. The <italic>kcbp-</italic><italic>1</italic> (Salk_031704) mutant allele, which shows the same trichome phenotype as with the loss-of-function alleles of <italic>zwi-3</italic> and the <italic>zwi-w2</italic>, is the best candidate because it contains a T-DNA insertion in the third exon, and was confirmed to be a null allele (please see Figure 3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Humphrey et al., 2015</xref>). The homozygous <italic>kcbp-1</italic> lines, which were identified by detecting the T-DNA insertion (please see the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>), were used to be the null KCBP background in our complementation tests, and the primers were already listed in the primer list in the previous version.

We have provided essential background information, which shows that <italic>ZWICHEL</italic> and <italic>KCBP</italic> are the same gene, but initially were characterized <italic>via</italic> different approaches by different groups, respectively. KCBP was firstly identified as a novel kinesin containing a calmodulin-binding domain by biochemical approaches using biotinylated calmodulin as a probe in 1996 (Reddy et al., 1996). The <italic>zwichel</italic> mutants were firstly characterized to show the typical <italic>zwichel</italic> trichome phenotype in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hulskamp et al., 1994</xref>), and then the <italic>ZWICHEL</italic> gene was cloned and found to encode the KCBP protein in 1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oppenheimer et al., 1997</xref>). Please see paragraph 3 of the Introduction.</p><p>The information about <italic>zwi</italic> alleles has also been included in the revised manuscript. As mentioned earlier, among the <italic>zwichel</italic> (<italic>zwi</italic>) alleles, the <italic>zwi-3</italic> allele and <italic>zwi-w2</italic> allele were frequently used in previous studies. The <italic>zwi-3</italic> allele in Columbia ecotype background, which is expected to produce a truncated ZWI protein (KCBP) of 522 amino acids lacking the coiled-coil and motor domains, shows the typical, strong <italic>zwichel</italic> trichome phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oppenheimer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krishnakumar and Oppenheimer, 1999</xref>). And the <italic>zwi-w2</italic> allele in RLD ecotype background shows weaker <italic>zwichel</italic> trichome phenotype, containing a small portion (about 15.9 %) of three-branched trichomes, because sequence analysis revealed that although a C to T transition results in a stop codon at amino acid position 72, re-initiation of translation likely occurs using the in-frame AUG ∼20 bp downstream from that mutation site as the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Folkers et al., 2002</xref>). To find a strong or null <italic>KCBP/ZWICHEL</italic> allele in Columbia ecotype background, we searched the Salk collection in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://abrc.osu.edu/">Arabidopsis Biological Resource Cente</ext-link>r, and finally selected the accession of Salk_031704, which contains a T-DNA insertion in the third exon (22 exons in the <italic>KCBP/ZWICHEL</italic> gene) and shows typical, strong <italic>zwichel</italic> trichome phenotype. Coincidently, the Salk_031704 strong allele was used in recent studies, and was designated either as <italic>kcbp-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19"><italic>Humphrey et al., 2015</italic></xref>) or as <italic>zwiA</italic> (accession is N531704; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arabidopsis.info/StockInfo?NASC_id=531704">http://arabidopsis.info/StockInfo?NASC_id=531704</ext-link>), which was ordered from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buschmann et al., 2015</xref>).

The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref> has been included as the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>. Furthermore, we performed detailed genetic identification of the <italic>kcbp-1/zwiA</italic> allele according to your suggestion. Sequencing analysis revealed that the T-DNA insertion is in the third exon and located at the position of 957 bp downstream the ATP start codon of the <italic>KCBP</italic> gene (please see the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>, and its legend), and introduces a premature stop codon 61 bp downstream the insertion site by frame shift. As expected, we couldn’t detect the transcripts of the <italic>KCBP</italic> after the T-DNA insertion, but we indeed detected weaker transcription of partial <italic>KCBP</italic> in front of the insertion site (please see the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). So, the <italic>kcbp-1/zwiA</italic> mutant is expected to produce a short peptide of 284 amino acids containing the first 263 amino acids of KCBP at a lower level. Nevertheless, the <italic>kcbp-1/zwiA</italic> allele is still the best choice for us because it shows strong, typical <italic>zwichel</italic> trichome phenotype, and is in Columbia ecotype background and publicly available, thus it is frequently used in recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buschmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Humphrey et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, we don’t think that the N-terminal 263 amino acids residual in the <italic>kcbp-1/zwiA</italic> mutant would affect the complementation tests because most of the constructs (6/9) could rescue the typical <italic>zwichel</italic> trichome defects (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Actually, the <italic>zwiA</italic> had also been successfully used for the genetic complementation in the most recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buschmann et al., 2015</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
