Here, we reconstructed human fetal pancreatic differentiation using cell surface markers. We demonstrate that at 7weeks of development, the glycoprotein 2 (GP2) marks a multipotent cell population that will differentiate into the acinar, ductal or endocrine lineages. Development towards the acinar lineage is paralleled by an increase in GP2 expression. Conversely, a subset of the GP2<sup>+</sup> population undergoes endocrine differentiation by down-regulating GP2 and CD142 and turning on <italic>NEUROG3</italic>, a marker of endocrine differentiation. Endocrine maturation progresses by up-regulating SUSD2 and lowering ECAD levels. Finally, in vitro differentiation of pancreatic endocrine cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells mimics key in vivo events. Our work paves the way to extend our understanding of the origin of mature human pancreatic cell types and how such lineage decisions are regulated.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27564.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27564.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>pancreas</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011102</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>602587</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scharfmann</surname><given-names>Raphaël</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innovative Medicines Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>115439</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scharfmann</surname><given-names>Raphaël</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A set of cell surface markers reconstruct human pancreatic differentiation and enable the segregation of pancreatic functions into specific populations.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intensive efforts are currently dedicated towards the development of cell replacement therapies using cell types derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC). Human insulin-producing beta cells represent a paradigm for this type of objective. These cells have a major physiological function, regulating circulating glucose levels by producing and secreting insulin. In patients suffering from type one diabetes, these cells are destroyed by an autoimmune mechanism, and would thus need to be replaced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benthuysen et al., 2016</xref>). Beta cell replacement holds immense promises for diabetic patients and current strategies have reached major milestones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pagliuca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Russ et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rezania et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is well accepted that a more detailed understanding of beta cell development in human is required to generate unlimited functional human beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The adult pancreas is composed of acinar cells that excrete enzymes into the duodenum through a ductal tree, and of endocrine cells (approximately 1% of the total pancreatic cells) that are clustered together forming the islets of Langerhans. The endocrine cells secrete hormones such as insulin (beta cells), glucagon (alpha cells) somatostatin (delta cells), pancreatic polypeptide (gamma cells) and ghrelin (epsilon cells). The pancreas develops from the primitive gut tube that evaginates into a dorsal and a ventral anlage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pan and Wright, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jennings et al., 2015</xref>). Multipotent epithelial pancreatic progenitors co-expressing the transcription factors PDX1 and NKX6-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nelson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cebola et al., 2015</xref>) proliferate upon signals (such as FGF10) from the adjacent mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhushan et al., 2001</xref>) and subsequently differentiate into the acinar, ductal and endocrine lineages. Endocrine commitment is initially marked by the expression of a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, NEUROG3, and followed by the expression of the mature endocrine markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gradwohl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gu et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Due to the difficulties associated with procuring staged human fetal tissues and the limited tools for their analysis, few data on human development is available and the majority of knowledge on tissue development derives from animal models. This also applies to the pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jennings et al., 2015</xref>) where only a limited number of studies have been performed on human pancreatic development. Theses studies demonstrate similarities but also differences between rodent and human pancreatic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scharfmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jennings et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nair and Hebrok, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Knowledge on human pancreatic development remains limited. More information exists concerning human hematopoietic cell differentiation thanks to the characterization and use of cell surface antigens that enabled to identify, quantify and purify hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors at different stages of their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eaves, 2015</xref>). By mirroring the hematopoietic field, we developed here an approach where cell surface markers are used to recapitulate the hierarchical sequence of human pancreatic development. Specifically, we characterized the expression levels of specific markers at different stages of human pancreatic development corresponding to 7 to 12 weeks of development (WD). First we purified human pancreatic epithelial cells by selecting cells positive for the transmembrane glycoprotein EPCAM and by excluding CD45<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic and CD31<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells. Next we segregated pancreatic epithelial cells into four populations based on the GP2 and CDH1 (ECAD) expression levels. We observed that the expression levels of GP2 and ECAD correlate with acinar, ductal and endocrine functions. By using the additional cell surface markers CD142 and SUSD2 we further refined endocrine cell differentiation. Finally, our development model also applies to the in vitro differentiation of hPSCs into pancreatic endocrine cells.</p><p>Taken together our work provides a novel approach to study human fetal pancreas development and bridges the path between in vivo and in vitro differentiation of human pancreatic endocrine cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EPCAM expression is restricted to the epithelium in the human fetal pancreas</title><p>We tested if EPCAM can be used to purify human fetal pancreatic epithelial fraction enriched in pancreatic progenitors. CD31 and CD45 were used to exclude endothelial and hematopoietic cells respectively. Using this combination of antibodies on human fetal pancreatic cells (9.7WD), we detected three distinct fractions: the CD45<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>+</sup> fraction (the endothelial/hematopoietic cells), the CD45<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup>EPCAM<sup>-</sup> fraction, and the CD45<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup>EPCAM<sup>+</sup> fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To unveil which fraction contained the pancreatic progenitors, we assayed the expression of PDX1 and NKX6-1. Immunohistochemistry analysis of human fetal pancreatic sections showed that EPCAM<sup>+</sup> cells expressed PDX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). FACS analysis demonstrated that PDX1 and NKX6-1 were co-expressed in the CD45<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup>EPCAM<sup>+</sup> fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>).

These results suggest that a combination of the cell surface markers EPCAM, CD45, and CD31 can be used to purify the human fetal pancreatic epithelial fraction.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27564.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>EPCAM expression in the human fetal pancreas.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The flow cytometry plot represents CD45 and CD31 expression against EPCAM gated on live human fetal pancreatic cells (9.7WD), n = 9.

Furthermore, additional data indicate that ECAD levels are tightly modulated during endocrine differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gouzi et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed GP2 and ECAD expression levels in the CD45<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup>EPCAM<sup>+</sup> fraction at 9.4WD. GP2 expression in CD45<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup> was restricted to the EPCAM<sup>+</sup> fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). GP2 and ECAD expression segregated the CD45<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup>EPCAM<sup>+</sup> fraction into four distinct populations: GP2<sup>hi</sup>ECAD<sup>+</sup> (named GP2<sup>hi</sup>), GP2<sup>+</sup>ECAD<sup>+</sup> (named GP2<sup>+</sup>), GP2<sup>-</sup>ECAD<sup>+</sup> (named GP2<sup>-</sup>), and the GP2<sup>-</sup>ECAD<sup>low</sup> (named E<sup>low</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Remarkably, the cell frequencies of the four populations were well conserved from one pancreas to the other, demonstrating inter-individual homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We assayed the dynamic expression of GP2 and ECAD in the pancreatic epithelial fraction (CD45<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup>EPCAM<sup>+</sup>) during development (from 7WD to 12WD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). At 7WD the epithelial fraction was essentially GP2<sup>+ </sup>(96 ± 1%). From 7WD to 8.4WD, the GP2<sup>-</sup> population evolves from 2 ± 1% to 34 ± 6% (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Interestingly, from 8.6WD, we detected cells with a lower ECAD level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). This E<sup>low</sup> population further increased in frequency from 10 ± 2% at 9.4WD to 18 ± 3% at 12WD (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). At 9.4WD, we also detected a GP2<sup>hi</sup> population, increasing in frequency during development (3 ± 1% at 9.4WD to 20 ± 5% at 12WD; p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Altogether, the temporal and continuum GP2 and ECAD expression suggest a progeny relationship between specific cell populations, the GP2<sup>+</sup> population would differentiate either into a GP2<sup>hi</sup> population or into a GP2<sup>-</sup> population that would later decrease its ECAD level to give rise to the E<sup>low</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27564.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>GP2 and ECAD expression in the human fetal pancreatic epithelium.</title><p>GP2 and ECAD expressions were assayed by flow cytometry during development.

As a non-epithelial control, we included the CD45<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup>EPCAM<sup>-</sup> fraction (population M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Due to limitations in cell numbers, the GP2<sup>hi</sup> population was only sorted at 11WD. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the sorted populations at 9WD revealed three clusters. PC1 separated the epithelial populations (GP2<sup>hi</sup>, GP2<sup>+</sup>, GP2<sup>-</sup> and E<sup>low</sup>) from the mesenchymal fraction (M), while PC2 segregated the E<sup>low</sup> population from the GP2<sup>hi</sup>, GP2<sup>+</sup> and GP2<sup>-</sup> populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using Gene Ontology database indicated that digestion was the most represented biological process in the GP2<sup>hi</sup> and GP2<sup>+</sup> populations while endocrine functions (insulin and peptide secretion, hormone secretion) were enriched in the E<sup>low</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Although a large set of data is available concerning development in rodent models, there is only limited knowledge on human development. Importantly, while rodent and human pancreatic development share many similarities, they differ on several aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scharfmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nair and Hebrok, 2015</xref>). For example, the global shape and the way islet cells cluster are different between rodent and human pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brissova et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, the expression pattern of major transcription factors crucial for proper pancreas development such as NEUROG3, NKX2-2 and PDX1 differ between rodent and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Villasenor et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salisbury et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sussel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohlsson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heimberg et al., 2000</xref>). As an example, NEUROG3 is expressed in two waves during rodent fetal pancreatic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Villasenor et al., 2008</xref>) while only a single-phase is observed in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>). It can be speculated that the number of differences between rodents and humans are under-estimated and more will be discovered by studying human pancreatic development. This knowledge will be essential to better design protocols to direct pluripotent stem cells towards functional insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pagliuca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rezania et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Russ et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Major progress has recently been made in the field of hPSC differentiation and a number of different cell types can be efficiently generated either in vivo following transplantation into immune-incompetent mice or in vitro under controlled conditions. However, the cells generated in vitro from hPSC do not seem fully differentiated and in some cases, display a fetal phenotype rather than an adult one. This is the case for hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baxter et al., 2015</xref>), cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karakikes et al., 2015</xref>), neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Playne and Connor, 2017</xref>) and pancreatic beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hrvatin et al., 2014</xref>). These partial successes could be in part due to the limited knowledge on human cell development. Here, we specifically designed new approaches to dissect in great detail pancreatic differentiation in human. We based our study on human fetal pancreases from 7 to 13WD. This developmental period corresponds to E12.5-E17 in the mouse when pancreatic progenitors first proliferate and next develop into differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gittes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jennings et al., 2015</xref>). At 6-7WD, the human pancreatic epithelium is mainly composed of PDX1<sup>+</sup>NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> pancreatic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cebola et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Riedel et al., 2012</xref>) while endocrine cells are extremely rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Polak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castaing et al., 2001</xref>). During the following weeks, proliferating epithelial pancreatic progenitors differentiate into endocrine, acinar and duct cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Capito et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The fetal pancreas is a compound organ composed of epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial and hematopoietic cells. We excluded endothelial and hematopoietic cells using CD31 and CD45 antibodies and used the transmembrane glycoprotein EPCAM as a marker to segregate the fetal pancreatic epithelium from the mesenchyme. Previous data indicated that EPCAM is expressed during human fetal life (18-20WD) in the ductal pancreatic epithelium and in developing islet-like cells but also in the adult human pancreas in duct and islet cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cirulli et al., 1998</xref>). Based on this previous report we demonstrated that EPCAM also marks the fetal pancreatic epithelium at earlier developmental stages, between 7 and 12WD. Moreover, we demonstrated that the EPCAM<sup>+</sup> compartment contains PDX1<sup>+</sup>NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> double-positive cells, a hallmark of pancreatic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cebola et al., 2015</xref>). Our data also indicate that 45% of the EPCAM<sup>+</sup> compartment expresses lower levels of PDX1 and NKX6-1. It would be interesting to determine if these cells are upstream progenitors of EPCAM<sup>+</sup>PDX1<sup>+</sup>NKX6-1<sup>+</sup> cells as recently suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ameri et al., 2017</xref>). Then we further segregated the fetal pancreatic epithelium into four distinct populations using the cell surface markers GP2 and ECAD. GP2 is a glycoprotein that is highly enriched in the acinar cells of the adult pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoops and Rindler, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2004</xref>). Limited knowledge is available on GP2 expression during pancreatic development. Very recently, using a model of pluripotent stem cells differentiation into pancreatic endocrine cells, GP2 was identified as a novel cell surface marker of human pancreatic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ameri et al., 2017</xref>). Our ex vivo data further support this claim. First, we observed that at 7WD, nearly all pancreatic epithelial cells are GP2<sup>+</sup>. Moreover, as development proceeds, the frequency of GP2<sup>+</sup> cells decreases. Finally, transcriptomic profiling performed at different developmental stages strongly suggests that the GP2<sup>+</sup> population can differentiate into endocrine and exocrine cells. Collectively, these data indicate that in the early human fetal pancreas, GP2 is indeed a cell surface marker of a multipotent cell population. Although the GP2<sup>+</sup> cell population is multipotent, it is not yet certain if the GP2<sup>+</sup> population contains multipotent GP2<sup>+</sup> progenitor that can differentiate into the three lineages (endocrine, acinar and ductal) or represent a mixture of GP2<sup>+</sup> progenitors already committed to a specific lineage. This could be addressed by utilizing a single cell culture approach. However, our attempts so far to culture so few cells sorted from human fetal pancreas have failed. Discovering new and efficient culture conditions such as co-culture on feeder layers could alleviate this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trott et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In animal models, cell adhesion molecules have emerged as key regulators of embryonic morphogenesis and this topic has been extensively studied using pancreatic development as a model organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Semb, 2004</xref>). As an example, during mouse and chick development, Pdx1<sup>+</sup>Nkx6.1<sup>+</sup> progenitors express high levels of ECAD. NEUROG3<sup>+</sup> endocrine progenitors will develop from such pancreatic progenitors while lowering their ECAD level during their delamination from the ductal tree to develop into pancreatic endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gouzi et al., 2011</xref>). Information remains scarcer on the regulation of ECAD levels during human development. Our results indicate that at 7WD, GP2<sup>+</sup> pancreatic progenitors express ECAD at high levels. At 8.6WD, ECAD<sup>low</sup> cells appear, their frequency increasing while development progresses. Interestingly, NEUROG3-expressing cells first appear at 8.4WD in the ECAD<sup>+</sup> population and are found later on in the ECAD<sup>low</sup> population. Whether it is linked to their delamination remains to be demonstrated. This step is followed (at 8.6WD) by the expression of endocrine markers such as <italic>CHGA</italic>, <italic>NEUROD1</italic> and <italic>INS.</italic> Of importance, endocrine cells expressed low but significant levels of ECAD. This perfectly fits with mouse data that indicate that during development ECAD function is necessary for proper aggregation of endocrine cells after delamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dahl et al., 1996</xref>). Taken together, our data demonstrate that ECAD levels are tightly regulated during specific steps of human pancreatic development.</p><p>We further refined specific pancreatic cell populations by using CD142 and SUSD2 found in our transcriptomic analysis as additional cell surface markers. CD142 has been proposed as a marker of pancreatic endodermal cells that also labels additional cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelly et al., 2011</xref>). SUSD2 was previously used as a marker to enrich <italic>NEUROG3<sup>+</sup></italic> from hPSC derived pancreatic cells and the human fetal pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Here, with our set of markers we reconstructed human pancreatic cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). The full combination of markers was required for this reconstruction as none of the markers was specific to the different subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our data indicate that GP2<sup>+</sup>CD142<sup>+</sup> pancreatic progenitors can either give rise to GP2<sup>hi</sup>CD142<sup>+</sup> acinar cells or enter the endocrine pathway and express <italic>NEUROG3</italic> by turning off GP2 and CD142. Endocrine maturation further progresses by up-regulating SUSD2 and decreasing ECAD level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). The first <italic>INS<sup> +</sup></italic> cells were detected at 8.6WD in the E<sup>low</sup> population as SUSD2<sup>+</sup> and later on as SUSD2<sup>-</sup>. Recently, differences in gene expression and functionality were observed between fetal, neonatal and adult beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hrvatin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jermendy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blum et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, heterogeneity between adult beta cells was also recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bader et al., 2016</xref>). Whether <italic>INS<sup> +</sup></italic> cells positive for SUSD2 represent a first wave of beta cells that could be poly-hormonal remains to be tested. Moreover, comparative analyses between <italic>INS<sup> +</sup></italic> cells from E<sup>low</sup>SUSD2<sup>+</sup> and E<sup>low</sup>SUSD2<sup>-</sup> subsets will define the differences in their transcriptional factor networks.</p><p>FACS-based approaches have been used since the eighties in the hematopoietic field to dissect hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spangrude et al., 1988</xref>). However, it has rarely been used in the field of pancreatic development and even less frequently with human fetal pancreases. In the pancreas, the majority of the cell sorting approaches was performed by analyzing fluorescent signals from tagged proteins derived from transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miyatsuka et al., 2014</xref>). While highly informative, this strategy cannot be used to dissect human pancreatic development. Antibodies against cell surface markers were used in a limited number of studies on pancreas development and mainly in rodents. It was found that a combination of CD49f and CD133 antibodies can be used to enrich fraction in mouse pancreatic progenitors expressing <italic>NEUROG3</italic>-expressing cells with some data on human fetal pancreas. However, the enrichment in <italic>NEUROG</italic>3 on human fetal pancreas was limited using this combination of markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sugiyama et al., 2007</xref>). More recently, SUSD2 was used as a marker to enrich NEUROG3<sup>+</sup> cells in hPSC -derived pancreatic cells and in the human fetal pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Our data confirm this point. However our single cell qPCR indicate that SUSD2 does not mark all, but only a subset of <italic>NEUROG3<sup>+</sup></italic> that co-expressed <italic>NEUROD1</italic> and <italic>NKX2-2</italic>. Thus, by using a combination of antibodies against cell surface markers, we demonstrate that cell populations highly enriched in specific functions can be sorted from the human fetal pancreas at different stages of development, allowing the reconstruction of the differentiation program. Our model constitutes a key advancement in understanding human fetal pancreas development by mapping out the pattern of differentiation of the three main pancreatic lineages. We further refined our work for the endocrine pathway by describing for the first time, discrete stages of human pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation and showed that our development model also applies to the in vitro differentiation of hPSCs into pancreatic endocrine cells. To the best of our knowledge, this type of side-by-side comparison that demonstrates that in vitro hPSC differentiation mimics in vivo events has rarely been done.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide a novel way of approaching human pancreatic differentiation. Our work will be useful to fill the limited knowledge on human pancreas development. It should also pave the way for developing new cell therapies for diabetic patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Pancreatic dissection and cell suspension preparation</title><p>All experiments on human fetal pancreas were performed at INSERM Paris, France.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Mark McCarthy (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Susana Chuva de Sousa Lopes (Reviewer #2); Timo Otonkoski (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have undertaken a cellular deconstruction of how the human pancreas develops by studying the expression dynamics of several surface markers between 7 and 12 weeks of development. There is particular focus on the insulin-producing β cells. The evolution of these cell populations was very dynamic during the developmental stages studied, demonstrating that endocrine cells arise in the population that down-regulates both ECAD and GP2 expression. Further refinement of the characterization was achieved by including the cell surface marker SUSD2. Finally, human pluripotent stem cells undergoing pancreatic differentiation were analysed by the same parameters, demonstrating that in vitro development followed the same principles identified in vivo.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The three referee reports are included as all raise important points that should be addressed (and would improve the manuscript). The major request focuses on more detailed analysis and reporting of existing data (and not the acquisition of new 'wet lab' data). While all individual points should to be addressed in a revised manuscript and / or the accompanying rebuttal letter, there are some common themes to the referee reports:</p><p>1) There is a need to improve the detail of the computational and statistical analyses. There would be benefit from incorporating existing datasets on other pancreatic cell-types into some of the analyses (as highlighted by reviewer 2). This would then assist in commenting on other endocrine cell-types (as requested by reviewer 3) and examining other important genes (PAX4 is mentioned by reviewer 1).</p><p>2) There is scope to include more information on specific genes, for instance underlying the GO terms, either as part of the figures or as additional supplementary tables.</p><p>3) All the data should be made freely available for download.</p><p>4) The Materials and methods need far more detail to enable others to follow the work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Thank you very much for letting me review this manuscript. The major novelty is in the cellular deconstruction of how a human organ (the pancreas) develops. This has not been undertaken before and is challenging for a solid organ (e.g. compared to the haematopoietic system). The data have direct translational benefit for stem cell researchers. I make comments to try and improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The data imply that a considerable number, 45% if I interpret the data correctly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, of EpCAM+ cells either lack or (more likely) have lower levels of PDX1 and NKX6.1. These are then excluded from downstream analyses. The immunohistochemistry and text imply that all EpCAM+ cells possess PDX1, i.e. these cells are pancreatic progenitors. What do the authors think these cells EpCAM+ / low PDX1/low NKX6.1 cells are? How do these cells fit with the notion of NKX6.1 'low' cells as described by the authors in their recent Cell Reports paper, Ameri et al.? In that study on differentiating hPSCs, these cells were argued to be earlier stage pancreatic progenitors with higher levels of cell proliferation. Perhaps the authors could integrate their thoughts on this topic into the current manuscript?</p><p>2) At several places in the manuscript, there is mention of very precise timing, e.g. '7.4 WD'. What does this mean? How was such accuracy determined over and above 7WD or 8WD? Moreover, the authors described triplicate experiments: are these biological replicates at this very precise time point? Or technical replicates from a single human embryonic pancreas. The manuscript would benefit on full detail regarding human tissue use, perhaps as a supplementary table.</p><p>3) Computational analyses. A number of improvements should be made to allow others to gain maximum benefit from the data.a) For instance, in the subsection “GP2 and ECAD define 4 populations in the human fetal pancreatic epithelium that develop sequentially” (and elsewhere) (unless I missed it) it is not clear what cut-offs were applied to define particular genes as enriched. I don't think this detail was in the Materials and methods. b) The genes underlying all the GO terms should be listed, perhaps as a supplementary table as this would help the reader interpret the data. c) 'We correlated these signatures with RNAseq Single Cell data'. How were these correlations undertaken? d) The heatmaps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> refer to very few genes. Why? And if selected, why were these particular genes chosen and (presumably) others overlooked?</p><p>4) Subsection “Acinar and endocrine functions segregate within the GP2 and ECAD populations”, end of first paragraph and elsewhere (e.g. subsection “CD142 and SUSD2 reveal heterogeneity within the GP2<sup>-</sup> and E<sup>low</sup> populations during development”, last paragraph): I would encourage the authors to avoid 'data not shown'. Either include the data or remove the interpretation.</p><p>5) I did not follow the text in the last paragraph of the subsection “CD142 and SUSD2 reveal heterogeneity within the GP2<sup>-</sup> and E<sup>low</sup> populations during development” referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>. This figure supplement does not detail SUSD2 or CD142?</p><p>6) The broad transcriptomics data are useful but at present only a limited number of key genes are discussed. Would it be possible to describe some additional key factors, some of which have been notoriously difficult to track down accurately in native human embryonic/fetal pancreas, such as PAX4? The precision with which the authors have picked apart human pancreatic differentiation should offer an opportunity to narrow down when PAX4 becomes expressed and in which precise cell-type.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-B</xref>. In the subsection “Endocrine progenitors develop in the GP2<sup>-</sup> CD142<sup>-</sup> SUSD2<sup>-</sup> subset and mature within the E<sup>low</sup>SUSD2<sup>+</sup> subset” the authors describe two different cell populations in which insulin is expressed in the earlier fetal pancreas at 8.6WD: an E<sup>low</sup>/CD142<sup>-</sup>/SUSD2<sup>+</sup> population but not in the E<sup>low</sup>/CD142<sup>-</sup>/SUSD2<sup>-</sup> population; and then the converse in older fetal pancreas at 10-12WD, namely in the E<sup>low</sup>/CD142<sup>-</sup>/SUSD2<sup>-</sup> population but now not in the E<sup>low</sup>/CD142<sup>-</sup>/SUSD2<sup>+</sup> population. At least to me, this is surprising as β cell differentiation operates over a window, i.e. β-cells are serially differentiating over time. Morphologically, there are differences-at the earlier time point β-cells tend to be scattered whereas at the later time point β-cells are more clustered. Therefore, my question is whether the authors have unearthed two distinct populations of β-cells?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have studied the expression dynamics of several surface markers in human pancreas from 7-12 weeks of development, mainly by FACS; and suggest an order of events during the differentiation of several lineages in the human pancreas.</p><p>1) The authors used single cell transcriptomics data from Segerstolpe et al. to generate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>, but I don't understand what values were used to generate the heatmap. I assume they used RPKM values, but the legend goes from -1 to 1, so I am confused. I suggest that figure is replaced by heatmaps for the selected genes showing all individual cells instead of using averages (?) and using RPKM values.</p><p>2) For robustness, the set of cells from Muraro et al., 2016, Cell Systems, 3:385 should also be included in two extra independent heatmaps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>. The authors should also include not only acinar, ductal, α and β, but also the mesenchymal, δ, ε and pp cells.</p><p>3) The authors should use more than one HKG to normalize the QPCR results, the probes used are stable they could use bactin, HPRT and PPIA instead of just one of those (they already have the 3 probes in house).</p><p>4) The authors differentiate hPSCs into pancreas progenitors, but from the results it is unclear which of the 3 different lines mentioned were used and for what experiments. Can this be clarified in the Results and figures? Were the 3 lines used for the same experiments? And are the results comparable? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: Could you specify what hPSCs were used for what experiments?</p><p>5) Discussion: you mention that culture of pancreatic cells have failed: could you be more specific about the reason for failure (cells don't attach; cells die; which conditions have you tried? What are the culture periods tried, etc.)?</p><p>6) The authors mention in the Discussion Ptf1, Cpa1 and cMyc as marking multipotent progenitors in mice. These genes were not analysed in the human data set. Were they expressed (and if yes, in what cells)? Could you include those genes in the heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>?</p><p>7) I don't understand what the samples with &quot;statistical significance&quot; in all QPCR graphs were compared to? Could you clarify that in the figures?</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>: the authors show the cells in the blue square stained with GP2 and ECAD. Could the authors also present the other 2 populations (in the two black squares) for the markers GP2 and ECAD? You should have that data acquired.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, C</xref>: If the authors want to present PCA in 3D, they have to provide lines projecting each dot into the lower area. The plots as presented are 2D…</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this study Ramond et al. have aimed to understand the sequential development of epithelial cell populations in the human fetal pancreas, focusing particularly on the emergence of the insulin-producing β cells. For this purpose, they have identified cell surface markers that were used to sort the cell populations between developmental stages estimated to represent 7-12 weeks. They identify a CD45-CD31-EPCAM+ population that includes the pancreatic progenitors. This population was then found to contain 4 subpopulations based on the expression of GP2 and E-Cadherin. The evolution of these cell populations was very dynamic during the developmental stages studied, demonstrating that endocrine cells arise in the population that downregulates both ECAD and GP2 expression. Further refinement of the characterization was achieved by including the cell surface marker SUSD2. Finally, human pluripotent stem cells undergoing pancreatic differentiation were analysed by the same parameters, demonstrating that the in vitro development follows the same principles identified in vivo.</p><p>Overall, the study represents an impressive amount of flow cytometry analysis in human fetal pancreas, taking into account the scarcity of this research material. These results contribute to the understanding of human pancreatic development and provide surface markers that could be utilized to isolate bona fide pancreatic endocrine progenitors. The novelty of the study relies in the combined used of previously reported and novel surface marker to delimit the target cell population, both in human fetal pancreas samples and stem cell derived cells. However, the novelty is decreased by the recent report by the same investigators (Ameri et al., Cell Reports 2017) in which GP2 was characterized as a surface marker for pancreatic endocrine progenitors in the human fetal pancreas and hPSCs.</p><p>The value of the study would be increased by adding the following analyses:</p><p>1) Out of all endocrine cells, the analysis focuses only on β cells. In which populations do the other major endocrine cell populations reside? It would be interesting to see at which stage and in which population within the GP2<sup>-</sup> ECAD<sup>low</sup> SUSD2<sup>+</sup> are other endocrine cell hormones than insulin expressed: is the GCG<sup>+</sup> population in SUSD2<sup>+</sup> or SUSD2<sup>-</sup>? What is the distribution of hormone+ endocrine cells in the single cell samples (6D and 6E)? Are there polyhormonal cells, as is often seen in hPSC differentiation?</p><p>2) In the fourth paragraph of the Discussion the authors describe the GP2<sup>+</sup> cell population to represent the multipotent &quot;tip&quot; cells described in the mouse embryo to express PTF1a, Cpa1 and c-Myc. Are these markers expressed in the human GP2<sup>+</sup> cells?</p><p>The quality of the presentation and the statistical analysis should be improved:</p><p>1) Many of the figures are difficult to interpret. In general, it would be advisable to present as much as possible of the results as the quantitative summary of all experiments (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and also include statistical comparison of the changes.</p><p>2) The immunofluorescent image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> should be made larger and clearer.</p><p>3) The methods in general are only superficially described and there are no detailed supplementary methods.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27564.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] 1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

On <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, 45% of the EPCAM+ cells express low levels of PDX1 and NKX6-1. In this context, it would really be interesting to compare the proliferative potential of EPCAM+ cells in relation to their NKX6-1 level. Indeed, defining cells that can be amplified from the human fetal pancreas is an important topic in the field. As suggested, we highlighted in the third paragraph of the Discussion section, the comparison with the Ameri et al. work of the new version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) At several places in the manuscript, there is mention of very precise timing, e.g. '7.4 WD'. What does this mean? How was such accuracy determined over and above 7WD or 8WD?</italic> </p><p>We determined the developmental age based on the length of the foot and the anatomy of the foot and the hand. With such information, the precise age was calculated using the formula from Manjunatha et al., 2012 (the Egyptian Journal of Forensic Sciences): Age = 4.11 X Foot Length + 5.60.

I don't think this detail was in the Materials and methods.</italic> </p><p>We now describe this point in the Materials and methods subsection “Transcriptomic statistical analysis”: the cut-offs we applied to define “specifically enriched genes”: “Each population (GP2<sup>hi</sup>, GP2<sup>+</sup>, GP2<sup>-</sup>, E<sup>low</sup> and M) was compared to the other populations using two-tailed Student t-test. Genes were considered as enriched in a specific population when over-expressed (p-value &lt; 0,05 and Fold Change &gt; 2) in a population compared to any of the others.

For this purpose, we searched for the expression of these enriched genes in the Segerstolpe et al. 2016 single cell RNAseq data and generated heatmaps representing expression levels of the fetal enriched genes in the different adult pancreatic cell subpopulations. This is now described in the subsection “Transcriptomic statistical analysis”.</p><p><italic>d) The heatmaps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> refer to very few genes. Why?

The term “selected” is now added in the second paragraph of the subsection “Acinar and endocrine functions segregate within the GP2 and ECAD populations”. We have now also added a new supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) based on gene ontology lists.</p><p><italic>4) Subsection “Acinar and endocrine functions segregate within the GP2 and ECAD populations”, end of first paragraph and elsewhere (e.g. subsection “CD142 and SUSD2 reveal heterogeneity within the GP2<sup>-</sup> and E<sup>low</sup> populations during development”, last paragraph): I would encourage the authors to avoid 'data not shown'. Either include the data or remove the interpretation.</italic> </p><p>In the previous version of the manuscript, the term “data not shown” was used twice. It concerned:</p><p>1) the comparative analysis between the Segerstolpe et al. 2016 RNAseq and the list of the specific enriched genes in the E<sup>low</sup> population at 9WD.

Would it be possible to describe some additional key factors, some of which have been notoriously difficult to track down accurately in native human embryonic/fetal pancreas, such as PAX4? The precision with which the authors have picked apart human pancreatic differentiation should offer an opportunity to narrow down when PAX4 becomes expressed and in which precise cell-type.</italic> </p><p>In the new version of the manuscript, we now display two more heatmaps for the acinar and endocrine pathways based on the GSEA analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>Concerning PAX4: It is true that while the role of PAX4 in rodent β cell development has been demonstrated, its expression pattern and role in human remains unknown. We cannot exclude differences between rodent and human for PAX4 expression, as is the case for the transcription factor NKX2-2, a target of NEUROG3 in human (Jennings Diabetes 2013). From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, we have learned that <italic>PAX4</italic> expression is enriched in the E<sup>low</sup> population both at 9 and 11WD. This information is indicated in the second paragraph of the subsection “Acinar and endocrine functions segregate within the GP2 and ECAD populations”. As a note for the reviewer, we have started to collect preliminary data that suggest that within the E<sup>low</sup> population, PAX4 is first expressed by the E<sup>low</sup>SUSD2<sup>+</sup> subset. In addition, in this population, PAX4 appears to be co-expressed with <italic>NEUROG3</italic>. We are also investigating if <italic>INS</italic> is also co-expressed with PAX4. As this set of information is preliminary at this stage, we decided not to include it in the new version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-B</xref>. In the subsection “Endocrine progenitors develop in the GP2<sup>-</sup> CD142<sup>-</sup> SUSD2<sup>-</sup> subset and mature within the E<sup>low</sup>SUSD2<sup>+</sup> subset” the authors describe two different cell populations in which insulin is expressed in the earlier fetal pancreas at 8.6WD: an E<sup>low</sup>/CD142<sup>-</sup>/SUSD2<sup>+</sup> population but not in the E<sup>low</sup>/CD142<sup>-</sup>/SUSD2<sup>-</sup> population; and then the converse in older fetal pancreas at 10-12WD, namely in the E<sup>low</sup>/CD142<sup>-</sup>/SUSD2<sup>-</sup> population but now not in the E<sup>low</sup>/CD142<sup>-</sup>/SUSD2<sup>+</sup> population. At least to me, this is surprising as β cell differentiation operates over a window, i.e. β-cells are serially differentiating over time. Morphologically, there are differences-at the earlier time point β-cells tend to be scattered whereas at the later time point β-cells are more clustered. Therefore, my question is whether the authors have unearthed two distinct populations of β-cells?</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting question. At this point, we do not have proof, but want to test the hypothesis that E<sup>low</sup>/CD142<sup>-</sup>/SUSD2<sup>+</sup><italic>INS<sup>+</sup></italic> cells could represent transient progenitors or pre-β cells. For this purpose, we are currently assaying the differences between E<sup>low</sup>/CD142<sup>-</sup>/SUSD2<sup>+</sup><italic>INS<sup>+</sup></italic> and E<sup>low</sup>/CD142<sup>-</sup>/SUSD2<sup>-</sup><italic>INS<sup>+</sup></italic> cells by single cell qPCR. A working hypothesis is that E<sup>low</sup>/CD142<sup>-</sup>/SUSD2<sup>+</sup><italic>INS<sup>+</sup></italic> would be poly-hormonal, which would not be the case for the E<sup>low</sup>/CD142<sup>-</sup>/SUSD2<sup>-</sup><italic>INS<sup>+</sup></italic> cells. Again, performing this type of experiment takes time due to the limitation in the number of fetal pancreases we have access to.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: Could you specify what hPSCs were used for what experiments?</italic> </p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>, we used AD3.1 iPSC. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref> we used 3 different lines: SA121 hESC, AD2.1 iPSC, AD3.1 iPSC. This information now appears in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, in the Results, and the Materials and methods subsection “Human pluripotent stem cells differentiation into pancreatic endocrine cells mimics human fetal endocrine cell development”. Results were comparable from one line to the other as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E-F</xref> by the limited variability observed from one experiment to the other.</p><p><italic>5) Discussion: you mention that culture of pancreatic cells have failed: could you be more specific about the reason for failure (cells don't attach; cells die; which conditions have you tried? What are the culture periods tried, etc.)?</italic> </p><p>We faced 3 main issues. First we have been and remain limited by the number of fetal pancreases we have access to. Second, the number of sorted cells when using combinations of antibodies is low (between 1,000 and 5,000 cells per fraction) and culturing such a limited number of cells is really challenging. Third, during the culture period, half of the sorted cells die (even with ROCK inhibitor). Thus, at the end of the culture period, the remaining cells are extremely difficult to analyse. We clearly need more time and experiments to solve the problems we encounter. A possibility could be to use a feeder layer such as 3T3-J2 cells as recently described (Trott et al., Stem Cell Reports 8:1675–1688, 2017) to amplify early progenitors. We started to design such a type of approach.</p><p><italic>6) The authors mention in the Discussion Ptf1, Cpa1 and cMyc as marking multipotent progenitors in mice. These genes were not analysed in the human data set. Were they expressed (and if yes, in what cells)? Could you include those genes in the heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>?</italic> </p><p>According to our transcriptome data, <italic>PTF1A, CPA1</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic> are expressed in the human fetal pancreas and enriched in GP2<sup>+</sup> compared to the E<sup>low</sup> population. This information can be extracted from the GEO platform (GSE96697) where we uploaded our data. But we did not test them in qPCRs. Following comments from the three reviewers we removed this paragraph.</p><p><italic>7) I don't understand what the samples with &quot;statistical significance&quot; in all QPCR graphs were compared to? Could you clarify that in the figures?</italic> </p><p>Thank you for pointing out this point. The comparisons are now directly highlighted on the figures. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and 7.</p><p><italic>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>: the authors show the cells in the blue square stained with GP2 and ECAD. Could the authors also present the other 2 populations (in the two black squares) for the markers GP2 and ECAD? You should have that data acquired.</italic> </p><p>We indeed had the data already acquired. Information on this topic now appears on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. The expression of GP2 and E-CADHERIN in CD45+/CD31+ is now presented in the red square and the expression of GP2 and E-CADHERIN in the CD45-CD31-EPCAM- in the green square.</p><p><italic>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, C</xref>: If the authors want to present PCA in 3D, they have to provide lines projecting each dot into the lower area.

In which populations do the other major endocrine cell populations reside? It would be interesting to see at which stage and in which population within the GP2<sup>-</sup> ECAD<sup>low</sup> SUSD2<sup>+</sup> are other endocrine cell hormones than insulin expressed: is the GCG<sup>+</sup> population in SUSD2<sup>+</sup> or SUSD2<sup>-</sup>? What is the distribution of hormone+ endocrine cells in the single cell samples (6D and 6E)? Are there polyhormonal cells, as is often seen in hPSC differentiation?</italic> </p><p>Our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) indicate that <italic>INS, GCG</italic> and <italic>GHRL</italic> are expressed in the E<sup>low</sup> population. This is the case both at 9 and 11WD. As pointed by the reviewer, in our previous single cell analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D-E</xref>), we did not include primers for hormones. We recently started to repeat the experiments looking at hormones following single cell qPCR. But, please keep into account that we remain limited by the scarcity of the fetal pancreases. The objective of the experiment is to further characterize the ECAD<sup>low</sup> SUSD2<sup>+</sup> and ECAD<sup>low</sup> SUSD2<sup>-</sup> subsets. We are for example asking whether poly-hormonal cells are detected. As a flavour, our first preliminary data indicate that ECAD<sup>low</sup> SUSD2<sup>-</sup> subset is highly enriched in <italic>INS</italic> mRNA when compared to ECAD<sup>low</sup> SUSD2<sup>+</sup> subset.</p><p><italic>2) In the fourth paragraph of the Discussion the authors describe the GP2<sup>+</sup> cell population to represent the multipotent &quot;tip&quot; cells described in the mouse embryo to express PTF1a, Cpa1 and c-Myc.
