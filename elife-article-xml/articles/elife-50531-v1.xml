synapse development and refinement in the developing brain, but it is unknown whether they are similarly involved during adult neurogenesis. By transiently depleting microglia from the healthy adult mouse brain, we show that microglia are necessary for the normal functional development of adult-born granule cells (abGCs) in the olfactory bulb. Microglial depletion reduces the odor responses of developing, but not preexisting GCs in vivo in both awake and anesthetized mice. Microglia preferentially target their motile processes to interact with mushroom spines on abGCs, and when microglia are absent, abGCs develop smaller spines and receive weaker excitatory synaptic inputs. These results suggest that microglia promote the development of excitatory synapses onto developing abGCs, which may impact the function of these cells in the olfactory circuit.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain has its own population of resident immune cells known as microglia, which defend against infections and are involved in conditions such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and other diseases. In the last decade, new studies have suggested that these cells also sculpt brain circuits during early development. They can ‘eat’ weak connections between neurons, and help strong ones to mature.</p><p>Most of brain ‘wiring’ happens during development, when the majority of neurons is born and connects together. However, a few brain areas can incorporate new neurons during adulthood into existing circuits. In mice for example, this process takes place in the olfactory bulb, the area that first processes smells: it is believed that new neurons connecting to existing ones helps to detect new odors. It is unclear, however, whether microglia also help to shape these connections, or if their role is confined to early development.</p><p>To investigate this question, Wallace et al. gave adult mice a drug that kills only microglia, and then examined how the neurons respond when the animals are exposed to smells. The results show that the new neurons that developed without microglia responded to fewer odors. These neurons also formed weaker connections and had physical features that indicated they might not have been properly incorporated into the circuit.</p><p>It may be possible to encourage new neurons to be born in brain areas that normally do not produce these cells in adulthood. Ultimately, this could potentially help to repair the damages of age or disease, but this will rely on understanding exactly how new neurons are integrated into existing brain circuits. Future work, however, is still necessary to figure out how much these new neurons could compensate for cells damaged by injury or disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adult neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>olfactory</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>adult-born granule cell</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC013329</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murthy</surname><given-names>Venkatesh N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE1144152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wallace</surname><given-names>Jenelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 DC016482</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wallace</surname><given-names>Jenelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS092578</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stevens</surname><given-names>Beth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013114</institution-id><institution>Broad Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Merkin Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stevens</surname><given-names>Beth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Harvard Center for Biological Imaging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Simmons Family Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wallace</surname><given-names>Jenelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Adult-born neurons in the olfactory bulb that develop in the absence of microglia have a higher density of small spines but weaker excitatory inputs and reduced responses to sensory stimuli.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microglia are critically important for normal brain development in the embryonic and early postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hammond et al., 2018</xref>). Originally thought to be primarily involved in injury and disease, many recent studies have implicated microglia in diverse neurodevelopmental functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tremblay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salter and Beggs, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hong et al., 2016</xref>). However, much less is known about what role microglia might play in the healthy adult brain, even during the process of adult neurogenesis, which can be thought of as an extension of developmental processes throughout the lifespan.</p><p>During early postnatal development, microglia have been implicated in the regulation of synaptic development, including activity-dependent synaptic pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stevens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tremblay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Paolicelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gunner et al., 2019</xref>) on one hand and promotion of synaptic development and maturation on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoshiko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miyamoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakayama et al., 2018</xref>). Although microglia seem well-positioned to perform similar roles to facilitate the integration of adult-born neurons into circuits in the adult brain in the dentate gyrus (DG) and olfactory bulb (OB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ekdahl, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rodríguez-Iglesias et al., 2019</xref>), most studies on microglial regulation of adult neurogenesis to date have focused on early stages of the process occurring in the neurogenic niches. For example, hippocampal adult neurogenesis is impaired in models of neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monje et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ekdahl et al., 2003</xref>) and in immune-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ziv et al., 2006</xref>). Microglia regulate adult neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the DG through ongoing phagocytosis of apoptotic neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sierra et al., 2010</xref>), although they do not seem to be similarly involved in the subventricular zone (SVZ) or rostral migratory stream (RMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kyle et al., 2019</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ribeiro Xavier et al., 2015</xref> for counterevidence).</p><p>Most of what is known about microglial involvement in later stages of neurogenesis is based on injury and disease models. Microglial activation via sensory deafferentation in the OB decreases the number of adult-born neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lazarini et al., 2012</xref>) and their spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denizet et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, lipopolysaccharide injection or CX3CR1 knockout activates microglia in the hippocampus and alters both inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jakubs et al., 2008</xref>) and excitatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolós et al., 2018</xref>) synapses onto adult-born neurons in the DG. These studies suggest that microglia can modulate the synaptic integration of adult-born neurons under inflammatory conditions, but raise the question of whether they are similarly involved in the healthy adult brain.</p><p>A recent study documented increased activity in principal neurons in the OB after microglial depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reshef et al., 2017</xref>). Here we investigate the cellular and circuit mechanisms behind this effect by analyzing the functional development of adult-born granule cells (abGCs) in the absence of microglia. We demonstrate that microglial depletion during, but not after abGC development reduces activity in abGCs that make inhibitory connections with principal cells in the OB. We show that microglia normally interact with spines in developing abGCs, and the volume of these spines is reduced when microglia are ablated. This is accompanied by a reduction in the amplitude of excitatory but not inhibitory inputs to abGCs, suggesting that microglia are essential for proper integration of abGCs in adult circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Microglia preferentially interact with spines on abGCs</title><p>We labeled cohorts of abGCs born using lentiviral injection into the RMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Consiglio et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Livneh and Mizrahi, 2012</xref>) of adult 8–12 week old mice. To visualize interactions between microglia and abGCs, we performed time-lapse in vivo two-photon imaging of the dendrites of dTomato-labeled abGCs in the external plexiform layer (EPL) of the OB over the first four weeks after injection in CX3CR1-GFP +/- mice, in which microglia are labeled with GFP (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Since GCs in the OB are axonless and their release sites are located at dendodendritic synapses on spines in the EPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rall et al., 1966</xref>), we chose to record calcium responses in these dendrites. We first recorded responses in anesthetized mice to a panel of 15 monomolecular odors (Materials and methods, <italic>Odor stimulation</italic>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), while simultaneously imaging morphology in the dTomato channel to aid in region of interest identification and image alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). AbGC responses to odors were sparse as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wallace et al., 2017</xref>), but across the population we could identify dendrites responding to most of the odors in our panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We characterized responses by taking the mean ΔF/F<sub>σ</sub> value over a five-second period following the onset of a two-second odor stimulus and plotted the cumulative distribution of dendritic responses across all odors.

Dendrites in PLX-treated mice also responded to fewer odors (for threshold response criteria, see Materials and methods, In vivo imaging analysis, Thresholds) (median (IQR): Control: 3 (1–6), PLX: 1 (0–4), p=1.16e-04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). We also found that lifetime sparseness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Willmore and Tolhurst, 2001</xref>), (bounded between 0 and 1, a low score indicates a sparser representation) was lower in dendrites in PLX-treated mice (median (IQR): Control: 0.18 (0.067–0.32), PLX: 0.067 (0–0.25), p=4.18e-04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). These effects were also significant when we performed hierarchical bootstrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saravanan et al., 2019</xref>) to take into account the fact that we imaged dozens of dendrites from each mouse, with dendrites in PLX-treated mice responding to fewer odors (mean Control: 3.6 ± 0.38, PLX: 2.8 ± 0.26, p=0.050) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</xref>) and having lower median response amplitudes (median Control: 0.14 ± 0.039, PLX: 0.070 ± 0.016, p=0.0011) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5D</xref>).

Interestingly, while response time courses were similar between control and PLX-treated mice in the anesthetized state (p=0.30), allowing us to characterize responses with a simple mean across the odor analysis period, principal components analysis of the ΔF/F<sub>σ</sub> traces for all cells’ responses to all odors revealed different response time courses in awake mice (p=0.004) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These differences were likely not due to changes in active sampling of odors since sniffing rates were not different during baseline or odor presentation periods (mean Baseline: Control = 3.49 Hz, PLX = 3.52 Hz, p=0.91; Odor: Control = 4.00 Hz, PLX = 3.94 Hz, p=0.81) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Importantly, our study is the first to link microglial depletion directly to changes in the in vivo activity and functional inputs of a specific affected cell population. We show that eliminating microglia has functional consequences for abGCs incorporating into the circuitry of the OB, reducing their responses to stimuli. Furthermore, we go on to investigate the physiological mechanisms and show that the dampened responses we observe are consistent with reduced spine volume and weaker excitatory inputs in neurons that develop in the absence of microglia.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>Several technical caveats must be acknowledged to allow proper interpretation of our study. While ablation of microglia with PLX5622 is highly efficient, it necessarily involves a period of microglial cell death, and it is unknown how this debris may be cleared or what effects it may have on other cell types. We have attempted to minimize these effects by beginning experiments at least three weeks after initiation of PLX5622 treatment, when the number of microglia should have reached steady state levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmore et al., 2014</xref>), but we cannot exclude the possibility of long-term effects resulting from microglial cell death. Encouragingly, there seems to be no upregulation of cytokines or GFAP with PLX treatment generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmore et al., 2014</xref>) or in the OB, specifically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reshef et al., 2017</xref>) in contrast to other methods for microglial depletion, which may cause a significant increase in GFAP+ astrocytes and a cytokine storm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruttger et al., 2015</xref>). However, we acknowledge that the array of possible inflammatory responses to microglial disruption is still poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liddelow and Barres, 2017</xref>) and may involve both responses to microglial cell death as well as reactions to the absence of normal homeostatic cues. Future work will be needed to characterize changes in crosstalk among different cell populations after microglial depletion and implications for the inflammatory environment. However, inflammation in the OB has been shown to generally reduce adult-born neuron numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lazarini et al., 2012</xref>) and spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denizet et al., 2017</xref>) as opposed to increasing spine density and reducing excitatory synapse strength as we show here, so it is unlikely that undetected inflammation relating to microglial depletion can fully account for the results we observe.</p><p>We also note that microglial depletion with PLX5622 is brain-wide. AbGCs receive local inputs from within the OB as well as feedback from other cortical areas and neuromodulatory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lepousez et al., 2013</xref>), so we cannot unambiguously attribute the effects on abGCs to changes within the OB. Future work will be necessary to investigate whether there is a change in the balance of distal (predominantly feedforward) and proximal (mostly feedback) inputs or instead a more general effect on excitatory synapse maturation and/or maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>AbGCs in the olfactory circuit</title><p>AbGCs become responsive to odor stimuli soon after they arrive in the OB and then undergo a period of functional refinement during which their initially broadly tuned responses become more selective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wallace et al., 2017</xref>) (although there may also be a subpopulation of abGCs that shows broadening of responses with maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Quast et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wallace et al., 2017</xref>). Although the mechanism behind this increase in stimulus selectivity is not well-understood, it may involve both a decrease in some aspects of excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carleton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nissant et al., 2009</xref>), especially dendritic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wallace et al., 2017</xref>), as well as selective reorganization of synaptic inputs such that mature abGCs become more responsive to a particular glomerular module at the expense of other inputs. We propose that abGCs in PLX-treated mice experience a normal drop in excitability (likely regulated by cell-intrinsic mechanisms) without a concomitant selective strengthening of specific synaptic inputs, leading to sparser odor responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This is consistent with the higher density of more filopodial-like spines in PLX-treated mice (characteristic of abGCs at an earlier stage of maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breton-Provencher et al., 2014</xref>) along with smaller mushroom spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and lower amplitude sEPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It is also possible that abGCs in PLX-treated mice could have generally lower excitability, but we regard this as unlikely since excitability has been mainly shown to affect survival rather than synaptic inputs in abGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2010</xref>), in contrast to what we observe here. Future work will be needed to disentangle the different aspects of abGC maturation and more fully elucidate which are affected by microglia.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary of results and model for the role of microglia in abGC maturation.</title><p>Young abGCs enter existing circuits and begin to make synapses, a process that involves the extension of filopodial spines that sample potential synaptic partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breton-Provencher et al., 2014</xref>). In control mice, abGCs undergo a coordinated process of synaptic formation and elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mizrahi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sailor et al., 2016</xref>), which leads to an increasing number of mushroom spines with mature synapses and higher frequency and amplitude excitatory synaptic currents as they mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Whitman and Greer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelsch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breton-Provencher et al., 2014</xref>).

In mice treated with PLX5622 to ablate microglia throughout the time course of abGC development, we hypothesize that abGCs undergo some parts of the maturation process, but not others. We show that aspects of excitability, such as input resistance, mature normally, and overall spine density increases to levels even above controls. However, synapses fail to mature, leading to overall smaller spines and lower amplitude sEPSCs. This may contribute to lower odor responsiveness in abGCs that have matured in the absence of microglia.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50531-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Though the effects on synaptic development that we observe in individual cells are modest (~15% reduction in median sEPSC amplitude in PLX-treated mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), these effects combined nonlinearly across many synapses likely become important near response threshold in vivo. Indeed, we observed larger effects on calcium responses recorded in vivo (median response amplitudes halved across all abGCs imaged in each PLX-treated animal, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5D</xref>), which likely represent dendritic calcium spikes or global calcium events accompanying somatic action potentials that result from simultaneous activation of many feedforward and feedback synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egger, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Microglia-neuron interactions in the adult brain</title><p>Though several studies have examined microglial motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nimmerjahn et al., 2005</xref>) and interactions between microglia and neuronal elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wake et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tremblay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sipe et al., 2016</xref>), it has been unclear whether microglia interact with synapses more often than would be expected by chance, given the dense synaptic milieu of the adult brain and the high degree of microglial process motility. Using automated methods to segment microglial processes from in vivo two-photon time-lapse imaging experiments and shuffle the resulting images for comparison, we demonstrated targeted motility towards mushroom spines on abGCs, which are likely to contain established excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Whitman and Greer, 2007</xref>). In the absence of microglia, we suggest that fewer spines attain mushroom morphology, leading to overall reduced spine volume and correspondingly weaker excitatory synapses. Concomitantly, we observed an increase in spine density in microglia-ablated animals, which is likely accounted for by filopodial spines which did not have functional or stable synapses (since we did not see an accompanying increase in the frequency of synaptic currents in PLX-treated mice). One potential unifying hypothesis is that microglia may prune weaker synapses, allowing stronger synapses to strengthen further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stevens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tremblay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Paolicelli et al., 2011</xref>). However, unlike other sensory systems that experience largescale pruning events during development, abGCs develop an increasing number of synapses over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carleton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breton-Provencher et al., 2014</xref>). This does not preclude a role for microglia in pruning inputs to these cells (in a situation in which synaptic formation occurs at a higher rate than elimination) but suggests that if this occurs, it is likely to be more subtle and difficult to detect with conventional methods. Although we did not directly observe pruning of dendritic spines in abGCs in our time lapse imaging experiments, it remains possible that microglia could prune presynaptic elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gunner et al., 2019</xref>)(which we did not image) or that our frame rate was too slow to observe such events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weinhard et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In addition to synaptic pruning, microglia may be involved in promoting synaptic strengthening.

It is still unclear whether these effects, similar to those that we observe in the PLX ablation model, are related to differences in spine surveillance and direct microglial-neuron signaling or due to altered microglial behavior, including changes in release of moderating factors or interactions with other cell types, such as astrocytes. We expect that in the future, a new generation of tools for more specifically modifying microglial gene expression and function during defined time windows will help clarify the mechanisms by which microglia affect synaptic development.</p><p>In addition, although most previous work has focused on microglial regulation of synapses, microglia may also regulate neuronal excitability through other mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peng et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, although we found no differences in passive membrane properties between abGCs in control versus PLX-treated animals, we cannot exclude additional possible effects of microglia on nonsynaptic aspects of abGC development, including active dendritic properties, that could also contribute to the reduced responsiveness we observe when microglia are ablated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Timing of microglial depletion</title><p>While our results suggest that the effect of microglial depletion is specific to developing abGCs (since our results with microglial depletion after abGC development did not reach statistical significance in most cases), we saw similar trends in reduced responses and excitatory inputs regardless of the timing of microglial depletion. This could be because lentiviral labeling is an imperfect method for isolating a single cohort of abGCs (so some abGCs in the ‘after development group’ may still be at an earlier stage of development – see discussion of newcomer cells in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wallace et al., 2017</xref>). Another possibility is that microglial depletion also affects mature abGCs, although to a lesser extent than developing abGCs.

Walter) was used to calculate and apply unmixing matrices for each image stack prior to further analysis. In Fiji, spine heads were delineated manually for each time point in the frame where they appeared brightest using the oval or polygon tools and ROI Manager and classified as either mushroom (spines whose spine head was wider than the spine neck at all timepoints) or filopodial (without a well-defined head). The Weka segmentation plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arganda-Carreras et al., 2017</xref>) was used to perform binary segmentation of microglial processes from background after training on five frames (that were fully segmented manually) selected to represent a variety of microglial morphologies and brightness variation across the three mice. To optimize our resolution, we segmented very conservatively by using z stacks to mark microglial processes only in the plane where they appeared brightest. This strategy combined with only delineating spine heads in the brightest frame means that we only detected the closest interactions between microglial processes and spine heads. The features chosen for segmentation training in Weka were Gaussian blur, Sobel filter, Hessian, and Difference of Gaussians. This approach allowed us to segment complex microglia morphology from background automatically in every image frame and obviated the need for corrections for bleaching or variations in brightness across different imaging fields. Imaging frames that were too dim to segment (usually due to loss of immersion water) were excluded. Each segmented image stack was checked manually to ensure that any residual bleed-through from the red channel did not appear in the segmentation. After segmentation, ROIs representing spine heads were exported to Matlab using a custom-written macro with the command getSelectionCoordinates. In Matlab, the ROIs were loaded onto the segmented image and the mean value of the binary microglia channel within each ROI at each timepoint (0 if there was no colocalization or up to one if all pixels were colocalized with a segmented microglial process) was measured. The frame was quantified as containing a microglia-spine interaction if the value of colocalization was greater than 0.05 (at least 5% of the spine head area overlapped by a microglial process). To compare the overlap between microglial processes and spine heads in the real data compared to what might be expected by chance, we iteratively translated the microglia channel relative to the marked spine head ROIs to calculate distributions for all the measured interaction parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunn et al., 2011</xref>). To do this, we took the original segmented image stack and translated it horizontally, vertically, or horizontally and vertically first by the maximum spine width across the whole data set (~32 pixels) to ensure none of the offsets would overlap the real data and then iteratively by the mean spine width (~10 pixels) to ensure each offset would be as uncorrelated as possible for a total of 231 offsets. Note that this method likely underestimates the significance of interactions in the real dataset because microglia cell bodies were never colocalized with spines in the real dataset (dendrites overlapping microglia cell bodies were not chosen for imaging) but were likely colocalized and quantified as interacting with spines in some of the offset datasets.

We previously estimated with our labeling and imaging strategy that about 1.4 times more dendrites than cells are represented in the dataset (and this is almost certainly an overestimate since this was based on the first week of imaging, where labeling is significantly sparser than at later timepoints). For ablation after development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the same fields of view were imaged before and after PLX treatment. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, we chose matching ROIs for the two sessions (any ROIs without similar morphology between the two sessions were excluded as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wallace et al., 2017</xref>) to quantify how much our imaging conditions changed between sessions without PLX treatment. However, we opted to choose ROIs independently for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> since matching ROIs always results in the exclusion of many ROIs, reducing sample size.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Motion correction</title><p>To correct for fast lateral motion and image drift, all image frames for a given field of view were aligned to the average of the first trial using cross-correlation based on rigid body translation (ImageJ plugin Moco)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dubbs et al., 2016</xref>). Frames with out-of-frame motion were removed based on the cosine similarity between each frame and the average intensity projection of the first trial (or the user-determined trial with the least motion for awake imaging). Image frames with cosine similarity that differed by more than 25% (30% for awake imaging) from the mean value for the user-determined best trial for that field of view or more than 20% (15% for awake imaging) from the mean of the baseline period for that trial were discarded. In some trials, immersion water dried up or laser power fluctuated, so trials were removed if their average brightness was less than half of the brightness of the average of the first three trials or if difference in brightness between the baseline and odor periods was greater than three times the standard deviation of brightness in the first trial. The entire trial was removed if, after these corrections, it contained less than 75% of the original frames during either the baseline or odor analysis period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Fluorescence changes</title><p>The average intensity in the GCaMP channel was calculated for each ROI, for each frame and for each odor. A response value for each cell-odor pair was calculated as the average ΔF/F<sub>σ</sub> value over the odor analysis period (5 s following odor onset) where F<sub>σ</sub> represents the standard deviation of fluorescence during the baseline period. We used F<sub>σ</sub> because we found that in many cases the baseline GCaMP6s fluorescence was so low in abGC dendrites that we could not reliably subtract the background as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wallace et al., 2017</xref>). Bleaching was corrected by fitting a single exponential to the florescence during the baseline period and taking the value at the end of the baseline period as the baseline mean, only for ROIs where the fluorescence during the last 2.5 s of the baseline period was greater than 1.1 times the fluorescence during the first 2.5 s. If, after correction for bleaching, baseline F<sub>σ</sub> was greater than 30% of the mean baseline fluorescence, that ROI was considered too noisy and was removed from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Event detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>)</title><p>Events were detected separately in each trace using the calculated ROC threshold (see next section) and any frames that were included in an event in any repeat were averaged across all repeats to obtain a mean event trace and the mean value in a 1 s period around the peak in this mean trace was then calculated as the average response to that odor.

Secondary and tertiary apical dendrites that were judged to be sufficiently bright, well-separated from adjacent or overlapping dendrites, at least 40 μm long, and extending at an angle from the imaging plane less than 45 degrees were chosen for tracing in Imaris. Each dendrite and all its dendritic protrusions less than 10 μm in length were manually traced using the Filaments function. Data from each dendrite were exported in a text file and imported into Matlab for plotting. For spine density, the Imaris property ‘Filament No. Spine Terminal Pts’ was used (meaning that branched spines were counted by the number of spine heads rather than attachment points). For spine head volume, the Imaris property ‘Spine Part Volume Head’ was used. For the classification of filopodial and mushroom spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, we used the Imaris properties ‘HeadMaxDiameter’ and ‘NeckMeanDiameter’ and classified spines as filopodial if they had maximum head diameter less than 1.5 times the neck mean diameter.

Mice were deeply anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and perfused with ice-cold modified ACSF solution (in mM: 120 choline chloride, 25 glucose, 25 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 7 MgSO4, 11.6 ascorbic acid, 3.1 pyruvic acid, 1.25 NaH2PO4). Brains were removed and placed in the same ice-cold modified ACSF. Coronal slices (300 µm thick) of olfactory bulbs were cut using a vibratome (VT1000S; Leica, Germany). Slices were incubated in oxygenated holding solution (in mM: 119 NaCl, 26.2 NaHCO3, 1 NaH2PO4*H2O, 2.5 KCl, 22 glucose, 1.3 CaCl2, 2.5 MgSO4) at 33°C for at least 30 min before being transferred to oxygenated ACSF (in mM: 119 NaCl, 26.2 NaHCO3, 1 NaH2PO4*H2O, 2.5 KCl, 22 glucose, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.3 MgSO4). Extra slices were maintained in holding solution at room temperature. Whole-cell recordings (Bessel filtered at 2.2 kHz and acquired at 10 kHz) were performed using patch pipettes filled with internal solution (in mM: 130 cesium gluconate, 5 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 12 phosphocreatine di(tris) salt, 3 Mg*ATP, 0.2 Na*GTP, 1 EGTA, 2.0 Na2-ATP, 0.5 Na3-GTP, pH 7.3) using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA) at 36°C. Cells were visualized with dTomato and DIC with custom-built optics on a BX51WI microscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) and recorded with pClamp 10.3 (Molecular Devices). Cell identity was confirmed by the presence of fluorescence material in the patch pipet after membrane rupture and/or cell fill with Alexa Fluor 488, and only cells that had a proximal dendrite that extended from the soma in the direction of the EPL while remaining beneath the surface of the slice (i.e. cells that had dendrites that did not appear to have been cut during slicing) were targeted for patching. Patch pipets had 8–11 MΩ open tip resistance. Series resistance was not compensated. Cells were recorded in continuous 10 s sweeps for five minutes with a test pulse at the beginning of every sweep, which was used to calculate series resistance and holding current in Matlab for initial quality control. sEPSCs were recorded at −70 mV and sIPSCs were recorded at 0 mV. We waited at least one minute after breaking into the cell before beginning recording for sEPSCs and at least 30 s after switching the holding potential for sIPSCs; sEPSCs were always recorded first.

The cell was excluded entirely if less than half of the recording sweeps remained after quality control. For each cell, separate test pulses (−10 mV, 20 ms) with 50 repetitions at 20 kHz were recorded before and after each set of recordings, and these files were used to calculate series resistance (based on the maximum current recorded at the beginning of the pulse), membrane resistance (based on the steady state current during the last 20% of the pulse), and cell capacitance (based on the time constant of an exponential fit between 20% and 80% of the current decay). Reported values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> are the means of these parameters from before and after the 5 min of sEPSC recordings. For sEPSCs and sIPSCs, all sweeps were concatenated for each cell (excluding 0.5 s around the test pulse), filtered with a 60 Hz band-stop filter with five harmonics in Matlab, and exported into Mini Analysis v. 6.0.7 (Synaptosoft). sEPSCs were detected with the following parameters: threshold 5, period to search a local minimum 10000, time before a peak to baseline 15000, period to search a decay time 20000, fraction of peak to find a decay time 0.37, period to average a baseline 1000, area threshold 20, number of points to average for peak 1, direction of peak ‘negative.’ After the initial detection step, ‘Scan and detect double peaks’ was selected. sIPSCs were detected with the following parameters: threshold 8, period to search a local minimum 10000, time before a peak to baseline 6000, period to search a decay time 20000, fraction of peak to find a decay time 0.37, period to average a baseline 1000, area threshold 80, number of points to average for peak 1, direction of peak ‘positive.’ In both cases, the detection was manually inspected, and the timepoints spanning any sections of the trace that exhibited increased noise (typically due to fluctuations in seal quality that caused many obviously false positive events) were noted.

For electrophysiology, we aimed to obtain data from at least 20 cells per group from 3 to 4 mice, consistent with other electrophysiological investigations in the field that were able to reveal effects of various manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pallotto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Quast et al., 2017</xref>). Littermates were randomly allocated into control or PLX-treated groups for all experiments. Raw data are shown in every figure, in the form of a scatterplot overlaid on a bar graph when N &lt; 40 or as a cumulative distribution otherwise. Non-parametric statistical tests were used for all comparisons, so no assumption of normality of data was made. Details for each statistical test can be found in the corresponding figure legend, and the rationale behind each is described here. The two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the medians of all unpaired non-normal distributions and correspondingly, the medians are plotted with bars in the figures. A one-tailed permutation test was used to test whether means in the real data were significantly higher than those in offset imaging data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Specifically, a sample was taken with replacement across the units of the upper level. For example, in the two-photon imaging data, a sample was taken of the individual mice that were imaged (the sample size was equal to the number of mice). Next, a sample was taken with replacement across the lower level, in this case the dendrites that were imaged. We chose to sample an equal number of dendrites from each mouse, regardless of the original number of dendrites imaged, to ensure that each animal would be represented equally (since the number of dendrites originally imaged for each animal was related to experimental considerations such as the density of viral labeling in each animal). For this level, we chose a sample size (100 dendrites) slightly larger than the largest sample per unit in the original data to ensure a representative sample would be obtained from each mouse. We then report the mean and the standard error of the bootstrapped parameter (either mean, median, or proportion, which is stated in each case) across the 1000 samples. We calculate a p value directly, which represents the probability that the parameter for the control group is greater than that for the PLX-treated group (for cases where the parameter for the PLX-treated group is significantly greater, such as the proportion of dendrites that were unresponsive in the imaging data, we report 1 – p to avoid confusion with standard p values). The same procedure was performed to analyze datasets for spine morphology (upper level = dendrites, lower level = spines, sample size = 100 spines) and electrophysiology (upper level = cells, lower level = EPSCs or IPSCs, sample size = 5000 EPSCs or IPSCs).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Martin Wienisch, Joseph Zak, Vikrant Kapoor, and Julien Grimaud from the Murthy lab for assistance with equipment setup and training in relevant techniques.

olfactory bulb&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Amanda Sierra (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers were interested in the topic and acknowledged the sophisticated approach to the issue of microglial-synaptic interactions. In particular the set of analyses were thorough and reasonable given the results. However, we were somewhat disappointed by the overall lack of clear mechanism (either tested or hypothesized) about what the microglia are actually doing in the OB, and with respect to abGC maturation/integration. The key points discussed between reviewers are included here, but the full original reviews are at the end of this letter. We urge the authors to fully address the concerns raised as we expect that a revised manuscript would require an additional round of review given the extent of the comments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors must acknowledge that depleting microglia may have unintended side effects (including inflammation) and that many microglial functions (beyond spine surveillance) will be altered.</p><p>2) Please better validate the method used to quantify spine surveillance.</p><p>3) The dendritic segments used for quantitation need to be specified and with a sufficient sample size to allow robust interpretation.</p><p>4) Please explain the relationship of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> correlates with spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> for these experiments.</p><p>5) Perhaps most importantly, a mechanistic explanation of how microglial surveillance leads to increase spine response to odors is needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Wallace et al. applied sophisticated in vivo 2-p imaging system to demonstrate a critical role of microglia in regulating development of adult-born neurons presumably by interacting with mushroom spines. Importantly, they showed that microglia ablation reduces odor responses of the adult-born neurons but had no effect on mature neurons, which correlates with reduced amplitude of EPSCs and reduced spine volume in adult-born neurons. In general, the experiments are well-designed and properly performed. The data generally support the conclusion. The Discussion section is particularly impressive, as the authors have extensively discussed potential caveats and future directions. Overall, this manuscript is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> pending addressing the following points.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) For spine analysis, the author claimed they picked 1-5 apical dendrites, but it is unclear where those dendritic segments come from. For instance, the spine density maybe different in proximal versus distal dendritic regions. To be consistent, authors should pick the same number of dendritic segments at similar dendritic locations. Furthermore, the number of adult-born neurons they have for spine analysis is considered low. More cells are required for analysis.</p><p>2) Authors studied the interaction between microglia processes and dendritic spines of the adult-born neurons. However, they performed Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in dendrites when multiple distinct odors were introduced. It is unclear how dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal correlates with spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals upon odor administration.</p><p>3) Authors consider 5-6 week old neurons as adult-born neurons, and 3 month old neurons as mature neurons. The assumption is that they represent different stages of maturation. However, it is unclear whether the spine phenotype is different between 5-6 week old and 3 month old neurons. Specifically, how different the quantity and quality of the mushroom spines in 5-6 week and 3 month old neurons? Some basic quantification on the spine phenotype from the two time points need to be provided to support the rationale of choosing these two time points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Wallace et al. performed series of two photon imaging studies of microglial interactions with developing and mature adult born granule cells (abGCs) in the olfactory bulb. Their findings indicate that microglial processes preferentially interact with abGC spines, and when pharmacologically ablated, leads to decreased odor responsivity and amplitude of excitatory input onto abGCs. Overall, this study presents straightforward evidence that microglia in the olfactory bulb influence responsivity of adult-born granule cells to odors. Specifically, a strength of this study is their use of GCaMP imaging from abGC dendrites in vivo, which shows that the amplitudes of abGC responses to odors are selectively reduced when microglia are ablated during abGC development. The authors present this as a mechanism by which microglial ablation may lead an increase in principle cell odor responses. While the imaging of odor responses in abGC dendrites after microglial ablation is novel and compelling, the supporting evidence regarding microglial interactions with abGC spines and the functional significance (electrophysiology) raise some questions and concerns.</p><p>– The impact of this study would be greatly enhanced by some mechanistic explanation for how microglial contact with mushroom spines leads to an increased response to odors. The authors briefly speculate about pruning and stabilization, but it seems like it is well-within the capabilities of the authors to directly test the pruning hypotheses. Or is this developmental stalling? On the other hand, the impact would also be enhanced by demonstrating a behavioral phenotype after microglial ablation. For example, the authors speculate at the end of the Discussion that &quot;…microglial regulation of (abGC) development may contribute to ongoing plasticity in the olfactory system.&quot; This could certainly be tested similarly as in the papers cited as supporting evidence.</p><p>– Although many appropriate analyses were performed, in general the results show relatively small effects, and correlations at times come across a bit overinterpreted. For example, the effect observed regarding microglial interactions with mushroom spines seems trivially small considering the weight that is put on it throughout the paper. Can the differences in average interaction time and number of interactions alone explain the larger effect on microglial ablation on abGC odor responses? The same criticism applies to the interpretation of the spine head volume after ablation and altered mEPSC amplitudes. Is it not also likely that effects of microglial ablation on other cell types in the OB (or throughout the brain) lead to changes in abGC recruitment?</p><p>– Did the authors perform statistics on all the CD plots in Figure 1? Are none significantly different? This applies to all CD plots where significance is not noted throughout the paper.</p><p>– Figure 7—figure supplement 1B directly contradicts the authors' claim that microglia ablation after abGC maturation does not affect their synaptic input. In fact, this is one of the more compelling differences seen in the electrophysiological recording data. It seems to also directly contradict Figure 7C, where the only difference is that one shows median mEPSC frequency by cell (Figure 7C) and one shows mean mEPSC frequency (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B). It would be helpful to see a more in-depth characterization of mature abGC and resident GC inputs after microglial ablation, especially given the open-ended nature of the discussion eluding to the possibility that the observed trends may indeed point to alterations in mature cells too.</p><p>– It appears that the heads of filopodial spines would be harder to define, and ROIs would be more likely to contain necks. Given the small effect seen in 1e, is it possible that any effect on non-mushroom spines is masked by the inclusion of dendrite and spine shafts?</p><p>– If similar colocalization analysis was performed on the entire visible abGC (including spines and dendrites together) is there a preferential interaction of microglia with whole abGC dendrites (compared to offset data)?</p><p>– The in vivo imaging data compares responses in populations of dendrites imaged from a small number of animals. The small number of animals is understandable given the nature of the experimentation, but nested statistics should be used considering that many data points are collected from the same animals (and even cells) within the same fields of view.</p><p>– The authors state that abGCs initially show broader tuning to odors that become refined over time and during development. It is a bit difficult to completely reconcile and/or understand this statement with respect to the accompanying data given the &quot;sparser&quot; responses observed with microglia ablation. Do the authors suggest the affected abGCs are more mature, stalled in development, selectively pruned, or just altered? These observations don't seem to fit with any &quot;tuning&quot; argument. In fact, other studies have reported broadening of tuning in both abGCs and developing cortical interneurons with maturation.</p><p>– To point above, and given the lack of mechanistic details presented here, it would be appreciated for the authors to at least provide some deeper insight and/or speculation within the discussion of what is actually happening with microglia ablation. Is this developmental stalling, failure for synaptic maintenance, selective survival, unchecked (and selective) pruning of spine subsets? As is, the data do not fully support a clear interpretation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript &quot;Microglia are necessary for the normal functional development of adult-born neurons in the olfactory bulb&quot; by Wallace et al., addresses a hot topic in neuroscience (the role of microglia in synaptic connectivity) using as a model adult neurogenesis in the OB. The topic is novel, the experimental design is sound, and the data supports the conclusions. There are a few issues that should be addressed prior to publication, mostly to reach non-specialized audiences.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) My major criticism is on the method used to address the role of microglia, i.e., microglial ablation.</p><p>In the first place, as the authors succinctly mention in the Discussion, ablation has been associated to the development of inflammatory responses (in some paradigms, it even leads to a &quot;cytokine storm&quot;). The authors should clearly define the inflammatory conditions in their model of ablation in the OB (which, to the best of my knowledge, has not been defined yet).</p><p>In addition, dead microglia do not just &quot;vanish&quot; – surely, clearing the microglia debris may indirectly affect their results and this should at least be acknowledged in the methodological consideration section.</p><p>Finally, the authors seem to imply that ablating microglia solely affects their surveillance of mushroom spines and that thus this must be the only mechanism by which microglia acts on developing newborn neurons. The authors should discuss alternative mechanisms for the observed effect on the functional responses of the newborn neurons.</p><p>2) The method used to analyze the interaction between microglia and spines is rather obscure and does not seem to have been validated before, as no paper is cited either in the Results or the Materials and methods section. If it is not based on previously published methods, the authors must validate it in the context of this paper. To validate their method, the authors should test it with well known co-localizating objects and then test it with the microglia-spine co-localization.</p><p>My major concern is that the interaction of microglia with the spines is compared to an Offset image that is calculated by horizontally translating the image stack by half of the total pixels (subsection “Analysis of microglia-spine interactions”). However, using a single Offset (instead of an iteration of Offsets) may lead to strong biases when comparing with the actual data. An example of this potential issue is that the Offset for mushroom spines is 34% whereas is 24.6% for filopodial spines (subsection “Microglia preferentially interact with mushroom spines on abGCs” second paragraph). This difference could be resulting from different densities and relative sizes of the two types of spines; or to the fact that the Offset is not representative of all the possible Offsets.</p><p>A more proper control would be in fact to iterate small translations (pixel by pixel) or even rotations (degree be degree) and obtain a probability distribution of Offsets, which then could be compared with the actual data.</p><p>Furthermore, in data shown in Figure 1D, the statistical effect seems to be related to an outlier in the real data, not to an actual difference of distribution.</p><p>3) The authors only briefly mention a similar paper published in 2017 in <italic>eLife</italic> on microglial ablation and OB neurogenesis (Reshef et al., The role of microglia and their CX3CR1 signaling in adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb). To enhance the perception of novelty the authors should put more effort into clearly discriminating what has been done vs what is learned in this paper (Introduction, paragraph four).</p><p>4) The text is rather arid at times, particularly when describing results using non-conventional techniques, as the authors seem to assume all readers will be fully experts in their methodology.</p><p>For instance, in the sentence &quot;To quantify whether microglia preferentially interact with dendritic spines (defined as colocalization of a microglial process with a spine head, meaning the two are within the diffraction limit of our microscope) on abGCs compared to encountering them by chance during the course of continuous motility&quot; (subsection “Microglia preferentially interact with mushroom spines on abGCs”) the reference to the diffraction limit of the microscope is really puzzling.</p><p>Similarly, &quot;lifetime sparseness&quot; is not explained (subsection “Odor responses are reduced in abGCs that mature in the absence of microglia” paragraph two).</p><p>Principal component analysis is not explained at all (subsection “Odor responses are reduced in abGCs that mature in the absence of microglia” paragraph three) – which variables were used? (the responses to all 15 odors?).</p><p>The authors also state that they applied an &quot;event detection analysis&quot; (subsection “Odor responses are reduced in abGCs that mature in the absence of microglia” paragraph three), which is not explained whatsoever.</p><p>5) Some figures are difficult to read.</p><p>Figure 1: the parameter measured in each of D-L figures is at the bottom of each pair, and is in small size. So when reading figure 1D one has, in fact, to go to the bottom of Figure 1I to figure out what parameter is actually shown.</p><p>Figure 2: odors should be either labeled or numbered (and referenced with names in the figure legend). There is a reference to Table 1 but this reviewer has not been able to find it.</p><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows the same odor and odor mean traces as Figure 3A. Both figures should be combined. In addition, the traces seem to lack asterisks denoting statistical significance.</p><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 2 is extremely puzzling. What do X and Y-axes represent in A and B? the eigenvalues of the PCs? The authors should show the 3D plot PC 1 vs PC 2 vs PC 3 showing whether anesthetized and awake mice group separately.</p><p>6) In addition to the number of odors generating responses in anesthetized vs awake mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 2 vs Figure 3A) there seems to be also a quality effect: not the same odors generate responses. The authors should comment on this issue.</p><p>7) The authors should check an efficient microglial ablation in the &quot;after development&quot; experiment (Figure 4). They should also speculate why developing neurons seem more susceptible than mature neurons in their regulation by microglia.</p><p>8) The authors conclude that &quot;In the absence of microglia, these spines have reduced volume, and this corresponds to weaker excitatory synapses.&quot; The second part of the sentence (whether synapses are weaker in the absence of microglia) has not been directly tested in the paper. The authors should either state that they are speculating, or test it directly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50531.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors must acknowledge that depleting microglia may have unintended side effects (including inflammation) and that many microglial functions (beyond spine surveillance) will be altered.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this important point, we have added Figure 2—figure supplement 3 which shows that the number of GFAP+ cells in the OB does not change after PLX ablation, supporting previous work (Elmore et al., 2014 and Reshef et al., 2017) that showed that PLX ablation, in contrast to diphtheria toxin-mediated ablation (Bruttger et al., 2015), does not cause widespread inflammation characterized by large increases in the number of GFAP+ astrocytes and a cytokine storm.

We do not intend to perform a direct comparison between 5-6 weeks old vs. 3 month old abGCs. We chose 5-6 week old abGCs as a relatively “mature” timepoint (based on our previous in vivo imaging data in Wallace et al., 2017) at which we might expect to see the outcome of differences occurring through development with PLX ablation. We chose the 3 month-old stage as a timepoint at which we could be sure maturation would be completed to test the effect of PLX ablation after development. However, we expect that the exact timepoint would not matter because we previously showed that there was no difference in dendritic calcium responses between mature abGCs (5-6 weeks old) and “resident” GCs that were 2-3 months old at the time of imaging (Wallace et al., 2018, Supplementary Figure 5).

We are happy to include these data in the paper if the reviewer and editor prefer. However, ruling out one pathway does not preclude the possibility of pruning occurring in this system. Unfortunately, it is more difficult to test pruning here than it might seem at first glance – unlike during early development, when entire brain regions experience waves of pruning during defined timepoints, a very small percentage of the total number of granule cells would be at this stage at any given time. Furthermore, most of our (Stevens) lab’s previous work points to developmental microglia-mediated pruning occurring on the pre- rather than post-synaptic side, and there is no straightforward way to selectively label and distinguish the inputs to adult-born granule cells (mitral cells and cortical feedback would be expected to synapse onto both adult-born and pre-existing granule cells). Therefore, we feel that addressing mechanisms of pruning would require a large number of experiments, well beyond the scope the present study.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Spine density and volume are unaffected in C1qKO mice.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Experimental timeline for spine quantification in wild type versus C1qKO mice.

However, we opted not to perform these experiments because we felt that the results would be difficult to interpret.

However, we felt that it would be misleading to perform statistics on these plots (using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, example) because the data points are not independent (for example, there are hundreds of sEPSCs recorded from each cell). To deal with this issue, we now use the hierarchical bootstrap (Saravanan et al., 2019) to perform hypothesis testing on these types of hierarchical datasets throughout the paper, in cases where multiple data points are measured from each cell. As discussed in Saravanan et al., 2019, this method is more appropriate for hierarchical datasets (in terms of preserving statistical power and avoiding elevating the false positive rate) than either comparing cumulative distributions of all data points directly or comparing data summarized per unit (for example, taking the mean across each cell and comparing these between groups), which was our original approach.

Related to the point above about the analysis of hierarchical datasets (Saravanan et al., 2019), we have removed Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and instead reanalyzed the data in Figure 7C with the hierarchical bootstrap. This new analysis shows that the same trend is present regardless of how frequency is calculated in this dataset (Figure 7C—the mean frequency is higher for PLX-treated cells), although it does not reach the threshold for statistical significance.

We have expanded our discussion of this point in the Discussion section, “AbGCs in the olfactory circuit”. In addition, we added Figure 8 to propose a model that integrates the results of the current study with our previous study (Wallace et al., 2017) and puts these findings in the context of other studies of abGC development. In short, we suggest that microglia ablation affects some aspects of abGC development (maturation and possibly selective reorganization of excitatory inputs) but not others (decrease in excitability and input resistance), leading to the phenotype we observe.</p><p>We note that it is difficult to compare maturation of abGCs with cortical interneurons, given their vastly different connectivity patterns in their respective circuits (for example PV interneurons are densely interconnected with excitatory neurons in both cortex and OB, but granule cells are much more sparsely connected than PV cells in the OB (Kato et al., 2013)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– To point above, and given the lack of mechanistic details presented here, it would be appreciated for the authors to at least provide some deeper insight and/or speculation within the discussion of what is actually happening with microglia ablation. Is this developmental stalling, failure for synaptic maintenance, selective survival, unchecked (and selective) pruning of spine subsets? As is, the data do not fully support a clear interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment, and it has motivated us to clarify our hypotheses about what is happening in this system by adding Figure 8, which summarizes our findings in the context of a potential model for how microglia might be acting on abGCs. As explained in our response to the previous point as well as in the Discussion section, “AbGCs in the olfactory circuit”, we suggest that microglia ablation affects some aspects of abGC development (maturation and possibly selective reorganization of excitatory inputs) but not others (decrease in excitability and input resistance), leading to the phenotype we observe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) My major criticism is on the method used to address the role of microglia, i.e., microglial ablation.</p><p>In the first place, as the authors succinctly mention in the Discussion, ablation has been associated to the development of inflammatory responses (in some paradigms, it even leads to a &quot;cytokine storm&quot;). The authors should clearly define the inflammatory conditions in their model of ablation in the OB (which, to the best of my knowledge, has not been defined yet).</p><p>In addition, dead microglia do not just &quot;vanish&quot; – surely, clearing the microglia debris may indirectly affect their results and this should at least be acknowledged in the methodological consideration section.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this important point, we have added Figure 2—figure supplement 3 which shows that the number of GFAP+ cells in the OB does not change after PLX ablation, supporting previous work (Elmore et al., 2014 and Reshef et al., 2017) that showed that PLX ablation, in contrast to diphtheria toxin-mediated ablation (Bruttger et al., 2015), does not cause widespread inflammation characterized by large increases in the number of GFAP+ astrocytes and a cytokine storm. However, we acknowledge that this does not preclude other undetectable effects on the inflammatory environment, and we have expanded our discussion on this point (in the section Discussion, “Methodological considerations”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors seem to imply that ablating microglia solely affects their surveillance of mushroom spines and that thus this must be the only mechanism by which microglia acts on developing newborn neurons. The authors should discuss alternative mechanisms for the observed effect on the functional responses of the newborn neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added to our discussion of possible alterations in microglial function beyond spine surveillance (Discussion, “Microglia-neuron interactions in the adult brain”) and modified the title of the paper to more accurately represent our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The method used to analyze the interaction between microglia and spines is rather obscure and does not seem to have been validated before, as no paper is cited either in the Results or the Materials and methods section. If it is not based on previously published methods, the authors must validate it in the context of this paper. To validate their method, the authors should test it with well-known co-localizating objects and then test it with the microglia-spine co-localization.</p><p>My major concern is that the interaction of microglia with the spines is compared to an Offset image that is calculated by horizontally translating the image stack by half of the total pixels (subsection “Analysis of microglia-spine interactions”). However, using a single Offset (instead of an iteration of Offsets) may lead to strong biases when comparing with the actual data. An example of this potential issue is that the Offset for mushroom spines is 34% whereas is 24.6% for filopodial spines (subsection “Microglia preferentially interact with mushroom spines on abGCs” second paragraph). This difference could be resulting from different densities and relative sizes of the two types of spines; or to the fact that the Offset is not representative of all the possible Offsets.</p><p>A more proper control would be in fact to iterate small translations (pixel by pixel) or even rotations (degree be degree) and obtain a probability distribution of Offsets, which then could be compared with the actual data.</p><p>Furthermore, in data shown in Figure 1D, the statistical effect seems to be related to an outlier in the real data, not to an actual difference of distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s detailed assessment of the method and agree with the concern that using a single Offset may not adequately represent a true shuffling of the data. Therefore, we have implemented the method the reviewer has suggested (iterating through many offsets).</p><p>Please see response to essential point 2 for further details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors only briefly mention a similar paper published in 2017 in eLife on microglial ablation and OB neurogenesis (Reshef et al., The role of microglia and their CX3CR1 signaling in adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb). To enhance the perception of novelty the authors should put more effort into clearly discriminating what has been done vs what is learned in this paper (Introduction, paragraph four).</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded our reference to this work both in the Introduction and in the Discussion to clarify that we have analyzed the functional effects of microglia ablation on abGCs, providing a mechanistic explanation for the reduction in mitral cell activity observed in Reshef et al., 2017.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The text is rather arid at times, particularly when describing results using non-conventional techniques, as the authors seem to assume all readers will be fully experts in their methodology.</p><p>For instance, in the sentence &quot;To quantify whether microglia preferentially interact with dendritic spines (defined as colocalization of a microglial process with a spine head, meaning the two are within the diffraction limit of our microscope) on abGCs compared to encountering them by chance during the course of continuous motility&quot; (subsection “Microglia preferentially interact with mushroom spines on abGCs”) the reference to the diffraction limit of the microscope is really puzzling.</p><p>Similarly, &quot;lifetime sparseness&quot; is not explained (subsection “Odor responses are reduced in abGCs that mature in the absence of microglia” paragraph two).</p><p>Principal component analysis is not explained at all (subsection “Odor responses are reduced in abGCs that mature in the absence of microglia” paragraph three) – which variables were used? (the responses to all 15 odors?).</p><p>The authors also state that they applied an &quot;event detection analysis&quot; (subsection “Odor responses are reduced in abGCs that mature in the absence of microglia” paragraph three), which is not explained whatsoever.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the feedback on this point and have endeavoured to clarify the reasoning behind our use of these methods in the main text, with references to the Materials and methods section where appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Some figures are difficult to read.</p><p>Figure 1: the parameter measured in each of D-L figures is at the bottom of each pair, and is in small size. So when reading Figure 1D one has, in fact, to go to the bottom of Figure 1I to figure out what parameter is actually shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We added labels to each individual panel to improve the readability of Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: odors should be either labeled or numbered (and referenced with names in the figure legend). There is a reference to Table 1 but this reviewer has not been able to find it.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the length of some of the chemical names, we opted not to include these in the figure itself. Thank you for alerting us to the omission of the odor list, we have now included Table 1 in the Materials and methods under the section “Odor stimulation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows the same odor and odor mean traces as Figure 3A. Both figures should be combined. In addition, the traces seem to lack asterisks denoting statistical significance.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have combined these figures. We did not include asterisks for these traces (similar to Figure 2E) because we did not test differences for individual odors (to avoid issues with multiple comparisons) and rather restricted significance testing to parts B, C, and D. In contrast, we show asterisks in Figure 2D denoting individual example responses above threshold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 2 is extremely puzzling. What do X and Y-axes represent in A and B? the eigenvalues of the PCs? The authors should show the 3D plot PC 1 vs PC 2 vs PC 3 showing whether anesthetized and awake mice group separately.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have clarified in the legend that the x-axis represents time and the y-axis represents ΔF/F<sub>σ</sub>. We have plotted it this way (as in Wienisch and Murthy, 2016 and Wallace et al., 2017) because a single 3D plot could not show the entire time course. As we have now clarified in the Materials and methods (“In vivoimaging analysis” and “Temporal dynamics”), we then used a permutation test to compare the time courses between control and PLX-treated mice for each condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In addition to the number of odors generating responses in anesthetized vs awake mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 2 vs Figure 3A) there seems to be also a quality effect: not the same odors generate responses. The authors should comment on this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous studies (Kato et al., 2012; Wienisch and Murthy, 2016; Wallace et al., 2017) have described significant reorganization of responses in granule cells in awake vs. anesthetized mice, which was part of the rationale for imaging in both conditions. Specifically, there seems to be a weaker relationship between the number of glomeruli activated by each odor and the number of granule cells activated in awake mice compared to anesthetized mice (Wienisch and Murthy, 2016). We did not comment extensively on this in the paper because we thought it might distract from the difference between control and PLX-treated mice, but we could add more discussion if the reviewer prefers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors should check an efficient microglial ablation in the &quot;after development&quot; experiment (Figure 4).</p></disp-quote><p>This is shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They should also speculate why developing neurons seem more susceptible than mature neurons in their regulation by microglia.</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed this in the Discussion section, “Timing of microglia ablation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors conclude that &quot;In the absence of microglia, these spines have reduced volume, and this corresponds to weaker excitatory synapses.&quot; The second part of the sentence (whether synapses are weaker in the absence of microglia) has not been directly tested in the paper. The authors should either state that they are speculating, or test it directly.</p></disp-quote><p>This conclusion is based on our finding that the amplitude of sEPSCs is reduced with PLX treatment in developing abGCs (Figure 6D).</p></body></sub-article></article>
