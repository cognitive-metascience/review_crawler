One key question is how such cells are specified and then protected from differentiation for a prolonged period. Investigating the maintenance of <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle progenitors (MPs) we demonstrate that it involves a switch in <italic>zfh1/ZEB1</italic> RNA-isoforms. Differentiation into functional muscles is accompanied by expression of <italic>miR-8/miR-200</italic>, which targets the major <italic>zfh1-long</italic> RNA isoform and decreases Zfh1 protein. Through activity of the Notch pathway, a subset of MPs produce an alternate <italic>zfh1-short</italic> isoform, which lacks the <italic>miR-8</italic> seed site. Zfh1 protein is thus maintained in these cells, enabling them to escape differentiation and persist as MPs in the adult. There, like mammalian satellite cells, they contribute to muscle homeostasis. Such preferential regulation of a specific RNA isoform, with differential sensitivity to miRs, is a powerful mechanism for maintaining a population of poised progenitors and may be of widespread significance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Notch</kwd><kwd>Zfh1</kwd><kwd>miRNA</kwd><kwd>satellite cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRL007177/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bray</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF-325-2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boukhatmi</surname><given-names>Hadi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Adult muscle progenitors evade differentiation by expressing a short RNA isoform of Zfh1 which is insensitive to regulation by a micro-RNA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Growth and regeneration of adult tissues depends on stem cells, which remain undifferentiated while retaining the potential to generate differentiated progeny. For example, muscle satellite cells (SCs) are a self-renewing population that provides the myogenic cells responsible for postnatal muscle growth and muscle repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang and Rudnicki, 2014</xref>). One key question is how tissue specific stem cells, such as satellite cells, are able to escape from differentiation and remain undifferentiated during development, to retain their stem cell programme though-out the lifetime of the animal.</p><p>It has been argued that the progenitors of <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult muscles share similarities with satellite cells and thus provide a valuable model to investigate mechanisms that maintain stem cell capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aradhya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Figeac et al., 2007</xref>). After their specification during embryogenesis, these muscle progenitors (MPs) remain undifferentiated throughout larval life before differentiating during pupal stages. For example, one population of MPs is associated with the wing imaginal disc, which acts as a transient niche, and will ultimately contribute to the adult flight muscles. These MPs initially divide symmetrically to amplify the population. They then enter an asymmetric division mode in which they self-renew and generate large numbers of myoblasts that go on to form the adult muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunage et al., 2014</xref>). In common with vertebrates, activity of Notch pathway is important to maintain the MPs in an undifferentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunage et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mourikis and Tajbakhsh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mourikis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernard et al., 2010</xref>). To subsequently trigger the muscle differentiation program, levels of Myocyte Enhancer factor 2 (Mef2) are increased and Notch signalling is terminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elgar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernard et al., 2006</xref>). Until now it was thought that all MPs followed the same fate, differentiating into functional muscles. However, it now appears that a subset persist into adulthood forming a population of satellite-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaturvedi et al., 2017</xref> and see below)). This implies a mechanism that enables these cells to escape from differentiation, so that they retain their progenitor-cell properties.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of ZEB1/ZEB2, Zfh1 (zinc-finger homeodoman 1), is a candidate for regulating the MPs because this family of transcription factors is known to repress Mef2, to counteract the myogenic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Postigo et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>zfh1</italic> is expressed in the MPs when they are specified in the embryo and was shown to be up-regulated by Notch activity in an MP-like cell line (DmD8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Figeac et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krejcí et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, an important regulatory link has been established whereby microRNAs (miRs) are responsible for down-regulating ZEB/Zfh1 protein expression to promote differentiation or prevent metastasis in certain contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zaravinos, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vandewalle et al., 2009</xref>). For example, the miR-200 family is significantly up-regulated during type II cell differentiation in fetal lungs, where it antagonizes ZEB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benlhabib et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, <italic>miR-8</italic>, a <italic>miR-200</italic> relative, promotes timely terminal differentiation in progeny of Drosophila intestinal stem cells by antagonizing <italic>zfh1</italic> and <italic>escargot</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antonello et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, down-regulation of <italic>miR-200</italic> drives epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) to promote metastasis in multiple epithelial derived tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Korpal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2008</xref>). Such observations have led to the proposal that the ZEB/miR-200 regulatory loop may be important in the maintenance of stemness, although examples are primarily limited to cancer contexts and others argue that the primary role is in regulating EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antonello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brabletz and Brabletz, 2010</xref>). The MPs are thus an interesting system to investigate whether this regulatory loop is a gatekeeper for the stem cell commitment to differentiation.</p><p>To investigate the concept that ZEB1/Zfh1 could be important in sustaining progenitor-type status, we examined the role and regulation of <italic>zfh1</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> MPs/SCs. Our results show that <italic>zfh1</italic> plays a central role in the maintenance of undifferentiated MPs and, importantly, that is expression is sustained in a population of progenitors that persist in adults (pMPs) through the activity of Notch. Specifically these pMPs express an alternate short RNA isoform of <italic>zfh1</italic> that cannot be targeted by <italic>miR-8</italic>. In contrast, the majority of larval precursors express a long isoform of <italic>zfh1</italic>, which is subject to regulation by <italic>miR-8</italic> so that Zfh-1 protein levels are suppressed to enable differentiation of myocytes. Expression of alternate <italic>zfh1-short</italic> isoform is thus a critical part of the regulatory switch to maintain a pool of progenitor ‘satellite-like’ cells in the adult. This type of regulatory logic, utilizing RNA isoforms with differential sensitivity to miRs, may be of widespread relevance for adult stem cell maintenance in other tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Zfh1 is required for maintenance of muscle progenitors</title><p><italic>As zfh1</italic> was previously shown to antagonize myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Postigo et al., 1999</xref>) it is a plausible candidate to maintain the muscle progenitor (MP) cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and prevent their differentiation. Its expression is consistent with this hypothesis as Zfh1 is present throughout the large group of MPs associated with the wing disc, which can be distinguished by the expression of Cut (Ct) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–A’’</xref>). At early stages Zfh1 expression is uniform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), but at later stages the levels become reduced in the cells with high Cut expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A’’</xref>).

These results demonstrate that reduced <italic>zfh1</italic> expression causes MPs to initiate the muscle differentiation program indicating that Zfh1 is required to prevent MP differentiation.</p><p>Lineage tracing experiments suggest that a subset of wing disc MPs have characteristics of muscle stem cells and remain undifferentiated even in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Recently, these have been shown to express Zfh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaturvedi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunage et al., 2014</xref>), which is compatible with our observation that Zfh1 is necessary to prevent differentiation in MPs. In agreement, adult IFM muscle fibers were associated with sparse nuclei that retained high levels of Zfh1 expression whereas the differentiated muscle nuclei exhibited no detectable expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–D’</xref>). To better characterise these Zfh1 positive (+ve) adult cells, we expressed a membrane-tagged GFP (<italic>UAS-Src::GFP</italic>) under the control of a specific muscle driver <italic>Mef2-Gal4</italic> (<italic>Mef2 &gt;GFP</italic>). This confirmed that Zfh1 was expressed in myogenic <italic>Mef2 &gt;GFP</italic> expressing cells, and revealed that these cells were closely embedded in the muscle lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–E’’’</xref>). Although many of the Zfh1 expressing cells were clearly co-expressing <italic>mef2 &gt;GFP</italic>, Zfh1 was also detected in another population that lacked Mef2 expression. Often clustered, these cells were co-labelled with a plasmatocyte marker P1/Nimrod indicating that they are phagocytic immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A subset of the Zfh1 +ve cells are therefore myogenic and have characteristics of persistent muscle progenitors that likely correspond to the so-called adult satellite cells recently identified by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaturvedi et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>).</p><p>The results demonstrate that Zfh1 is expressed in MPs, where it is required for their maintenance, and that its expression continues into adult-hood in a small subset of myogenic cells. If, as these data suggest, Zfh1 is important for sustaining a population of a persistent adult progenitors, there must be a mechanism that maintains Zfh1 expression in these cells while the remainder differentiate into functional flight muscles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>zfh1</italic> enhancers conferring expression in MPs</title><p>To investigate whether the maintenance of Zfh1 expression in larval and adult MPs could be attributed to distinct enhancers, we screened <italic>enhancer-Gal4</italic> collections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jory et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manning et al., 2012</xref>) to identify <italic>zfh1</italic> enhancers that were active in larval MPs.

Activity of Notch is important for maintaining Zfh1 expression and hence is required to sustain the progenitor status of these cells, similar to the situation in mammalian satellite cells, which require Notch activity for their maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mourikis and Tajbakhsh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bjornson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Using lineage-tracing method we showed that adult Zfh1 +ve cells, in normal conditions, provide new myoblasts to the fibers.

These results demonstrate that Zfh-1 is necessary to maintain these progenitors and that, similar to vertebrate satellite cells, the Zfh1 +ve progenitor cells contribute to the adult muscles homeostasis. Others have recently shown that the pMPs are expanded in conditions of muscle injury where they are likely to contribute to repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaturvedi et al., 2017</xref>). Thus the retention of a pool of progenitor cells may be critical to maintain the physiological function of all muscles in all organism types, as also highlighted by their identification in another arthropod <italic>Parahyle</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alwes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Konstantinides and Averof, 2014</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> notably differs because their satellite-like cells do not express the Pax3/Pax7 homologue (<italic>gooseberry</italic>; data not shown), considered a canonical marker in mammals and some other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang and Rudnicki, 2014</xref>). Nor do they express the promyogenic bHLH protein Twist (data not shown), which is present in the muscle progenitors in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bate et al., 1991</xref>). Instead, Zfh1 appears to fulfill an analogous function and it will be interesting to discover how widespread this alternate Zfh1 pathway is for precursor maintenance. Notably, the loss of ZEB1 in mice accelerates the temporal expression of muscle differentiation genes (e.g. MHC) suggesting that there is indeed an evolutionary conserved function of Zfh1/ZEB in regulating the muscle differentiation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siles et al., 2013</xref>).

It also implies that Notch preferentially promotes the expression of a specific RNA isoform, most likely through the use of an alternate promoter in <italic>zfh1</italic>. Both of these concepts have widespread implications.</p><p>Alternate use of 3’UTRs, to escape miRNA regulation, is potentially an important mechanism to tune developmental decisions. Some tissues have a global tendency to favor certain isoform types, for example, distal polyadenylation sites are preferred in neuronal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, the occurrence of alternate 3’UTR RNA isoforms is widespread (&gt;50% human genes generate alternate 3’UTR isoforms) and many conserved <italic>miR</italic> target sites are contained in such alternate 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tian and Manley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sandberg et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, similar isoform switching may underpin many instances of progenitor regulation and cell fate determination. Indeed an isoform switch appears to underlie variations in Pax3 expression levels between two different populations of muscle satellite cells in mice, where the use of alternative polyadenylation sites resulted in transcripts with shorter 3’UTRs that are resistant to regulation by <italic>miR-206</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boutet et al., 2012</xref>). The selection of alternate 3’-UTRs could ensure that protein levels do not fall below a critical level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yatsenko et al., 2014</xref>), and in this way prevent differentiation from being triggered.</p><p>The switch in <italic>zfh1</italic> RNA isoforms is associated with Notch-dependent maintenance of the persistent adult MPs. Notably, <italic>zfh1-short</italic> is generated from an alternate promoter, as well as having a truncated 3’UTR, which may be one factor underlying this switch. Studies in yeasts demonstrate that looping occurs between promoters and polyadenylation sites, and that specific factors recruited at promoters can influence poly-A site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lamas-Maceiras et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tian and Manley, 2013</xref>). The levels and speed of transcription also appear to influence polyA site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Proudfoot, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tian and Manley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pinto et al., 2011</xref>). If Notch mediated activation via <italic>Enh3</italic> favors initiation at the <italic>zfh1-short</italic> promoter, this could in turn influence the selection of the proximal adenylation site to generate the truncated <italic>miR-8</italic> insensitive UTR. The concept that signaling can differentially regulate RNA sub-types has so far been little explored but our results suggest that is potentially of considerable significance. In future it will be important to investigate the extent that this mechanism is deployed in other contexts where signaling coordinates cell fate choices and stem cell maintenance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (D. melanogaster)</td><td>zfh1</td><td>NA</td><td>FLYB:FBgn0004606</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (D. melanogaster)</td><td>Notch</td><td>NA</td><td>FLYB:FBgn0004647</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (D. melanogaster)</td><td>miR-8</td><td>NA</td><td>FLYB:FBgn0262432</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(D. melanogaster)</td><td>Enh3-Gal4</td><td>Janelia Research Campus</td><td>BDSC: 49924, FLYB: FBtp0059625</td><td>FlyBase symbol: P{GMR35H09-GAL4}attP2</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(D. melanogaster)</td><td>zfh1 RNAi (kk 103205)</td><td>Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center</td><td>VDRC: 103205</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(D. melanogaster)</td><td>miR-8-Gal4</td><td>Kyoto Stock Center</td><td>DGRC: 104917</td><td>Genotype: y[*] w[*]; P{w[+mW.hs]=GawB}NP5247/CyO, P{w[-]=UAS lacZ.UW14}UW14</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(D. melanogaster)</td><td>UAS-miR-8-Sp</td><td>Bloomington Stock Center</td><td>BDSC: 61374, FLYB: FBst0061374</td><td>Genotype: P{UAS-mCherry.mir-8.sponge.V2}attP40/CyO; P{UAS-mCherry.mir-8.sponge.V2}attP2</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(D. melanogaster)</td><td>Enh3-GFP</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(D. melanogaster)</td><td>∆Enh3</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(D. melanogaster)</td><td>UAS-zfh1-short</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>UAS-Zfh1-short construct provided by BDGP, Clone # UF5607</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (D. melanogaster)</td><td>Notch[NRE]-GFP</td><td>Sarah Bray (Cambridge, UK)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Zfh1</td><td>Ruth Lehmann (New York, USA)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Mef2</td><td>Eileen Furlong (Heidelberg, Germany)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pCFD4</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Addgene # 49411</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pDsRed-attP</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Addgene # 51019</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Drosophila genetics</title><p>All <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> stocks were grown on standard medium at 25°C.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers agree that this is a very interesting study proposing a conceptually novel regulatory logic in muscle stem cell development. However, all three reviewers conclude that some of the key pieces of evidence are still too preliminary and do not yet firmly support the conclusions made. As you will see from the attached reviews, the main weaknesses include a) the absence of clonal evidence showing that the satellite-like cells are contributing to muscle homeostasis, b) uncertainties regarding the role of Zfh1 short in these cells and their precursors, c) the lack of data demonstrating the developmental expression dynamics of <italic>miR-8</italic>, Enh3-GFP, and Zfh1 within the satellite-like cells and their precursors, and d) the insufficient characterization of <italic>mir-8</italic> function within these cells that would support the biological relevance of this regulatory logic. As the reviewers expect that the work to address these issues would take significantly longer than the two months requested for a resubmission, we are returning the manuscript to you and hope that the reviews will provide helpful guidance for further strengthening the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Boukhatmi and Bray present intriguing data suggesting the existence of muscle stem cells in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> that may function like the satellite cells in vertebrates during muscle repair upon injury and aging. The authors propose a major role of the transcription factor Zfh1 in keeping these cells undifferentiated. They extend the regulatory pathway further by findings indicating that a short isoform of zfh1 is being induced by Notch/Su(H) in these satellite-like cells, which in contrast to the long form is not targeted by the microRNA miR-8 that could otherwise prevent expression of Zfh1 in them. Through this mechanism, Notch could stabilize the undifferentiated state of these satellite-like cells.</p><p>In principle, these are very important and novel findings that would have broad relevance in the muscle stem cell field. However, as discussed below, there are still some major gaps and inconsistencies in the data and models, which means that the evidence for functional muscle satellite cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in this study is largely circumstantial but without solid proof, and some aspects of the proposed regulatory pathway are questionable. However, if the authors were able to fill in these gaps convincingly the manuscript would be highly appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) Currently, the authors do not have any direct evidence that the observed cells act as muscle stem cells that can fuse with muscles for repairing damage. The Enh3-Gal4&gt;G-TRACE lineage data with GFP (Figure 2) only show that both the muscles and the satellite-like cells are derived from adepithelial cells of the wing discs, as would be expected. The demonstration of proliferation is interesting, but not proof for their potential to achieve muscle repair. The crucial experiment would be to perform this experiment conditionally, such that GFP becomes only expressed in the satellite-like cells and their descendants after hatching, and then look for GFP-positive nuclei <italic>within</italic> muscles upon aging or injury. I realize there may be some diffusion of GFP in the syncytia but nevertheless, the bulk of GFP should be imported into the nuclei that express GFP RNA.</p><p>Related to this point, in Figure 7 the authors show that, upon knockdown of <italic>zfh1</italic> after hatching and 8 days of further aging of the flies, their IFMs contain ca. 20% fewer nuclei, which they take to mean that normally that many satellite cells fuse to repair the aging muscles during this time period. This would be a surprisingly large percentage and an important result. If true, the conditional lineage tracing experiment requested above should show ca. 20% GFP-positive nuclei in IFM cross sections of aged flies similar to those shown in Figure 7. Alternatively, could the reduction in muscle nuclei be caused by leaky earlier dsRNA expression during muscle development?</p><p>2) Given the recurring off-target and other artifacts with RNAi, the differences in phenotypes with different <italic>zfh1</italic> RNAi lines are a bit worrisome. Such effects could also explain the different phenotypes with the DeltaEnh3 allele and with forced miR-8 expression. In particular, whereas with the KK line there is some premature differentiation while the undifferentiated bulk of adepithelial cells look normal, with the GD line all of the adepithelial cells look morphologically abnormal but none are differentiated. First, the authors should verify by antibody stainings that Zfh1 levels are indeed strongly reduced in these experiments. Second, they should rule out that the effect with the KK line is caused the known second site insertion that activates the Hippo pathway, which is present in a significant portion of the KK lines (Vissers et al., Nature Comm. 2016). Third, they should use the Valium10 and -20 lines from TRiP to check for consistent phenotypes. In this context, it is not always clear which one of the lines was used in a particular experiment (e.g., in Figure 7. And does the other line give the same phenotype?).</p><p>3) –In the subsection “An alternate short <italic>zfh1</italic> isoform is transcribed in adult MPs” and elsewhere the authors argue repeatedly that Zfh1 expression and thus stem cell maintenance must &quot;evade&quot; regulation by miR-8, which they explain by the expression of the short isoform that lacks miR-8 target sequences. However, in Figure 4 they show that <italic>mir-8</italic> is not even expressed in the satellite-like cells, which means there is actually no need for evasion in these cells. Currently, there is only evidence that <italic>miR-8</italic> is expressed in fully differentiated muscles, which could be downstream of differentiation regulators such as <italic>Mef2</italic> (in line with data from Figure 6—figure supplement 1). So the proposed evasion mechanism is highly speculative and cannot be presented as a fact without any supporting data. Such data could for instance come from G-TRACE experiments with <italic>miR-8-GAL4</italic> that show that <italic>miR-8</italic> is indeed transiently expressed in the precursors of the satellite-like cells.</p><p>4) –Subsection “<italic>zfh1</italic> isoform transcription requires Notch activity in adult SCs”, second paragraph, Figure 6, Figure 8—figure supplement 1: The authors ascribe the high <italic>Mef2</italic> levels (i.e., possible entry into differentiation) in satellite cells with depleted Notch to reduced <italic>zfh1</italic>-short. However, as they show, <italic>zfh1</italic>-long is unaffected by Notch depletion and because <italic>mir-8</italic> is absent in these cells (see above), <italic>zfh1</italic> could still suppress differentiation. This would argue for <italic>zfh1</italic>-independent effects of Notch.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Bokhatmi and Bray report the presence of a population of satellite-like stem cells in the adult of <italic>Drosophila</italic> that are maintained through a switch of <italic>zfh1</italic> RNA -isoforms that enable escape from microRNA <italic>miR-8/miR-200</italic> control. They authors show that differentiation of MP is associated with expression of <italic>miR-8</italic>, which targets <italic>zfh1</italic>-long RNA thus down-regulating <italic>zfh1</italic> protein. They also map an enhancer (Enh3) region that drives expression of <italic>zfh1</italic> gene in some MPs in the larval wing imaginal discs and the adult MPs. Interestingly, this enhancer is regulated by Su (H) and these authors show very clearly that Notch-Su(H) activates an alternate <italic>zfh1</italic> short isoform in adult MPs, where Notch is also normally activated. <italic>zfh1</italic> short RNA lacks the <italic>miR-8</italic> seed sequence and thus cannot be silenced by <italic>miR-8</italic>. Altogether the data suggest that Notch-driven <italic>zfh1</italic> short allows the <italic>zfh1</italic> to escape down-regulation of <italic>miR-8</italic> and thus terminal differentiation in a subset of larval muscle progenitor cells. The authors also postulate that expression of the alternate <italic>zfh1</italic>-short isoform is a critical part of the regulatory switch to maintain a pool of progenitor &quot;satellite-like&quot; cells in the adult.</p><p>I have some critics and specific comments that need clarification:</p><p>1) Role of Zfh1 short RNA isoform in the maintenance of muscle progenitors. Some additional experiments, such as gain-of-expression of <italic>zfh1</italic> isoforms, specifically the short form to substantiate the model.</p><p>2) Loss of <italic>mir-8</italic> assays is paramount to the model. The <italic>mir-8</italic> sponge should produce phenotypes that substantiate the biological relevance of the regulatory switch to maintain a subset of MPs retaining <italic>zfh1. mir-8</italic> loss would be expected to increase the number of pMPs.</p><p>3) Epistatic studies to link <italic>mir-8</italic> overexpression to <italic>zfh1</italic> (gain of <italic>mir-8</italic> along with gain of <italic>zfh1</italic> and/or loss of <italic>mir-8</italic> and loss of <italic>zfh1</italic>). These experiments seem important for substantiating the biological relevance of the regulatory loci discovered.</p><p>4) The conclusion that adult Zfh1+ve cells retain capacity to divide and produce progeny should be reinforced with direct data. G-TRACE is not a cell lineage method – it traces the dynamics of a Gal4 expressing cell. It is very likely the authors' conclusion is right but a clonal cell lineage method is more appropriate for this particular issue.</p><p>In summary, this is a very interesting study with a conceptually novel regulatory logic that may have broader implications for understanding how other stem cells and cancer stem-like cells may escape terminal differentiation. Nonetheless, some additional data would be required to substantiate that the zfh1 short isoform contributes (or is capable) to the maintenance of satellite-like progenitor cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In the submitted manuscript H. Boukhatmi and S. Bray analyse an intriguing issue related to the mechanisms of maintenance of persistent Muscle Progenitors (pMPs) in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscles focusing on flight muscles. Considering that identification and functional characterisation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle satellite-like cells that express Zfh-1 has already been reported (open access BioRxiv Chaturvedi et al., manuscript posted 25 Jan 2016 from VijayRaghavan lab) the Boukhatmi and Bray's manuscript carries two new findings: i) pMPs preferentially express a short isoform of <italic>zfh1</italic>, which is devoid of <italic>miR8</italic> seed site and ii) <italic>zfh1</italic> is not only present in pMPs but also plays an important role in their maintenance. Authors also identify and apply a new tool, <italic>zfh1-Enh3-Gal4</italic> that allows them to target/visualize pMPs.</p><p>My comments focus on these two aspects, which make this manuscript of potential interest for <italic>eLife</italic> if documented more rigorously.</p><p>1) Differential post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>zfh1</italic> isoforms by <italic>miR8</italic> could indeed represent a major regulatory mechanism in setting pMPs population. Authors have tools in their hands to document when this isoform switch takes place. In Figure 2D they show that in 3rd instar larvae Enh3&gt;GFP is largely expressed in Zfh1/Cut positive MPs in the notum region and then they jump to adult stage to show Enh3-GFP restricted to pMPs only. It would be interesting to see when in development this restriction is effective. In other words when the satellite-like pMPs could be identified and visualized for the first time. Time lapse imaging of IFM development in Enh3-GFP pupa (approach developed in Schnorrer lab) could represent an interesting view point as well. The developmental restriction of Enh3-GFP expression should be correlated with miR8 sensor and/or <italic>mir8-Gal4</italic> expression to evaluate whether these two regulatory events are coordinated. In relation to this it would be important to better correlate Enh3 activity with transcriptional regulation of <italic>zfh1</italic>-short isoform. It is unclear whether Enh3 indeed regulates preferentially transcription of <italic>zfh1</italic>-short. Levels of short and long transcripts could be quantified in ΔdeltaEnh3 context in wing discs (instead of Zfh1 protein shown in Figure 2G) and in adult pMPs.</p><p>2) Regarding second major finding that <italic>zfh1</italic> is required for maintenance of pMPs it could be important to test functional relevance of the two isoforms. Enh3&gt;miR8 could be applied to deplete pMPs of <italic>zfh1</italic>-long and Enh3&gt;NRNAi to see if effects of N and zfh1RNAi are similar (with experimental setup like in Figure 7). Generation of CRISPRs mutation of <italic>zfh1</italic>-short promoter/TSS site could help in defining function of this isoform.</p><p>3) Referring to the role of pMPs in muscle homeostasis one complementary experiment could be to test effects of ablation of these cells in adult flies (Enh3&gt;Rpr).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A population of adult satellite-like cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is maintained through a switch in RNA-isoforms&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

But the main point to be dealt with is the one above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The revised resubmission by Boukhatmi and Bray has addressed the majority of the criticisms of the reviewers. The most important additions include:</p><p>1) Experimental evidence by fate mapping and ablation experiments that support the notion that the pMPs serve as satellite-like cells to promote adult muscle homeostasis. The recently published <italic>eLife</italic> paper by Chaturvedi et al. on the same topic is now incorporated and referenced.</p><p>2) Immunohistochemical analyses of the time course of <italic>miR-8</italic> vs. Zfh1 expression from pupal to adult stages. Although <italic>miR-8</italic> expression was monitored indirectly via <italic>miR-8-GAL4</italic> driving UAS-nGFP, which due to Gal4 and GFP perdurance likely produces longer-lasting signals than <italic>miR-8</italic> RNA proper, these data do help to strengthen the points made by the authors. The dynamic activity of Enh3 from <italic>zfh1</italic> has been documented in more detail as well.</p><p>3) Conditional depletion experiments for Zfh1 in adults, which show a role of zfh1 in maintaining the pMPs and, presumably as a consequence, in adult muscle homeostasis.</p><p>4) Conditional depletion experiments for <italic>miR-8</italic> using forced expression of a <italic>miR-8</italic> sponge and, conversely, of <italic>miR-8</italic>, results of which support the mechanistic model proposed by the authors.</p><p>Altogether, these data significantly strengthen the story presented in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Authors generated impressive set of new data that support and further reinforce their initial findings. In the revised version of the manuscript they also answer all issues raised in my comments.</p><p>I would like to congratulate them for this very nicely documented work that provides an example of a how differentiation versus non-differentiation of a cell could be regulated.</p><p>The images they provide are convincing but regarding the intensity it would be good to have further information in how they had performed the analysis. Usually, it is a good idea to do flip-out clones so that there is internal control and one can appreciate the different intensity between the mutant cells and the wt surrounding within the same staining. However this might be difficult for some experiment here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is a much improved manuscript which clarified all my previous concerns and specific questions. The authors make a strong case and provide a mechanistic understanding on how a population of satellite-like stem cells in the adult of <italic>Drosophila</italic> maintain their undifferentiated state through a switch of <italic>zfh1</italic> RNA -isoforms that enable the escape from the <italic>miR-8</italic> microRNA inhibition. The regulatory logic is further sustained in the current revised version and now the authors provide new functional evidence for the requirement of <italic>mir-8</italic> and the <italic>zfh1</italic> short-isoform. Along with the previous results, the new data consolidate the model that differentiation of MP is linked to <italic>miR-8</italic>-mediated inhibition of <italic>zfh1 (zfh1</italic>-long RNA) and that scape from <italic>miR-8 (zfh1</italic>-short) maintains a pool of MPs that sustain muscle homeostasis. The time course analyses of expression of the genes, and the data that <italic>zfh1</italic>-positive cells contribute to differentiated adult muscle are also strong and the images clear and of high quality. In their study, they authors also map the regulation of the <italic>zfh1</italic>-short isoform to Notch, and identified an enhancer (Enh3) region that drives expression of <italic>zfh1</italic> gene in some MPs in the larval wing imaginal discs and the adult MPs. This Enh3-Gal4 has been, and will be a valuable tool for further studies of these cells. The data are consistent with Notch-driving expression of the alternate <italic>zfh1</italic> short isoform at the right time to allow this important stem cell factor to escape down-regulation by <italic>miR-8</italic> in a subset of larval muscle progenitor cells. Some conclusions are derived from indirect data, but the authors explain the technical limitations and provide alternative experimental data that form a consistent model. In summary, the authors provide support for the model that expression of the alternate <italic>zfh1</italic>-short isoform is a critical part of the regulatory switch to select a pool of progenitor &quot;satellite-like&quot; cells that are capable to sustain muscle repair in the adult fly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35954.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) Currently, the authors do not have any direct evidence that the observed cells act as muscle stem cells that can fuse with muscles for repairing damage.

We note however that in our initial experiments we had focused on the perdurance of the RFP signal in the newly born myoblasts to trace their origin, because of the caveats mentioned by the reviewer. However we agree that the question of whether these cells contribute to normal homeostatic muscle repair is an important one, and has not been addressed before. We have taken two strategies to investigate. First as suggested by the reviewer we have used thermosensitive Gal80 (Gal80ts) to conditionally inactivate the Enh3-Gal4 until the adult flies emerge, then raised the temperature to allow Gal4 activity and traced the progeny from this adult-only expression with G-Trace. Specifically we quantified the GFP-positive nuclei present within adult muscles 10 days after they had emerged, and found that around 24% of the nuclei contained GFP (new Figure 3C-D, subsection “Adult Zfh1+ve MP cells contribute to flight muscles”, last paragraph).These GFPpositive nuclei were most concentrated in proximity to the satellite-like cells supporting the model that their progeny contribute to muscle homeostasis. As the reviewer rightly points out, the proportion of cells that we label fits well with the predictions based on the effects from depleting <italic>zfh1</italic> in these cells.</p><p>Second, to provide further evidence that the satellite cells are important for normal muscle repair, we performed a genetic ablation by expressing a pro-apoptotic gene, reaper. Strikingly, this led to a similar reduction in muscle nuclei to that from <italic>zfh1</italic> depletion (new Figure 3I, see the aforementioned paragraph). Altogether these data support the conclusion that the pMPs are contributing to muscle maintenance by providing new myoblasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given the recurring off-target and other artifacts with RNAi, the differences in phenotypes with different zfh1 RNAi lines are a bit worrisome. Such effects could also explain the different phenotypes with the DeltaEnh3 allele and with forced miR-8 expression. In particular, whereas with the KK line there is some premature differentiation while the undifferentiated bulk of adepithelial cells look normal, with the GD line all of the adepithelial cells look morphologically abnormal but none are differentiated.

In this context, it is not always clear which one of the lines was used in a particular experiment (e.g., in Figure 7. And does the other line give the same phenotype?).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concerns about the specificity of the <italic>zfh1</italic> RNAi KK line that was the primary tool used in our analysis. Following the reviewer’s request we have verified that the KK RNAi line strongly reduces Zfh1 protein levels (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E). We have also taken on board their important suggestion to confirm the results using further independent RNAi lines. We have new data demonstrating that the TRiP Valium10 <italic>zfh1</italic> shRNA gives the same premature differentiation phenotype as <italic>zfh1</italic> RNAi KK (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1F-H). We have clarified in the figure legends which specific RNAi line was used for a given experiment.</p><p>With respect to the “differences in phenotypes” we note that there is a correlation between the severity of the phenotype, as measured by ectopic expression of differentiation markers, and the morphology of any residual MP/adepithelial cells. In some discs there is strong Tropomyosin expression in all the cells and there are few with any undifferentiated morphology, in others there are fewer Tropomyosin expressing cells and many of the MP/adepithelial cells retain a more normal morphology. In the relatively mild conditions from ∆Enh3 or from <italic>miR-8</italic> overexpression, there is residual Zfh1 present and most of the cells retain their normal morphology rather than becoming differentiated.</p><p>Thus the differences resemble those commonly seen with alleles of varying severity (so-called “allelic series”) as expected if the experiments result in different degrees of <italic>zfh1</italic> depletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) –In the subsection “An alternate short zfh1 isoform is transcribed in adult MPs” and elsewhere the authors argue repeatedly that Zfh1 expression and thus stem cell maintenance must &quot;evade&quot; regulation by miR-8, which they explain by the expression of the short isoform that lacks miR-8 target sequences. However, in Figure 4 they show that mir-8 is not even expressed in the satellite-like cells, which means there is actually no need for evasion in these cells. Currently, there is only evidence that miR-8 is expressed in fully differentiated muscles, which could be downstream of differentiation regulators such as Mef2 (in line with data from Figure 6—figure supplement 1). So the proposed evasion mechanism is highly speculative and cannot be presented as a fact without any supporting data. Such data could for instance come from G-TRACE experiments with miR-8-GAL4 that show that miR-8 is indeed transiently expressed in the precursors of the satellite-like cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the “evasion” model implies that <italic>mIR-8</italic> expression should overlap with Zfh1 during the stages where pMPs are selected and we appreciate the reviewer’s suggestions. To address this point we have examined the expression of <italic>mIR-8</italic> and Zfh1 during pupal stages (at circa 20hr and 30hr after pupa formation) when the pMPs are specified. These data, which are shown in new Figure 5D-F(subsection “<italic>zfh1</italic> is silenced by the conserved microRNA <italic>miR-8/miR-200</italic> in MPs”, third paragraph) demonstrate that there is a phase where the two overlap in their expression. At 20hr the differentiating myoblasts have higher levels of <italic>mIR-8</italic> than the remaining MPs while the converse is seen for Zfh-1, which is at highest levels in the MPs. By 30 hours, few Zfh1 expressing cells remain and a small subset of these retain <italic>miR-8</italic> expression (new Figure 5D-F). Together these new data show that <italic>miR-8</italic> is initially expressed in the precursors and that there is an important window where its expression overlaps with that of Zfh1 in the pMPs</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “zfh1 isoform transcription requires Notch activity in adult SCs”, second paragraph, Figure 6, Figure 8—figure supplement 1: The authors ascribe the high Mef2 levels (i.e., possible entry into differentiation) in satellite cells with depleted Notch to reduced zfh1-short.

We have now tested the consequences from expressing the <italic>miR-8</italic> sponge specifically in the muscle progenitors during the differentiation phase, (using <italic>Mef2</italic>-Gal4). As predicted by the reviewer, this “mopping up” of <italic>miR-8</italic> led to a significant increase in the number of adult pMPs. These new data, which have been added to new Figure 6 and discussed in the main text (subsection “<italic>zfh1</italic> is silenced by the conserved microRNA <italic>miR-8/miR-200</italic> in MPs”, last two paragraphs), further substantiate the model that <italic>mIR-8</italic> counteracts the maintenance of pMPs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Epistatic studies to link mir-8 overexpression to zfh1 (gain of mir-8 along with gain of zfh1 and/or loss of mir-8 and loss of zfh1). These experiments seem important for substantiating the biological relevance of the regulatory loci discovered.</p></disp-quote><p>Because <italic>mIR-8</italic> and Zfh1 are ultimately required in complementary cells, it is difficult to design ideal experiments combining their misexpression/knockdown along the lines proposed by the reviewer, especially because over-expression of Zfh1-long causes lethality. We have however performed several additional experiments to test the different aspects of the model individually. For example, we have over-expressed <italic>miR-8</italic> in the pMPs, where it leads to a reduction in pMPs consistent with <italic>miR-8</italic> shifting the balance towards differentiation (Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and subsection “<italic>zfh1</italic> is silenced by the conserved microRNA <italic>miR-8/miR-200</italic> in MPs”, last two paragraphs). We have expressed the <italic>mIR-8</italic> sponge, as summarized above, to deplete <italic>mIR-8</italic> and shown that this increases the number of MPs as predicted (new Figure 6, see the aforementioned paragraphs). We have demonstrated that <italic>zfh1-short</italic> expression can prevent muscle differentiation induced by <italic>Mef2</italic> (new Figure 7—figure supplement 1; subsection “An alternate short <italic>zfh1</italic> isoform is transcribed in adult pMPs”, last paragraph). We believe that these additional experiments greatly substantiate the regulatory logic that we propose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The conclusion that adult Zfh1+ve cells retain capacity to divide and produce progeny should be reinforced with direct data. G-TRACE is not a cell lineage method – it traces the dynamics of a Gal4 expressing cell. It is very likely the authors' conclusion is right but a clonal cell lineage method is more appropriate for this particular issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concerns of the reviewer, which were also raised by reviewer 1 (point 1). Due to the nature of the tissue, it is very difficult to perform a classic clonal lineage tracing (we have tried extensively without real success). We have therefore taken the strategy suggested by reviewer 1, namely to induce G-TRACE expression only in the adult by restricting it with Gal80ts until after eclosion. When we use Gal80ts to conditionally activate the Enh3-Gal4 in <underline>adult</underline> flies and trace the progeny with G-Trace, we detect a limited number of GFP-positive nuclei present within adult muscles 10 days after they had emerged (new Figure 3C-D, subsection “Adult Zfh1+ve MP cells contribute to flight muscles”, last paragraph). These GFP positive nuclei were most concentrated in proximity to the satellite-like cells supporting the model that they are derived from the MPs. Furthermore, in our initial experiments we focused on the perdurance of the RFP signal in the newly born myoblasts to link them directly to the cells of origin (Figure 3A, subsection “Adult Zfh1+ve MP cells contribute to flight muscles”, first paragraph), because of the caveats mentioned by the reviewer. Finally we have performed new experiments ablating the pMP cells and have shown that this reduces the number of muscle nuclei (new Figure 3I, subsection “Adult Zfh1+ve MP cells contribute to flight muscles”, last paragraph), supporting the conclusion that the pMPs give rise to progeny that contribute to the muscles. We believe that together these data provide clear evidence that the pMPs retain capacity to divide and produce progeny that contribute to the adult muscles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, this is a very interesting study with a conceptually novel regulatory logic that may have broader implications for understanding how other stem cells and cancer stem-like cells may escape terminal differentiation. Nonetheless, some additional data would be required to substantiate that the zfh1 short isoform contributes (or is capable) to the maintenance of satellite-like progenitor cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad that the reviewer finds the work conceptually novel and important. We believe that the additional data we have provided in the revised version substantiate our model that Zfh1-short contributes to progenitor maintenance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In the submitted manuscript H. Boukhatmi and S. Bray analyse an intriguing issue related to the mechanisms of maintenance of persistent Muscle Progenitors (pMPs) in adult Drosophila muscles focusing on flight muscles. Considering that identification and functional characterisation of Drosophila muscle satellite-like cells that express Zfh-1 has already been reported (open access BioRxiv Chaturvedi et al., manuscript posted 25 Jan 2016 from VijayRaghavan lab) the Boukhatmi and Bray's manuscript carries two new findings: i) pMPs preferentially express a short isoform of zfh1, which is devoid of miR8 seed site and ii) zfh1 is not only present in pMPs but also plays an important role in their maintenance. Authors also identify and apply a new tool, zfh1-Enh3-Gal4 that allows them to target/visualize pMPs.</p><p>My comments focus on these two aspects, which make this manuscript of potential interest for eLife if documented more rigorously.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad the reviewer considers that our results are of potential interest for <italic>eLife</italic>. We would like to emphasise the fact that our data address the mechanism of how muscle satellite cells are maintained and demonstrate their role in normal muscle homeostasis. As noted by the reviewer this is a substantial advance on the recent work from VijayRaghavan’s lab, which very nicely documented the existence of the persistent muscle precursor/satellite cell population and showed their expansion during muscle injury (Chaturvedi et al., 2017). The reviewer is correct that they also reported that Zfh-1 is expressed in these cells, although these data were only added to their manuscript during the final round of revisions, July 2017, at the same time ours was initially submitted. We have modified our text to take on board the additional features in their final published version. However we stress that they have not demonstrated that Zfh1 is functionally important nor shed any light on its regulation, which are key the aspects of our work and that lead to a novel model for stem cell maintenance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Differential post-transcriptional regulation of zfh1 isoforms by miR8 could indeed represent a major regulatory mechanism in setting pMPs population. Authors have tools in their hands to document when this isoform switch takes place. In Figure 2D they show that in 3rd instar larvae Enh3&gt;GFP is largely expressed in Zfh1/Cut positive MPs in the notum region and then they jump to adult stage to show Enh3-GFP restricted to pMPs only. It would be interesting to see when in development this restriction is effective. In other words when the satellite-like pMPs could be identified and visualized for the first time. Time lapse imaging of IFM development in Enh3-GFP pupa (approach developed in Schnorrer lab) could represent an interesting view point as well. The developmental restriction of Enh3-GFP expression should be correlated with miR8 sensor and/or mir8-Gal4 expression to evaluate whether these two regulatory events are coordinated. In relation to this it would be important to better correlate Enh3 activity with transcriptional regulation of zfh1-short isoform.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there was a gap in our analysis of Enh3-GFP and thank them for encouraging us to investigate the timing of its developmental restriction. Following their suggestions we have carried out two further sets of experiments. In the first, we have followed Enh3_GFP and Zfh1 expression at two stages during pupal development, 20h APF and 30h APF, see new Figure 2F, G and subsection “<italic>zfh1</italic> enhancers conferring expression in MPs”, third paragraph. Both Enh3_GFP and Zfh1 are broadly expressed in myoblasts and in MPs at 20h, where a subset of unfused MPs express higher levels of both. By 30hrs Enh3_GFP and Zfh1 are restricted to a few scattered cells, the presumptive pMPs, which are closely apposed to the muscle fibers. At the same stage, a small number of Zfh1+ve cells lack detectable Enh3 expression and we speculate that these are undergoing differentiation. These data suggest that expression from Enh3 correlates with the restriction/selection of the pMPs, which begins around 20 hrs and is largely completed by 30 hrs.</p><p>In the second experiments we have investigated <italic>mIR-8</italic> expression at similar stages (new Figure 5, subsection “<italic>zfh1</italic> is silenced by the conserved microRNA <italic>miR-8/miR-200</italic> in MPs”). At 18-22hr APF <italic>miR-8-Gal4</italic> and Zfh1 expression overlap in most if not all muscle nuclei (new Figure 5D). However <italic>miR-8-Gal4</italic> expression level was elevated in the differentiated myoblasts, whereas Zfh1 expression level was slightly lower in this population and higher in the undifferentiated MPs. By 30h APF, their expression becomes mutually exclusive, except in a few rare MPs where both are co-expressed (new Figure 5E). Thus <italic>mIR-8</italic> and Zfh1 develop reciprocal expression profiles between 20 and 30hr APF, as predicted if <italic>mIR-8</italic> down-regulates Zfh1. The timing of this restriction is similar to that seen for Enh3, supporting the model that Enh3 is responsible for the persistence of Zfh1 in MPs.</p><p><italic>It is unclear whether Enh3 indeed regulates preferentially transcription of zfh1-short. Levels of short and long transcripts could be quantified in ΔdeltaEnh3 context in wing discs (instead of Zfh1 protein shown in Figure 2G) and in adult pMPs.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that we have not fully ruled out the possibility that Enh3 could also regulate <italic>zfh-1-long</italic>. We are hampered by the fact that it is difficult to quantify the transcript levels unless we can reliably measure the individual foci in the FISH, so we could not reliably assess changes in <italic>zfh-1-long</italic> in the wing disc in ∆Enh3. In addition the early lethality of ∆Enh3 means that it is not plausible to monitor the isoforms in the adult pMPs. What we have shown is that Enh3 is the only tested <italic>zfh1</italic> enhancer that is activated and maintained in the pMPs, where <italic>zfh1-short</italic> is the predominant isoform (Figure 2 and 7) and that depletion or up-regulation of Notch, which acts through Enh3, specifically affects <italic>zfh1-short</italic> expression (Figure 8). We cannot exclude that Enh3 also regulates <italic>zfh1-long</italic> in some circumstances, especially as the region defined is 3kb and may encompass more than one regulatory element. We have commented specifically on the possibility in the text (subsection “<italic>zfh1</italic>-short isoform transcription requires Notch activity in adult pMPs” and Figure legend 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding second major finding that zfh1 is required for maintenance of pMPs it could be important to test functional relevance of the two isoforms. Enh3&gt;miR8 could be applied to deplete pMPs of zfh1-long and Enh3&gt;NRNAi to see if effects of N and zfh1RNAi are similar (with experimental setup like in Figure 7). Generation of CRISPRs mutation of zfh1-short promoter/TSS site could help in defining function of this isoform.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken on board the thoughtful suggestions of the reviewer to explore further the role of Zfh1 short by comparing the effects from expressing N-RNAi and <italic>zfh1</italic>-RNAi in the adult pMPs using Gal80ts in combination with Enh3-Gal4 so the knock down occurs only in the adults (new Figure 8I, subsection “<italic>zfh1</italic>-short isoform transcription requires Notch activity in adult pMPs”, last paragraph). Both have similar effects on the muscles, reducing the number of nuclei in the same way as when the pMPs are ablated genetically (new Figure 3). As Notch primarily promotes expression of the <italic>zfh1-short</italic>, this supports the model that this isoform is important in preventing MPs from differentiating. While the generation of a CRISPR mutation specific for <italic>zfh1-short</italic> is potentially a powerful way to further test the role of this isoform, unfortunately it is lethal at an early stage (preliminary unpublished data from a colleague), due to expression of this isoform in embryos, so it is not possible to analyze the adult muscle phenotype.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have also now tested the consequences of forced <italic>miR-8</italic> expression in the adult (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1D) and found that it causes a reduction in pMPs. The fact that the pMPs remain sensitive to miR-8, which would only target <italic>zfh1-long</italic>, suggests that the levels of Zfh1 are finely tuned by the expression of both <italic>zfh1-long</italic> and <italic>zfh1-short</italic> in these cells. We have explicitly discussed this possibility in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Referring to the role of pMPs in muscle homeostasis one complementary experiment could be to test effects of ablation of these cells in adult flies (Enh3&gt;Rpr).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful suggestion. We have, as they proposed, performed a genetic ablation of the pMPs in adult MPs by expressing the proapoptotic gene <italic>reaper</italic>. As predicted this has led to a decrease in muscle nuclei number (new Figure 3, subsection “Adult Zfh1+ve MP cells contribute to flight muscles”, last paragraph). These results are consistent with those from <italic>zfh1</italic> RNAi assays and provide a complementary experiment showing that the pMPs have an important role in muscle homeostasis.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The images they provide are convincing but regarding the intensity it would be good to have further information in how they had performed the analysis. Usually, it is a good idea to do flip-out clones so that there is internal control and one can appreciate the different intensity between the mutant cells and the wt surrounding within the same staining. However this might be difficult for some experiment here.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad the reviewer is positive about all the additional data we have included. We appreciate their concerns about analysis of staining intensities and agree that in tissues where flip-out clones are effective this is a powerful way to have internal controls. Unfortunately, because the cells become dispersed, the method does not work well in this tissue. However, in all cases the experiments have been replicated and we now present the data from those replicates by plotting all of the data points and shading them accordingly. We hope that the more transparent and informative plotting of all our data points demonstrates clearly the robustness of our replicate data sets and addresses these concerns.</p></body></sub-article></article>
