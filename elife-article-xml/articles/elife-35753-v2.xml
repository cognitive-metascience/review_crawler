Since TRIP8b is expressed exclusively in the brain, we envisage that it can be used for orthogonal control of HCN channels beyond the central nervous system. To this end, we have identified by rational design a 40-aa long peptide (TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>) that recapitulates affinity and gating effects of TRIP8b in HCN isoforms (hHCN1, mHCN2, rbHCN4) and in the cardiac current I<sub>f</sub> in rabbit and mouse sinoatrial node cardiomyocytes. Guided by an NMR-derived structural model that identifies the key molecular interactions between TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> and the HCN CNBD, we further designed a cell-penetrating peptide (TAT-TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>) which successfully prevented β-adrenergic activation of mouse I<sub>f</sub> leaving the stimulation of the L-type calcium current (I<sub>CaL</sub>) unaffected. TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> represents a novel approach to selectively control HCN activation, which yields the promise of a more targeted pharmacology compared to pore blockers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cardiac pacemaker</kwd><kwd>HCN</kwd><kwd>cAMP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008027</institution-id><institution>Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship in Neurobiology research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saponaro</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015 Advanced Grant 495 n. 695078 noMAGIC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thiel</surname><given-names>Gerhard</given-names></name><name><surname>Moroni</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002803</institution-id><institution>Fondazione Cariplo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-0796</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banci</surname><given-names>Lucia</given-names></name><name><surname>Santoro</surname><given-names>Bina</given-names></name><name><surname>Moroni</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Instruct-ERIC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banci</surname><given-names>Lucia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS036658</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santoro</surname><given-names>Bina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006474</institution-id><institution>Columbia University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016 Schaefer Research Scholars Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moroni</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell-penetrating peptide drugs prevent adrenergic regulation of pacemaker channels without altering the overall response of the cell to cAMP.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN1-4) channels are the molecular correlate of the I<sub>f</sub>/I<sub>h</sub> current, which plays a key role in controlling several higher order physiological functions, including dendritic integration and intrinsic rhythmicity both in cardiac and neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003</xref>). Unique among the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily, HCN channels are modulated by the direct binding of cAMP to their cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD). Binding of the cyclic nucleotide increases the channel open probability upon hyperpolarization via conformational changes in the CNBD that are propagated to the pore through the C-linker domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiFrancesco and Tortora, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wainger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zagotta et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In addition to cAMP, HCN channels are regulated by TRIP8b, a brain-specific auxiliary (β) subunit, which modulates two independent features of the channel, namely trafficking and gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Santoro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zolles et al., 2009</xref>). For this dual regulation, TRIP8b binds HCN channels through two distinct sites: via the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which interacts with the last three amino acids (SNL) of HCN channels and regulates their trafficking; and via the TRIP8b<sub>core</sub> domain, which interacts with the CNBD and antagonizes the effect of cAMP on the voltage dependency of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Santoro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we focus our attention on the specific action of TRIP8b in preventing cAMP regulation of HCN channels. Given the brain-specific localization of TRIP8b, we posit that a TRIP8b-derived peptide drug, able to reproduce the effect of the full length protein on HCN channel gating, can be developed for orthogonal selective regulation of HCN in cells/tissues in which TRIP8b is not expressed. cAMP-dependent modulation of HCN channels underlies distinct roles of cAMP in heart rate regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DiFrancesco, 1993</xref>) and development of peripheral neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emery et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herrmann et al., 2017</xref>), which can be dissected by using a TRIP8b-based tool. In this regard, peptide-based drugs (2–50 aa long) are emerging as a fascinating application area as they open new therapeutic possibilities with an advantage over small molecules in terms of specificity and affinity for the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fosgerau and Hoffmann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henninot et al., 2018</xref>). To this end, we searched for the minimal peptide that binds to the CNBD and recapitulates the gating effect of full length TRIP8b in three HCN isoforms (HCN1, HCN2 and HCN4) and in the native I<sub>f</sub> current. In previous studies, we identified the core portion of TRIP8b (TRIP8b<sub>core,</sub> 80 aa long) that interacts with the HCN CNBD and prevents cAMP modulation in full length channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Santoro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saponaro et al., 2014</xref>). A recent paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lyman et al., 2017</xref>) reported an even shorter binding sequence of TRIP8b (37 aa). However, this peptide, which was identified by progressive truncation of TRIP8b<sub>core</sub>, failed to reproduce the binding affinity of the starting construct. Moreover, evidence for activity of this peptide on HCN currents is lacking. In the present study, we adopted a structure-driven rational design approach to engineer a 40-aa long peptide, TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>, that efficiently prevents cAMP regulation of HCN channels. The rational design of this peptide, based on secondary structure predictions and on NMR data of TRIP8b<sub>core</sub>, was supported by an NMR-based 3D model structure of the complex formed by the TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> peptide and CNBD of the human HCN2 channel isoform. This structural information identifies crucial interactions between the two partners and explains both direct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeBerg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bankston et al., 2017</xref>) and indirect (allosteric) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saponaro et al., 2014</xref>) modes of competition between TRIP8b and cAMP for binding to the CNBD. The evidence that TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> establishes all relevant interactions with the CNBD is reflected by the finding that, contrary to shorter core sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lyman et al., 2017</xref>), it binds to the isolated CNBD with the same affinity as TRIP8b<sub>core</sub> and acts with even higher efficacy than TRIP8b<sub>core</sub> in preventing cAMP modulation of full length HCN channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2013</xref>).

However, the NMR spectra of TRIP8b<sub>core</sub> showed very few signals. In order to improve the quality of the NMR spectra, we reduced the length of the TRIP8b fragment by progressively removing residues at the N- and C-termini with no predicted secondary structure. The truncated peptides were then tested for CNBD binding activity by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). We thus identified a 40-aa peptide (TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>, comprising residues 235–275 of TRIP8b, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) with a binding K<sub>D</sub> of 1.5 ± 0.1 µM, a value similar to the K<sub>D</sub> of 1.2 ± 0.1 µM obtained with TRIP8b<sub>core</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Remarkably, in all clusters selected in this way, residues E<sub>264</sub> or E<sub>265</sub> in TRIP8b were found to interact with residues K<sub>665</sub> or K<sub>666</sub> of the CNBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This finding was notable, because we previously identified K<sub>665</sub>/K<sub>666</sub> as being critical for TRIP8b interaction in a biochemical binding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saponaro et al., 2014</xref>). We thus proceeded to individually mutate each of these four positions, and test their effect on binding affinity through ITC. As expected, reverse charge mutations K<sub>665</sub>E or K<sub>666</sub>E (CNBD) as well as E<sub>264</sub>K or E<sub>265</sub>K (TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>) each strongly reduced the CNBD/TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Based on these observations, we performed a second molecular docking calculation, including E<sub>264</sub> and E<sub>265</sub> as additional active residues for TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>. This procedure resulted in the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, which represents the top-ranking cluster for energetic and scoring function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>) and was fully validated by mutagenesis analysis as described below. Scrutiny of the model shows that TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> binds to both the C-helix and the N-bundle loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Binding to the C-helix is mainly guided by electrostatic interactions between the negative charges on TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>, and the positive charges on the CNBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the model highlights a double saline bridge (K<sub>665</sub> and K<sub>666</sub> of CNBD with E<sub>265</sub> and E<sub>264</sub> of TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>) in line with the ITC results described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Of note, the contribution of residue R<sub>662</sub> to the binding is also consistent with previous experiments showing residual TRIP8b interaction in a CNBD deletion mutant ending at position 663 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saponaro et al., 2014</xref>). Our modeling data suggest that, upon folding of the distal portion of the C-helix, the side chains of residues R<sub>662</sub> and K<sub>665</sub> face to the inside when contacting cAMP, but face to the outside when binding TRIP8b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). This indicates that cAMP and TRIP8b directly compete for the binding to the distal region of C-helix.</p><p>In addition to clarifying the role of residues in the distal portion of the CNBD C-helix, the model also highlights a second important cluster of electrostatic interactions, with R<sub>650</sub> in the proximal portion of the CNBD C-helix contacting E<sub>240</sub> and E<sub>241</sub> in helix N of TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To confirm the contribution of these residues, we reversed charges and tested each residue mutation for binding in ITC. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> show that R<sub>650</sub>E caused a more than six-fold reduction in binding affinity for TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>, with smaller but significant effects seen also for E<sub>240</sub>R and E<sub>241</sub>R.</p><p>A third important contact highlighted by the model is the interaction between N<sub>547</sub> in the N-bundle loop of the CNBD and D<sub>252</sub> in the link between helix N and helix C of TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We tested this potential interaction by disrupting the expected hydrogen bond between N<sub>547</sub> and the carboxyl group of the negative residue (D<sub>252</sub>) in TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>. The asparagine in CNBD was mutated into aspartate (N<sub>547</sub>D) to generate an electrostatic repulsion for D<sub>252</sub>, and the carboxyl group in D<sub>252</sub> of TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> was removed by mutation into asparagine (D<sub>252</sub>N). As predicted, N<sub>547</sub>D greatly reduced binding to TRIP8b in ITC assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), with a smaller but significant effect observed also for D<sub>252</sub>N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results confirm and extend our previous finding that the N-bundle loop contributes in a substantial manner to the binding of TRIP8b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saponaro et al., 2014</xref>). To understand the mechanism for the allosteric effect of TRIP8b on cAMP binding, which has been postulated on the basis of electrophysiological and structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saponaro et al., 2014</xref>), we further tested by ITC the affinity of the N<sub>547</sub>D CNBD mutant for cAMP. Somewhat surprisingly, the affinity of the mutant is much lower than that of the wt (N<sub>547</sub>D K<sub>D</sub> = 5.5 ± 0.4 µM (n = 3) <italic>vs</italic>. wt K<sub>D</sub> = 1.4 ± 0.1 µM (n = 3)). Moreover, we measured a reduced sensitivity to cAMP also in patch clamp experiments where addition of 5 μM cAMP caused a right shift in the V<sub>1/2</sub> of the mutant HCN2 channel of only 5 mV while the wt channel shifted by 12 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). To exclude that the N<sub>547</sub>D mutation affects the overall structure of the CNBD, we performed the NMR (<sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum) analysis of the N<sub>547</sub>D CNBD mutant. Our data show that the protein is appropriately folded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). In conclusion, since the N-bundle loop does not directly contact any of the residues of the cAMP binding pocket, these findings underscore a previously unaddressed role of the N-bundle loop in allosterically modulating cAMP binding to the CNBD (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> as a tool for the direct regulation of native HCN currents</title><p>Next, we asked whether the relatively short TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> could be used to block cAMP-dependent modulation of HCN channels by delivering the peptide to full length channels. To this end, we dialyzed TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> into the cytosol of HEK 293 T cells transfected either with HCN1, HCN2, or HCN4 channels. The peptide was added (10 µM) in the recording pipette together with a non-saturating concentration of cAMP (5 µM for HCN2, 1 µM for HCN4) expected to induce a ~ 10 mV rightward shift in the half-activation potential (V<sub>1/2</sub>) of the channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Already from a visual comparison of the most positive voltage at which the current appears measurable, it is evident that TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> counteracts the activating effect of cAMP on the voltage-dependent gating. In the case of HCN1, the effect of TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> can be observed without added cAMP for the aforementioned reasons. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref> show the mean channel activation curves obtained from the above and other experiments.

In HCN1, TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> induced a left shift in V<sub>1/2</sub> of about 10 mV (from – 72.8 to −82 mV) which is comparable to that induced by the R<sub>549</sub>E mutation (from −72.7 to −80.4 mV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> also shows the result of a control experiment performed on HCN4 where 10 µM TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> was added to the extracellular medium (TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> bath) in order to test if the peptide was able to cross the cell membrane (current traces and activation curves not shown). The V<sub>1/2</sub> value, which is similar to that of cAMP alone (−91.7 vs. −89.2 mV), confirmed that TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> peptide affects channel gating only if added to the intracellular solution presumably because it does not diffuse through the cell membrane.</p><p>It is worth noting that TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> prevents other related effects of cAMP activation in HCN channels, such as the acceleration of activation kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wainger et al., 2001</xref>) and, for HCN2 only, the increase in maximal current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2013</xref>).

As proof of principle, we tested whether TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> can modulate the frequency of action potential firing in SAN myocytes. In these cells, I<sub>f</sub> is key contributor of the diastolic depolarization phase of the pacemaker action potential cycle. Moreover, the autonomic nervous system modulates the frequency of action potential firing by changing intracellular cAMP levels, which in turn acts on f-HCN channel open probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DiFrancesco, 1993</xref>). We thus recorded the native I<sub>f</sub> current in acutely isolated rabbit SAN myocytes with and without 10 µM TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> in the pipette solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows that the averaged I<sub>f</sub> activation curve measured in presence of TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> is significantly shifted to hyperpolarized voltages compared to the control. This indicates that the peptide is displacing the binding of endogenous cAMP to native HCN channels. Moreover, when the experiment was repeated in the presence of 1 µM cAMP, TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> prevented the typical cAMP-dependent potentiation of the native I<sub>f</sub> current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In light of these results, we tested whether TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> is also able to modulate cardiac automaticity by antagonizing basal cAMP.

The peptide is 40 aa long and binds the HCN CNBD with high affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 1.4 μM). By solving the NMR structures of TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> and HCN CNBD in the bound form, we generated a structural model of their complex. The model provides detailed information on this protein-protein interaction at the atomic level with implications on their physiological function. The data show that the minimal binding unit of TRIP8b, TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>, folds in two helices upon binding and suggest that this region is intrinsically disordered when it is not bound. The model structurally validates previous indirect evidence, which suggested that TRIP8b binds to two discrete elements of the CNBD: the N-bundle loop and the C-helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saponaro et al., 2014</xref>). The complex forms by electrostatic interactions, which are spread throughout the contact surface. As a consequence of the interaction with TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>, the C-helix of CNBD increases in length, a behavior previously observed in the case of cAMP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Puljung and Zagotta, 2013</xref>). This portion of C-helix includes the two residues R<sub>662</sub> and K<sub>665</sub> engaged in salt bridge formation with respectively E<sub>250</sub>/D<sub>257</sub> and E<sub>264</sub> of TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>. It is important to note that these two cationic residues are also involved in cAMP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zagotta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhou and Siegelbaum, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lolicato et al., 2011</xref>). The finding that TRIP8b and cAMP share the same binding sites on the C-helix provides a solid molecular explanation for functional data, which imply a competition between the two regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeBerg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bankston et al., 2017</xref>). Another study, however, has indicated that a direct competition model cannot fully explain the mutually antagonistic effect of the two ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, the fact that the inhibitory effect of TRIP8b on channel activity persists even at saturating cAMP concentrations advocated an allosteric component in the regulation mechanism. Our data, showing that the N<sub>547</sub>D mutation in the N-bundle loop controls cAMP affinity in the binding pocket support the conclusion that the N-bundle loop allosterically controls cAMP binding. This is not surprising, given its crucial role of mechanically transducing to the pore the cAMP binding event within the CNBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saponaro et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The structural model also explains why a previously identified peptide selected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lyman et al. (2017</xref>) failed to reproduce the binding affinity of the TRIP8b<sub>core</sub> for the CNBD. This 37 aa long fragment is lacking one important contact residue, namely E<sub>240, </sub>which, in our model, forms a salt bridge with R<sub>650</sub> of the CNBD. The loss of one crucial interaction is presumably the reason for the major decrease in affinity (about 20 times lower) reported for this peptide.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> as a tool for modulating native I<sub>f</sub> currents</title><p>In functional assays, we showed that TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> binds the HCN channel CNBD with high affinity and fully abolishes the cAMP effect in all tested isoforms (HCN1, 2 and 4).</p><p>Given the small size of the peptide (&lt;5 kDa), TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> is a good candidate for in vivo delivery into intact cells. As a proof of concept, we fused TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> to an internalization sequence, the TAT peptide (YGRKKRRQRRRGG). This arginine-rich Cell Penetrating Peptide (CPP) from HIV has been used in several studies as a vehicle for the delivery of large molecules across the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guidotti et al., 2017</xref>). In our case, the challenge was to construct a TAT-fusion protein, which would be efficiently delivered in the cell without compromising TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> function. Indeed, covalent conjugation of a CPP may negatively affect both the function of the cargo, and the cell-penetrating efficacy of the CPP-peptide chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kristensen et al., 2016</xref>). The design of the construct was greatly supported by the detailed knowledge of the electrostatic interactions with the target protein CNBD, provided by the NMR model structure. This structure suggested that the polycationic TAT sequence would be best linked to the N-terminus of TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> to avoid interference with the cationic residues of CNBD, mainly located in the distal region of C-helix, which are crucial for the binding of the peptide. From test experiments with the TAT-TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> peptide in SAN myocytes, we can conclude that this strategy was successful in that: (i) the peptide is efficiently delivered inside the cells; (ii) it is kept in its active conformation; (iii) the TAT sequence did not damage cell membranes and did not interfere with the basic features of I<sub>f</sub> and I<sub>Ca,L</sub> currents; (iv) the modification did not affect the proteolytic stability of the TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> peptide at least in the time frame of our experiments (30 min to 1 hr).</p><p>In conclusion, we successfully used the miniaturized TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> peptide to selectively control native I<sub>f</sub> currents and the rate of spontaneous firing in SAN myocytes. Unlike channel blockers, which inhibit ionic currents, the peptide only interferes with the cAMP-based regulation of HCN channels, while leaving basal HCN functions unaltered. In addition and in contrast to even the most selective blockers, it is selective for HCN and it does not interfere with other cAMP-modulated channels present in the SAN, such as L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Collectively, this makes TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> a promising tool in targeted therapeutic interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>species</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (human)</td><td valign="top">HCN1</td><td valign="top">Xention Ltd. <break/>(Cambridge, UK)</td><td valign="top">NM_021072.3</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (mouse)</td><td valign="top">HCN2</td><td valign="top">PMID: 11331358</td><td valign="top">NM_008226.2</td><td valign="top">Laboratory of Steven A. <break/>Siegelbaum</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (rabbit)</td><td valign="top">HCN4</td><td valign="top">PMID: 10212270</td><td valign="top">NM_001082707.1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (mouse)</td><td valign="top">TRIP8b</td><td valign="top">PMID: 19555649</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Laboratory of Steven A. <break/>Siegelbaum</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">DH5α</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Stbl2</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Mus</italic> <break/><italic>musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Male or female C57BL/6J mice</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mousemine.org/mousemine/portal.do?class=Strain&amp;externalids=MGI:5653012">MGI:5653012</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Oryctolagus</italic> <break/><italic>cuniculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">New Zealand white female <break/>rabbits</td><td valign="top">Envigo</td><td valign="top">ID strain:HsdOkd:NZW</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (human)</td><td valign="top">HEK 293T</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Tested negative for <break/>mycoplasma</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Isolated adult Sinoatrial node <break/>(SAN) cardiomyocytes</td><td valign="top">PMID: 11557233</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample <break/>(<italic>Oryctolagus cuniculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Isolated adult Sinoatrial node <break/>(SAN) cardiomyocytes</td><td valign="top">PMID: 2432247</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA <break/>reagent</td><td valign="top">pET-52b (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">EMD Millipore</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA <break/>reagent</td><td valign="top">modified pET-24b (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">Laboratory of Daniel L. <break/>Minor, Jr.</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA <break/>reagent</td><td valign="top">pcDNA 3.1 (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">Clontech Laboratories</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA <break/>reagent</td><td valign="top">pCI (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">Promega</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA <break/>reagent</td><td valign="top">TRIP8bnano (cDNA)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Made by PCR and <break/>cloning;

Patch-clamp pipettes were filled with an intracellular solution containing: 130 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.2).</p><p>For recording of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, pipette solution contained: 125 mM CsOH, 20 mM tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl), 1.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM Mg-ATP, 0.1 mM Li<sub>2</sub>-GTP, 5 mM EGTA and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2 with aspartate). 30 µM TTX (Latoxan, Portes lès Valence, France) to block INa was added to external solution containing: 135 mM tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl), 4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>,10 mM 4-amino-pyridine, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES and 1 mg/ml Glucose (pH 7.4 with TEA-OH).</p><p>Electrodes had a resistance of about 3 MΩ. Seal resistances were in the range of 2–5 GΩ. 10 µM TRIPb8<sub>nano</sub> was added to pipette solution. 10 µM TAT-TRIPb8<sub>nano</sub> was added in cell storage solution for at least 30 min before patch clamp recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>TAT-peptides</title><p>TAT-TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> (<bold>YGRKKRRQRRRGG</bold>-NHSLEEEFERAKAAVESTEFWDKMQAEWEEMARRNWISEN, TAT sequence is shown in bold type) and TAT-(SCRAMBLED)TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> (<bold>YGRKKRRQRRRGG</bold>-RNEAEAAEVAQKDMINERARTHEFEWESWEMWENLSESFK, TAT sequence is shown in bold type) were purchased from CASLO ApS. TAT-peptides were dissolved in Milliq water (1.5 mM) and added to the petri dish at the final concentration (10 µM) 30 min before current recordings. During the patch clamp experiments, cells were perfused with standard Tyrode with 2 mM BaCl<sub>2</sub> (see above) without the peptides. Recordings from the same petri dish were performed over a time window of 10 to 60 min in peptide-free solution</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were acquired at 1 kHz using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp10.5 or 10.7 software (Axon Instruments). Data were analyzed off-line using Clampfit 10.5 or 10.7 (Molecular Devices) and Origin 2015 or 16 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton MA). Activation curves were analyzed by the Boltzmann equation, y = 1/{1 + exp[(V−V<sub>1/2</sub>)/s]}, where y is fractional activation, V is voltage, V<sub>1/2</sub> half-activation voltage, and s the inverse slope factor (mV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DiFrancesco, 1999</xref>). Mean activation curves were obtained by fitting individual curves from each cell to the Boltzmann equation and then averaging all curves obtained. Activation time constants (τ<sub>on</sub>) were obtained by fitting a single exponential function,</p><p>I=I<sub>0</sub> exp(-t/τ) to current traces recorded at the indicated voltages.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Experiments on rabbit SAN cells were performed using left-over cells obtained during experiments approved by the Animal Welfare Body of the University of Milan and by the Italian Ministry of Health (license n.1127/2015-PR).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Volker Dötsch as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Catherine Proenza (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Structure-guided design of a synthetic peptide for orthogonal control of HCN channels,&quot; by Moroni et al. investigates a novel, rationally engineered polypeptide for the control of HCN channels in vivo. The group utilized an endogenous regulator of HCN channels (TRIP8b) to design their 40 amino acid functional regulator (TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>). This peptide antagonizes the binding of cAMP to the HCN channels. The group proceeds to use isothermal calorimetry, NMR spectroscopy and reverse charge mutations to define the interaction sites and structure between HCN channels and the TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>. Finally, the group uses the TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> to modulate HCN channels and their resulting currents in both HEK 293 cells and in rabbit and mouse SAN cells. Of particular interest therapeutically, the TAT internalization sequence was used for application of the TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> to a portion of the rabbit SAN cells. This work is important as specific modulation of I<sub>f</sub> has potential utility therapeutically, especially when compared to current ion channel pore blockers.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) What is the justification for utilizing reverse charge mutations as opposed to alanine mutation? It seems like a reverse charge mutation biases the system toward less interaction between the HCN and TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>.</p><p>2) Is there any data on how long the TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> is able to maintain an effect in vivo?</p><p>3) In the Discussion it is stated that the TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> is entirely specific for HCN channels. Is this too strong of an assertion? Is there any data regarding off target effects on non-ion channel targets?</p><p>4) Include legends in some of the figures for clarification. (Figure 4B, Figure 5B).</p><p>5) The peptide experiments should be supported by controls using scrambled peptides. This is particularly important for charged TAT peptides, which can have non-specific effects.</p><p>6) Related to this, what is the evidence that the TAT-fused peptide indeed translocates into the cell? Have control experiments with the non-TAT-fused peptide been performed? These should not be able to penetrate the cell.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35753.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) What is the justification for utilizing reverse charge mutations as opposed to alanine mutation? It seems like a reverse charge mutation biases the system toward less interaction between the HCN and TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 3, the CNBD ‐ TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> interaction is mainly driven by an electrostatic network rather than single, isolated salt bridges. Therefore, our choice to invert charges instead of neutralize them was to overcome possible compensatory effects deriving from the network of electrostatic interactions. The reviewer is certainly right, a reverse charge mutation biases the system toward less interaction. But in the case of three negative charges (D<sub>257</sub>, E<sub>264</sub>, E<sub>265</sub>) facing three positive ones (R<sub>662</sub>, K<sub>665</sub>, K<sub>666</sub>), we considered the possibility of compensatory effects form the neighbors very likely. Similar consideration holds also for E<sub>241</sub> and E<sub>240</sub> although we could have performed R<sub>650</sub>A. In this case we decided not to, for coherence with the rest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is there any data on how long the TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> is able to maintain an effect in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>Cells were pretreated by adding the cell‐penetrating peptides TAT‐TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> and TAT‐ (SCRAMBLED) TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> (see below our reply to point 5) but also TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> (see our reply to point 6) to the extracellular solution, 30 minutes before the experiment. At the end of the pretreatment, cells were patched under constant perfusion of extracellular solution that did not contain the (TAT)‐peptides. Our patch recordings nevertheless show that TAT‐TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> was still effective even after 60 minutes from the beginning of the experiment. This indicates in our view that TAT‐TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub>, once accumulated inside, is not released from the cell and maintains its effect up to 1 hours without becoming toxic.</p><p>We have added an explanatory paragraph on the modality of the experiment with TAT‐peptides (Materials and methods, subsection “TAT-peptides”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the Discussion it is stated that the TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> is entirely specific for HCN channels. Is this too strong of an assertion? Is there any data regarding off target effects on non-ion channel targets?</p></disp-quote><p>In agreement with the reviewer we have rephrased the sentence as follows:</p><p>“…it is selective for HCN and it does not interfere with other cAMP‐modulated channels present in the SAN, such as L‐type Ca<sup>2+</sup>channels. Collectively, this makes TRIP8b<sub>nano</sub> a promising tool in targeted therapeutic interventions”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Include legends in some of the figures for clarification.
