and biophysical properties of the cytosol implicitly govern molecular interactions within cells. However, little is known about mechanisms by which cells regulate cytosolic properties and intracellular diffusion rates. Here, we demonstrate that the intracellular environment of budding yeast undertakes a startling transition upon glucose starvation in which macromolecular mobility is dramatically restricted, reducing the movement of both chromatin in the nucleus and mRNPs in the cytoplasm. This confinement cannot be explained by an ATP decrease or the physiological drop in intracellular pH. Rather, our results suggest that the regulation of diffusional mobility is induced by a reduction in cell volume and subsequent increase in molecular crowding which severely alters the biophysical properties of the intracellular environment. A similar response can be observed in fission yeast and bacteria. This reveals a novel mechanism by which cells globally alter their properties to establish a unique homeostasis during starvation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09376.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09376.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09376.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most organisms live in unpredictable environments, which can often lead to nutrient shortages and other conditions that limit their ability to grow. To survive in these harsh conditions, many organisms adopt a dormant state in which their metabolism slows down to conserve vital energy. When the environmental conditions improve, the organisms can return to their normal state and continue to grow.</p><p>The interior of cells is known as the cytoplasm. It is very crowded and contains many molecules and compartments that carry out a variety of vital processes. The cytoplasm has long been considered to be fluid-like in nature, but recent evidence suggests that in bacterial cells it can solidify to resemble a glass-like material under certain conditions. When cells experience stress they stop dividing and alter their metabolism. However, it was not clear whether cells also alter their physical properties in response to changes in the environment.</p><p>Now, Joyner et al. starve yeast cells of sugar and track the movements of two large molecules called mRNPs and chromatin. Chromatin is found in a cell compartment known as the nucleus, while mRNPs are found in the cytoplasm. The experiments show that during starvation, both molecules are less able to move around in their respective areas of the cell. This appears to be due to water loss from the cells, which causes the cells to become smaller and leads to the interior of the cell becoming more crowded. Joyner et al. also observed a similar response in bacteria. Furthermore, Joyner et al. suggest that the changes in physical properties are critical for cells to survive the stress caused by starvation.</p><p>A separate study by Munder et al. found that when cells become dormant the cytoplasm becomes more acidic, which causes many proteins to bind to each other and form large clumps. Together, the findings of the studies suggest that the interior of cells can undergo a transition from a fluid-like to a more solid-like state to protect the cells from damage when energy is in short supply. The next challenge is to understand the molecular mechanisms that cause the physical properties of the cells to change under different conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09376.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09376.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>crowding</kwd><kwd>diffusion</kwd><kwd>starvation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM058065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weis</surname><given-names>Karsten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM101257</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weis</surname><given-names>Karsten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SNF 159731</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weis</surname><given-names>Karsten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 182-2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dultz</surname><given-names>Elisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During stress conditions, eukaryotic cells dramatically alter their biophysical properties to regulate diffusion of macromolecules.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic cells expend a significant amount of energy to establish and maintain a high degree of intracellular organization in order to regulate and orchestrate their complex metabolism. This includes the active enrichment of macromolecules into organelles, which in turn allows for the separation of biochemical pathways and enhances their efficiency by increasing local concentrations of enzymes and metabolites. Similarly, active transport by motor proteins on the cytoskeleton enables large eukaryotic cells to overcome the limits of Brownian motion in which the diffusion time scales with the square of the distance. Nevertheless, many cellular pathways and biochemical interactions are dependent on Brownian diffusion. Much research has therefore been performed to characterize diffusional processes that occur within eukaryotic cells. These studies have revealed that the very complex and extremely crowded cytosol of eukaryotic cells cannot be viewed as an ideal liquid but, instead, can be modeled as a polymer gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luby-Phelps, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clegg, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knull and Minton, 1996</xref>) or soft colloidal glass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fabry et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mandadapu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luby-Phelps, 2000</xref>). Still, a comprehensive understanding of the biophysical properties of eukaryotic cells is lacking, and it remains poorly understood how these characteristics influence macromolecular movement. Furthermore, little is known about the biological determinants of intracellular diffusion including whether cells functionally regulate their diffusional properties in response to changes in growth conditions or the environment.</p><p>A particularly well-studied model of intracellular movement is the motion of chromatin in the nucleus. Various groups have analyzed chromatin mobility, but a coherent mechanistic understanding of this process has yet to emerge (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hübner and Spector, 2010</xref>). For example, it was shown that chromosomes wiggle in a manner consistent with constrained diffusion and it was proposed that chromosome movement results from Brownian motion rather than from active motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marshall et al., 1997</xref>). In contrast, other studies have suggested that chromatin movement is ATP dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heun et al., 2001</xref>), and it was hypothesized that chromatin movement is driven by a multitude of ATP-dependent processes along the length of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neumann et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, the role of the cytoskeleton in chromatin movement has remained controversial. For example, both microtubule-dependent and -independent movement was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heun et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marshall et al., 1997</xref>), and several recent studies have also implicated the actin cytoskeleton in chromatin mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chuang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koszul et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spagnol and Dahl, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spichal et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To better characterize the diffusional properties of eukaryotic cells, we have analyzed here the movement of chromatin and mRNPs in budding yeast under changing growth conditions. Our results demonstrate that cells dramatically change their biophysical properties in response to glucose starvation, which causes a confinement of macromolecules and affects the mechanical properties of the cell. This effect cannot be explained by changes in ATP levels or pH but can be induced by a loss of cell volume without any change in cell mass. This response seems to be conserved as bacteria similarly restrict macromolecular mobility in response to starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parry et al., 2014</xref>), and we show here that starvation also induces a volume loss in bacterial cells and severely affects the rigidity of fission yeast cells. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which cells regulate their biophysical properties in order to adapt to environmental stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Glucose starvation limits macromolecular mobility in the nucleus and cytoplasm</title><p>To examine the effects of changes in growth conditions on nuclear chromatin dynamics in budding yeast, we analyzed the movement of various gene loci.

nucleus, or whether it also influences the mobility of other macromolecules, we imaged the movement of cytoplasmic mRNPs, which can be conveniently tracked as single particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shav-Tal et al., 2004</xref>). 24-PP7 stem-loops were integrated into the 3’ UTR of <italic>GFA1</italic> and <italic>FBA1</italic>, essential genes involved in distinct processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lagorce et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schwelberger et al., 1989</xref>), and the movement of individual mRNPs was examined upon co-expression of the coat-binding protein, CP-PP7-3xYFP. Cumulative track projections revealed substantially higher mobility for mRNPs than chromosomal loci in glucose, which is expected given the significantly smaller size of mRNPs compared to chromosome fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thompson et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zarnack and Feldbrügge, 2007</xref>). Yet, upon glucose starvation, <italic>GFA1</italic> and <italic>FBA1</italic> mRNPs also exhibited a dramatic reduction in their mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Removal of glucose led to a three- to four-fold decrease in the diffusion coefficient of both <italic>GFA1</italic> (K<italic><sub>GFA1</sub></italic>reduced from 4.2 x 10<sup>–2</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s to 1.3 x 10<sup>–2</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s) and <italic>FBA1</italic> (K<italic><sub>FBA1</sub></italic>reduced from 5.0 x 10<sup>–2</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s to 1.4 x 10<sup>-2</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s) mRNPs without affecting the anomalous exponent (α). These values are similar to the relative change that we observed in the diffusion of chromatin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Depletion of glucose by growth into quiescence also confined the mobility of mRNPs; therefore, the effects we observe are not a consequence of our cell washes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). The decrease in mobility of both chromosomal loci and mRNP particles suggests that glucose starvation causes a confinement of macromolecules in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Starvation arrests cytoskeletal dynamics, which constrains chromatin mobility but has little effect on mRNPs</title><p>To begin to understand the nature and mechanism of the starvation-induced reduction in chromatin and mRNP mobility, we first focused on the cytoskeleton. In eukaryotes, the movement of many macromolecules is directly influenced by the dynamics of the cytoskeleton. For instance, mRNPs can be actively transported by motor proteins along the cytoskeleton and both the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules were reported to influence chromatin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thompson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koszul et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spagnol and Dahl, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spichal et al., 2016</xref>).

In order to test this hypothesis, we treated cells with the actin depolymerizer, latrunculin A (LatA), and/or the microtubule depolymerizing drug, nocodazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayscough et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jacobs et al., 1988</xref>). Indeed, treatment with either drug reduced chromatin movement, although the effect was insufficient to mimic the confinement of chromatin during starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Concurrent treatments with LatA and nocodazole reduced chromatin mobility in an additive manner to substantially reduce chromatin mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, log-log MSD plots indicate that the effect of inhibiting the cytoskeleton is most apparent at longer time intervals and may augment the anomalous behavior of chromatin motion (α<italic><sub>POA1</sub></italic><sub>-DMSO</sub> = 0.56 versus α<italic><sub>POA1</sub></italic><sub>-Noc+LatA</sub> = 0.48; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The actin and microtubule cytoskeleton could either act on chromatin itself or affect chromatin mobility indirectly by influencing overall nuclear motion. To differentiate between these two possibilities, we tracked the distance between two labelled chromosomal loci (<italic>POA1</italic>, chromosome II and <italic>PES4</italic>, chromosome VI) over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This approach allows for the exclusive quantification of intranuclear movements because translational changes in the positioning of the nucleus affect both loci identically and thus, do not influence intranuclear distance measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marshall et al., 1997</xref>). This two-locus analysis confirmed the LatA and nocodazole-induced reduction in chromatin mobility as the interchromosomal distance between the two loci still decreased considerably with simultaneous drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of note, however, this result cannot differentiate between cytoplasmic or nuclear cytoskeletal dynamics in modulating chromatin mobility (e.g. via deformations of the nucleus). In conclusion, actin and microtubule dynamics independently contribute to the mobility of yeast chromatin.</p><p>In contrast to chromatin mobility, mRNP mobility was only moderately affected by perturbation of cytoskeletal dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggesting that the mobility of the <italic>GFA1</italic> and <italic>FBA1</italic> mRNPs is largely independent of the cytoskeleton. Overall, our results show that glucose starvation restricts cytoskeleton-independent mobility as well as the mobility of macromolecules influenced by the cytoskeleton.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Reduction of ATP is insufficient to explain the macromolecular confinement</title><p>Our results so far could be explained by two alternative models: 1) starvation impacts macromolecular diffusion through multiple, distinct mechanisms, or 2) a singular, starvation-induced pathway restricts the mobility of macromolecules, and leads to both the collapse of cytoskeletal dynamics and the restriction of mRNP mobility. The acute withdrawal of glucose in fermenting yeast cells is expected to have dramatic consequences on cellular physiology. For example, the cellular ATP concentration drops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashe et al., 2000</xref>) and the intracellular pH decreases in starved cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Orij et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore tested whether these global changes in cellular physiology lead to the observed changes in macromolecular mobility.</p><p>First, we investigated the changes in intracellular ATP concentration during starvation. Upon glucose starvation, the ATP concentration rapidly decreased by ~70%. Remarkably, after this initial drop, ATP levels were relatively stable at ~30% of the initial concentration for the remainder of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Of note, the maintenance of this reduced ATP level required oxidative phosphorylation as the cellular ATP concentration quickly dropped to nearly undetectable levels when cells deficient in mitochondrial function were starved (<italic>cbp2</italic>∆; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shaw and Lewin, 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, when cells washed in sugar-free medium were back-diluted into media containing glucose, ATP levels recovered to the initial concentration within 30. Thus, glucose starvation induces a rapid ~70% reduction of intracellular ATP levels in agreement with previously published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Özalp et al., 2010</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09376.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>A ~70% reduction of intracellular ATP is insufficient to replicate the macromolecular confinement of glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Intracellular ATP concentrations of acutely glucose-starved yeast were back-diluted into media containing 2% dextrose (n = 2 experiments), 2% dextrose + 0.02% azide (n = 2 experiments), or maintained in (–) glucose media (n = 3 experiments).

If the hypothesis was correct that a decrease of cell volume was the singular response that confines macromolecular mobility, two predictions could be made: (1) lowering the pH<sub>i</sub> by the addition of K<sup>+</sup>Sorbate might induce a decrease in cellular volume since high concentrations of potassium sorbate can replicate the confinement of both chromatin and mRNPs during starvation, and (2) manipulation of cellular volumes, for example, by changes in osmolarity should recapitulate the effects of glucose starvation on cytoskeleton-independent mobility (mRNPs) and on mobility influenced by the cytoskeleton (chromatin).</p><p>To test our first prediction, we explored the effect of pH<sub>i</sub> changes on cell volume. Remarkably, lowering pH<sub>i</sub> by the addition of K<sup>+</sup>Sorbate also induced an increasing reduction in cell volume. Strikingly, addition of 8 mM K<sup>+</sup>Sorbate, which led to the same mobility decrease as glucose starvation, reduced the median cell volume to 87.1 fL (<italic>σ</italic> = 46.3), a level virtually identical to that of glucose-starved cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Although intracellular acidification led to a decrease in cell volume, it was not required for this decrease since starvation in (–) glucose media adjusted to pH 7.4, preventing an intracellular pH drop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dechant et al., 2010</xref>), also reduced the cell volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, the effects of K<sup>+</sup>Sorbate are better explained in terms of volume decrease than pH changes. These data suggest a strong relationship between cell size and macromolecular mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To further test our model, we manipulated the cellular volume by changing the extracellular osmolarity. We treated cells with increasing concentrations of NaCl and monitored the effects on chromatin and mRNPs. Notably, addition of NaCl had little effect on pH<sub>i</sub> or cellular ATP levels, allowing us to uncouple the effects of cell volume from these factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>, both chromatin and mRNP mobility were progressively confined by increasing the magnitude of osmotic shock, consistent with recent results demonstrating that osmotic shock affects intracellular diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babazadeh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miermont et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, a reduction of cell volume is sufficient to explain the starvation-induced confinement of macromolecular mobility.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The reduction in volume leads to an increase in molecular crowding</title><p>We next explored how decreased cell volume could impede the movement of macromolecules. In the very densely packed environment of the cell, a reduction in the volume accessible to diffusing molecules can alter protein-protein interactions and induce complex phase changes such as liquid-to-gel-like or liquid-to-glass-like transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doliwa and Heurer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weeks et al., 2000</xref>). To test whether glucose starvation causes an increase in molecular crowding, we examined whether the observed volume loss is compensated by a reduction in the total biomass of the cell. We performed lyophilization mass measurement experiments in which starved and non-starved yeast cells were freeze-dried to remove their water content, and their masses were measured and normalized against the total number of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We saw no significant difference between the non-starved and starved samples (11.5 ± 0.5 pg/cell and 11.9 ± 0.4 pg/cell, respectively; mean ± standard deviation for three independent experiments). Importantly, yeast cells grown continuously in raffinose, which are known to be smaller than cells grown on glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tyson et al., 1979</xref>) and thus served as a positive control, showed a 23% reduction in cell mass (8.9 pg/cell) compared to cells grown in glucose. Thus, acute glucose starvation does not induce a decrease in cell mass despite a significant reduction in the accessible cellular volume. This increase in mass density suggests that the intracellular environment experiences increased molecular crowding conditions, which may lead to broad changes in the material properties of the cell.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09376.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A conserved glucose starvation response alters the mechanical properties of the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dry mass measurements of non-starved and starved yeast.

Our setup used wedged AFM cantilevers for parallel plate compression to characterize yeast cell morphology. These live-cell micro-compression experiments provide measurements of cellular viscoelasticity and cell stiffness under various conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stewart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramanathan et al., 2015</xref>). After removal of the cell wall, glucose-starved and non-starved yeast spheroplasts were subjected to AFM measurements. Force-response curves were recorded while compressing single cells and analysis showed that glucose starvation induced a change in the cells’ mechanical properties increasing their mean stiffness from 18 to 22 nN·µm<sup>–1</sup> as well as increasing the cell-to-cell variability in stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Consistent with the cell size measurements described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), these AFM experiments also suggest that starved yeast cells are smaller than the corresponding control cells and that there appears to be a negative correlation between cell size and stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In a separate approach, we also investigated the rigidity of the cytoplasm by examining cell morphology after removal of the cell wall. Without an intact cell wall, the cytoplasmic turgor pressure causes the yeast spheroplast to ‘ball up’ into a sphere. Since budding yeast cells are naturally round to begin with, we treated cells with the mating pheromone α-factor to generate shmoos, mating projections that cause the cell to become substantially elongated. Spheroplasted shmooed cells which were not starved of glucose behaved as expected and formed spherical spheroplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Intriguingly, starved shmooed spheroplasts remained predominantly in an elongated form (~four-fold less spherical spheroplasts in starved versus non-starved conditions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). This resistance to the internal turgor pressure suggests that the starved yeast cytoplasm is significantly more rigid than that of non-starved yeast, consistent with our AFM measurements. Furthermore, this stiffening is reversible as re-addition of glucose to the starved spheroplasts returned them to a spherical form (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>), suggesting that sensory feedback pathways may exist to actively regulate this stiffening mechanism. Taken together our results demonstrate that budding yeast cells undergo dramatic biophysical changes upon acute glucose starvation affecting their viscoelastic properties in addition to their intracellular macromolecular diffusion.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-09376-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09376.020</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Spheroplasted budding yeast shmoos.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09376.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09376.020</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-09376-media2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09376.021</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Spheroplasted starved budding yeast shmoos.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09376.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09376.021</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-09376-media3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09376.022</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Re-addition of glucose to spheroplasted starved budding yeast shmoos.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09376.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09376.022</ext-link></p></caption></media></p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Changes in biophysical properties are a conserved starvation response</title><p>To examine whether similar biophysical changes can also be observed in other unicellular eukaryotes upon glucose withdrawal, we monitored the starvation-response of the fission yeast, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe.</italic> Budding and fission yeast separated evolutionarily several hundred million years ago, and they are as different from each other as either is from metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sipiczki, 2000</xref>).

Strikingly, a 30 min treatment of <italic>E.coli</italic> with 2 mM DNP caused a significant reduction in the volume of <italic>E.coli</italic>, inducing a ~9.5% modal volume contraction (SD = ± 4.1%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). It should be noted, however, that the treatment utilized here, for technical reasons, is longer than the DNP-incubation time reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parry et al. (2014)</xref>. Nevertheless, this result suggests that the reported liquid-to-solid like phase transition of the bacterial cytoplasm may also be triggered by cellular volume loss and suggests that the starvation-induced reduction of cell size could be a deeply conserved starvation response.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results identify a novel cellular response that severely alters the biophysical properties of cells and restricts intracellular diffusion in response to glucose starvation. The dramatic macromolecular confinement observed upon starvation of budding yeast cannot be explained by a reduction of intracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), by a drop in pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) or inhibition of global metabolism, as respiration persists upon glucose depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Instead, we propose that increased macromolecular crowding induced by an acute volume loss fundamentally alters the mechanically properties of cells leading to macromolecular confinement. Our results further suggest that both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells regulate the level of crowding in order to control intracellular diffusion and macromolecular interactions. In this context, it is intriguing that metazoan cells also seem to regulate their cellular volume as it was recently reported that tissue culture cells rapidly swell during cell division, which might aid with the mitotic separation of large chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zlotek-Zlotkiewicz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Son et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>At this point, it is unknown how glucose starvation induces a reduction in cellular volume and more work is needed to elucidate the signaling pathways and mechanisms by which glucose starvation causes cell size contraction and vacuolar volume increase. Upon acute glucose starvation, budding yeast cells undergo a notable cytosolic acidification lowering their intracellular pH to ~6.4, presumably by the rapid inhibition of the major plasma membrane proton pump Pma1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Orij et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Young et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dechant et al., 2010</xref>). Whereas this acidification might contribute to macromolecular confinement and enhance changes of biophysical properties within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fels et al., 2009</xref>), pH drop alone is neither necessary nor sufficient to recapitulate the macromolecular confinement, and the volume loss observed in glucose starved cells can occur in the absence of acidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). An increase of the intracellular proton concentration below 6 by the addition of increasing concentrations of K<sup>+</sup>Sorbate is able to induce a complete confinement of macromolecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>) but also significantly reduces the available cytoplasmic volume. Interestingly, inhibition of cellular metabolism by 2-deoxyglucose and antimycin also provokes an enhanced drop of intracellular pHto 5.5, which in turn triggers macromolecular confinement and leads to profound changes in the mechanical properties of the cell consistent with a sol to gel-like transition of the cytoplasm (Munder <italic>et al.</italic>, personal communication).</p><p>Our data also support a mechanism of chromatin mobility in which the movement of yeast chromatin is strongly influenced by the joint dynamics of both actin and microtubules. Precedence for such a mechanism is evidenced by previous work describing similar microtubule-dependent motion and reported interactions between microtubules, spindle pole bodies, and centromeres throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tanaka and Tanaka, 2009</xref>). Moreover, the actin cytoskeleton is known to propel the movement of meiotic chromosomes and to influence the diffusion of other large macromolecules, suggesting a central function throughout the life cycle of yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koszul et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brangwynne et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). The long-range directional movement of chromosomal loci is also reported to be dependent on the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chuang et al., 2006</xref>). This is consistent with our data, as the cytoskeletal inhibitors latrunculin-A and nocodozale appeared to more strongly affect the mobility of chromatin at longer timescales and have minor effects at shorter ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, recent work detailing the existence of actin filaments in the nucleus substantiates the possibility of a network of nuclear actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baarlink et al., 2013</xref>). However, because latrunculin A depolymerizes all actin, our work cannot currently differentiate between the effects of cytoplasmic and nuclear actin in modulating chromatin mobility.</p><p>Paradoxically, previous experiments exploring the ATP dependence of chromatin mobility reached opposing conclusions in that treatment with sodium azide had only minor effects on the mobility of chromosomes in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marshall et al., 1997</xref>) but drastically reduced their mobility in another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heun et al., 2001</xref>). By tracking both chromatin and mRNPs in conditions that closely replicated the perceived differences in the two published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marshall et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heun et al., 2001</xref>), we were indeed able to duplicate the distinct results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, however, we also observed that azide treatment lowered pH<sub>i</sub> and that the distinct treatments reduced intracellular pH to dramatically different extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, a pleiotropic effect of azide treatment on pH<sub>i</sub> might be sufficient to reconcile the observed differences in the confinement of macromolecules. These results also show that the azide treatment used here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (wash); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) replicates both the decrease in intracellular ATP concentrations and the drop in pH<sub>i</sub> in glucose-starved cells. This indicates that changes in ATP and pH<sub>i</sub> do not have additive effects and are neither alone nor in combination sufficient to explain the effects on macromolecular mobility that we observe in glucose starvation.</p><p>As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luby-Phelps, 2000</xref>), our single particle-tracking experiments show that both chromatin and mRNPs display anomalous subdiffusion at the timescales that we investigated. Interestingly, while glucose starvation dramatically decreases the diffusivity of the tracked objects, it does not change the anomaly of the diffusion. Anomalous subdiffusion is usually considered to be a transient phenomenon that occurs in complex, disordered media such as the intracellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Höfling and Franosch, 2013</xref>). At short timescales, objects explore a pure viscous environment thus displaying normal Brownian motion. Yet, at intermediate timescales, the motion of the objects is hindered by static structures, leading to anomalous subdiffusion. Finally, at long timescales, that is, when the traveled distances are much larger than the sizes of the structures that impede movement, diffusion is again pure Brownian motion. The fact that glucose deprivation affects diffusivity but not anomaly suggests that starvation induces a dramatic increase of the 'microscopic' viscosity without affecting the higher order cellular structures that impede macromolecule motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huet et al., 2014</xref>). Based on our results and according to the classical molecular crowding theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zimmerman and Minton, 1993</xref>) this change of microscopic viscosity is probably the consequence of an increase in crowding upon cell size contraction.</p><p>As the cell cytosol becomes more viscous and restrictive to diffusional motion under glucose starvation, we posit that it must also become more resistive to external perturbations on the cytoplasm. Indeed, we find that upon starvation the cytoplasm of budding and fission yeast undertake an astonishing transition leading to an increase in the viscoelastic stiffness of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Our observations are reminiscent of recently published observations in bacteria describing a glassy liquid-to-solid transition upon glucose starvation or DNP treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parry et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, we demonstrate that bacteria also undergo a volume loss similar to starved yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This observation suggests that molecular crowding also triggers the reported phase transition in bacteria, and similar mechanisms might be activated in both pro- and eukaryotes in response to glucose starvation.</p><p>Notably, this modulation of intracellular diffusion represents a mechanism to globally regulate the biochemistry of cells. As described for bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parry et al., 2014</xref>), we envision glucose starvation as a dormant state which might hold cells in stasis until provisions in the environment improve. Consequently, we propose that cells functionally regulate intracellular diffusion in order to establish a cellular organization that is restrictive to some molecular interactions, perhaps thereby conserving energy, while simultaneously permissive to essential biochemistry.</p><p>The conservation of cell contraction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes strongly suggests a vital function during starvation. On the one hand, the reduction in macromolecular mobility may allow for the rapid inhibition of excessive energy expenditure by diminishing unnecessary molecular interactions. This is consistent with previous observations describing the rapid inhibition of principal ATP consumers upon starvation. For example, Pma1p, required for regulation of intracellular pH and thought to use upwards of 20% of cellular ATP, is immediately inhibited upon glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bracey et al., 1998</xref>). Ribosomes also disengage from mRNA, resulting in a global collapse of polysome profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashe et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, we found that depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton may function, in part, to conserve ATP, as treatment with latrunculin A rapidly increases intracellular ATP concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Because osmotic shock promptly inhibits translation initiation and depolymerizes the actin cytoskeleton, it is conceivable that the starvation-induced cytoskeletal breakdown and collapse of polysome profiles, as well as other starvation-associated phenotypes, could be partly driven by molecular crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chowdhury et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ueseono et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Uesono and Toh-EA, 2002</xref>). Therefore, the confinement of intracellular diffusion through molecular crowding may prove vital for economical biochemistry and represent a very upstream event upon carbon starvation.</p><p>On the other hand, molecular crowding-enhanced aggregation and confined macromolecular mobility may promote sustained interactions between complexes during starvation. In agreement with this hypothesis, starvation is known to induce the formation of compartmentalized biochemistry and potential pockets of liquid-liquid unmixing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brangwynne et al., 2009b</xref>). For example, P-bodies, macromolecular complexes composed of mRNPs and mRNA decay machinery, form in the absence of glucose and potentially aggregate through unstructured regions of the component proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramachandran et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, stationary phase induces the formation of foci and filaments for large numbers of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</xref>). This aggregation was hypothesized to enhance interactions between members of the same pathway and promote more efficient biochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</xref>) but was more recently also shown to cause enzymatic inactivation in some instances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Petrovska et al., 2014</xref>). As a consequence, prolonged starvation and confinement of macromolecular mobility may also pose unique challenges to cells, as complexes with elongated stretches of unstructured regions may prove more prone to extensive aggregation. It will now be interesting to explore whether other cell types, including metazoan cells, respond similarly to starvation or growth factor depletion and if limited diffusion indeed stimulates aberrant protein aggregation, a process which has been implicated in a wide variety of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross and Poirier, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and growth</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are of the W303 strain-background, except for strains containing labeled mRNPs which are heterozygous diploids of W303 and S288c backgrounds.

Cells were imaged by epifluorescence time-lapse microscopy for 20 min: a z-stack of five images, each 1 µm apart was acquired once every minute. The resulting images were processed by a maximum intensity projection and the number of microtubule elongation events per minute was manually scored by an experimental blinded to the sample identity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Lyophilization mass measurements</title><p>KWY165 yeast cells were grown in 400 mL synthetic complete + 2% dextrose (SCD) media and harvested during log-phase growth (OD<sub>600</sub> ~ 0.8). Cells were spun down, supernatant removed, and cells re-suspended in 50 mL synthetic complete without dextrose (SC) media, and then repeated with two further wash steps. The sample was then finally re-suspended into 4 mL SC media. 2 mL were added to 48 mL SCD media, and 2 mL were added to 48 mL SC media. Both samples were incubated at 25°C for 30 min. Then the samples were spun down, supernatant removed, and cells re-suspended into 1 mL water, which was repeated two more times. After the final wash step, the supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was lyophilized under 0.040 mbar pressure at -50°C for 24 hr using the Alpha 2–4 LDplus freeze-dryer (Martin Christ GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany). The dry mass of the cells were measured, and the cells were re-suspended in water and counted using a hemocytometer to determine the average mass per cell for both the non-starved and starved cells. For mass measurements with raffinose, the protocol was the same except dextrose was replaced with raffinose.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Vacuolar volume measurements</title><p>KWY5112 cells expressing GFP and N-terminally tagged Vph1-mCherry were grown in SCD media and harvested during log-phase growth. The standard acute glucose starvation protocol was performed, and the cells were placed on concanavalin A-coated Lab-Tek chambered slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA) and imaged on a spinning disk confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany). The entire cell volume was imaged using a z-stack (0.24 µm z-slice height) under 488 nm (GFP) and 561 nm (mCherry) laser excitation with a 100x α Plan-Apochromat objective. The z-stack images were segmented and the vacuolar and cellular volumes were computed using custom Python scripts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Accessible cytoplasmic volume calculation</title><p>To calculate the change in accessible cytoplasmic volume after glucose starvation, the total cell shrinkage (15%), nuclear volume reduction (4.60 fL to 4.12 fL), and vacuolar volume expansion (25 to 40% of cellular volume) were taken into account.

DIC images were recorded using a 40x/1.2 C-Apochromat water immersion objective (Zeiss). Tip-less cantilevers (NSC12/noAl, Mikromasch, 350 µm long, nominal spring constant 150 mN·m<sup>-1</sup>) were modified with PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) wedges to correct for tilt angle of the cantilever and to be able to confine yeast cells between two parallel plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stewart et al., 2013]</xref>. KWY165 cells in log-phase growth were spheroplasted for 1 hr in 200 µg·mL<sup>-1</sup> zymolyase 100T (Amsbio) in SCD plus 1 M sorbitol at 30°C. Spheroplasts were then either washed into SCD plus 1 M sorbitol (non-starved treatment) or SC plus 1 M sorbitol (starved treatment) for 1 hr at room temperature before plated onto concanavalin A-coated glass-bottomed Petri dishes (WPI). For each stiffness measurement, an isolated spheroplast was identified and DIC imaged. The image was used to determine the spheroplast diameter. Thereafter, the cantilever wedge was positioned ~20 µm above the spheroplast and lowered at 1 µm·s<sup>-1</sup> until an upward force of 10 nN was recorded. The cantilever height was maintained for 10 s before the cantilever was raised 10 µm at 1 µm·s<sup>-1</sup>. The cantilever was then lowered onto the same cell, paused and raised successively for seven further cycles. The cantilever height and the force acting on the cantilever were recorded at 40 Hz. The slope (least-squares fit, nN·µm<sup>-1</sup>) of the data points between 3 and 7 nN of force of the downward phase of each cycle was determined. The mean of these slopes was used as the measure of spheroplast stiffness.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Spheroplasting assays</title><p>For budding yeast cells, yYB5978 was grown overnight in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) at 30°C and diluted to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.1 in 25 mL YPD.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While both reviewers found the work of interest and importance, they were unconvinced that the data supported the conclusions. In addition, one reviewer notes that the accompanying Alberti manuscript appears to contradict the observations. In view of these considerations, we do not feel that the manuscript warrants further consideration unless these concerns can be resolved.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the authors include experiments with the goal of providing support to their claim that an increase in macromolecular crowding is what causes a reduction in cellular dynamics in glucose-depleted cells. However, there are technical concerns with these experiments. The reported evidence is unconvincing, as explained below. In fact, a comparison between the data here and those in the Alberti paper argue against crowding being the primary cause for the observed particle confinement. In addition, the concern about the bacterial work was not addressed, and the generalization to bacteria remains unwarranted.</p><p>The data shown in Figure 7B and Figure 7—figure supplement 1 suggest that there is something wrong about their FRET-based crowding sensor. The change in crowding under glucose-depletion condition is proposed to be equivalent to a hyperosmotic shock with 2 M sorbitol. This is a massive osmotic shock. GFP diffusion should be severely impacted under these conditions; yet they show that GFP diffusion is unchanged in glucose-depleted cells. The cytoplasmic volume should also be more reduced with 2 M sorbitol than what they report for glucose depletion. Consistent with this, the accompanying paper from the Alberti group reports a large reduction in both cytoplasmic volume and GFP diffusion in cells exposed to 2 M sorbitol. Thus, the crowding in glucose-depleted cells is unlikely to be equivalent to cells exposed to 2 M sorbitol. Could the FRET-based sensor be affected by the difference in pH between the glucose-plus and glucose-depleted conditions? Fluorophores are often sensitive to pH, which would make the measurements unreliable.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, it is argued that &quot;a reduction in cell volume is sufficient to explain the starvation-induced effect on macromolecular mobility&quot;. However, it is unclear that the reduction in cytoplasmic volume under their glucose-depletion conditions is equivalent to the reduction in cytoplasmic volume under the reported hyperosmotic shock conditions (&gt; 0.4M NaCl).</p><p>Furthermore, the key issue was to determine the cytoplasmic volume and not the cell volume/size (the cytoplasm can shrink more than the cell because of the cell wall).</p><p>Also, similarly to the 2 M sorbitol experiments, how is GFP diffusion under the hyperosmotic conditions of high concentrations of NaCl? GFP diffusion should be significantly reduced (e.g., see van den Bogaart et al., Mol Microbiol 2007) in which case it argues that their hyperosmotic shock treatment does not phenocopy their glucose-depletion condition (where GFP diffusion is unaffected), contrary to their claim.</p><p>The authors appropriately take into consideration the increase in vacuole size, but they should probably also consider the decrease in nucleus size.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>: Is the assay to determine cell mass/cell sensitive enough to draw conclusions about glucose-plus and glucose-deprived cells? What is the difference in cytoplasmic volume (after correction for vacuole and nucleus size) between raffinose-plus and glucose-plus cells? Is it similar to the difference between glucose-plus and glucose-depleted cells? This is important to know. If the difference is much larger, it is unclear that the assay would be able to measure a difference in cellular mass between glucose-plus and glucose-depleted cells since the difference in cellular mass between raffinose-plus and glucose-plus cells was only 23%. There is typically a lot of variability in cell number measurements.</p><p>Figure 7D: As mentioned above, cytoplasmic volumes and not cell volumes should be measured for DNP-treated <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Furthermore, the 30-min DNP treatment is too long to be compared to the data in Parry et al., 2014. Cellular composition can change in 30 min, and Parry et al. report an immediate effect on particle dynamics following DNP treatment. The presented evidence is too tenuous to draw conclusions about what happens in bacteria.</p><p>As currently presented, the conclusions between the two co-submitted papers appear contradictory.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, the authors track various structures in yeast cells, calculate their mean squared displacements (MSD) and find that these structures have a reduced mobility when the cells are starved (&quot;- Glucose condition&quot;). The authors show that a decrease in ATP or pH to levels similar to those seen during starvation are alone not sufficient to explain the reduced mobility. However, they notice that as they lower pH they not only lower the measured mobility in the cell, they also reduce the cell volume. Surprisingly, when they lower pH to the point where the mobility in the cell is similar to that seen in a starved cell, they find a similar volume reduction as the volume reduction observed for a starved cell. From this, they conclude that the reduced mobility arises from an increased confinement owing to this reduced cell volume. Overall, I think the paper is a bit weak in its current form. The reasons follow:</p><p>1) The authors don't really show that a given volume change always corresponds to a given decrease in mobility. They just show that one mobility and cell volume under starvation conditions corresponds to the same mobility and volume under one other condition (8mM K<sup>+</sup>Sorbate). In particular, the authors don't properly correlate a measured change in mobility to a measured change in volume under different conditions. They attempt to do this through the addition of NaCl, but they never report the actual volume change with increasing salt condition (They just say the volume decreases). In addition, they have data (2mM K<sup>+</sup>Sorbate) that indicate a similar degree of cell volume change without a significant decrease in mobility. This contradicts the general conclusion of the paper (see point 2, below).</p><p>A) In addition, the authors attribute a decreased mobility under some conditions (loss of actin or microtubules) to effects other than volume change. This would indicate that there are conditions in which mobility is affected without changing cell volume. Therefore, they need more evidence to show that the cell volume decrease and mobility under starvation conditions doesn't just coincidentally coincide with those of 8mM K<sup>+</sup>Sorbate conditions.</p><p>2) Currently, the authors only relate the volume of a cell under starved conditions to that of a cell whose volume is reduced while the pH of the cell is also reduced. They should do a test where they only change cell volume and leave all other variables fixed. They attempt to do this through osmotic pressure with the addition of NaCl, but they never actually measure the amount of cell volume reduction under these conditions.</p><p>A) In addition, I don't know enough about yeast biology to know what NaCl does to the cell. If it isn't an inert osmotic shock, it may make sense to do a test using an inert crowder like PEG or dextran.</p><p>3) The authors conclude that this is a conserved mechanism because they show that the volume of <italic>E. coli</italic> also decreases under conditions where the internal dynamics of <italic>E. coli</italic> show a reduced mobility. However, they don't show that something more definitive like a similar volume decrease leads to a similar decrease in mobility or relate the volume decrease to mobility through some theoretical prediction with regards to molecular crowding. (Again, they just test this one condition). The claim from this limited investigation that this is a conversed mechanism is too strong in my mind.</p><p>Overall, I think their study is interesting and a link between mobility and cell volume could be interesting. However, I find that the authors’ claim that the reduced mobility under starvation conditions arises from a reduction in cell volume too strong. The data are suggestive but not conclusive (I think they are over-selling it). In addition, the way the story is presented and the evidence for their conclusion is slightly contradictory indicating that this most likely not the full story.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09376.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the peer reviewers follow.]</p><p><italic>While both reviewers found the work of interest and importance, they were unconvinced that the data supported the conclusions.

Reviewer #1: In this revised manuscript, the authors include experiments with the goal of providing support to their claim that an increase in macromolecular crowding is what causes a reduction in cellular dynamics in glucose-depleted cells.

Regarding the conflicting data with the Alberti paper, we show in our manuscript that the physiological pH drop that occurs upon glucose starvation is neither necessary nor sufficient to recapitulate the confinement of macromolecules that we have observed during this physiological stress. Furthermore, we include evidence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>) that the response of yeast cells to the treatment described by Munder et al. (2-deoxyglucose and antimycin A incubation) is different from the response we see in our acute glucose starvation treatment (rapid removal of glucose). We therefore believe that the phenomena being described in these two papers cannot be directly compared. Nevertheless, both papers have in common that they show that yeast cells have the ability to dramatically alter their biophysical properties.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09376.028</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of acute glucose starvation and 2-deoxyglucose/antimycin A treatments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MSD curves for GFA1 mRNP particles in non-starved cells (blue), cells acutely starved of glucose (red), and cells acutely starved of glucose additionally treated with 20 mM 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) and 10 µM antimycin A (AntA) (green).

Yet, since both reviewers questioned the validity of the sensor, and it has not yet been widely used and confirmed in the literature, we have removed the FRET biosensor results.</p><p><italic>The cytoplasmic volume should also be more reduced with 2 M sorbitol than what they report for glucose depletion.</italic> </p><p>We don’t know where the evidence for this argument comes from but we have used 0.4M NaCl and not 2 M sorbitol to successfully mimic the macromolecular confinement observed upon glucose withdrawal.</p><p><italic>Consistent with this, the accompanying paper from the Alberti group reports a large reduction in both cytoplasmic volume and GFP diffusion in cells exposed to 2 M sorbitol. Thus, the crowding in glucose-depleted cells is unlikely to be equivalent to cells exposed to 2 M sorbitol. Could the FRET-based sensor be affected by the difference in pH between the glucose-plus and glucose-depleted conditions? Fluorophores are often sensitive to pH, which would make the measurements unreliable.</italic> We have not seen these results from the Alberti lab however, as pointed out above, we have not used 2 M sorbitol to inhibit the macromolecular diffusion but instead use 0.4 M NaCl. Sorbitol was used as a control for our biosensor experiments. However, as there were concerns by both reviewers we have removed the FRET biosensor results from this submission.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, it is argued that &quot;a reduction in cell volume is sufficient to explain the starvation-induced effect on macromolecular mobility&quot;. However, it is unclear that the reduction in cytoplasmic volume under their glucose-depletion conditions is equivalent to the reduction in cytoplasmic volume under the reported hyperosmotic shock conditions (&gt; 0.4M NaCl).</italic> Measuring the cellular volume decrease under the hyperosmotic shock conditions would indeed be informative. Unfortunately, however, we are technically unable to perform this experiment using our methods because the buffer requirements of the Coulter counter (which needs isotonic concentrations of salt for the electric current measurements) precludes measurements under hyperosmotic shock conditions.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, the key issue was to determine the cytoplasmic volume and not the cell volume/size (the cytoplasm can shrink more than the cell because of the cell wall).</italic> Because the yeast cell wall is permeable to ions (but the plasma membrane is not), the Coulter counter experiments directly measure the cytoplasmic volume, not the cell wall.</p><p><italic>Also, similarly to the 2 M sorbitol experiments, how is GFP diffusion under the hyperosmotic conditions of high concentrations of NaCl? GFP diffusion should be significantly reduced (e.g., see van den Bogaart et al., Mol Microbiol 2007) in which case it argues that their hyperosmotic shock treatment does not phenocopy their glucose-depletion condition (where GFP diffusion is unaffected), contrary to their claim.</italic> </p><p>As pointed out above, the experiments reported in van den Bogaart et al., Mol Microbiol 2007 were done in <italic>E. coli</italic> and are thus difficult to compare. We cannot perform single molecule tracking experiments with GFP but we were able to perform FCS experiments with GFP but because the methodology and time scale of the measurements are so fundamentally different compared to the single particle MSD measurements reported here, we prefer not to include these results.</p><p><italic>The authors appropriately take into consideration the increase in vacuole size, but they should probably also consider the decrease in nucleus size.</italic> </p><p>Yes, this is a valid point, and we have changed the manuscript to reflect this concern. Taking into account the change in nuclear volume in addition to the change in vacuolar volume after glucose starvation, we now calculate that the accessible cytoplasmic volume decreases by 33%.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>: Is the assay to determine cell mass/cell sensitive enough to draw conclusions about glucose-plus and glucose-deprived cells? What is the difference in cytoplasmic volume (after correction for vacuole and nucleus size) between raffinose-plus and glucose-plus cells? Is it similar to the difference between glucose-plus and glucose-depleted cells? This is important to know. If the difference is much larger, it is unclear that the assay would be able to measure a difference in cellular mass between glucose-plus and glucose-depleted cells since the difference in cellular mass between raffinose-plus and glucose-plus cells was only 23%. There is typically a lot of variability in cell number measurements.</italic> </p><p>These experiments were repeated three times and statistical tests demonstrate that the results are highly significant. Furthermore, the mass-per-cell measurements showed little variability and high agreement with each other in the biological triplicates. Finally, cell number measurements were performed using a Neubauer hemocytometer, which is a routinely used tool for accurate cell counting measurements.</p><p><italic>Figure 7D: As mentioned above, cytoplasmic volumes and not cell volumes should be measured for DNP-treated E. coli cells. Furthermore, the 30-min DNP treatment is too long to be compared to the data in Parry et al., 2014. Cellular composition can change in 30 min, and Parry et al. report an immediate effect on particle dynamics following DNP treatment. The presented evidence is too tenuous to draw conclusions about what happens in bacteria.</italic> </p><p>As mentioned previously, the Coulter counter measures the flow of ions, which can completely permeate the porous bacterial cell wall. Thus, our results do indeed measure cytoplasmic volumes and not cellular volumes. However, we have now reduced the scope of our discussion about the possible conserved nature of the diffusional restriction phenomena in bacteria and yeast.</p><p><italic>As currently presented, the conclusions between the two co-submitted papers appear contradictory.</italic> </p><p>As explained earlier, we believe that the effects seen in the Alberti paper are significantly distinct from those presented here due to the considerably different treatments used.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2: In this paper, the authors track various structures in yeast cells, calculate their mean squared displacements (MSD) and find that these structures have a reduced mobility when the cells are starved (&quot;- Glucose condition&quot;). The authors show that a decrease in ATP or pH to levels similar to those seen during starvation are alone not sufficient to explain the reduced mobility. However, they notice that as they lower pH they not only lower the measured mobility in the cell, they also reduce the cell volume. Surprisingly, when they lower pH to the point where the mobility in the cell is similar to that seen in a starved cell, they find a similar volume reduction as the volume reduction observed for a starved cell. From this, they conclude that the reduced mobility arises from an increased confinement owing to this reduced cell volume. Overall, I think the paper is a bit weak in its current form.</italic> </p><p>Obviously, we would like to disagree with this assessment. The perceived weakness (see also below) relates to our incomplete mechanistic understanding of the observed phenomenon (i.e. what causes the observed change in macromolecular diffusion upon glucose starvation). In our view the strength of the paper is the remarkable finding that cells regulate their biophysical properties in order to control rates of intracellular diffusion. We have further strengthened this aspect and now include additional experiments demonstrating that yeast undergo a dramatic change in their visco-elastic properties upon glucose starvation. This includes new atomic force microscopy measurements and a novel assay that reveals that glucose starved cells are significantly more rigid than their non-starved controls.</p><p><italic>The reasons follow:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) The authors don't really show that a given volume change always corresponds to a given decrease in mobility. They just show that one mobility and cell volume under starvation conditions corresponds to the same mobility and volume under one other condition (8mM K<sup>+</sup>Sorbate). In particular, the authors don't properly correlate a measured change in mobility to a measured change in volume under different conditions. They attempt to do this through the addition of NaCl, but they never report the actual volume change with increasing salt condition (They just say the volume decreases).</italic></p><p>We agree that this would be informative. Unfortunately, however, we are technically unable to perform this experiment using our methods because the buffer requirements of the Coulter counter (which needs isotonic concentrations of salt for the electric current measurements) precludes measurements under hyperosmotic shock conditions. The Coulter counter allowed us to measure tens of thousands of cells and lower throughput visual assays might not be sensitive enough to cleanly differentiate between individual salt concentrations although a significant shrinkage can be observed upon 0.4 M NaCl addition (consistent with prior publications).</p><p><italic>In addition, they have data (2mM K<sup>+</sup>Sorbate) that indicate a similar degree of cell volume change without a significant decrease in mobility. This contradicts the general conclusion of the paper (see point 2, below).</italic></p><p>We apologize but unfortunately our original supplemental figure was not properly displayed and appeared compressed, which seemed to have led to a confusion. The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> hopefully clarifies this point. Furthermore, we have removed our results using the crowding sensor.</p><p><italic>A) In addition, the authors attribute a decreased mobility under some conditions (loss of actin or microtubules) to effects other than volume change. This would indicate that there are conditions in which mobility is affected without changing cell volume. Therefore, they need more evidence to show that the cell volume decrease and mobility under starvation conditions doesn't just coincidentally coincide with those of 8mM K<sup>+</sup>Sorbate conditions.</italic> </p><p>We are not quite sure whether we understand this point. Our data suggest that the effects on chromatin mobility are an indirect consequence of the breakdown of the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton. It was previously shown (and confirmed by us) that the cytoskeleton breaks down during osmotic shock.</p><p><italic>2) Currently, the authors only relate the volume of a cell under starved conditions to that of a cell whose volume is reduced while the pH of the cell is also reduced. They should do a test where they only change cell volume and leave all other variables fixed. They attempt to do this through osmotic pressure with the addition of NaCl, but they never actually measure the amount of cell volume reduction under these conditions.</italic></p><p>As discussed previously, the Coulter counter method unfortunately does not permit us to measure the volume of the yeast cells under the hyperosmotic NaCl treatment because the measurement buffer requires an isotonic salt concentration.</p><p> <italic>A) In addition, I don't know enough about yeast biology to know what NaCl does to the cell. If it isn't an inert osmotic shock, it may make sense to do a test using an inert crowder like PEG or dextran.</italic> </p><p>That is correct. Indeed, high concentrations of sorbitol (2M) have similar effects on macromolecular diffusion as 0.4 M NaCl (data not shown).</p><p> <italic>3) The authors conclude that this is a conserved mechanism because they show that the volume of E. coli also decreases under conditions where the internal dynamics of E. coli show a reduced mobility. However, they don't show that something more definitive like a similar volume decrease leads to a similar decrease in mobility or relate the volume decrease to mobility through some theoretical prediction with regards to molecular crowding. (Again, they just test this one condition). The claim from this limited investigation that this is a conversed mechanism is too strong in my mind.</italic> </p><p>As discussed in our response to reviewer 1, we have now reduced the scope of our discussion regarding the conserved nature of the mechanism in <italic>E. coli</italic> and yeast.</p><p><italic>Overall, I think their study is interesting and a link between mobility and cell volume could be interesting. However, I find that the authors’ claim that the reduced mobility under starvation conditions arises from a reduction in cell volume too strong. The data are suggestive but not conclusive (I think they are over-selling it). In addition, the way the story is presented and the evidence for their conclusion is slightly contradictory indicating that this most likely not the full story.</italic> </p><p>We thank this reviewer for his positive assessment. We would agree that our study is interesting demonstrating for the first time that eukaryotic cells dramatically alter their biophysical and mechanical properties as part of a physiological stress response.</p></body></sub-article></article>
