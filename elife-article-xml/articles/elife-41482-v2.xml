However, despite the centrality of multicellularity to the origin of animals, little is known about the genetic and developmental mechanisms that precipitated the evolution of multicellularity on the animal stem lineage. All modern animals develop clonally through serial cell division, suggesting that the same was true for their last common ancestor. While the closest living relatives of animals, choanoflagellates, develop clonally into multicellular rosettes, more distant relatives such as <italic>Capsaspora owczarzaki</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2013</xref>) and <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonner, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brefeld, 1869</xref>) become multicellular through cell aggregation (which is vulnerable to cheating) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Santorelli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Strassmann et al., 2000</xref>). This raises a general question of how stem animals might have suppressed cell aggregation in favor of clonal multicellular development.</p><p>Although the first animals evolved over 600 million years ago, studying choanoflagellates allows the reconstruction of important aspects of animal origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunet and King, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">King et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ruiz-Trillo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shalchian-Tabrizi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic> is an emerging model choanoflagellate that was isolated from nature as a spherical colony of cells called a rosette. Under standard laboratory conditions, <italic>S. rosetta</italic> proliferates as solitary cells or as linear chain colonies that easily break apart into solitary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dayel et al., 2011</xref>). When exposed to rosette inducing factors (RIFs) produced by the co-isolated prey bacterium <italic>Algoriphagus machipongonensis, S. rosetta</italic> instead develops into highly organized and structurally stable rosettes through a process of serial cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alegado et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dayel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fairclough et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Woznica et al., 2016</xref>). Recent advances, including a sequenced genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fairclough et al., 2010</xref>), the discovery of a sexual phase to the <italic>S. rosetta</italic> life cycle that enables controlled mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levin and King, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Woznica et al., 2017</xref>), and techniques that allow for transfection and expression of transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booth et al., 2018</xref>) have enabled increasingly detailed studies of molecular mechanisms underlying rosette development in <italic>S. rosetta</italic>.</p><p>In the first genetic screen to identify genes required for rosette formation in <italic>S. rosetta</italic>, multiple rosette defect mutants were recovered that displayed a range of phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 2014</xref>). The first mutant to be characterized in detail was named Rosetteless; while Rosetteless cells did not develop into rosettes in the presence of RIFs, they were otherwise indistinguishable from wild type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 2014</xref>). The mutation underlying the Rosetteless phenotype was mapped to a C-type lectin, encoded by the gene <italic>rosetteless,</italic> the first gene shown to be required for rosette formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 2014</xref>). In animals, C-type lectins function in signaling and adhesion to promote development and innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cambi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ruoslahti, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Svajger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zelensky and Gready, 2005</xref>). Although the molecular mechanisms by which <italic>rosetteless</italic> regulates rosette development remain unknown, the localization of Rosetteless protein to the rosette interior suggests that it functions as part of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here we report on the largest class of mutants from the original rosette defect screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 2014</xref>), all of which fail to develop into organized rosettes and instead form large, amorphous clumps of cells in both the absence and presence of RIFs. By mapping the mutations underlying the clumpy, rosette defect phenotypes of two mutants in this class, we identified two predicted glycosyltransferase genes that are each essential for proper rosette development. The causative mutations led to similar perturbations in the glycosylation pattern of the basal ECM. The essentiality of the predicted glycosyltransferases for rosette development combined with prior findings of the requirement of a C-type lectin highlight the importance of the ECM for regulating multicellular rosette development and preventing spurious cell adhesion in a close relative of animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rosette defect mutants form amorphous clumps of cells through promiscuous cell adhesion</title><p>The original rosette defect screen performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al.

For this study, we screened 21,925 additional clones and identified an additional seven mutants that failed to form proper rosettes in the presence of <italic>Algoriphagus</italic> RIFs. (For this study, we used <italic>Algoriphagus</italic> outer membrane vesicles as a source of RIFs, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Woznica et al., 2016</xref>). Comparing the phenotypes of the 16 total rosette defect mutants in the presence and absence of RIFs allowed us to classify four broad phenotypic classes: (1) Class A mutants that have wild type morphologies in the absence of RIFs and entirely lack rosettes in the presence of RIFs, (2) Class B mutants that have wild type morphologies in the absence of RIFs and develop reduced levels of rosettes with aberrant structures in the presence of RIFs, (3) Class C mutants that produce large clumps of cells in both the presence and absence of RIFs while forming little to no rosettes in the presence of RIFs, and (4) a Class D mutant that exist primarily as solitary cells, with no linear chains of cells detected in the absence of RIFs and no rosettes detected in the presence of RIFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file - Table S1</xref>).</p><p>Of the 16 rosette defect mutants isolated, seven mutants fell into Class C. For this study, we focused on four Class C mutants — Seafoam, Soapsuds, Jumble, and Couscous (previously named Branched in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 2014</xref>) — that form amorphous, tightly packed clumps of cells, both in the presence and absence of RIFs, but never develop into rosettes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We found that the clumps contain a few to hundreds of mutant cells that pack together haphazardly, unlike wild type rosettes in which all cells are oriented with their basal poles toward the rosette center and their apical flagella extending out from the rosette surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alegado et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Woznica et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, in contrast with the structural stability and shear resistance of wild type rosettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 2014</xref>), the cell clumps formed by Class C mutants were sensitive to shear and separated into solitary cells upon pipetting or vortexing the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41482.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mutant cells aggregate and fail to form rosettes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild type cells are unicellular or form linear chains in the absence of rosette inducing factors (RIFs) and develop into organized spherical rosettes when cultured with RIFs.

We isolated 38 F1s with the rosette defect phenotype from a Mapping Strain × Rosetteless cross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 2014</xref>), grew clonal cultures from each, pooled the resulting cultures, extracted their genomic DNA, and sequenced the pooled mutant genomes to an average coverage of 187X. Against a background of sequence variants that did not segregate with the Rosetteless phenotype, five unlinked single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (INDELs) were found to segregate with the phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file - Table S2</xref>). Four of these detected sequence variants likely had spurious correlations with the phenotype resulting from relatively low sequencing coverage at those variants (&gt;0.25X coverage of the entire genome) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file - Table S2</xref>). In contrast, the remaining SNV was detected in a well-assembled portion of the genome at a sequencing depth approaching the average coverage of the entire genome. The segregating SNV, at position 427,804 on supercontig 8, was identical to the causative mutation identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al.

Thus, a method based on pooling F1 haploid mutants, identifying sequence variants that segregated with the phenotype, and masking those SNVs/INDELs that were detected with &gt;0.25X coverage of the total genome was effective for correctly pinpointing the causal mutation for Rosetteless (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Therefore, the heterozygous diploids were not informative about whether the mutations were dominant or recessive as the phenotypes could only be detected in haploid cells. For Seafoam and Soapsuds, we isolated heterozygous diploids, but never recovered F1 offspring with the mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The inability to recover haploids with either clumping or rosette defect phenotypes from the Seafoam × Mapping Strain and Soapsuds × Mapping Strain crosses might be explained by any of the following: (1) the clumping/rosette defect phenotypes are polygenic, (2) meiosis defects are associated with the causative mutations, and/or (3) mutant fitness defects allowed wild type progeny to outcompete the mutant progeny. In contrast, heterozygous diploids from crosses of Jumble and Couscous to the Mapping Strain produced F1 haploid progeny with both wild type and mutant phenotypes and thus allowed for the successful mapping of the causative genetic lesions, as detailed below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Jumble maps to a putative glycosyltransferase</title><p>Following the bulk segregant approach, we identified five sequence variants in Jumble that segregated with both the clumping and rosette defects.

(2014)</xref> and in this study, almost half (7) also display a mild to severe clumping phenotype. This suggests that mechanisms for preventing promiscuous adhesion among wild type cells can be easily disrupted. We found that the clumping phenotype results from promiscuous adhesion of mutant cells to other mutant or wild type cells rather than from incomplete cytokinesis. A recent study revealed that the bacterium <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic> induces <italic>S. rosetta</italic> to form swarms of cells, visually similar to the mutant clumps, as part of their mating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Woznica et al., 2017</xref>). However, it seems unlikely that the clumping Class C mutants is related to swarming; the cell fusion and subsequent settling of diploid cells characteristic of <italic>V. fischeri-</italic>induced mating have not been observed in the class C mutants cultured without <italic>V. fischeri</italic>.</p><p>For both Jumble and Couscous, the causative mutations mapped to predicted glycosyltransferase genes. Consistent with its role as a glycosyltransferase, Jumble localized to the Golgi apparatus, but Couscous appeared to localize in cytoplasmic puncta and to the cell membrane. We predict that the mutations in predicted glycosyltransferases are loss of function alleles, given that transfection of mutant <italic>S. rosetta</italic> with the wild type alleles was sufficient to complement each of the mutations. While we have not uncovered the target(s) of the predicted glycotransferases or the exact nature of the interplay between the two phenotypes, disruption of the glycocalyx at the basal pole of both Jumble and Couscous mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) hints that the regulation of ECM could play a role in preventing clumping and in promoting proper rosette development.</p><p>One possible explanation for the clumping phenotype is that <italic>jumble</italic> and <italic>couscous</italic> are required to regulate the activity of cell surface adhesion molecules and receptors. Glycosylation regulates the activities of two key adhesion proteins in animals: integrins that regulate ECM adhesion, and cadherins that, among their various roles in cell signaling and animal development, bind other cadherins to form cell-cell adhesions called adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Larsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Cadherin activity can be either positively or negatively regulated by glycosyltransferases. For example, epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) is modified by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III) whose activity leads to increased cell adhesion and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) whose activity leads to decreased cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Granovsky et al., 2000</xref>). GnT-V knockdown enhances cell-cell adhesion mediated by E-cadherin and the related N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2009</xref>). The inactivation of E-cadherin, including through over- or under- expression of GnT-V or GnT-III, is considered to be a hallmark of epithelial cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirohashi and Kanai, 2003</xref>). <italic>S. rosetta</italic> expresses 29 different cadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nichols et al., 2012</xref>) and it is possible that mutations to <italic>jumble</italic> and <italic>couscous</italic> disrupt regulatory glycosylation of a cell adhesion molecules like cadherins.</p><p>Another possibility is that <italic>jumble</italic> and <italic>couscous</italic> add a protective sugar layer to the cell surface and loss of glycosyltransferase activity reveals underlying sticky surfaces. If <italic>jumble</italic> and <italic>couscous</italic> add branches to existing sugar modifications, their loss of function could expose new sugar moieties at the cell surface that act as ligands for lectins that aggregate cells. Lectins mediate cell aggregation in diverse organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colin Hughes, 1992</xref>). For example, sponges, such as <italic>Geodia cydonium,</italic> can be disaggregated into single cells and then reaggregated through lectin binding of a post-translational sugar modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Müller et al., 1979</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the mannosyltransferase MNN2 adds mannose structures to the cell wall that are recognized by aggregating lectins and MNN2 is required for proper flocculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rayner and Munro, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stratford, 1992</xref>). Exposing new sugars on the cell surface in Jumble and Couscous could lead to spurious aggregation, potentially by lectins or other sugar binding proteins.</p><p>It is somewhat more difficult to infer how increased clumping in single cells might interfere with rosette development. One possibility is that the disruption of ECM glycosylation that we hypothesize might promote clumping may also prevent the proper maturation of the ECM needed for rosette development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). A prior study showed that only <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cells recognized with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) are competent to form rosettes, which suggests that glycosylation might be necessary for rosette development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dayel et al., 2011</xref>). While WGA staining does not appear to be perturbed in Jumble and Couscous (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file - Table S5</xref>), jacalin staining at the basal pole appears severely reduced or abolished compared to wild type. Jacalin staining was enriched in the center of wild type rosettes in a pattern reminiscent of Rosetteless, which is required for rosette development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, in Jumble and Couscous, Rosetteless localized to the correct pole, but did not become enriched upon rosette induction, indicating that the ECM did not properly mature. Rosetteless has mucin-like Ser/Thr repeats that are predicted sites of heavy glycosylation and two C-type lectin domains that would be expected to bind to sugar moieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that Rosetteless might be regulated either through direct glycosylation or through the glycosylation of potential binding partners by Jumble and Couscous.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41482.019</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model for promiscuous clumping in rosette defective Class C mutants.</title><p>Wild type <italic>S. rosetta</italic> has a glycosylated basal patch of ECM (red) as marked by the lectin jacalin that becomes enriched during the course of rosette formation. The Rosetteless protein, required for rosette formation and speculated to play a structural role in holding rosettes together, localizes to the same location on the basal pole of cells and becomes similarly enriched as rosette form. Mutants lack the glycosylated basal patch of jacalin staining. The altered cell surface could lead to clumping, either through mis-regulation of cell adhesion molecules or exposure of a normally masked adhesive cell surface. The same alteration that allows clumping of Class C mutants also prevents rosette development, perhaps by disrupting glycan modification on the Rosetteless protein or one of its interaction partners.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41482-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The clumping, rosette defect mutants underscore the differences between cell aggregation and a regulated clonal developmental program, such as animal embryogenesis or choanoflagellate rosette development. Importantly, the multicellularity of all extant animals arises through cell division rather than cell aggregation, suggesting that the suppression of cell aggregation in favor of clonal development was a prerequisite for animal origins. Our results raise the possibility that glycosylation and the regulation of the ECM suppressed cell aggregation while stabilizing obligate clonal multicellularity on the animal stem lineage. Glycosylation remains an important regulator of tissue organization in modern animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>).

The wild type strain, from which each mutant was generated, was the described strain SrEpac (ATCC PRA-390; accession number SRX365844) in which <italic>S. rosetta</italic> is co-cultured monoxenically with the prey bacterium <italic>Echinicola pacifica</italic> (DSM 19836, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levin and King, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nedashkovskaya et al., 2006</xref>). Seafoam, Soapsuds, and Couscous (previously named Branched) were generated through X-ray mutagenesis and Jumble was generated by EMS mutagenesis as documented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al. (2014)</xref>. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al. (2014)</xref>, Branched/Couscous was not thoroughly characterized and was named based on the hypothesis that the clumps formed through cell divisions that resulted in unusually branched chain colonies. (Wild type chain colonies are primarily linear, with rare branches.) Our thorough characterization of the mutant in this study revealed that the clumps form through aggregation and not through branching cell divisions. In order for the mutant name to better reflect the phenotype, we renamed it Couscous. For routine culturing, wild type and mutant cultures were diluted 1:10 every 2–3 days in 5% (v/v) HN media in ASW. The Mapping Strain, (previously called Isolate B in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 2014</xref>) used for mapping crosses (accession number SRX363839) was grown in the presence of rosette-inducing <italic>A. machipongonensis</italic> bacteria (ATCC BAA-2233). The Mapping Strain was maintained in 25% (v/v) CG media diluted in ASW and passaged 1:10 every 2–3 days. For transfection of <italic>S. rosetta</italic>, cells were maintained in 5% (v/v) HN media in AK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booth et al., 2018</xref>). Rosette formation initially was assayed using both live <italic>A. machipongonensis</italic> and <italic>A. machipongonensis</italic> outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) prepared as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Woznica et al.

For each strain tested, both methods of rosette induction resulted in similarly low/non-existent percentages of cells in rosettes and visually similar clumps for Class C mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file - Table S1</xref>). Therefore, unless stated otherwise, rosette induction was performed with <italic>A. machipongonensis</italic> OMVs and referred to here as rosette inducing factors (RIFs).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Imaging and quantifying rosette phenotypes</title><p>To image rosette phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), cells were plated at a density of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/ml in 3 ml 5% (v/v) HN media in ASW either with or without <italic>Algoriphagus</italic> RIFs. Cultures were imaged after 48 hr of rosette induction in 8-well glass bottom dishes (Ibidi 15 μ-Slide eight well Cat. No. 80826) that were coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-D-lysine (Sigma) for 15 min and washed 3 times with water to remove excess poly-D-lysine. For imaging wild type and mutant cultures in the presence and absence of RIFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> top two panels), 200 μl of cells were plated with a wide bore pipette tip for minimal disruption and allowed to settle for 5 min. For images of vortexed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> bottom panel), 200 μl of cells were vortexed for 15 s before plating and imaged within 10 min of plating to prevent re-clumping. Cells were imaged live by differential interference contrast microscopy using a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1/7 Widefield microscope with a Hammatsu Orca-Flash 4.0 LT CMOS Digital Camera and a 63x/NA1.40 Plan-Apochromatic oil immersion lens with 1.6X optivar setting.</p><p>To quantify rosette induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), cells were plated at a density of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/ml in 3 ml 5% (v/v) HN media in ASW with RIFs. After 48 hr, an aliquot of cells was vortexed vigorously for 15 s and fixed with formaldehyde. To determine the percentage of cells in rosettes, the relative number of single cells and cells within rosettes were scored using a hemocytometer. Rosettes were counted as a group of 3 or more cells with organized polarity relative to a central focus after exposure to vortexing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Imaging and quantification of cell clumping</title><p>Clumps were quantified using a modified protocol from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Woznica et al. (2017)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Mutant cells, and to some extent wild type cells, will adhere to glass. Therefore, to prevent cells from simply sticking to the bottom of the 8-well glass bottom dishes (Ibidi 15 μ-Slide eight well Cat. No. 80826), the dishes were coated with 1% BSA for 1 hr and washed 3 times with water to remove any residual BSA. Importantly, the addition of BSA to the imaging dishes did not cause wild type cells to stick to the bottom of the dishes or to each other. Cells were diluted to 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml, vortexed for 15 s to break apart any pre-formed clumps and plated in the BSA pre-treated dishes. For quantification, DIC images were taken using a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1/7 Widefield microscope with a Hammatsu Orca-Flash 4.0 LT CMOS Digital Camera and a 20x objective. Images were collected for each strain from 10 distinct locations throughout the well.</p><p>Images were batch processed in ImageJ for consistency. To accurately segment the phase bright cells and limit signal from the phase dark bacteria the following commands were applied with default settings: ‘Smooth’ (to reduce background bacterial signal), ‘Find Edges’ (to highlight the phase-bright choanoflagellate cells), ‘Despeckle’ (to remove noise), ‘Make Binary’ (to convert to black and white), ‘Dilate’ (to expand to smooth jagged edges from segmentation), ‘Erode’ (to return to the same size as before dilate), and ‘Fill Holes’ (to fill any remaining small holes). Finally, images were analyzed with the ‘Analyze Particles’ command to calculate the area of the clump and only particles larger than 20 μm<sup>2</sup> were kept to filter out any remaining bacterial signal. Cell equivalents/clump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, right y axis) were calculated by dividing the area of the clump by the area of a representative individual cell (as approximated by averaging the area of the wild type cells). Data are presented as violin boxplots, showing the median cell number (horizontal line), interquartile range (white box), and range excluding outliers (vertical line). A minimum of 630 clumps from two biological replicates were measured for each condition.</p><p>To examine whether cell division was required for clump formation, we used aphidicolin to block cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Cells in vortexed wild type, Jumble, and Couscous cultures were counted and diluted to 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml in 5% (v/v) HN media in AK. For each strain, either 250 μM aphicidolin, an equal volume of a DMSO control, or no additional control were added to each condition. After 24 hr, DIC images were taken using a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1/7 Widefield microscope with a Hammatsu Orca-Flash 4.0 LT CMOS Digital Camera and a 40x air objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Performing mapping crosses</title><p>Mapping crosses for each mutant strain (Seafoam, Soapsuds, Jumble, and Couscous) with Mapping Strain (previously described as Isolate B) were attempted using both methods previously shown to induce mating in <italic>S. rosetta</italic>: nutrient limitation for 11 days and addition of 2.5–5% <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic> (ATCC 700601) conditioned media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levin and King, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Woznica et al., 2017</xref>). Both methods were effective at inducing mating for all attempted crosses; here, we report which method was used to generate data for each individual cross. Cells induced to mate were plated by limiting dilution to isolate diploid clones. Clonal isolates were allowed to grow for 5–7 days and screened for populations of thecate cells, as these are the only documented diploid cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Woznica et al., 2017</xref>). From each population of thecate cells, we extracted DNA from 75 μl of cells by scraping cells from the plate, harvesting and pelleting the cells, resuspending in 10 μl of base solution (25 mM NaOH, 2 mM EDTA), transferring samples into PCR plates, boiling at 100°C for 20 min, followed by cooling at 4°C for 5 min, and then adding 10 μl Tris solution (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). We used 2 μl of this sample as the DNA template for each genotyping reaction. We identified heterozygous strains through genotyping by PCR at a single microsatellite genotyping marker at position 577,135 on supercontig 1 (Forward primer: GACAGGGCAAAACAGACAGA and Reverse primer: CCATCCACGTTCATTCTCCT) that distinguishes a 25 bp deletion in the Mapping Strain (199 bp) from the strain used to generate the mutants (217 bp). Isolates containing PCR products of both sizes were inferred to be diploid. Meiosis was induced by rapid passaging every day in CG medium.</p><p>For both Seafoam and Soapsuds, we were able to generate putative outcrossed diploids by crossing to the Mapping Strain based on the genotyping marker on supercontig 1, but we only could only clonally isolate populations of F1 haploids with rosettes and never isolated any F1 haploids with the clumpy, rosetteless phenotype. Whole genome resequencing of Seafoam and Soapsuds revealed no mutations at the <italic>rosetteless</italic>, <italic>jumble,</italic> or <italic>couscous</italic> loci. Seafoam and Soapsuds have 17 and 34 predicted nonsense or missense mutations, respectively, in coding sequences and additional mutations in non-coding portions of the genome. Of the lesions in Seafoam and Soapsuds, none were detected in genes encoding a predicted glycosyltransferase, lectin, or related gene family. Without being able to do mapping crosses, it was not possible to identify the causative mutations from Seafoam or Soapsuds.</p><p>For the successful cross of Jumble to the Mapping Strain, we induced mating by starvation using the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levin and King (2013)</xref>. First, we started with rapidly growing, regularly passaged strains, pelleted 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml of each strain together and resuspended in 10 ml of ASW lacking any added nutrients. After 11 days of starvation in ASW, we pelleted all cells (presumably including diploid cells resulting from mating) and resuspended in 100% CG media to recover any diploids. After 3 days of recovery, we isolated clones by limiting dilution in 10% (v/v) CG media in ASW. The probability of clonal isolation in this step was 0.91–0.93 (calculated using the Poisson distribution and the number of choanoflagellate-free wells per plate; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levin and King, 2013</xref>). Three clonally isolated heterozygous populations, each containing almost exclusively thecate cells, were identified through genotyping by PCR at a supercontig 1 microsatellite as described above. To induce meiosis, heterozygotes were diluted 1:2 in 25% (v/v) CG media in ASW every 1–2 days for 8 days. As soon as rosettes and swimming cells were observed, we repeated the serial dilution to isolate clones (probability of clonal isolation 0.85–0.98). We collected any clonally isolated populations that formed rosettes or clumps and ignored any wells containing thecate cells assuming that these represented diploid cells that had not undergone meiosis. 56% of all non-thecate isolates displayed the cell clumping phenotype and 44% of all non-thecate isolates were capable of forming rosettes, consistent with Mendelian segregation of a single locus (χ<sup>2</sup>=1.162, df = 1, p<italic>=</italic>0.28). Isolates were genotyped with the marker on supercontig 1 to ensure that independent assortment of the genotype and the phenotype indeed occurred. In total, 30 clumpy F1s were collected for bulk segregation analysis.</p><p>For the successful Couscous cross, we induced mating using <italic>V. fisheri</italic> conditioned media using the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Woznica et al. (2017)</xref>. A mixture of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> Couscous and Mapping Strain cells at stationary growth were pelleted and resuspended in 5% (v/v) <italic>V. fischeri</italic> conditioned media in ASW. After 24 hr, the cells were pelleted, resuspended in 5% (v/v) HN media in ASW, and allowed to recover for 24 hr. We then isolated clones by limiting dilution in 10% (v/v) CG media in ASW. The probability of clonal isolation in this step was between 0.97–0.98. We extracted DNA as described above and identified heterozygous clones through genotyping by PCR at a single microsatellite genotyping marker on supercontig 1. Four clonally isolated heterozygous populations, containing almost exclusively thecate cells, were identified. To induce meiosis, heterozygotes were passaged 1:2 in 25% (v/v) CG media in ASW every 1–2 days for 8 days. As soon as rosettes and swimming cells were observed, we repeated clonal isolation (probability of clonal isolation 0.78–0.97). We collected any clonally isolated populations that formed rosettes or clumps and ignored any wells containing thecate cells assuming that these represented diploid cells that had not undergone meiosis. Only 14.6% of non-thecate isolates were clumps; this deviation from a Mendelian ratio (χ<sup>2</sup>=225.63, df = 1, p<italic>&lt;</italic>5.34<sup>−51</sup>) may indicate a potential fitness defect of the mutant phenotype. Isolates were genotyped with the marker on supercontig 1 to ensure that independent assortment indeed occurred. In total, 22 clumpy F1s were collected for bulk segregant analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Whole genome sequencing</title><p>Jumble, Couscous, Seafoam, and Soapsuds were whole genome sequenced individually to identify the mutation(s) carried in each strain.

Two days prior to transfection, a culture flask (Corning, Cat. No. 353144) was seeded with Jumble, Couscous, or wild type cells at a density of 5,000 cells/ml in 200 ml of 5% (v/v) HN in AK. After 36–48 hr of growth, bacteria were washed away from the cells in three consecutive rounds of centrifugation and resuspension in sterile AK. After the final wash, the cells were resuspended in a total volume of 100 μl AK and counted on a Luna-FL automated cell counter (Logos Biosystems). The remaining cells were diluted to a final concentration of 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml and divided into 100 μl aliquots. Each aliquot of cells pelleted at 2750 x g, resuspend in priming buffer (40 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5; 34 mM Lithium Citrate; 50 mM L-Cysteine; 15% (w/v) PEG 8000; and 1 μM papain), and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to remove extracellular material coating the cells. Priming buffer was quenched with 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin-fraction V (Sigma). Cells were pelleted at 1250 x g and resuspend in 25 μl of SF buffer (Lonza). Each transfection reaction was prepared by adding 2 μl of ‘primed’ cells to a mixture of 16 μl of SF buffer, 2 μl of 20 μg/ μl pUC19; 1 μl of 250 mM ATP, pH 7.5; 1 μl of 100 mg/ml Sodium Heparin; and 1 μl of each reporter DNA construct at 5 μg/μl. Transfections were carried out in 96-well nucleofection plate (Lonza) in a Nucleofector 4d 96-well Nucleofection unit (Lonza) with the CM-156 pulse. Immediately after nucleofection, 100 μl of ice-cold recovery buffer (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5; 0.9 M Sorbitol; 8% (w/v) PEG 8000) was added to the cells and incubated for 5 min. The whole volume of the transfection reaction plus the recovery buffer was transferred to 1 ml of 5% (v/v) HN in AK in a 12-well plate. After cells recovered for 1 hr, 5 μl of a 10 mg frozen <italic>E. pacifica</italic> pellet resuspend in 1 ml of AK was added to each well and RIFs were added if looking at rosette induction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Transgenic complementation</title><p>For complementation, Jumble mutants were transfected with the following plasmids: (1) <italic>pEFl5'-Actin3'::pac-P2A-Jumble-mTFP</italic> (Addgene ID NK694), (2) <italic>pEFl5'-Actin3'::pac-P2A-Jumble<sup>lw1</sup>-mTFP</italic> (Addgene ID NK695), (3) <italic>pEFl5'-Actin3'::pac-P2A-mTFP-Jumble</italic> (Addgene ID NK696), (4) <italic>pEFl5'-Actin3'::pac-P2A-mTFP-Jumble<sup>lw1</sup></italic> (Addgene ID NK697), and (5) <italic>pEFl5'-Actin3'::pac-P2A-mTFP</italic> (Addgene ID NK676); and Couscous with the following plasmids: (1) <italic>pEFl5'-Actin3'::pac-P2A-Couscous-mTFP</italic> (Addgene ID NK698), (2) <italic>pEFl5'-Actin3'::pac-P2A-Couscous<sup>lw1</sup>-mTFP</italic> (Addgene ID NK699), (3) <italic>pEFl5'-Actin3'::pac-P2A-mTFP-Couscous</italic> (Addgene ID NK700), (4) <italic>pEFl5'-Actin3'::pac-P2A-mTFP-Couscous<sup>lw1</sup></italic> (Addgene ID NK701), and (5) <italic>pEFl5'-Actin3'::pac-P2A-mTFP</italic> (Addgene ID NK676). Transformed cells were grown an additional 24 hr after transfection to allow for transgene expression, and then 40 μg/ml puromycin was added for selection. Selection occurred for 48 hr before rosette induction was counted by hemocytometer. After vortexing for 15 s and fixing with formaldehyde, 200 cells of each transfection well were counted on a hemocytometer to determine percentage of cells in rosettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Cells were plated on poly-D-Lysine coated wells of a 96-well glass bottom plate, lectins were added at a concentration of 1:200 and imaged immediately using Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1/7 Widefield microscope with a Hammatsu Orca-Flash 4.0 LT CMOS Digital Camera and a 20x objective. For further jacalin image analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), cells were plated on a poly-D-Lysine coated glass bottom dish, 1:400 FITC labelled jacalin and 1:200 lysotracker Red DN-99 (overloaded to visualize the cell body) and were imaged immediately by confocal microscopy using Zeiss Axio Observer LSM 880 a 63x/NA1.40 Plan-Apochromatic oil immersion objective.

Fifteen unique fields of view chosen based on lysotracker staining. Induced cells were treated with RIFs for 24 hr before imaging.</p><p>To process images, Z-stack images were max projected using ImageJ. Individual cells were chosen based on the ability to clearly see a horizontally oriented collar by lysotracker and cropped to only include a single cell. The maximum fluorescence intensity pixel of the jacalin channel was determined for the cropped image and was used to normalize the fluorescence intensity. To measure jacalin staining around the cell body, a line was drawn using only the lysotracker staining from the point where the collar and the cell body meet on one side of the cell around the cell to the other and the fluorescence intensity was measured along the line. To compare between cells, the lines drawn around the cell body were one-dimensional interpolated in R to include 150 points and normalized to the length of the line. The average fluorescence intensity was plotted over the length of the line drawn around the cell body for Jumble, Couscous, and wild type -RIFs and +RIFs with a 95% confidence interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Therefore, cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml biotinylated jacalin (Vector Labs, Cat. No. B-1155) for 5 min at room temperature and pelleted at 3000xg for 5 min. Once the supernatant was removed, the cells were incubated with 1:1000 Streptavidin Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat.

The cells were then pelleted at 3000xg for 5 min, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were resuspended in ASW and plated for imaging.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor.

Here, the authors report on a genetic screen in the choanoflagellate <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic> aimed at identifying genes essential for the development of choanoflagellate colonies. Using a bulk segregant assay, two genes (Jumble and Couscous) were identified encoding presumptive glycosyltransferases. The sequencing, as well as the mapping data and complementation studies are sound. The mutants disrupt the normal pattern of rosettes and instead result in clumps of cells. The authors conclude that their findings suggest a pre-metazoan role for glycosyltransferases in regulating development.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major concern is regarding the aggregative behavior of Jumble and Couscous mutants. It is unclear whether the data presented demonstrate that Jumble and Couscous develop by aggregation. It is evident that once they are disaggregated, they aggregate to form the clumps again. But what about the original clumps? Are they really formed by aggregation? Maybe we missed something, but could it not be possible that the original Couscous and Jumble clumps developed by clonal division? This needs to be more clearly explained.</p><p>2) Another area that could be improved upon is the lectin localization data.</p><p>The mis-localization of the lectin jacalin in the Jumble and Couscous mutants is interesting. Is that localization restored to wild-type by complementation? Or linked to the mutations following a genetic cross? What about in rosetteless mutants or in the two other mutants that could not be mapped here, Soapsuds and Seafoam? Absent complementation data, or genetic linkage data, or congruent phenotype of two independent mutants, an observed mutant phenotype might or might not be linked to the suspect causative mutation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41482.055</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major concern is regarding the aggregative behavior of Jumble and Couscous mutants.
