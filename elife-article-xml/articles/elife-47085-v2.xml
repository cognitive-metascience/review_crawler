One of the ways in which memory achieves this remarkable feat is by integrating the sensory and emotional elements of experiences that are separated in time but share common elements. For example, suppose that while hiking through a rainforest in tropical Australia you hear an (unfamiliar) deep booming sound and then see the (unfamiliar) bird-like animal who is making that sound. The next day, you see a poster showing a photograph of the animal (a cassowary) with a heading ‘extremely dangerous.’ Finally, when again hiking through the rainforest you hear the booming sound and feel apprehensive, even frightened.</p><p>This hypothetical scenario illustrates how the sound-animal memory formed at one point in time and the animal-danger memory formed at a second point were integrated via their common, animal, element to generate defensive/fear reactions to the sound. This type of integration could occur in two ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shohamy and Daw, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schlichting and Preston, 2015</xref>). The first is through formation of indirect associations between past sensory experiences and emotional events as they are encountered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hall, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holland, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Konorski, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ward-Robinson and Hall, 1999</xref>): that is during formation of the animal-danger memory, the past sound-animal memory is activated and integrated with the emotional memory content (what might be called ‘online’ integration). The second is through retrieval and chaining of memories at choice points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rizley and Rescorla, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sadacca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sharpe et al., 2017</xref>): that is re-exposure to the sound activates the sound-animal memory, which in turn, activates the animal-danger memory, resulting in expression of defensive/fear reactions to the sound (‘memory-chaining’).</p><p>At present, very little is known about when/how such memories are integrated in the brain to generate action. The present study addressed these questions using an animal model, sensory preconditioning in rats. We specifically examined whether sensory and emotional memories, which are consolidated in distinct regions of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holmes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parkes and Westbrook, 2010</xref>), are integrated online when new memories are formed, or through a memory-chaining mechanism when actions are required. The protocol consisted in three stages that were separated by 24 hr. In stage 1, rats are exposed to pairings of two relatively innocuous stimuli (e.g., a sound followed by a light), and in stage 2 they are exposed to pairings of the light and footshock. Finally, in stage 3, rats are tested with the sound and then with the light. Rats typically exhibit defensive reactions (freezing) when tested with the preconditioned sound, even though it had never been paired with danger, and when tested with the conditioned light, that had been paired with danger.</p><p>Control conditions confirm that freezing to the sound in this protocol requires formation of sound-light and light-shock memories in training (it is not due to generalization of fear), and previous work in our laboratory has shown that the substrates of these memories are doubly dissociable in the MTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holmes et al., 2018</xref>). The sound-light memory that forms in stage 1 requires neuronal activity, including activation of NMDA receptors, in the most anterior region of the parahippocampal cortex, the perirhinal cortex (PRh), but not the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parkes and Westbrook, 2010</xref>); whereas the light-shock memory that forms in stage 2 requires neuronal activity, including activation of NMDA receptors, in the BLA, but not the PRh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parkes and Westbrook, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilensky et al., 2006</xref>). The major question of interest is <italic>when</italic> the sound-light and light-shock memories are integrated to generate freezing responses to the test presentations of the sound.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1: Demonstration of sensory preconditioned fear to the sound</title><p>Experiment 1 had two aims. The first was to show that rats exposed to sound-light pairings in stage 1 and light-shock pairings in stage 2 exhibit fear when tested with the sound alone in stage 3. The second was to show that this fear of the sound is conditional on pairings of the relevant stimuli in each stage of training: that it is due to sensory preconditioning, rather than generalization of fear from the light to the sound. Rats in the group of interest, Group PP, were trained in the manner just-described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Rats in the control groups were exposed to unpaired presentations of the sound and light in stage 1, followed by light-shock pairings in stage 2 (Group UP); or to sound-light pairings in stage 1, followed by unpaired presentations of the light and shock in stage 2 (Group PU). All rats were then tested for freezing to the sound and light alone in stage 3.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47085.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Demonstration of sensory preconditioned fear.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the behavioral protocol used for the group of interest (Group PP) in Experiment 1, and in all subsequent experiments (Group PP, <italic>n</italic> = 13; Group PU, <italic>n</italic> = 16; and Group UP, <italic>n</italic> = 16). It is important to note that the sound and light were fully counterbalanced across the preconditioned and conditioned stimulus identities in this experiment and all subsequent experiments. For convenience of explanation, the designs are described with reference to one half of the counterbalancing. (<bold>B</bold>) Percentage freezing to the preconditioned sound (left panel) and to the conditioned light (right panel), averaged across the eight trials of their respective tests. It is also important to note that the level of freezing to the preconditioned sound is never as high as the level of freezing to the directly conditioned light (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holmes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parkes and Westbrook, 2010</xref>). For this reason, we avoid drawing direct comparisons between the preconditioned sound and directly conditioned light, and use y-axis scales that most effectively show the key findings. Data shown are means ± SEM. They were analyzed using sets of planned orthogonal contrasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hays, 1963</xref>). For test levels of freezing to the sound, the first contrast compared Group PP versus the weighted average of Groups PU and UP; and the second contrast compared Group PU versus Group UP. For test levels of freezing to the light, the first contrast compared Group PU (no light-shock pairings) versus the weighted average of Groups UP and PP (both received light-shock pairings); and the second contrast compared Group UP versus Group PP.

Rats exposed to pairings of the sound-light in stage 1 and to light-shock pairings in stage 2 (Group PP) froze significantly more to the sound than rats that received pairings in stage 1 but not in stage 2 (Group PU) and those that received pairings in stage 2 but not in stage 1 (Group UP) (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,42)</sub> = 20.684; p &lt; 0.0001; <italic>d</italic> = 0.91; 95% CI: [7.063, 18.330]). Rats in these two latter groups did not differ from each other in their levels of freezing (<italic>F</italic> = 0.043; p = 0.837). The analysis also confirmed what is clear from inspection of the light test. Rats that received light-shock pairings (Groups PP and UP) did not differ in their levels of freezing from each other (<italic>F</italic> = 3.988; p = 0.052) but froze significantly more to the light than rats that received unpaired light-shock presentations (UP) (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,42)</sub> = 66.477; p &lt; 0.0001; <italic>d</italic> = 2.06; 95% CI: [37.059, 61.439]). Thus, freezing to the sound in this protocol is not due to generalization of fear, but rather, requires formation of sound-light and light-shock memories in training.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Experiment 2: Consolidation of the sound-light association formed in stage 1 requires de novo protein synthesis in the PRh</title><p>In Experiment 2, we used micro-infusions of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, to confirm that the sound-light memory that forms in stage 1 is consolidated in the PRh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Protein synthesis is thought to be critical for the structural changes that stabilize new information in memory and/or permit successful retrieval of stored information (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis and Squire, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hernandez and Abel, 2008</xref>). Therefore, if consolidation of the sound-light memory requires protein synthesis in the PRh, it would be disrupted by an infusion of cycloheximide, and this disruption would be reflected in less freezing to the sensory preconditioned sound. Rats were exposed to sound-light pairings in stage 1, and immediately after this session, infused with either cycloheximide (Group CHX) or vehicle alone (Group VEH) into the PRh. All rats were then exposed to pairings of the light and shock in stage 2, and finally, tested with presentations of the sound and light in stage 3.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47085.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Protein synthesis in the PRh is required for consolidation of a sensory sound-light memory.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the behavioral procedure for Experiment 2 (Group VEH, <italic>n</italic> = 8; and Group CHX, <italic>n</italic> = 10).

The first is through mediated conditioning of the sound across pairings of the light and shock in stage 2 (online integration). The idea is that the light retrieves its sound associate from long-term memory and thereby allows the sound to associate with the shock. The rats thus form two associations in stage 2: a direct association between the presented light and shock, and an indirect or mediated association between the retrieved (but not presented) sound and shock. Integration, therefore, occurs online to imbue the innocuous sound with emotional value. The second way in which integration could occur is through chaining of the sound-light and light-shock memories at the time of testing. The idea here is that test presentations of the sound activate its now feared associate, the light, and thereby elicit freezing in anticipation of that feared outcome. Integration, therefore, occurs when the sound-light and light-shock memories are required for action.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47085.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Illustration of the two possible mechanisms underlying integration of the sound-light memory formed in stage 1 and the light-shock memory formed in stage 2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The first possibility is that the memories are integrated ‘online’ during training. When the subject is exposed to light-shock pairings in stage 2, presentation of the light triggers retrieval of its past associate, the sound, thereby allowing it to enter into an association with the shock. Test presentations of the sound then retrieve this mediated sound-shock association, and thus, elicit fear. (<bold>B</bold>) The second possibility is that the memories are integrated at the time of testing (‘memory chaining’). According to this account, the sound-light memory (stage 1) and the light-shock memory (stage 2) are formed independently of each other. It is at the point of testing, when the sound is once again encountered, that the subject retrieves the initial sound-light memory and integrates (or chains) it with the light-shock memory; thus, the sound elicits fear.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47085-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In order to distinguish between these alternatives, we trained rats in our standard protocol but silenced neural activity in the PRh, via infusions of the sodium channel blocker, bupivacaine, either before or after the light-shock pairings in stage 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We anticipated that silencing the PRh would not affect formation of the light-shock fear memory, which is encoded and stored in the BLA. Hence, if freezing to the sound is based on a chaining of the sound-light and light-shock memories at the time of testing, this manipulation should spare that freezing as rats enter testing with both of those memories intact. If, however, freezing to the sound is based on a mediated sound-shock association formed across the light-shock pairings in stage 2, silencing neural activity in the PRh before (Group Pre-BUP) or after (Group Post-BUP) the light-shock pairings should undermine the ability of the light to retrieve its sound associate, and thereby, formation of the mediated sound-shock association. Hence, Groups Pre-BUP and Post-BUP should freeze less when tested with the sensory preconditioned sound than control rats (Group VEH).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47085.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The PRh supports online integration of the sound-light and light-shock memories.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Behavioral procedure for Experiment 3 (Group VEH, <italic>n</italic> = 8; Group PRE-BUP, <italic>n</italic> = 6; and Group POST-BUP, <italic>n</italic> = 8).

Previous work had shown that formation of the sound-light memory requires activation of NMDAr in the PRh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>), and that the consolidation of this memory requires ERK/MAPK signaling in the PRh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holmes et al., 2018</xref>). The present work shows that this consolidation also requires de novo protein synthesis in the PRh (Experiment 2). In contrast, the PRh is not required for encoding, consolidating or retrieving information about a light-shock fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phillips and LeDoux, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Romanski and LeDoux, 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Romanski and LeDoux, 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilensky et al., 2006</xref>). Instead, the BLA is critical for each of these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johansen et al., 2011</xref>): encoding of a light-shock fear memory requires activation of NMDAr in the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Campeau et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fanselow and Kim, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miserendino et al., 1990</xref>); consolidation of this memory requires neuronal activity in this region, including de novo protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maren et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schafe and LeDoux, 2000</xref>); and retrieval/expression of a light-shock fear memory requires neuronal activity in the BLA, but occurs independently of de novo protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel and Lattal, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bourtchouladze et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Helmstetter and Bellgowan, 1994</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lopez et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Given the distinct substrates of the sound-light and light-shock memories in the PRh and BLA, respectively, the major question of interest asked here was <italic>when</italic> these memories are integrated so that the sound, which is never paired with shock, comes to elicit the defensive or fear response of freezing. To address this question, we examined whether manipulations of the PRh during formation of the light-shock fear memory influenced the test level of freezing to the preconditioned sound. The results showed that pharmacological inhibition of activity in the PRh before light-shock pairings spared freezing to the directly conditioned light, but reduced freezing to the preconditioned sound. They additionally showed that inhibition of PRh activity after light-shock pairings, including inhibition of de novo protein synthesis, produced the same pattern of test results. These manipulations should have left intact the PRh dependent sound-light memory formed in stage 1 and the BLA dependent light-shock memory formed in stage 2. Hence, if these memories were integrated at the time of testing (via the memory chaining mechanism described above), then independently of our PRh manipulations, the sound should have activated its now dangerous associate, the light, and elicited freezing. The fact that this did not occur indicates that integration had occurred in advance of testing, when the light was rendered dangerous via its pairing with shock (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coureaud et al., 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, we acknowledge that even these results do not completely rule out the possibility that some portion of the integration occurs at the time of testing in stage 3. For example, given the initial coding of the light in the PRh in stage 1 (as part of the sound-light association), it is possible that the light-shock association that forms in stage two is coded in parallel in the amygdala (principally) and PRh. If so, the PRh may further support responding to the sensory preconditioned sound by integrating the sound-light and light-shock associations at the point of testing (or at least the portions of these associations that are represented in the PRh). According to this account, silencing the PRh during stage 2 would have prevented coding of the light-shock association in this region, thereby undermining the possibility of memory chaining during testing in stage 3; and silencing the PRh during stage 3 would have blocked memory chaining directly, thereby disrupting responding to the preconditioned sound.</p><p>The present study used a between-subject design to show that freezing to the sensory preconditioned sound is doubly contingent on sound-light and light-shock pairings across the two stages of training; and that the PRh codes a mediated sound-shock association during stage 2 conditioning of the light. It does, however, leave open the question of whether the PRh codes for other types of mediated associations. This question could be assessed using a within-subject design, in which rats are exposed to two sets of stimulus pairings, for example tone-light and noise-flashing light (flash), in stage 1; shocked presentations of the light and non-shocked presentations of the flash in stage 2; and test presentations of the tone and noise in stage 3. Sensory preconditioning would be evident as greater test responding to the tone than the noise (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2012</xref>); see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sharpe et al., 2017</xref>). Such a difference could originate in two distinct associations formed across stage 2 of training: an excitatory light-shock association and an inhibitory flash-no shock association. That is, just as the shocked presentations of the light allow the tone to enter into an association with the shock, non-reinforced presentations of the flash should allow the noise to enter into an inhibitory, no shock association. In other words, the test differences between the tone and the noise could be due to the former enhancing and the latter reducing freezing. Since both the tone-light and noise-flash associations are likely to be encoded in the PRh in stage 1, we predict that silencing activity in the PRh across the discriminative conditioning of the light and flash in stage 2 would eliminate the test differences between the tone and the noise. It would do so by preventing not only the mediated excitatory conditioning of the tone but also the mediated inhibitory conditioning of the noise.</p><p>It is worth noting that the within-subject design just described requires many trials to achieve differential responding in stage 2; that is, for the rats to freeze when presented with the shocked light and not to freeze when presented with the non-shocked flash. In contrast, relatively few shocked presentations were used here. This difference may be important with respect to when the information acquired in sensory preconditioning and conditioning is integrated. There is evidence that the likelihood of mediated conditioning decreases with the number of conditioning trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holland, 1998</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al. (2012)</xref> used just such a within-subject, sensory preconditioning design in an appetitive conditioning protocol (one that involved multiple trials to produce the discrimination in stage 2) to show that integration occurred at the time of testing: specifically, they reported that silencing the orbitofrontal cortex prior to testing reduced the expression of sensory preconditioned appetitive responding (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sharpe et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, it remains to be shown within a single study that variations in the number of stage 2 conditioning trials regulates whether integration occurs in stage 2 (online) or stage 3 (memory chaining).</p><p>The present findings have also identified both commonalities and differences between sensory preconditioning and a conceptually-related protocol, second-order conditioning, in which animals are exposed to the same training but in the reverse order, that is light-shock pairings in stage 1 and sound-light pairings in stage 2. Like in sensory preconditioning, rats integrate the memories formed in the two stages of second-order conditioning so that the sound, which is not paired with shock, elicits freezing; and this integration occurs during training rather than at test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gewirtz and Davis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parkes and Westbrook, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rizley and Rescorla, 1972</xref>). However, the integration in second-order conditioning differs from that in sensory preconditioning in two critical respects. First, unlike in sensory preconditioning where the two component memories are encoded and stored in distinct regions of the MTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>), both of the component memories in second-order conditioning are encoded and stored in the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parkes and Westbrook, 2010</xref>). Second, unlike in sensory preconditioning, where consolidation of the integrated (or mediated) sound-shock memory requires de novo protein synthesis in the PRh, consolidation of the integrated second-order memory occurs independently of de novo protein synthesis in the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lay et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leidl et al., 2018</xref>). These differences show that the order in which information is presented (or processed) determines how distinct memories are encoded and stored in the MTL, as well as the mechanisms involved in their integration. The integration of memories stored in distinct MTL regions (the PRh and BLA in sensory preconditioning) requires cellular changes that are supported by de novo protein synthesis; whereas the integration of memories stored within the same MTL region (the BLA in second-order conditioning) does not require this synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lay et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leidl et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The present findings also extend previous work showing that contextual information encoded and stored in one region of the brain can be retrieved and integrated with motivational information processed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wolosin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zeithamova et al., 2012</xref>): for example memories of specific contexts are encoded and stored in distinct regions of the hippocampus, and when activated (through stimulation of context-specific ensembles, or exposure to reminder cues), can associate with nociceptive information in the amygdala to form a context fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matus-Amat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ramirez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rudy and O'Reilly, 2001</xref>). They extend these findings by showing that animals can integrate a distinct sensory element of one memory (not just context elements) with motivational components of another (even when the two have never been experienced together); and that this integration involves protein synthesis-dependent changes in the PRh. This is generally consistent with current theories of MTL function (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Squire et al., 2004</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGaugh et al., 2002</xref>) which hold that: (i) context and stimulus elements are represented in a distributed network of regions, (ii) the values of these representations are updated across the course of experience (i.e., ‘on the fly’ rather than at choice points), and (iii) the amygdala plays a critical role in this updating process. However, the results of the final experiment suggest that these theories require further elaboration: retrieval/expression of the mediated sound-shock memory required activity in the PRh, whereas retrieval/expression of the directly conditioned light-shock memory did not. This difference implies that, as a consequence of its direct pairings with shock, the light was recoded so that responding to this stimulus ceased to depend on the PRh. It is consistent with previous work which showed that danger shifts the encoding and consolidation of innocuous sensory information from the PRh to the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holmes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holmes and Westbrook, 2017</xref>). Thus, in addition to its role as a modulator of PRh-dependent stimulus representations, the BLA itself encodes and recodes stimulus representations when danger is present; and thereafter, remains involved in the retrieval/expression of information about those stimuli.</p><p>In summary, using a sensory preconditioning protocol, the present study provides evidence that the brain integrates sound-light and light-shock memories across the course of training; and that the cortical region that codes for the integration, the PRh, remains critical for the subsequent retrieval and expression of the integrated memory. As noted above, our findings do not preclude the possibility that some portion of the integration in the present study occurred at the point of testing; or indeed, that there are circumstances under which sensory and emotional memories are exclusively integrated at the time of testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rizley and Rescorla, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sadacca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sharpe et al., 2017</xref>). They do, however, suggest that with very simple procedures of the sort used here, the bulk of the integration occurs during training. More generally, our findings reiterate that memory is not a repository of experience, but rather, a process of construction and reconstruction. These constructions are not a limitation of the system, but rather, a feature of its design: they help animals and people to solve novel problems in the absence of further experience, and thereby, adapt to changes in the environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were experimentally naïve male and female Long-Evan rats, obtained from a colony maintained by the Biological Resources Centre at the University of New South Wales, and Sprague-Dawley rats, obtained from a commercial supplier (Animal Resources Centre, Perth, Australia).

The rat was then mounted onto a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments) and incisions made over the skull. Two holes were drilled through the skull and 26-gauge guide cannulas (Plastic Ones) were implanted into the brain, one in each hemisphere. The tips of the cannulas targeted the PRh at coordinates 4.15 mm posterior to Bregma, 5.00 mm lateral to the midline, 8.4 mm ventral to Bregma, and angled at approximately 9° (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Paxinos and Watson, 2006</xref>).

The infusion procedure began by removing the dummy caps from the guide cannulas on each rat and inserting 33-gauge infusion cannulas in its place. The pump was programmed to infuse a total of 0.5 μl at a rate of 0.25 μl/min, which resulted in a total infusion time of 2 min. The infusion cannulas remained in place for an additional 2 min after the infusion was complete to allow for diffusion of the drug into the PRh tissue and to avoid reuptake of the drug. This resulted in a total infusion time of 4 min. After the additional 2 min, the infusion cannulas were removed and replaced with dummy cannulas. The day prior to infusions, the dummy cannula was removed and the infusion pump was activated to familiarize the rats with the procedure and thereby minimize any effect of procedure on the day of infusions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Drugs</title><p>The sodium channel blocker, bupivacaine hydrochloride (0.5% w/v), was obtained from Cenvet Australia.

The cameras were connected to a monitor and DVD recorder located in an adjacent room. This room also contained the computer that controlled stimulus and shock presentations through an interface and appropriate software (MatLab, MathWorks).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavioral procedure</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Context exposure</title><p>On Days 1 and 2, rats received two 20 min exposures to the chambers, one in the morning and the other approximately 3 hr later in the afternoon.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Sensory preconditioning</title><p>On Day 3, all rats received eight presentations of the sound and eight of the light. Each presentation of the sound was 30 s in duration and each presentation of the light was 10 s in duration. The offset of one stimulus co-occurred with the onset of the other stimulus for groups that received paired presentations of the sound and the light, while these stimuli were presented separately for groups that received explicitly unpaired presentations. The first stimulus presentation occurred 5 min after rats were placed into the chambers, and the interval between each paired presentation was fixed at 5 min while the interval between each separately presented stimulus was fixed at 150 s. After the last stimulus presentation, rats remained in the chambers for an additional 1 min. They were then returned to their home cages.</p><p>It should be noted that the sound and the light were fully counterbalanced for all experiments. That is, for half of the rats in each group, the sound would be the preconditioned stimulus, while the light would be the conditioned stimulus; and for the remainder, the light would be the preconditioned stimulus, and the sound would be the conditioned stimulus. However, for convenience of explanation, the following designs will be described with reference to one half of the counterbalancing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>First-order conditioning</title><p>On Day 4, all rats received four presentations of the light and four presentations of footshock. The first light presentation occurred 5 min after rats were placed in chambers. In groups that received paired presentations, each 10 s light co-terminated with footshock, and the interval between light-shock pairings was 5 min. In groups that received explicitly unpaired presentations, presentations of the light and the footshock occurred separately, 165 s apart. Rats remained in the chambers for an additional 1 min after the final stimulus presentation and were then returned to their home cages.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>Context extinction</title><p>On Day 5, rats received two 20 min exposures to the chambers, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon. These exposures were intended to extinguish any freezing elicited by the context and thereby provide a measure of the level of freezing to the sound and the light un-confounded by context-elicited freezing. On Day 6, rats received a further 10 min extinction exposure to the context.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-5"><title>Test</title><p>On Day 6, approximately 2 hr after the context-extinction session, rats were tested for their levels of freezing to the preconditioned sound. On Day 7, rats were tested for their levels of freezing to the conditioned light. For each test, the first stimulus was presented 2 min after rats were placed in the chambers. Each test consisted of eight stimulus alone presentations, with a 3 min interval between each presentation. Each sound presentation was 30 s in duration and each light was 10 s. Rats remained in the chamber for an additional min after the final stimulus presentation in each test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Scoring and statistics</title><p>Conditioning and testing sessions were recorded on DVD. Freezing, defined as the absence of all movements except those required for breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fanselow, 1980</xref>), was used as a measure of conditioned fear. Freezing data were collected using a time-sampling procedure in which each rat was scored as either ‘freezing’ or ‘not freezing’ every 2 s by an observer blind to the rat’s group allocation. A second blind observer scored a randomly selected 25% of the data. The correlation between the scores were high (Pearson &gt; 0.9). The data were analyzed using a set of planned orthogonal contrasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hays, 1963</xref>), with the type one error rate controlled at α = 0.05. Standardized 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported for significant results, and Cohen’s d (<italic>d</italic>) is reported as a measure of effect size (where 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 is a small, medium and large effect size respectively). The required number of rats per group was determined during the design stage of the study. It was based on our prior experience in running sensory preconditioning studies: experiments of this sort typically require an average of 8 subjects per group (or per comparison in the contrast testing procedure) to provide sufficient statistical power to detect effect sizes &gt; 0.5 with the recommended probability of 0.8–0.9.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Dr. Kelly Clemens and Dr. Vincent Laurent for helpful advice in development of the experimental program. </p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing—original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the guidelines published by the National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Matthew PH Gardner (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript addresses an important question of how distinct memories are integrated in order to guide future behavior. The authors use the sensory preconditioning paradigm in which a neutral stimulus acquires motivational significance through indirect association with an emotionally salient stimulus (shock). They find that perirhinal cortex must be online and capable of protein synthesis during the cue-shock learning. This learning allows for the expression of the inferred fear to the non-shock paired neutral stimulus at the time of test, and critically, disrupting this learning has no effect on the direct cue-shock learning. This suggests that sensory preconditioning relies on mediated learning during cue-shock learning, and that perirhinal cortex is necessary for this indirect learning between the unpaired neutral stimulus and the emotionally relevant stimulus. Furthermore, the authors show that activation of this inferred association is required at the time of test. This suggests that perirhinal cortex is necessary for both the learning of the indirect association and the expression of this learning during integration.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that this is a well-written manuscript implementing a straightforward and thorough experimental design with clear results. However, all reviewers also agreed that the current results do not rule out a chaining account and that alternative explanations for the findings should be discussed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As the authors mention in the Introduction, there is considerable evidence that integration may occur at the time of test (e.g., Jones et al., 2012). Can the authors elaborate on what experimental conditions might lead to either mediated learning or integration at test? It seems unlikely that this would simply be due to use of either a positive or negative reinforcer used in the design. If this is true, what are the conditions that might promote one method over the other?</p><p>2) Assuming the systems that allow for mediated learning vs. chaining are independent, it is interesting that they are not redundant. That is, why does inactivation of perirhinal cortex at the time of test disrupt behavior so effectively? If the systems are active in parallel, then the chaining system should be intact and allow for integration even when the mediated system is inactive. In other words, it is not clear why perirhinal activity would be necessary if the fear was integrated with the sensory association during stage 2. This somewhat undercuts the main conclusion because this finding is more consistent with the chaining model dismissed by the authors. Specifically, the current results are compatible with the interpretation that perirhinal cortex is in fact part of the chaining system and therefore must have access to cue-cue and cue-shock associations during the test. If perirhinal cortex is offline in stage 1, it cannot consolidate cue-cue associations. If this region is inactive during stage 2, it cannot form cue-shock associations. And if it is inactive during test, it cannot perform the integration. Of note, other areas (e.g., BLA) may in parallel acquire the cue-shock association during stage 2 to support responding to the CS at test, but this association cannot be used for chaining. The authors should consider this alternative interpretation of their data which supports a chaining mechanism rather than mediated learning.</p><p>3) To demonstrate the specificity of the effects, an important control condition would have been a second stimulus pair C-D, where D is not paired with shocks (in contrast to A-B). It would have been useful to see that the animals can discriminate between a shocked (B) and an unshocked (D) stimulus and only freeze in response to B. Likewise, in such a situation one would expect freezing in response to A, but not C. In addition, it would have been useful to see that the response to C is not affected by the various manipulations. While the reviewers agree that an additional control experiment is not strictly necessary, these issues should at least be discussed.

Can the authors elaborate on what experimental conditions might lead to either mediated learning or integration at test? It seems unlikely that this would simply be due to use of either a positive or negative reinforcer used in the design. If this is true, what are the conditions that might promote one method over the other?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included two new paragraphs in the Discussion that address the evidence for test integration, as well as experimental conditions that might shift the timing of integration from stage 2 (online) to stage 3 (testing). As these two paragraphs address each of the major points raised in the review, they have been copied and pasted below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Assuming the systems that allow for mediated learning vs. chaining are independent, it is interesting that they are not redundant. That is, why does inactivation of perirhinal cortex at the time of test disrupt behavior so effectively? If the systems are active in parallel, then the chaining system should be intact and allow for integration even when the mediated system is inactive. In other words, it is not clear why perirhinal activity would be necessary if the fear was integrated with the sensory association during stage 2. This somewhat undercuts the main conclusion because this finding is more consistent with the chaining model dismissed by the authors. Specifically, the current results are compatible with the interpretation that perirhinal cortex is in fact part of the chaining system and therefore must have access to cue-cue and cue-shock associations during the test. If perirhinal cortex is offline in stage 1, it cannot consolidate cue-cue associations. If this region is inactive during stage 2, it cannot form cue-shock associations. And if it is inactive during test, it cannot perform the integration. Of note, other areas (e.g., BLA) may in parallel acquire the cue-shock association during stage 2 to support responding to the CS at test, but this association cannot be used for chaining. The authors should consider this alternative interpretation of their data which supports a chaining mechanism rather than mediated learning.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that, under some conditions, integration occurs at the time of testing. We only show that, in our conditions, integration occurs during stage 2 of training. Rather than the two mechanisms of integration operating in parallel (which would not explain the results of our study), the most parsimonious explanation of our data is that the evidence for sensory preconditioned responding at test is <italic>entirely</italic> due to formation of a mediated association in stage 2; and that the requirement for PRh activity at the time of testing reflects its role in retrieval of the mediated association. We address this point, as well as studies showing that integration occurs at the time of testing, in the third and fourth paragraphs of the Discussion (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To demonstrate the specificity of the effects, an important control condition would have been a second stimulus pair C-D, where D is not paired with shocks (in contrast to A-B). It would have been useful to see that the animals can discriminate between a shocked (B) and an unshocked (D) stimulus and only freeze in response to B. Likewise, in such a situation one would expect freezing in response to A, but not C. In addition, it would have been useful to see that the response to C is not affected by the various manipulations. While the reviewers agree that an additional control experiment is not strictly necessary, these issues should at least be discussed. For instance, is it possible that the absence of a C-D pair in the current design could explain the apparent dominance of mediated learning?</p></disp-quote><p>We take the point that the within-subject design used in other studies has a number of virtues. In the revised manuscript, we discuss the value of this design, inferences supported by the use of this design, and the potential role of the PRh in coding for mediated associations in this design (see below).</p><p>Two new paragraphs in the Discussion:</p><p>“The present study used a between-subject design to show that freezing to the sensory preconditioned sound is doubly contingent on sound-light and light-shock pairings across the two stages of training; and that the PRh codes a mediated sound-shock association during stage 2 conditioning of the light. It does, however, leave open the question of whether the PRh codes for other types of mediated associations. This question could be assessed using a within-subject design, in which rats are exposed to two sets of stimulus pairings, e.g., tonelight and noise-flashing light (flash), in stage 1; shocked presentations of the light and nonshocked presentations of the flash in stage 2; and test presentations of the tone and noise in stage 3. Sensory preconditioning would be evident as greater test responding to the tone than the noise (e.g., Jones et al., 2012; see also Sharpe et al., 2017). Such a difference could originate in two distinct associations formed across stage 2 of training: an excitatory lightshock association and an inhibitory flash-no shock association. That is, just as the shocked presentations of the light allow the tone to enter into an association with the shock, nonreinforced presentations of the flash should allow the noise to enter into an inhibitory, no shock association. In other words, the test differences between the tone and the noise could be due to the former enhancing and the latter reducing freezing. Since both the tone-light and the noise-flash associations are likely to be encoded in the PRh in stage 1, we predict that silencing activity in the PRh across the discriminative conditioning of the light and flash in stage 2 would eliminate the test differences between the tone and the noise. It would do so by preventing not only the mediated excitatory conditioning of the tone but also the mediated inhibitory conditioning of the noise.”</p><p>“It is worth noting that the within-subject design just described requires many trials to achieve differential responding in stage 2; that is, for the rats to freeze when presented with the shocked light and not to freeze when presented with the non-shocked flash. In contrast, relatively few shocked presentations were used here. This difference may be important with respect to when the information acquired in sensory preconditioning and conditioning is integrated. There is evidence that the likelihood of mediated conditioning decreases with the number of conditioning trials (Holland, 1998). Moreover, Jones et al (2012) used just such a within-subject, sensory preconditioning design in an appetitive conditioning protocol (one that involved multiple trials to produce the discrimination in stage 2) to show that integration occurred at the time of testing: specifically, they reported that silencing the orbitofrontal cortex prior to testing reduced the expression of sensory preconditioned appetitive responding (see also Sharpe et al., 2017). Nonetheless, it remains to be shown within a single study that variations in the number of stage 2 conditioning trials regulates whether integration occurs in stage 2 (online) or stage 3 (memory chaining).”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have adequately addressed essential points 1 and 3 in addition to all minor points.

We have included new text in the Discussion of the further revised manuscript that states the following: “Nonetheless, we acknowledge that even these results do not completely rule out the possibility that some portion of the integration occurs at the time of testing in stage 3. For example, given the initial coding of the light in the PRh in stage 1 (as part of the sound-light association), it is possible that the light-shock association that forms in stage 2 is coded in parallel in the amygdala (principally) and PRh. If so, the PRh may further support responding to the sensory preconditioned sound by integrating the sound-light and lightshock associations at the point of testing (or at least the portions of these associations that are represented in the PRh). According to this account, silencing the PRh during stage 2 would have prevented coding of the light-shock association in this region, thereby undermining the possibility of memory chaining during testing in stage 3; and silencing the PRh during stage 3 would have blocked memory chaining directly, thereby disrupting responding to the preconditioned sound.”</p><p>We also made some very minor edits to the final summary for consistency with the new added text: e.g., we changed “showed” to “suggested”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
