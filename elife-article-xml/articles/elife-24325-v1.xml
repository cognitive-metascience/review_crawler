ligases (CRLs). While many non-cullin neddylation substrates have been proposed over the years, validation of true NEDD8 targets has been challenging, as overexpression of exogenous NEDD8 can trigger NEDD8 conjugation through the ubiquitylation machinery. Here, we developed a deconjugation-resistant form of NEDD8 to stabilize the neddylated form of cullins and other non-cullin substrates. Using this strategy, we identified Ubc12, a NEDD8-specific E2 conjugating enzyme, as a substrate for auto-neddylation. Furthermore, we characterized SENP8/DEN1 as the protease that counteracts Ubc12 auto-neddylation, and observed aberrant neddylation of Ubc12 and other NEDD8 conjugation pathway components in SENP8-deficient cells. Importantly, loss of SENP8 function contributes to accumulation of CRL substrates and defective cell cycle progression. Thus, our study highlights the importance of SENP8 in maintaining proper neddylation levels for CRL-dependent proteostasis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24325.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24325.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>CRL</kwd><kwd>Nedd8</kwd><kwd>Ubl protease</kwd><kwd>Ubc12</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM100598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Békés</surname><given-names>Miklós</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cancer Center Support Grant P30CA016087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ueberheide</surname><given-names>Beatrix M</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Tony T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES025166</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Tony T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-12-158-DMC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Tony T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Aberrant neddylation of non-cullin substrates disrupts normal cell cycle progression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Conjugation of the ubiquitin-like (Ubl) protein NEDD8 (neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8) to target proteins, or neddylation, is a fundamental biological process that controls many key cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, the DNA damage response, and apoptosis. Like ubiquitylation, neddylation is catalyzed through an enzymatic cascade consisting of an E1-activating enzyme complex (NAE1/APPBP1-UBA3), two E2 enzymes (Ubc12/Ube2M and Ube2F) and several E3 enzymes such as <italic>R</italic>eally <italic>I</italic>nteresting <italic>N</italic>ew <italic>G</italic>ene (RING)-box protein 1 (Rbx1) and its close homologue Rbx2 (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Soucy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Enchev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown and Jackson, 2015</xref>]). Additional proteins called DCUN1D1-5 (defective in cullin neddylation, domain containing 1–5) have been described in human cells as cofactors for RBX1 and RBX2, which potentiate neddylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kurz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Monda et al., 2013</xref>). The most well-studied target for NEDD8 conjugation are the cullins (CUL1,−2,–3,−4A,−4B,−5, and −7), which are the scaffold subunits of the largest family of ubiquitin E3 ligases, the cullin-RING ligases (CRLs). NEDD8 transfer from the E2 to a lysine (Lys) residue within the cullin promotes conformational changes that increase the catalytic activity of the CRL, while also blocking the binding of the CRL exchange factor CAND1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saha and Deshaies, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pierce et al., 2013</xref>). Structural changes induced by NEDD8 conjugation to cullin subunits ultimately contribute to the efficient ubiquitylation of downstream CRL substrates and their degradation by the 26S proteasome.</p><p>By inducing CRL activation and assembly in this way, NEDD8 ligation to cullins controls a high proportion of ubiquitylation events in cells (~10–20%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Soucy et al., 2009</xref>), making this pathway an attractive target for pharmacological manipulation of protein turnover or proteostasis. An inhibitor of the NEDD8 E1 enzyme, MLN4924, has been recently developed and shown to potently and rapidly suppress neddylation in cells, thereby inhibiting CRL activity. Significantly, preclinical studies using MLN4924 have demonstrated its antitumor activity in several human tumor xenografts and hematological malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Soucy et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brownell et al., 2010</xref>). While the antitumorigenic activity of MLN4924 has been largely attributed to CRL substrates, it is unknown whether non-cullin targets of neddylation could also play important roles in tumorigenesis.</p><p>Although cullins are the primary substrates for NEDD8 conjugation, more recently several non-cullin neddylation targets have been described. Among this list of proteins are p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Xirodimas et al., 2004</xref>), E2F1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Loftus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>), ribosomal protein L11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sundqvist et al., 2009</xref>), Smurf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xie et al., 2014</xref>) and Histone H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ma et al., 2013b</xref>). In addition, large-scale proteomic surveys have uncovered several other neddylation substrates both within and outside the CRL pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xirodimas et al., 2008</xref>). However, some of these non-cullin substrates remain to be fully validated as true NEDD8 targets, as these studies relied on overexpression of epitope-tagged NEDD8 constructs as bait. Since NEDD8 conjugation can also occur through the ubiquitylation machinery under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hjerpe et al., 2012</xref>), it can be difficult to assign <italic>bona fide</italic> neddylation substrates in such experiments. Another challenge in the identification of non-cullin neddylation targets is the relatively low abundance and transient nature of NEDD8 modification events in cells, limiting neddylation detection at an endogenous level by proteomic approaches.</p><p>Like other protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), neddylation is reversible. COP9 signalosome complex subunit 5 (CSN5), a metallo-protease and component of the eight-subunit COP9 signalosome complex (CSN), is the major cullin deneddylase in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lyapina et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cope, 2002</xref>). CSN is specific for neddylated cullins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lingaraju et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cavadini et al., 2016</xref>); however, deneddylase(s) controlling non-cullin neddylated substrates have been poorly defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Recently, a cysteine protease called SENP8 (also known as DEN1 or NEDP1) has been characterized that functions distinctly from CSN in deneddylating primarily non-cullin substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mergner et al., 2015</xref>) as well as hyper-neddylated cullins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mendoza et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2003</xref>). SENP8 selectively interacts with NEDD8 and not ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gan-Erdene et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shen et al., 2005</xref>), and also plays a redundant role in proteolytic processing of the precursor form of NEDD8 in conjunction with ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase isozyme 3 (UCHL3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2003</xref>). Criteria defining the unique substrate preferences of CSN and SENP8 are still not clear; however, a previous study showed distinct neddylation defects in DEN1<sup>null</sup> versus CSN5<sup>null</sup> <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, suggesting that the two enzymes have non-overlapping functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chan et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, the specific substrates for NEDD8 deconjugation by SENP8, as well as the phenotypic consequences of long-term SENP8 depletion, have not been thoroughly profiled in mammalian cells.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24325.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of a deconjugation-resistant NEDD8 mutant (L73P) stabilizes neddylation of cullins and other non-cullin substrates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of the regulation of NEDD8 substrates by modification with either WT- (left panel) or L73P-Nedd8 (right panel), and deneddylation by NEDD8-specific proteases.

The deconjugation-resistant form of NEDD8 was expressed in cells using a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible expression system to minimize the potential of overexpression artifacts, followed by immuno-affinity purification and identification of neddylated substrates by mass spectrometry (MS). Strikingly, we observed enrichment of not only neddylated cullins using this technique but also several novel non-cullin targets, including the NEDD8 E2-conjugating enzyme, Ubc12. In a series of experiments, we confirmed that Ubc12 becomes auto-neddylated both in vitro and in cells, and that Ubc12 and other NEDD8 pathway components form aberrant NEDD8-conjugates in the absence of deneddylating activity. Moreover, we identified SENP8, but not CSN, as the deconjugating enzyme responsible for reversing aberrant neddylation of non-cullin substrates. Importantly, SENP8 loss-of-function studies showed that SENP8 is required for proper CRL activation and G1/S phase cell cycle progression. Finally, to identify candidate substrates with altered ubiquitylation status that could contribute to this defective G1/S regulation, we performed an unbiased proteomics screen to compare the relative abundance of ubiquitylated peptides in parental versus SENP8 knockout cells. Using this approach, we uncovered several potentially relevant substrates with reduced ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation in SENP8-deficient cells that have important roles in cell cycle regulation. Therefore, our findings suggest a novel role for SENP8 in the quality control of the NEDD8 conjugation pathway through prevention of aberrant neddylation of pathway components and demonstrate the functional consequences of perturbing this regulation on CRL activation and cell growth control.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of novel neddylation substrates in cells by expression of a deconjugation-resistant NEDD8 mutant</title><p>We have previously demonstrated that mutation of leucine (Leu) 73 in ubiquitin, located at the P4 position of the DUB cleavage site at the C-terminus, to proline (Pro) renders conjugated ubiquitin resistant to cleavage by a wide range of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Békés et al., 2013</xref>). The C-termini of Nedd8 and Ub are conserved, where the P4 position in NEDD8 is also a Leu residue. Therefore, to generate a deconjugation-resistant form of NEDD8 to be utilized in the identification of non-cullin neddylation substrates, we engineered the analogous mutation in NEDD8 (L73P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To test whether this mutant form of NEDD8 was indeed refractory to deneddylation, we expressed and purified recombinant His-tagged wild-type (WT) NEDD8 and the L73P NEDD8 mutant and used them to in vitro neddylate recombinant CUL1 (and other cullins, data not shown) followed by CSN-mediated deneddylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). While WT NEDD8 was readily deconjugated from CUL1 with increasing concentrations of CSN in the reaction, the L73P NEDD8 mutant was resistant to cleavage from CUL1 at all CSN concentrations. As expected, the addition of the zinc-chelator ortho-phenanthroline (OPT) to the reaction mixture completely inhibited the metalloprotease activity of CSN, and neither WT nor L73P NEDD8 were cleaved from CUL1 under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Collectively, these in vitro studies established NEDD8 L73P as a deneddylation-resistant mutant.</p><p>Next, we used NEDD8 L73P as a tool to trap neddylated forms of substrates in cells, purify stabilized NEDD8-conjugates, and identify substrates and neddylation sites by MS. For this purpose, we generated Dox-inducible (Flp-In) HeLa cell lines expressing low levels of either FLAG-NEDD8-WT or FLAG-NEDD8-L73P, as had been previously developed for Ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Békés et al., 2013</xref>), and used spectral counts to determine the relative abundance of WT- versus L73P-purified NEDD8 substrates. Immunoblot analysis of FLAG-immunoprecipitations (IPs) performed using these cell lines showed that both versions of ectopically expressed NEDD8 could be incorporated into CUL1- and CUL2-NEDD8 conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We observed increased recovery of FLAG-NEDD8-L73P-modified CUL1 compared to FLAG-NEDD8-WT-conjugated CUL1, likely reflecting the inability of the L73P mutant to be deneddylated in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Soucy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brownell et al., 2010</xref>), MLN4924 treatment blocked the conjugation of both endogenous NEDD8 and FLAG-NEDD8 to cullin substrates entirely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Importantly, immunoblot analyses showed that both FLAG-NEDD8-WT and FLAG-NEDD8-L73P were incorporated into CUL1- and CUL2- conjugates at similar levels as endogenous NEDD8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Taken together, these experiments show the utility of both the WT and L73P NEDD8 constructs in isolating neddylated cullins and potentially other non-cullin substrates, in a manner that does not involve the spurious effects of NEDD8 overexpression studies.</p><p>We subsequently scaled up and purified both FLAG-NEDD8-WT and FLAG-NEDD8-L73P conjugates in sufficient quantities for MS analysis.

As anticipated, both FLAG-NEDD8-WT and FLAG-NEDD8-L73P immunoprecipitated CUL1, −2, −4A, and −4B, although the relative abundance, based on spectral counting, of these cullin substrates was much higher in the FLAG-NEDD8-L73P IP samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Interestingly, several non-cullin neddylation targets were identified using this strategy (for a complete list, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), most notably the NEDD8 E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) as well as other previously validated substrates such as Histone H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ma et al., 2013b</xref>) and ribosomal protein L11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sundqvist et al., 2009</xref>). Given the particularly high prevalence of Ubc12 peptide spectral matches (PSMs) in the FLAG-NEDD8-L73P IPs, our results prompted us to further investigate Ubc12 as a potential novel neddylation substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Validation of Ubc12 as a substrate for neddylation</title><p>Upon further analysis of our MS results from the FLAG-NEDD8-L73P IP dataset, we determined that the site of NEDD8 conjugation to Ubc12 is Lys3, as we observed a K-ε-GG remnant, characteristic of trypic digestion of either NEDD8 or ubiquitin, at this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This Ubc12 peptide was also acetylated at the N-terminus, in agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scott et al., 2011</xref>). Sequence alignments show that the Lys3 residue of Ubc12 is highly conserved across several eukaryotic orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Immunoblot analysis of identically prepared FLAG-NEDD8 IPs showed that Ubc12 is modified upon Dox-induced expression by FLAG-NEDD8-L73P, but not when pre-treated with MLN4924, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). suggesting that these represent neddylated Ubc12 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To confirm that these modified forms of Ubc12 resulted from NEDD8 conjugation and not ubiquitylation, we compared relative binding of either ubiquitin L73P or NEDD8 L73P to ectopically expressed Ubc12 in HEK 293T cells. Both WT and L73P HA-tagged NEDD8 constructs, but not the analogous WT and L73P HA-tagged Ub constructs, formed conjugates with co-transfected MycFlag-Ubc12 WT in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We derived additional Ubc12 constructs to test whether the K3 site could support modification by NEDD8 L73P. As we noted that there were several alternative Lys sites at the N-terminus of Ubc12 that could potentially be modified other than K3 (indicated in the alignments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we engineered an additional mutant (NK0) in which all N-terminal Lys residues were converted to Arginine (Arg). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, mutations introduced into the NK0-Ubc12 mutant sufficiently blocked modification by co-transfected NEDD8-L73P. Furthermore, restoring a single Lys at position 3 (K3) in the NK0-Ubc12 mutant (N-K3) partially rescued the ability of Ubc12 to form conjugates with NEDD8-L73P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Therefore, we sought to determine whether neddylation at the N-terminus of Ubc12 could also impact binding to DCN1 as well as other NEDD8 pathway components. We transiently transfected cells with either Flag-tagged WT or NK0 Ubc12 in the presence of HA-NEDD8-L73P and performed co-IPs in the presence of co-expressed HA-NEDD8-L73P to compare their relative interaction to DCN1 and other factors. Consistent with our previous experiments, only the WT Ubc12 construct, but not the NK0 mutant, could support modification with HA-NEDD8-L73P, which likely contributed to reduced interaction to DCN1 and Cul3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Consistently, WT Ubc12 co-purified with more DCN1 when it was not neddylated by HA-NEDD8-L73P co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that N-terminal neddylation of Ubc12 likely weakens binding to DCN1, which in turn may influence downstream NEDD8 pathway function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>SENP8 deneddylates Ubc12</title><p>Based on our observation that Ubc12 neddylation is stabilized by the deconjugation-resistant FLAG-NEDD8-L73P mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), we predicted the presence of a Ubl protease that selectively deconjugates neddylated Ubc12 in cells. To identify the protease responsible for deneddylating Ubc12, we depleted cells for either of the two known deneddylating enzymes (CSN and SENP8) and examined effects on Ubc12 neddylation. Treatment of cells with siRNAs targeting SENP8, but not CSN5, resulted in increased levels of Ubc12 conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These results were corroborated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of endogenous SENP8 using multiple sgRNA sequences in different cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and 5B). To confirm that these modified forms of Ubc12 are NEDD8-conjugated, we additionally performed IPs for endogenous Ubc12 in WT and SENP8 knockout HEK293T cells. In immunoblot analyses of IP samples, probing with antibodies against Ubc12 and NEDD8 detected a band of similar molecular weight corresponding to di-neddylated Ubc12 in both SENP8 knockout cell lines, but not the parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, higher molecular weight Ubc12 NEDD8-conjugates were no longer observed in either siRNA-depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or CRISPR-generated SENP8-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) following treatment with MLN4924. To determine whether SENP8 can directly deconjugate neddylated Ubc12, we utilized an in vitro deneddylation assay using purified components. As demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2005</xref>), we observed that Ubc12 undergoes auto-neddylation when incubated with the E1 enzyme, ATP, and recombinant NEDD8 (WT or L73P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also showed that Ubc12 auto-neddylation occurs in cis via its own catalytic Cys residue, as the catalytically inactive mutant of Ubc12 (C111A) is not neddylated in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), even in the presence of additional WT Ubc12 or when transfected in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This modification was removed when recombinant SENP8 was added to reactions containing WT NEDD8, but not the L73P mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Moreover, in titration experiments using different concentrations of recombinant SENP8 or CSN proteases, we further showed that NEDD8 deconjugation from auto-neddylated Ubc12 only occurs in the presence of SENP8, but not CSN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, these findings establish SENP8 as the primary protease that regulates Ubc12 auto-neddylation both in vitro and in cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24325.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>SENP8 regulates Ubc12 deneddylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HeLa cells were treated with control, CSN5, or SENP8 siRNAs for 48 hr prior to harvesting.

For these studies, we used SENP8-deficient and SENP8 WT-corrected HeLa cells, generated as described in Materials and methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Notably, we observed that the SENP8-deficient cells showed accelerated cell growth in comparison to parental HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To determine whether alterations in cell cycle distribution could account for this difference in overall growth rate, we performed analysis of DNA synthesis (measured by EdU incorporation) versus DNA content (measured by DAPI staining) by flow cytometry. Strikingly, we found that loss of SENP8 contributes to notable changes in the cell cycle profiles of asynchronously dividing cells, including a reduction in the subpopulation of G1 cells, and a concomitant increase of cells in S and G2/M phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). Importantly, the reduction in G1 phase cells observed in SENP8-deficient cells was partially rescued through complementation with WT SENP8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24325.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>SENP8 depletion contributes to altered cell cycle progression and cell growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SENP8 knockout (lanes 2–4) and SENP8-rescued (lanes 5–6) HeLa cell lines were generated as specified in Materials and methods.

Entry into S phase was measured by pulse-labeling cells with EdU prior to collection (a marker for nascent DNA synthesis) and flow cytometry analysis.

Accompanying the increased stability of these substrates, we found other evidence to support premature S phase entry in SENP8-deficient cells, such as increased levels of the E2F targets Cyclin E1 and Cyclin A2, and decreased accumulation of the G1 cyclin Cyclin D1 and the CDK inhibitor p27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Resnitzky et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soucek et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sigl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).

Using a deconjugation-resistant FLAG-NEDD8-L73P mutant, we were able to isolate several NEDD8-conjugated proteins in cells for identification by MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), several of which were also found in previous analyses using ectopically-expressed NEDD8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xirodimas et al., 2008</xref>). Our system provides an advantage over previous proteomic approaches in that expression of even relatively low levels of the FLAG-NEDD8-L73P is sufficient to enable stabilization and IP of neddylated proteins for MS analysis, thus avoiding potential artificial effects of NEDD8 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xirodimas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hjerpe et al., 2012</xref>). This feature aided our detection of several NEDD8-conjugates unique to this study, including MCM7, DDB1, Rab14, FEM1C, RNF187 and others (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> for complete list). Future work will be needed to further validate these as true neddylation substrates and functionally characterize these newly identified NEDD-conjugates in cells. Nevertheless, our MS dataset provides a valuable resource to expand upon previous studies of the NEDD8-modified proteome. Recently, several criteria for validation of <italic>bona fide</italic> neddylation substrates have been delineated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Enchev et al., 2014</xref>). In light of our current findings, we propose that identifying the physiological deneddylase could be added to these criteria to show potential dynamic and reversible neddylation of target substrates.</p><p>We identified and characterized the NEDD8 E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc12 as a novel substrate for auto-neddylation both in vitro and in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Through a combination of both MS-based analysis and Ubc12 Lys site mutagenesis, we identified the site of Ubc12 NEDD8 conjugation at its extreme N-terminus (K3). This modification is distinct from the site of Ubc12~NEDD8 thioester intermediate formation, occurring when NEDD8 is transferred from the active site of the E1 to the E2 active site Cys residue during the NEDD8 conjugation reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2007</xref>). We have also shown that Ubc12 neddylation is sensitive to MLN4924 treatment and is dependent on the catalytic Cys residue of Ubc12. NEDD8 modification at the N-terminus of Ubc12 contributes to reduced DCN1 binding and consequently altered CRL activities, although the mechanism by which this occurs is still unclear. One possibility is that the NEDD8 modification could directly impede the initial interaction between the N-terminally acetylated Ubc12 and the hydrophobic binding pocket of DCN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scott et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, NEDD8 modification could occur on pre-formed Dcn1-Ubc12 complex to induce a conformational change, leading to dissolution of the complex. Further in vitro analyses using purified components will be required to discriminate between these possibilities. Unexpectedly, from our SILAC-MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we identified additional components within the NEDD8 pathway that can form NEDD8-conjugates, including the E1 subunits UBA3 (UBE1C) and NAE1 (APPBP1), as well as the DCNLs DCUN1D1 and DCUN1D5. Future structural and biochemical work will be necessary to better understand the functional roles of these individual NEDD8 modifications in regulating the efficiency of NEDD8 conjugation to cullin and non-cullin substrates.</p><p>Furthermore, we identified the NEDD8-specific cysteine protease, SENP8, as the deneddylase that deconjugates NEDD8 from Ubc12 and other NEDD8 pathway components in human cells. Generation of CRISPR-derived knockout cell lines allowed us to profile effects of SENP8 depletion on global neddylation changes through MS-based proteomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and immunoblot analysis of NEDD8 conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These analyses revealed that SENP8 deneddylating activity is important to inhibit the aberrant neddylation of Ubc12 and other NEDD8 pathway components in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). We also uncovered several previously uncharacterized non-cullin neddylation substrates in the SENP8 knockout cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref> for complete list), complementing our MS analyses using L73P-NEDD8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>.</p><p>Several adverse phenotypic consequences occur in SENP8 knockout cells, including decreased efficiency of NEDD8 conjugation to cullins (primarily CUL1 and CUL5), decreased CRL activity, and increased stabilization of CRL substrates, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Accompanying these deficiencies, SENP8 knockout cells also showed aberrant G1/S cell cycle progression and accelerated cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, these cell cycle alterations partially phenocopy previously reported defects associated with the loss of either Cul1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dealy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen and Li, 2010</xref>) or Cul5 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burnatowska-Hledin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buchwalter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bradley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Willis et al., 2017</xref>). Through an unbiased proteomic screen in which we enriched for K-ε-GG remnant-containing peptides in MG132-treated cells, we were able to identify several candidate substrates with deregulated ubiquitylation status and stability in the SENP8 knockout cells that could potentially contribute to G1/S progression defects. One prominent example is the SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> substrate Cdc25A. Cdc25A acts as a major regulator of both the G1/S and G2/M cell cycle transitions by dephosphorylating and activating Cyclin E/Cdk2 and Cyclin B/Cdk1 complexes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strausfeld et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blomberg and Hoffmann, 1999</xref>).

Whether the elevated UHRF1 levels in SENP8 knockout cells account for this reduced expression of p14<sup>ARF</sup> is unclear. However, deregulated p14<sup>ARF</sup> levels may have a significant impact on the accelerated G1/S progression in SENP8 knockout cells, as p14<sup>ARF</sup> plays a critical role as a tumor suppressor protein by blocking mouse double minute (MDM2)-induced degradation of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stott et al., 1998</xref>), and inhibiting E2F transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eymin et al., 2001</xref>). The combined effects of p14<sup>ARF</sup> levels, deregulated CRL substrates identified in our SILAC-MS screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), and undiscovered substrates (including unknown CUL5 targets, which are largely uncharacterized) are likely to contribute to the deregulated cell cycle progression observed in SENP8-deficient cells.</p><p>It is also apparent from our studies that the decreased CRL function accompanying SENP8 loss does not affect all CRL substrates uniformly and is likely to have substrate-specific effects. For example, SENP8 depletion does not entirely phenocopy the effects of complete inhibition of CRL activity following MLN4924 treatment, as we did not see a significant increase in cells with &gt;4C DNA content (indicative of cells undergoing multiple rounds of replication without cell division, or re-replication) or induction of a DNA damage response in SENP8 knockout cells (data not shown). Similarly, using a CSN5-specific inhibitor developed by Novartis, it was recently shown that CSN inhibition does not have pleiotropic effects on all CRL substrates as MLN4924 treatment does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schlierf et al., 2016</xref>), but results in substrate-specific stabilization. This effect was shown to be dependent on the auto-ubiquitylation of unique substrate recognition modules of CRLs following sustained neddylation and activation of CRL complexes. It is likely that SENP8 depletion has similar substrate-specific effects related to the dynamics of CRL activation and substrate-adapter auto-ubiquitylation influenced via aberrant neddylation of Ubc12.</p><p>An outstanding question from our study is concerning the biological role for auto-neddylation of NEDD8 pathway components: Is auto-neddylation simply a consequence of prolonged SENP8 depletion, or does it also occur in physiological conditions as a feedback mechanism regulating overstimulation of the NEDD8 pathway? Several recent studies have observed a correlation between overactivation of NEDD8 pathway components, including NEDD8, UBA3, NAE1, and Ubc12, with cancer progression and poor prognosis in human lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2014</xref>), colorectal cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xie et al., 2014</xref>), and glioblastomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hua et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, auto-neddylation within the NEDD8 pathway may represent a deliberate quality control mechanism to limit adverse consequences associated with elevated NEDD8 conjugation and CRL activity. Consistent with this notion, we observed in our own study that NEDD8 conjugation to Ubc12 and other components occurs at defined Lys residues, which are evolutionarily conserved across species. If auto-neddylation of NEDD8 pathway components does in fact occur upon hyper-activation of the neddylation machinery in vivo, this also raises the question of how SENP8 deneddylating activity is regulated under such circumstances. Furthermore, what defines the unique substrate preferences of SENP8 versus those of CSN, the other major deneddylating enzyme in human cells? These issues and others will require further interrogation of SENP8 regulation to resolve. Nevertheless, our study characterizes the SENP8 protease as a key regulator of the NEDD8 pathway, implicating SENP8 as a potential pharmacological target to control CRL-mediated processes in cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and lysis conditions</title><p>Both HeLa (ATCC CCL-2) and HEK293T (ATCC CRL-3216) cells were originally obtained from ATCC cell bank. These cell banks, including ATCC, comprehensively perform authentication and quality control tests on all distributed lots of cell lines.

Transfections were carried out using Fugene 6 (Promega) or Hiperfect (QIAGEN), for plasmids or siRNA oligonucleotides, respectively, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were routinely harvested in PBS, and the pellets were frozen at −80°C prior to lysis. Cells were lysed in either denaturing SDS buffer (100 mM Tris [pH 6.8], 2% SDS and 20 mM β-Me) for direct analysis by SDS-PAGE or in nondenaturing buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.6], 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and benzonase (Novagen) for IPs.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tony Hunter as the Senior Editor.

As inhibitors of NEDD8 conjugation have entered clinical trials, it is important to understand the complete substrate spectrum of NEDDylation, as well as the regulation of this modification. Previously, several non-cullin NEDD8 substrates have been proposed; however, these studies have relied on overexpression of NEDD8, which can lead to non-specific protein modification through mis-targeting by ubiquitylation enzymes. Developing new methods to identify potential non-cullin NEDD8 substrates is, therefore, important.</p><p>In this manuscript Békés et al. developed a deconjugation-resistant form of NEDD8, and then exploited this protein to identify novel substrates that are modified with NEDD8 in the cell. Following this strategy, they successfully identified non-cullin neddylation targets including the NEDD8 E2, UBC12, which they showed undergoes neddylation on Lys3. They further showed that this modification interferes with the interaction of UBC12 with the co-E3 DCN1 thereby downregulating CUL neddylation. In parallel, they showed that SENP8 is the enzyme responsible for removing this modification from UBC12 as well from other substrates. Finally they demonstrated that SENP8 depletion contributes to accumulation of CRL substrates and defective cell cycle progression.</p><p>Most experiments are well-conceived and executed well. This work clearly demonstrates that components of the neddylation machinery can be neddylated themselves and it is likely that sifting through the supplemental tables will reveal new neddylation targets that were not characterized in this work. However, several issues need to be addressed before this manuscript can be accepted for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Further characterization of the inhibitory function of Ubc12 neddylation is required to provide a solid foundation for the phenotypes observed in this work. For example, it is a clear prediction that SENP8 should activate CRL1 in in vitro ubiquitylation assays. As all proteins are available, the authors should test this notion. A positive result in this experiment would also support the broad claims of SENP8 function in the title.</p><p>2) The data suggesting that UBC12 neddylation inhibits the interaction of this protein with DCN1 is not particularly strong. The authors should purify neddylated UBC12 and test its ability to engage DCN1 in direct binding assays. Furthermore, they should re-introduce Lys3 into their NK0 mutant of UBC12 and test whether this is sufficient to disrupt interaction with DCN1 (the data concerning the K3R mutation are confusing, but this experiment should strengthen the notion that K3 neddylation has functional impact). A better description of the NK0 mutant in the text would also be helpful, including control experiments that demonstrate that the NK0 mutant of UBC12 does not interfere with acetylation of this protein.</p><p>3) The last figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, describing the in vivo relevance of this autoneddylation/SENP8 pathway is rather incomplete, and for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> stronger physiological data are required, to establish that the perturbation in cell cycle progression observed in SENP8 knockdown cells is in fact due to a failure to deneddylate UBC12 and the resultant decrease in CRL activity, as opposed to the lack of SENP8 deneddylation of some other protein involved in cell cycle progression. For example, the authors could investigate their mass spec data for global changes in CRL substrate levels or they could look at more candidate CRL substrates and investigate the consequences of their stabilization (it is unclear whether the tested ones are the only ones with a phenotype, which would raise some doubts about the importance of this pathway).

For this assay to be executed properly, we envision multiple sequential reactions that would need to be each independently optimized. For example, we would need to demonstrate in an in vitro system that:</p><p>1) Recombinant SENP8 purified from either human cells or insect cells can directly cleave NEDD8 from aberrantly neddylated Ubc12 in the presence of charged E1;</p><p>2) Deneddylated Ubc12 is then fully functional to promote DCN1-dependent Cul1 neddylation;</p><p>3) In vitro neddylated Cul1 can be reconstituted in an active SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and used to in vitro ubiquitylate a candidate substrate and lastly;</p><p>4) SCF-mediated substrate ubiquitylation occurs more efficiently (or not) with increasing concentrations of SENP8 in the original deneddylation reaction. This multi-step reaction would also need to be optimized for various reaction parameters, including concentrations of enzymes and substrates, and appropriate timing of in vitro neddylation and ubiquitylation reactions.</p><p>Unfortunately, we do not have the capacity nor the technical expertise at this stage to execute this complicated biochemical reconstitution experiment within the expected timeline for revision. One of the major challenges is our inability to purify a sufficient amount of mammalian Ubc12 WT and NK0 mutant from tissue culture cells to perform the DCN1-dependent Cul1 neddylation reaction optimally. We were able to use bacterially-expressed Ubc12 as a recombinant source to study the mechanism of Ubc12 auto-neddylation and direct deneddylation by recombinant SENP8 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, 3D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, for the in vitro reconstitution experiments described above, purification of Ubc12 from mammalian or insect cells would be necessary to preserve the integrity of the N-terminal acetylation mark on Ubc12, since the N-term acetylation would be lost by expression/purification in a bacterial system (N-terminal acetylation is essential for Ubc12 binding to DCN1).</p><p>Nevertheless, we attempted to address some aspects of this question using epitope- tagged Ubc12 IP-ed from human cells, although the yield of Ubc12 was relatively low for biochemical studies. Using this source of Ubc12, we found a major difference in the kinetics of autoneddylation of Ubc12 versus DCN1-dependent neddylation of Cul1 (data not shown). For example, while in vitro DCN1-dependent Cul1 neddylation can occur within a time-frame of around 1 minute, Ubc12 auto-neddylation is observed between 30-60 min. In other words, most Cul1 is already neddylated in vitro before Ubc12 auto- neddylation takes place. Therefore, we predicted that this would further complicate our ability to assess how aberrant Ubc12 auto-neddylation alters Cul1 neddylation efficiency in an in vitro assay, in which components for both Cul1 and Ubc12 neddylation would be mixed together simultaneously. Related to this point, we think that Ubc12 auto- neddylation is a relatively slow event and accumulates over time in the absence of SENP8. In support of this idea, we were able to see much more auto-neddylated Ubc12 accumulate in the CRISPR-knockout SENP8 clones in comparison to cells transiently depleted for SENP8 using siRNAs (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A and 3B</xref>). So, the overall defect in CRL activity that we observed in the absence of SENP8 is probably a cumulative effect over several cell divisions, attributable to a gradual decrease in the pool of Ubc12 that is readily available to transfer E1-activated Nedd8 to Cul1 via DCN1 binding. In the future, we hope to directly address this point to understand both spatial and temporal regulation of Ubc12 aberrant neddylation.</p><p>To support the role of SENP8 in activating Cul1 in cells, we performed new experiments to show that 1) SENP8 knockout cells have less binding of endogenous Ubc12 to DCN1, which can be rescued by transiently expressing SENP8 WT in SENP8- deficient cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>); and that 2) SENP8-deficient cells contain a subset of Cul1 target proteins with reduced ubiquitylation in comparison to WT cells (identified using quantitative proteomics and candidate-based Western blot detection of ubiquitylated proteins) (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). This further supports our claim that SENP8 suppresses aberrant neddylation of components of the NEDD8 pathway to promote efficient CRL-dependent ubiquitylation and degradation of substrates in cells. Although the defect in CRL-dependent degradation of substrates in SENP8-deficient cells is attributable to aberrant Ubc12 auto-neddylation based on our indirect evidence of reduced DCN1 binding, we cannot rule out the possibility that other targets of aberrant neddylation in the conjugation pathway, such as DCN1, or Nae1-Uba3, or even the free Nedd8 pool itself, could synergistically contribute to the CRL activation defect phenotype we observed. We have mentioned this possibility in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>2) The data suggesting that UBC12 neddylation inhibits the interaction of this protein with DCN1 is not particularly strong. The authors should purify neddylated UBC12 and test its ability to engage DCN1 in direct binding assays. Furthermore, they should re-introduce Lys3 into their NK0 mutant of UBC12 and test whether this is sufficient to disrupt interaction with DCN1 (the data concerning the K3R mutation are confusing, but this experiment should strengthen the notion that K3 neddylation has functional impact). A better description of the NK0 mutant in the text would also be helpful, including control experiments that demonstrate that the NK0 mutant of UBC12 does not interfere with acetylation of this protein.</italic> </p><p>To address these points, we now include new data to show that WT Ubc12 interacts with relatively less endogenous DCN1 when WT Ubc12 is irreversibly auto- neddylated by HA-Nedd8-L73P (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We also performed new co- immunoprecipitation analyses to show that endogenous Ubc12 interacts with less DCN1 in SENP8 knockout cells in comparison to SENP8-corrected cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This further supports our conclusion that in conditions that promote Ubc12 auto-neddylation (loss of SENP8), there is a decrease in Ubc12 found associated with DCN1, leading to a reduction in Cul1 activation.</p><p>In hindsight, we realize how the K3R data can be somewhat confusing. Our original expectation was that this mutation would block Ubc12 auto-neddylation by HA- Nedd8-L73P, as the K3 site was identified as a K-ε-GG-modified residue by targeted MS analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. However, we found that the K3R Ubc12 mutant could still support neddylation (likely due to the compensatory nature of the multiple Lys sites available at the N-terminal region of Ubc12), prompting us to create an additional mutant (NK0) to block all potential Lys sites for NEDD8 modification at the N-terminus. To eliminate this confusion, we decided to remove the K3R data from the paper, and instead generated the construct suggested above with K3 added back to the NK0 mutant of Ubc12 (N-K3). As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, we found that the N-K3 mutant can partially rescue Ubc12 auto-neddylation by HA-Nedd8-L73P, in agreement with our MS results mapping K3 as an in vivo site for auto-neddylation. Unfortunately, we were unable to convincingly show that the N-K3 mutant can block interaction with DCN1 (data not shown). We think this is because the N-K3 mutant only partially rescues Ubc12 autoneddylation, and there is still a sufficient amount of unmodified Ubc12 available to interact with DCN1 in comparison with the NK0 mutant. In the future, we hope to develop better molecular strategies to purify the neddylated Ubc12 form away from unmodified Ubc12 to directly measure binding properties between DCN1 and Ubc12.</p><p>It was an interesting suggestion to determine whether the NK0 mutations impact N-terminal acetylation of Ubc12. It is widely assumed that N-terminal acetylation of translated proteins is a constitutive event and not subjected to regulation, but this is something that could indeed be interesting to explore further as a way to regulate DCN1 and Ubc12 binding. According to original IP analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the NK0 mutant of Ubc12 showed increased binding to DCN1 in comparison to WT Ubc12. Since N- terminal acetylation was shown to be a requirement for the interaction between Ubc12 and DCN1 (Scott et al., 2011), it follows that the NK0 Ubc12 mutant must also be acetylated; if this were not the case, then we would not have observed any association of the NK0 Ubc12 mutant with DCN1 by co-IP. By this argument, we have decided to forgo efforts to validate N-terminal acetylation of the NK0 mutant to focus attention on other suggested experiments.</p><p><italic>3) The last figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, describing the in vivo relevance of this autoneddylation/SENP8 pathway is rather incomplete, and for publication in eLife stronger physiological data are required, to establish that the perturbation in cell cycle progression observed in SENP8 knockdown cells is in fact due to a failure to deneddylate UBC12 and the resultant decrease in CRL activity, as opposed to the lack of SENP8 deneddylation of some other protein involved in cell cycle progression. For example, the authors could investigate their mass spec data for global changes in CRL substrate levels or they could look at more candidate CRL substrates and investigate the consequences of their stabilization (it is unclear whether the tested ones are the only ones with a phenotype, which would raise some doubts about the importance of this pathway). Along these lines, does NEDD8-L73P produce similar phenotypes as deletion of SENP8?</italic> </p><p>To address these concerns, we performed the following new experiments:</p><p>We took a more unbiased approach to identify CRL target proteins that are less ubiquitylated (more stable) in the absence of SENP8. We utilized SILAC-MS (K-ε-GG) proteomics analysis of MG132-treated WT vs SENP8 knockout cells to identify additional relevant substrates that have compromised ubiquitylation status in SENP8 knockout cells. Some of the substrates that showed differential ubiquitylation status under MG132 treatment have key roles in controlling cell proliferation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Moreover, we were able to verify the altered stability of these proteins, such as Cdc25A, in both asynchronous and G1/S-synchronized cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and 7F</xref>), and in cycloheximide chase experiments (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although it is likely that proteins other than the ones tested by immunoblotting may contribute to the growth and cell cycle defects in SENP8-deficient cells, our K-ε-GG profiling MS screen adds substantial impact to our study by providing a broad overview of major proteins/pathways affected by SENP8 loss, many of which fall under the category of defective cullin neddylation.</p><p>We provide new evidence that overexpression of WT Ubc12, NK0 Ubc12, and WT DCN1 can partially rescue the defective neddylation of CUL1/CUL5 in SENP8 knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This strengthens the notion that failure to deneddylate Ubc12 leads to suboptimal NEDD8 pathway function in neddylating and activating CRLs, since adding back excess Ubc12 and DCN1 can partially rescue the cullin neddylation defects observed in SENP8 knockout cells. We also provide new data showing that complementation of SENP8 knockout HeLa cells with WT SENP8 partially rescues the effects of SENP8 loss on G1/S distribution and cullin neddylation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-C</xref>). Additionally, to more thoroughly characterize the G1/S defect observed in SENP8-deficient cells, we performed a synchronization experiment to compare the timing of G1 to S phase entry in WT versus SENP8 knockout HeLa cells. Using combined flow cytometry analysis of EdU incorporation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) and immunoblotting analyses of various cell cycle regulators (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), we showed that SENP8-deficient cells enter S phase prematurely in comparison to WT cells.</p><p>Furthermore, complementation of SENP8 knockout cells with WT SENP8 partially reverses this accelerated G1-S progression (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the new data provides stronger physiological evidence to explain how the loss of SENP8 and consequent effects on aberrant Ubc12 auto-neddylation can lead to a G1-S progression defect. We do not think the Nedd8-L73P would produce a similar phenotype as the deletion of SENP8 since the Nedd8-L73P mutant also stabilizes cullin neddylation levels. Therefore, the downstream functional defect of Nedd8-L73P expression would likely be attributable to combined phenotypes associated with hyper-neddylation of Ubc12 and cullin proteins (aberrant Ubc12 neddylation equates to less CRL activity, while hyper-neddylation of CRL could provide more CRL activity, but less F-box turnover). Therefore, we did not attempt to measure the downstream effects of Nedd8-L73P expression because the interpretation of the data would be confusing due to the pleiotropic effects of this Nedd8 mutant.</p><p><italic>4) A better statistical analysis and complete representation of the mass spec data is required.
