Its neurogenetic basis is largely unknown beyond a shared requirement for FoxP2 in both humans and zebra finches. We manipulated FoxP2 isoforms in Area X, a song-specific region of the avian striatopallidum analogous to human anterior striatum, during a critical period for song development. We delineate, for the first time, unique contributions of each isoform to vocal learning. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis of RNA-seq data revealed gene modules correlated to singing, learning, or vocal variability. Coexpression related to singing was found in juvenile and adult Area X whereas coexpression correlated to learning was unique to juveniles. The confluence of learning and singing coexpression in juvenile Area X may underscore molecular processes that drive vocal learning in young zebra finches and, by analogy, humans.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30649.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Songbirds, much like in humans, have a critical period in youth when they are best at learning vocal communication skills. In birds, this is when they learn a song they will use later in life as a courtship song. In humans, this is when language skills are most easily learned. After this critical period ends, it is much harder for people to learn languages, and for certain bird species to learn their song.</p><p>When birds sing every morning, the activity of a gene called FoxP2 drops, which causes a coordinated change in the activity of thousands of other genes. It is suspected that FoxP2 – and the changes it causes – could be a part of the molecular basis for vocal learning. FoxP2 is also known to play a role in speech in humans, and both birds and humans have a long and a short version of this gene. Previous research has shown that when the long version of the gene was altered so its activity would no longer decrease when birds were singing, the birds failed to learn their song. Moreover, humans with a mutation in the long version have problems with their speech. However, until now, it was not known if modifications to the short version had the same effect.</p><p>Burkett et al. investigated whether there was a noticeable pattern in the effects of FoxP2 before and after the critical period in a songbird. The analysis found that during the critical period, a set of genes changed together as young birds learned to sing. This particular pattern disappeared as the birds aged and the critical period ended. Burkett et al. confirmed that when birds had the long version of FoxP2 altered, they were less able to learn. However, changing the short version of FoxP2 had little effect on learning but led to changes in the birds’ song.</p><p>The genetic pathways identified in the experiments are known to be present in many different species, including humans. Related pathways have also been found to play a role in non-vocal learning in organisms as distantly related as rats and snails. This suggests that they could be acting as a blueprint for learning new skills. Few treatments for language impairments have been developed so far due to poor understanding of the molecular basis for vocal communication. The findings of this study could help to create new treatments for speech problems in people, such as children with autism or people with mutated versions of FoxP2.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Taeniopygia guttata</kwd><kwd>WGCNA</kwd><kwd>Area X</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>vocal learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1MH070712</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Stephanie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32HD007228</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burkett</surname><given-names>Zachary Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Tennenbaum Center for the Biology of Creativity, University of California Los Angeles</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Stephanie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Basal ganglia gene coexpression patterns shift across the sensorimotor critical period for vocal learning.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to learn new vocalizations is a key subcomponent of language. Complex behaviors such as human speech and birdsong are rarely monogenic in origin, making the attribution of their direct molecular underpinnings a challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marcus and Fisher, 2003</xref>). While language is unique to humans, learned vocal behavior is present in a number of animal taxa. Among laboratory animals, the zebra finch songbird (<italic>Taeniopygia guttata</italic>) is the primary genetic model for vocal learning, and song learning in this species shares numerous parallels with human speech development. For example, both species share corticostriatal loops for producing vocalizations and have direct projections from cortical neurons onto brainstem motor neurons that control the vocal organs, a connection that is lacking or reduced in non-vocal learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lemon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jürgens, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arriaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doupe and Kuhl, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Petkov et al., 2012</xref>). The brains of avian vocal learners contain a distributed corticostriatal network of clustered cells devoted to vocal production learning, commonly referred to as the song control circuit, offering tractable targets for experimental manipulation. Despite their evolutionary distance, humans and zebra finches exhibit shared transcriptional profiles in key brain regions for vocal learning that are unique from surrounding brain areas and from the brains of non-vocal learning species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pfenning et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The forkhead box P2 (FOXP2) transcription factor was the first gene shown to be important for vocal learning in both humans and songbirds. Forkhead box proteins are characterized by the presence of DNA-binding FOX domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 1993</xref>) and FOXP subfamily members form homo- or heterodimers at zinc finger and leucine zipper domains in order to bind DNA. In humans, a heterozygous mutation in the FOX domain of FOXP2 causes a rare heritable speech and language disorder in a cohort known as the KE family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vargha-Khadem et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lai et al., 2001</xref>), potentially by altering the subcellular localization of the molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vernes et al., 2006</xref>). While the mutation disrupts vocal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marcus and Fisher, 2003</xref>) and also vocalization in vocal non-learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chabout et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castellucci et al., 2016</xref>), multiple FOXP2 isoforms are endogenous to both songbirds and humans, including one that lacks the DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Teramitsu and White, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruce and Margolis, 2002</xref>). This truncated variant is referred to as FOXP2.10+ because, although it lacks the FOX domain, it retains the dimerization domains plus an additional 10 amino acids that are not found in the full length form (FoxP2.FL).</p><p>Consistent with its lack of a FOX domain, in vitro assays of FOXP2.10+ indicate that it may regulate other FoxP2 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vernes et al., 2006</xref>). Since it retains the dimerization domain, it has been hypothesized to act as a cytoplasmic sink, binding to other FOXP proteins and preventing their entry to the nucleus and interaction with DNA. Investigation of FoxP2 function in zebra finches has revealed remarkable parallels with humans. Similar <italic>FoxP2</italic> expression patterns occur in developing human and zebra finch brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Teramitsu et al., 2004</xref>). In zebra finches, knockdown of <italic>FoxP2</italic> in the song dedicated striatopallidal nucleus, Area X, during vocal development impaired vocal mimicry of tutor songs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haesler et al., 2007</xref>), much as the KE family mutation impairs speech. These observations indicate that functional FoxP2 is necessary for proper vocal learning, an inference supported by work in songbirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haesler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heston and White, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The unique organization of song control circuit neurons enabled the discovery that FoxP2 is dynamically downregulated within Area X when zebra finches practice their songs, termed ‘undirected’ (UD) singing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Teramitsu and White, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hall, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Immelmann, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunn and Zann, 1996</xref>). This decrease in FoxP2 is accompanied by increased vocal variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilliard et al., 2012a</xref>), thought to be a form of vocal exploration. Blockade of FoxP2 downregulation impaired birds’ ability to induce variability in their songs. A poor learning phenotype emerged following FoxP2 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heston and White, 2015</xref>) that was remarkably similar to that observed following FoxP2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haesler et al., 2007</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the dynamic regulation of at least FoxP2.FL, and thereby the behavior-linked up- and down-regulation of its transcriptional targets, is necessary for the proper learning of vocalizations. No specific role in vocal behavior has yet been attributed to the FoxP2.10+ isoform.</p><p>These observations pinpoint FoxP2 as a molecular entry point to the pathways underlying vocal learning. In adult birds, we previously used Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify thousands of genes regulated by singing specifically in Area X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilliard et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>). Since adult zebra finches sing stable, or crystallized, songs, the transcription patterns underlying vocal learning were not identified. Here we conduct a new study with two goals: (1) Determine whether FoxP2.10+ may play a role in vocalization and, (2) Manipulate FoxP2 isoforms in juveniles to generate a broad range of behavioral and transcriptional states upon which to apply WGCNA and thereby reveal learning-related gene modules. Toward the first goal, overexpression of FoxP2.10+ revealed a unique role for this truncated isoform in the acute modulation of vocal variability. Toward the second goal, overexpression of either GFP or one of the two FoxP2 isoforms created three distinct groups of juvenile birds: one that was good at learning and acutely modulating variability (GFP), one that was poor at learning and acutely modulating variability (FoxP2.FL), and one that was good at learning but injected stability into song (FoxP2.10+). We applied WGCNA to the Area X transcriptome of birds across this behavioral continuum and discovered striatopallidal coexpression patterns that were positively correlated to learning. These learning-related patterns were present in juvenile but not adult Area X. However, singing-driven coexpression patterns in Area X were largely preserved between juveniles and adults, suggesting that: (1) song production modules are independent of learning state and (2) the spatiotemporal co-occurrence of both song production and learning-related gene modules in juvenile Area X is fundamental to vocal learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Virus-mediated overexpression of FoxP2 isoforms affects song learning and/or vocal variability</title><p>Adeno-associated viral (AAV) constructs were used to drive overexpression of FoxP2.FL or FoxP2.10+ in Area X of developing males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To verify isoform-specific overexpression, we used two riboprobes in <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiments: one antisense to a region common to both transcripts (mid probe) and one antisense to a region near the 3’ end of FoxP2.FL (3’ probe; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Teramitsu and White, 2006</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Robust signals beyond endogenous/background levels were observed in the striatopallidum of both hemispheres using the mid probe but only in the hemisphere injected with the FoxP2.FL construct using the 3’ probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results indicate that each viral construct overexpressed its encoded <italic>FoxP2</italic> isoform and was thus suitable for bilateral injection into Area X of juvenile males at 35d. An additional cohort received AAV encoding GFP as a control. We quantified levels of <italic>FoxP2</italic> expression at 65d by performing qRT-PCR with a set of primers that amplifies a region common to both transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haesler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Olias et al., 2014</xref>) and another set specific to the FoxP2.10+ (see Materials and methods). The first primer set indicated that <italic>FoxP2</italic> levels were higher in birds injected with either construct relative to control levels. When quantified by the second primer set, we found elevated PCR product only in the animals injected with the FoxP2.10+ construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). No overexpression was detected in the ventral striatopallidum (VSP; the zebra finch striatum is interspersed with pallidal-like cells and is separate from the pallidum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reiner et al., 2004</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We thus examined the protein-level distribution of FoxP2.10+ and FoxP2.FL in the finch striatopallidum following overexpression of an N-terminus Xpress tagged FoxP2.10+ linked to a GFP reporter (see Stereotaxic Surgery and Viruses in Materials and methods). Transduced cells shared the distinctive FoxP2.10+ staining pattern of aggresomes seen previously. In FoxP2+ cells that co-expressed the Xpress tag and GFP reporter, endogenous FoxP2.FL signal was interspersed among Xpress-positive puncta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vernes et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>We previously found that, in unmanipulated birds, two hours of UD singing in the morning is sufficient to decrease Area X <italic>FoxP2</italic> mRNA (as measured by both the mid and 3’ probes) and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Teramitsu and White, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller et al., 2008</xref>). This decrease in FoxP2 was accompanied by an increase in the variability of UD songs, in the form of decreased self-similarity (see Materials and methods), that were sung subsequent to the two hour time-point, a paradigm which we term UD-UD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilliard et al., 2012a</xref>). In contrast, when birds were distracted from singing for two hours in the morning (non-singing; NS), their subsequent UD songs (termed NS-UD) were less variable. Moreover, overexpression of FoxP2.FL in Area X abolished the increase in vocal variability normally induced by the UD-UD paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heston and White, 2015</xref>). These observations indicate that downregulation of full length FoxP2 is important for acute vocal variability but we did not directly manipulate FoxP2.10+. Here, we performed similar behavioral experiments to test for the induction of vocal variability and included the FoxP2.10+ injected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). To assess whether UD singing drove an increase in vocal variability, we used the UD-UD paradigm (see Materials and methods) and quantified the effect of two hours of UD singing on the coefficient of variation (CV) of acoustic features in the subsequent UD songs of ~60d birds overexpressing GFP, FoxP2.FL, or FoxP2.10+. Results were compared to songs sung by the same birds undergoing the NS-UD paradigm. As predicted, GFP-expressing animals exhibited a negative effect size for most acoustic features, and FoxP2.FL overexpression diminished these practice-induced changes in vocal variability, replicating our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heston and White, 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30649.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Overexpression of FoxP2 isoforms affect song learning and/or song variability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Timeline of experimental procedures relative to critical periods in song development.

Rather than increasing song variability (as in the GFP group) or creating a state of equivalent variability (as in the FoxP2.FL group), UD-UD singing led to markedly invariable songs in the FoxP2.10+ birds, suggesting a role for FoxP2.10+ in promoting song stability. We also examined variability in the raw acoustic features of NS-UD and UD-UD song and found that expression of either FoxP2 isoform did not dramatically alter variability, indicating that the viral-driven overexpression specifically affected the modulation of variability (See ‘Acute Modulation of Vocal Variability’ in Materials and methods) and not its overall level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and Materials and methods).

We found significant correlations between module eigengenes and the following behaviors: tutor percentage similarity (i.e. vocal learning: darkred, green, and greenyellow modules), number of motifs sung (i.e. amount of singing: black, orange, darkgreen, royalblue, and blue modules), singing-induced acoustic variability (i.e. variability induction: black, brown, darkgreen, darkgrey, magenta, orange, pink, purple and turquoise modules), and motif identity (i.e. overall vocal variability: darkgrey module) (0.00008 &lt; p &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Hereafter, these modules are termed ‘learning-related’, ‘song-production’, ‘variability-induction’ and ‘vocal variability’ modules, respectively. We examined all modules whose p-value was ≤0.05 and calculated the relationship between module membership and gene significance. (For definitions of WGCNA and network terms, see Materials and methods: WGCNA and network terminology. For information about significance levels reported here, see Materials and methods: Correlation of behavior to gene expression). For most modules, strong correlations were observed for each trait, indicating that the genes most representative of the module’s overall expression profile were those most strongly related to the behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Connectivity is the core gene coexpression network concept and genes with high connectivity have the strongest coexpression relationships across the entire network, indicating greater importance to overall network structure and biological significance.

These findings indicate that information about the relationships between gene coexpression and behavior was reflected in the structure of the network: <sc>A</sc> gene’s relationship to a module or a module’s relationship to the network was predictive of strong behavioral relevance. Therefore, we examined the most well-connected/hub genes within the context of their module (genes with the greatest intramodular connectivity) or the entire network (genes with the greatest whole-network connectivity). We discovered that many of these hub genes are known risk genes for human disease. For example, of the 7462 genes in the overall network, Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (<italic>FMR1</italic>) had the third highest connectivity and was the most well connected member of the green module (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We reasoned that if highly similar coexpression patterns were present in juveniles, then they would likely be unrelated to learning. In this case, the capacity to learn a song might be attributable to other genes and/or the relationships between them. To compare across studies, we built two new, age-specific networks composed of genes common to the two original networks, then computed gene significance scores for all genes in both networks. We found a remarkable correlation between gene significances to singing in juveniles and adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), showing that genes in Area X shared similar relationships to singing, whether it be positive, negative, or nonexistent, independent of the animal’s age and learning state.

These results indicate that not only are the relationships between genes and singing consistent across ages but those genes’ coexpression patterns are preserved as well.</p><p>Since singing-driven gene coexpression patterns were similar between juvenile and adult Area X, the capacity to learn vocalizations is not a product of large-scale differences in coexpression of the song production module genes. We therefore looked for any modules that differed between juvenile and adult Area X. We found that the green, greenyellow and darkred learning-related modules that were significantly correlated to tutor similarity in juveniles were poorly preserved in adult Area X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

These results attribute the difference between juvenile and adult Area X not to differential expression or altered correlation to behavior, but to differential connectivity in adults of modules that are correlated to tutor similarity in juveniles. Our findings suggest that the capacity to alter vocalizations may not reside in the absolute expression level of a given gene but instead the gene’s transcriptional context. For example, <italic>FMR1</italic> was poorly connected in the adult network but was positioned as a hub gene in the juvenile network, indicating the gene’s importance during a developmental period when vocalizations are being actively modified but not during their maintenance. In general, genes that were positively correlated with learning and/or had high module membership in the green learning-related module had the greatest decrease in connectivity in adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A bioinformatics approach indicates MAPK11 as an entry point to neuromolecular networks for vocal learning</title><p>Above we describe two classes of coexpression modules: (1) learning-related modules that are preserved throughout the striatopallidum but present only in juveniles, (2) song production modules that are preserved across age but specific to Area X. Therefore, song production modules and learning-related modules exist simultaneously only in juveniles, and their co-occurrence within Area X may reflect the capacity to dramatically alter vocalizations during sensorimotor learning. Therefore, we hypothesized that interactions between these two modules may drive the vocal learning process.</p><p>To test this idea using bioinformatics, we examined any genes linked to FoxP2, whose overexpression drove the broad range of tutor song copying in our animals. The gene with the greatest gene significance to learning was <italic>MAPK11</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Interestingly, in Foxp2 heterozygous knockout mice, <italic>MAPK11</italic> levels increase, supporting the interaction we observed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enard et al., 2009</xref>).

The network properties of these modules revealed strong relationships between gene module membership and the behavior(s) to which the modules were correlated.</p><p>To understand how gene coexpression patterns change across the boundary of the sensorimotor critical period for vocal learning, we compared the juvenile Area X overall network constructed here to one previously constructed from adult Area X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilliard et al., 2012a</xref>). We had competing hypotheses about whether the inability to learn new songs as an adult is resultant of changes to the song production modules observed in juveniles or associated with some other transcriptional change. Module preservation statistics revealed robust preservation of the juvenile Area X song production modules in the adult network, supporting the latter hypothesis. In striking contrast, the densely interconnected green learning-related module observed in juvenile striatopallidum was poorly preserved in adults, indicating that at least part of the learning-related transcriptome is altered by aging. Further, the green learning-related module was strongly preserved across the construct-specific networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>) and robustly correlated to learning in the GFP network. This latter finding suggests that the coexpression of these genes occurs in non-manipulated birds and is not a byproduct of experimental perturbation of FoxP2 levels.</p><p>Because we created networks from VSP of the same animals, we could compare how well the Area X modules were preserved in a similar brain region that is unspecialized for song.

These experiments define juvenile Area X as a nexus wherein the striatopallidal learning-related modules exist in tandem with song production modules.

Despite the poor exploration of motor space induced by FoxP2.10+ overexpression, these animals learned their tutors’ songs well, a finding seemingly at odds with motor learning theory where broad exploration of motor space is refined through practice before arriving at an ‘ideal’ precise pattern for execution of the skill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaelbling et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2014</xref>).

For example, the local interaction network around green module hub <italic>ATF2</italic> (defined as all those neighbors within two steps and with high confidence of protein interaction) is composed of well-connected genes in the learning-related and song production modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, top). Moreover, the connections to learning-related genes are, themselves, inputs to well-connected network hubs. As the juvenile crosses over into adulthood, the connectivity of many of the learning-related genes, like <italic>ATF2</italic>, dramatically decreases. As part of the same process, the adjacencies between genes in the interaction network shift such that a connection to a learning-related gene is no longer one with a hub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, bottom). This shift in network importance may present a pattern underlying song maintenance rather than song learning, and potentially the closure of the critical period in which the bird can change its song.</p><p>To understand the mechanisms underlying the transition between the two learning states, our data highlight the importance of the network position of a gene. To enable vocal plasticity after critical period closure, a goal critically relevant to social and communication disorders, manipulations that coordinate gene expression such that poorly connected genes are reestablished as network hubs are likely required. Tools to accomplish a goal such as this do not yet exist, but the pathways prioritized and presented here provide a framework for teasing out testable components.</p><p>In sum, we have described the Area X transcriptome at a developmentally significant point in the vocal learning process and provided context for it in terms of aging and brain region specificity. We suggest numerous coexpression and protein level interactions that our data indicate are significant to vocal learning. Due to the large amount of data generated by this study, we provide interactive graphics describing the coexpression and protein interaction networks as a supplement to the figures and tables in the manuscript.

At 40d, juvenile males were isolated from all other birds and continuously audio-recorded. At ~60 d, an ‘NS-UD’ experiment was performed according to the methods of Miller et al., Chen et al., and Heston et al.

Virus was injected via a Drummond Nanoject II through a glass microelectrode (~40 µM inner diameter) backfilled with mineral oil. Three 27.6 nL injections were performed with a 15 s wait between injections and a 10 min wait before retraction of the electrode so as to minimize vacuum action pulling the virus away from the injection site. Incisions in the scalp were closed with Vetbond (3M, St. Paul, MN, USA).

There is currently no antibody specific to this truncated isoform, presenting a challenge to its immunological detection. The limited cloning capacity of AAV precluded our ability to express a reporter gene in the viruses that we used for behavioral and RNA-seq experiments. Moreover, we opted not to include an epitope tag on AAV-expressed FoxP2 isoforms in order to avoid any conformational changes that could confound our behavioral or RNA-seq analyses. For histological analysis only, however, we took advantage of the larger cloning capacity of HSV to express FoxP2.10+ tagged with an Xpress epitope at its N-terminus downstream of the IE 4/5 promoter and a GFP transduction reporter downstream of the CMV promoter (McGovern Institute for Brain Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). Surgical procedures were identical to those performed with AAV except that the virus was diluted to 60% in PBS immediately preceding injection, per the manufacturer’s recommendation.

We checked for batch effect on average expression resultant of RNA extraction group, RNA extraction experimenter, and across sequencing lanes. No batch effects were observed. We used an iterative process of removing gene expression data from single samples whose expression was &gt;2.5 SD of that gene’s expression across all samples, repeating until no samples remained with expression &gt;2.5 SD away from the gene’s average expression across all samples. Finally, we calculated the intrasample correlation (ISC) and used a hard cutoff of 2 SD away from the group ISC for removal of samples from the study. No sample in any group (Area X or VSP) was &gt;2 SD from the group ISC. Data were quantile normalized as the last step.

We then constructed a signed network using the blockwiseModules function in the WGCNA R package. For the Area X network, we used a minimum module size of 100 genes and deepSplit was set equal to four for Area X and two for VSP. Genes were required to have at least a connectivity of 0.3 with their module eigengene in order to remain a member of their module and the module ‘core’ (=minimum module size/3) needed to have a minimum eigengene connectivity of 0.5 for the module to not be disbanded. All other parameters were set to default. Networks were iteratively constructed with genes in the grey module removed from the expression data after each round of network building and module definition. The networks were considered final after no genes were placed into the grey module.</p><p>During network construction, FoxP2 was removed, presumably due to the lack of coexpression with other genes in the network resulting from virus-driven overexpression. Therefore, we added FoxP2’s expression data back into the final overall network and it became the only gene in the grey module. Once coexpression modules were defined, we correlated vocal behavior to the module eigengenes. Since the grey module included only a single gene with no significant behavioral correlations, it was excluded from module-trait analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>WGCNA and network terminology</title><p>WGCNA is a well-established technique for gleaning biologically relevant clusters of coexpressed and functionally related genes from microarray and sequencing data.

Zsummary is a composite preservation score defined as the average of Zdensity and Zconnectivity, which assess the preservation of connection strength among network nodes (e.g. Are strongly connected nodes in one network also strongly connected in the other?) and the connectivity patterns between nodes (e.g. Do the patterns of connection between specific nodes exist in both networks?), respectively, following permutation tests under the null hypothesis.

Gene significances were calculated for the following traits: Motifs, defined as the number of motifs each animal sang in the two hours following lights-on on the day of sacrifice; Tutor similarity, defined as the percentage similarity between the pupil and its tutor on the day of sacrifice; Variability induction, defined by inserting Wiener entropy CV scores into the equation (NS-UD)/(NS + UD) from the first twenty syllable renditions sung during the NS-UD experiment performed at ~60 d; Motif identity, defined as the product of the similarity and accuracy scores divided by 100 of the last 20 motifs sung by each bird before sacrifice. Song variability was assessed on the motif level for the purpose of gene significance calculations so as to obtain a single value for each animal.</p><p>Following network construction, modules were summarized by calculating a module eigengene, defined as the first principal component of the module’s expression data using the moduleEigengenes() function in the WGCNA R package. The relationship between a module and a behavior was assessed by determining the Pearson correlation between the module eigengene and continuous behavioral traits as defined in ‘Song Analysis and Statistics’, above. Significance was then determined by calculating the Fisher transformation of each correlation using the corPvalueFisher() function in the WGCNA R package. We performed p-value corrections for module-trait correlations using the p.adjust() function with the number of comparisons equal to the number of traits (4) by the number of modules (21; the FoxP2-only grey module was not included for purposes of p-value correction). The p-values presented in this manuscript are uncorrected for multiple hypothesis testing but those that pass FDR-correction at p&lt;0.05 are indicated. We chose to present uncorrected p-values due to the small sample size used to create the overall network (n = 19 birds). The authors of WGCNA suggest a minimum of 15 samples with &gt;20 preferred (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/faq.html"><named-content content-type="sequence">https://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/faq.html</named-content></ext-link>). P-value corrections drive nearly all results to insignificance, including well preserved module-trait relationships that are present in adults and survive such corrections due to the larger sample size in that study. We use the significant but uncorrected p-values in this study as a guide toward interesting module-trait relationships, then use the properties of the network to inform the downstream analysis.</p><p>Our choice of behavioral traits for correlation to the gene network was hypothesis-driven. In addition to the obvious quantification of vocal learning, the comparison for variability induction was planned, as indicated by the fact that we conducted the NS-UD and UD-UD behavioral paradigms (prior to the bird’s sacrifice) that led to it. We originally used these paradigms as a method for naturally regulating FoxP2 levels, before we had identified a virus that was effective in doing so. In that study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miller et al., 2010</xref>), our prediction was that behavioral conditions that lead to low endogenous FoxP2 in Area X (namely 2 hr of UD singing), would be associated with higher levels of variability. This was indeed the case. We replicated this finding in zebra finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heston and White, 2015</xref>) but did not observe the same phenomenon in Bengalese finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) as noted in our Discussion.

Upon closer inspection of the MAPK11 RefSeq annotation model, we believe the identified region does not lie within the promoter but instead within an intronic region of MAPK11. There is currently no experimental evidence to verify the RefSeq model’s predicted transcription start site and the Ensembl model for MAPK11 is considerably longer (323 residues vs. 285 residues) due to an expanded N-terminus region. Further, the chicken MAPK11 RefSeq model is 361 residues and contains an N-terminus residue (MSERGGFYRQELNKTVWEVPQRYQNLTPVGSGAYGSVC) that maps ~12 kb upstream of the second exon of chicken MAPK11. This residue does not map to the zebra finch genome, presumably because a gap in the genome exists ~13 kb upstream of zebra finch MAPK11. The MAPK11 N-terminus peptides of other songbird species (Bengalese finch, starling, white-throated sparrow, great tit and Tibetan ground-tit) are highly similar to that in chicken and align to the first exon in chicken MAPK11. This peptide is found in mice and humans, indicating high conservation. We thus posit that the MAPK11 RefSeq annotation in zebra finch is incomplete on the 5’ end and that we are reporting a binding site internal to MAPK11 and not at the promoter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR</title><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using ChIP-IT High Sensitivity (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA, Cat.

Therefore, plots depicting nodes and their edges with other genes become exceedingly complicated and unintuitive if all nodes and edges are included. In an effort to sparsify the networks and present the most salient data, we removed edges and genes from the coexpression networks using the following workflow: first, remove ≤98% of edges, then remove all disconnected nodes, then remove all nodes that are not part of the network’s main component (e.g. the largest group of connected nodes). The remaining nodes and edges were plotted.</p><p>In this manuscript, we present three types of network plots that look similar but convey different data. The three types are as follows:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The overall gene coexpression network, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/a/g.ucla.edu/genenet/coexpressionnetwork">https://sites.google.com/a/g.ucla.edu/genenet/coexpressionnetwork</ext-link>. In these plots, the nodes represent genes and their colors represent the module assignment. Edges represent the adjacency between nodes and the edge color is a combination of the origin and target node colors. Due to the overwhelming number of edges in this network, the edge weights are scaled to minimize the range. Node size in this network is equivalent to the node’s degree (e.g. the number of connections originating or terminating at that node) and the maximum node size is suppressed so as to provide maximal visual clarity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Individual coexpression modules, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/a/g.ucla.edu/genenet/modules">https://sites.google.com/a/g.ucla.edu/genenet/modules</ext-link>. These plots are similar to the preceding except that, potentially, more nodes are present in the module since the filtration procedures detailed above are applied in a different context (e.g. only the expression data in the module are considered here vs. the expression data for the entire network). The same scaling parameters as above are applied to the edges for visual clarity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Protein interaction network, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/a/g.ucla.edu/genenet/protein">https://sites.google.com/a/g.ucla.edu/genenet/protein</ext-link>. Nodes represent proteins and their colors represent the coexpression module assignments. Node size is equivalent to its degree. Here, the edge width conveys meaning and is helpful in interpreting the relationship between nodes. An edge is drawn between two nodes when the STRING database indicates a high confidence interaction (score ≥0.9) between them. Edge widths are the confidence score scaled by the product of the origin and target node’s intramodular connectivities (kIN). Thus, thick edges indicate a high confidence protein level interaction between two genes that are well connected members of learning and singing related modules. Unlike the previous plots, a node’s size does not necessarily convey a higher degree of coexpression network importance. Instead, it indicates many interactions involving this protein described in the database. The thickness of the edges conveys influence of the gene’s biological importance, as interpreted through their kIN. Whether a node’s degree or the weight of its connections is the ultimate determinant of its relationship to vocal learning remains to be determined but the reader should keep the preceding information in mind when interpreting this network.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Accession information</title><p>Raw and processed RNA-seq and behavioral data for each bird are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>) at accession number GSE96843.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jennifer Morales and Maria Truong for their assistance in analyzing song and non-vocal behavior.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you see from detailed reviews, both reviewers appreciate your study, but raised substantial critiques that will take more than two months of work to address. As you may know, <italic>eLife</italic>'s policy of inviting a revision is that the authors should be able to return the revised manuscript that satisfactorily address reviewers' comments in about two months. We would be happy to consider a new submission of your manuscript in the future, should you be able to address these critiques. In addition to the initial reviews appended below, the reviewers provided additional guidance for improvement of the study, which I copy below:</p><p>The authors might consider one of the following trajectories:</p><p>a) Carrying out additional experiments to test whether any of the 'learning' networks normally are engaged during learning. For example, testing whether the levels of network expression co-vary with learning in unmanipulated birds. This is a significant enterprise that seems like it falls outside of the 'experiments that could be done in 2 months' criterion. However, it has the potential to show that networks identified in Area X and VSP through FOXP2 manipulation are actually relevant to normal developmental song learning. As I understand the authors' claims, a central prediction is that the 'learning networks' that they have identified are indeed relevant to normal function. I therefore think that this trajectory has the greatest likelihood of further substantiating the author's current conclusions. I think the results of such experiments are genuinely uncertain but, would not be surprised if the 'learning' networks identified in the current manuscript are not identified in an analysis of gene expression changes during normal learning (as opposed to being a signature for circuit damage/dysfunction driven by FOXP2 overexpression).</p><p>b) Reorienting their manuscript to focus more on what genes within and outside of learning circuitry are regulated/misregulated by FOXP2 isoforms, and potentially provide further insight into the regulatory action of FOXP2, and mechanistic insights into how this system contributes at a molecular level to organization of neural circuitry. In this orientation, abstract and manuscript would focus more on what does overexpression of different FOXP2 isoforms do, in terms of driving identifiable signatures in expression levels of downstream genes, as well as changes in gene networks. Per my thinking, these are potentially signatures of abnormalities associated with manipulations (or natural occurring mutations/misregulations) of FOXP2 function, and therefore have potential interest in shedding further insight into the mechanisms of FOXP2 regulation of gene expression and circuit function, independently of an ability to identify networks that are (for example) normally engaged during learning. I suspect that the authors might be able to reformulate their paper in this fashion with little or no additional data, and while I am open to other possibilities, it seems likely to me that there is a straighter conceptual line form the authors' experiments to this sort of formulation than to their current formulation. The one uncertainty I have about the authors' ability to reorient their paper in this fashion is the degree to which they can provide data from the experimental birds about the efficacy of viral manipulations (i.e. level of FOXP2 isoforms in each of their samples from manipulated and control birds). It isn't at all clear to me why the authors do not already have these data in hand, and what would impede an analysis of whether and how casual manipulations of FOXP2 isoforms drive changes to gene expression levels and gene networks. Indeed, some examination of these sorts of data regarding the efficacy and consequences of the experimental manipulations seems crucial whatever avenue the authors pursue. While it seems possible that the authors could follow this reformulation of their study with no additional experiments, it would reflect a sufficiently different approach from their current manuscript that it is hard to predict whether the authors could be successful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Previous work from this group and others has provided good evidence that Foxp2 plays a role in regulating both song learning in juvenile songbirds as well as song variability in adults. Considerable effort has been made in the field to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which Foxp2, particularly in the striatopallidal song nucleus Area X, influences song. This paper addresses two main questions: (1) How does the overexpression of two Foxp2 isoforms in Area X influence song learning and acute song features. (2) What gene co-expression patterns correlate with different singing and learning-related states, as generated by Foxp2 overexpression.</p><p>The authors' approach consisted of overexpressing three constructs via AAV injection into Area X of juvenile males: full-length Foxp2 (FoxP2.FL), a truncated naturally occurring isoform (FoxP2.10+) that lacks a DNA-binding domain, and a GFP control. These injections took place at 30 days post hatch, within the sensory and sensorimotor song learning periods. After 30 days song learning was assessed as tutor song similarity, and song variability was calculated as either song motif similarity across renditions or the change in the variability of song features (pitch, amplitude, etc.) after periods of free singing or sessions in which the bird was prevented from singing. The two Foxp2 isoforms were found to have separable effects on song learning and variability, with FoxP2.FL disrupting song learning and limiting song variability, and FoxP2.10+ having little effect on song learning but causing the characteristic song variability effect to shift in the opposite direction (i.e. instead of increasing after earlier undirected singing, variability decreased).</p><p>The authors extracted RNA from Area X and a control ventral striatopallidal (VSP) region of these birds, constructed and sequenced RNA-seq libraries from this RNA, then performed an extensive correlation-based gene expression network analysis using WGCNA. Consistent with previous work, they found several co-expression modules in Area X that correlate with amount of singing before euthanasia that they here term 'singing-related' modules, or sometimes 'song modules'. They also identify a few modules that correlate with the tutor song similarity termed 'learning-related' modules. Singing-related modules were not found independently in the VSP network or preserved from the Area X network in the VSP network. However, learning-related modules were preserved in VSP (but not found independently). Comparison to microarray Area X and VSP expression datasets from a previous study indicated that three of the song-related modules were preserved between juveniles and adults. In contrast, the authors find little preservation of the juvenile learning-related modules in adults. Finally, MAPK11, a Foxp2 target identified in mouse Foxp2 knockouts, is noted as the gene whose expression most strongly correlates with learning state and identification of a Foxp2 binding site in the promoter of zebra finch MAPK11 is given as additional evidence that this gene is a Foxp2 target in zebra finch.</p><p>As a whole, this work is an interesting look at how the genetic perturbation of different Foxp2 isoforms in the song system drives changes to song learning and variability. In addition, the RNA-seq dataset appears to be of high quality and offers an important glimpse into the expression patterns present in juvenile Area X and VSP under different genetic and behavioral states. The authors have also performed a great service in organizing this complex dataset and their network analyses into a readily accessible online format.</p><p>However, I have several major concerns about the analysis and especially the interpretation. The greatest issue is the interpretation of modules as 'learning related'.</p><p>I) There are a couple of ways to interpret the data showing correlations between a 'learning eigengene' and behavioral measures of learning:</p><p>1) Observed expression differences are due to direct action of Foxp2 isoform overexpression.</p><p>2) Expression differences are due to secondary effects from behavioral changes induced by Foxp2 OE.</p><p>It's the second interpretation the authors seem to rely on, using the molecular perturbation as a mechanism to generate behavioral diversity, possibly driving the system to extremes to better reveal underlying singing- and learning-related processes. This approach is potentially a powerful way to reveal mechanistic connections that may be undetectable by relying solely on natural variation in quality of learning and modulation of song variability. But it makes interpretability of a lot of the data difficult. For instance, assigning the label 'learning-related' to a given module seems uncertain given the learning-related effects are secondary to the manipulation. One could imagine a scenario in which FOXP2 overexpression drives some process that generally disrupts the functioning of Area X (for example a gross alteration in neuronal functioning, alteration in wiring, increase in apoptosis, etc.). Then we expect that learning will be impaired in proportion to disruption of Area X (since it is previously well established that damage of Area X impairs learning) and gene network analysis should detect networks associated with disruption and damage that do not necessarily relate to normal mechanisms of learning (such as apoptosis, microglia infiltration, axonal pruning, etc.). It would be incorrect in this scenario to conclude that the gene networks identified in this analysis are 'learning modules' rather than 'damage modules'. This seems to me to be a fundamental issue of interpretation for this study that significantly undermines the conclusions that the authors wish to draw.</p><p>Similarly, in the comparison between juveniles and adults, there is the argument the learning-related modules are present in both Area X and VSP in juveniles but in neither area of adults. However, in addition to age, a major difference between the groups is simply that juveniles have overexpression of Foxp2 isoforms while the adults are unmanipulated. This suggests that the observed effects might not be age-dependent but simply Foxp2 manipulated versus Foxp2 unmanipulated. The determination of whether FOXp2 isoforms are altered in VSP (as requested below), perhaps as a direct consequence of virus spillover into VSP, would aid in interpretation of these effects.</p><p>One compelling way to address the concerns expressed above would be to test whether the 'learning modules' identified under conditions of FOXP2 overexpression bear any resemblance to modules that are engaged during normal developmental learning. For example, within the GFP experimental group (or other control populations) there can be substantial variation in the quality of learning. If the authors could show that the learning modules identified in this study correlate with the quality of learning in control populations, that would go a long way towards substantiating the identity of these modules as learning related. Rather than carry out a full network analysis on additional birds that might be required to validate learning modules in control populations, the authors could alternatively analyze expression levels of a set of hub genes identified as part of the learning module.</p><p>More broadly, further analysis of the nature of expression changes driven by FOXP2 overexpression would be helpful in interpreting data.</p><p>a) It would be helpful to show a plot demonstrating the differential expression of FoxP2 in the overexpression conditions relative to the control GFP condition. Particularly informative would be separation of the two isoforms using reads mapped to distinguishing exons. This should be done for both Area X and VSP datasets to get a sense of how much overexpression there is in VSP. This point seems particularly important as the data from these analyses should reveal the effectiveness of the causal manipulations in the study, and aid in interpretation of learning effects and the links between modules and behavioral traits.</p><p>b) Also required is some form of differential expression analysis comparing Area X and VSP as well as Area X control versus overexpression conditions. Correlation-based network analysis can be an extremely effective tool in reducing the complexity of large expression datasets (as nicely shown here). But its use does not supplant the need for some basic understanding of what FoxP2 overexpression does to gene expression levels. This requirement is particularly germane with the manipulation of a transcription factor, which, if effective, should have direct effects on expression. Regarding the interpretation that there are learning modules in juvenile VSP and Area X that are absent in adults, it is especially important to establish whether viral infection has driven changes in FOXP2 expression in VSP, perhaps due to direct viral infection of that region. If FoxP2 overexpression is driven in VSP (as well as Area X) this would further accentuate concern that the 'learning module' detected in both VSP and Area X reflects direct consequences of overexpression in both of these regions, rather than processes in these regions that are specifically linked to learning.</p><p>c) For gene expression data it would be helpful to provide a plot showing sample distance determined from the expression data to give an indication of how well the replicate datasets are clustering. This could take the form of some sort of dimensionality reduction approach such MDS, PCA, or tSNE.</p><p>II) The analyses are complicated enough that I find it difficult to assess the validity of conclusions. While more analyses, presentation of statistics, and discussion has the potential to be persuasive, the most compelling way to validate the conclusions from the analysis of the FOXP2 manipulated birds is to show that the conclusions derived from the analyses accurately predict or inform findings in other settings. As outlined above, most compelling would be demonstration that the 'learning modules' identified under conditions of overexpression are also relevant to the normal juvenile song learning process. The MAPK11 analyses are also a start in the direction of demonstrating the utility of the network analysis, and if further supported would provide another way of validating the network structures identified in the study.</p><p>The authors find that MAPK11 expression is most strongly correlated with learning and is a Foxp2 target as determined in a mouse knockout study. However, this conclusion needs further support: identification of a single TFBS in a promoter can potentially not be that meaningful. For the analysis to be stronger, the following questions should be addressed:</p><p>What is the probability that this motif was found randomly?</p><p>Is the Foxp2 motif enriched in MAPK11 connected genes or learning-associated modules?</p><p>If you perform a standard differential expression analysis between control and Foxp2 conditions, do you find a consistent set of misregulated genes? Are these gene promoters enriched for Foxp2 motifs?</p><p>Additionally, the drawing of connections between MAPK11, ATF2, and H2B needs further support to be persuasive. This is especially apparent in the reasoning concerning H2B. Histone H2B is a core nucleosome component, constitutively expressed across tissues. Its post-translational modification has important roles in regulating transcription, but it's unclear if regulation of its expression per se has roles in modifying the expression of specific genes. The argument here is that H2B expression levels are modulated in response to singing due to the gene's inclusion in the blue network. The authors include a citation in support of this argument. However, the paper cited describes H2B acetylation differences in a learning paradigm and not expression differences, which would be the more direct comparison.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study examines the relationships between striatal expression of FOXP2 isoforms and vocal learning and variability in a songbird. This is an important contribution, in particular because this gene's involvement in vocal learning cannot be properly studied in models like mice, which lack this behavior. The study takes advantage of the knowledge on vocal learning and circuitry in finches and makes extensive use of weighted co-expression analysis across ages and basal ganglia subregions. It contributes novel data and insights, indicating that different gene sets are co-expressed in correlation with different states of singing or learning. It also points to novel relationships among genes, and candidates for mechanistic studies. The effort is a tour de force, the expression data are impressive, and the findings seem robust.</p><p>One issue is that the study does not provide direct evidence that the major variant examined, the short 10+ isoform, occurs endogenously in finch brain tissue. The fact that this variant transcript exists is not sufficient, as transcripts do not reliably reflect expression at protein level. Because this point is novel and central, the authors should consider options for demonstrating the endogenous occurrence of this protein isoform, such as mass spectrometry to detect the isoform's unique peptide or developing a specific antibody. The lack of direct evidence weakens a major underlying assumption of the study and will require toning down several statements about expression of that isoform and the implications for many of the datasets presented.</p><p>With regards to MAPK11, the authors' inference about the putative transcription start site (TSS) and promoter definition is likely incorrect. In silico predictions are often incomplete and need to be taken with caution in the absence of data like cDNAs with intact 5' caps, or primer extension assays. The orthologous MAPK11 RefSeq models from other species (chicken, mammals, <italic>Xenopus</italic>) do not map to the zebra finch genome for their first 100-200 nucleotides (readily verified with alignments in UCSC's genome browser). In fact, this 5' segment in other species corresponds to a first exon that maps several kb upstream of the second exon for this gene in the respective genomes (~12 kb in chicken, where the gene has 12 exons). Assuming the study was based on Ensembl's prediction in zebra finch (please indicate if otherwise), this first exon is not predicted: the model has only 11 exons and does not have a starting ATG, indicating 5' end incompleteness. A 5'-most exon, if found, would bring the exon number to 12 and likely lie several kb upstream (possibly in a gap) to the first exon of the Ensembl model. Thus, the authors have most likely not identified the correct TSS/promoter region for this gene in finch. Further, to assess the significance of the occurrence of any given DNA binding motif, an estimate of chance occurrences in the genome needs to be provided. In sum, the claims about the presence of a possible FOXP2 binding site(s) in promoter region of MAPK11 are not supported by the evidence provided.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;FoxP2 isoforms delineate spatiotemporal transcriptional networks for vocal learning in the zebra finch&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Erich D Jarvis (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We apologize for the time it took to get back to you. We have now received three reports: two original reviewers and one new reviewer. As you see from their detailed reviews, while they are in general supportive of this study, there are substantial remaining issues that need to be thoroughly addressed before the manuscript is acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. We want to emphasize that if there are substantial issues remained in a further revised manuscript, it will have to be rejected. Please take your time to do a thorough revision addressing as much as possible reviewers' critiques. Below is a list of the most important points, consensus from extensive discussions among the reviewers after they have all submitted their individual reviews.</p><p>1) As pointed out by reviewer 2 (the new reviewer), echoed by previous rounds of both reviewers 1 and 3 and remaining concern of reviewer 3, a major issue is whether your data provide unequivocal support to the notion that FoxP2 manipulations affect area X gene expression and gene network (a major claim of the manuscript that is reflected in the title). This 'learning network' is present in both control (GFP) and all animals combined and is generally correlated with tutor song similarity across groups, but there is no evidence that it or any other network was affected by the FoxP2 manipulations. Short of asking you to redo the experiment of analyzing gene expression in only virally transduced regions, you are strongly encouraged to dig further into the analyses comparing specific genes, including more qRT-PCR on control genes to find that maybe there is a viral FoxP2 manipulated gene expression signal in the Area X punches. If you cannot find gene expression changes due to FoxP2 manipulations, you should state clearly the results, substantially modify this part of the manuscript, including the title.</p><p>2) All reviewers expressed frustrations that much of the data and analyses you described in the rebuttal did not make into the revised manuscript. Please include useful materials in revised manuscript, at least in supplemental figures, so that readers can have additional perspectives.</p><p>3) You need to spell out more clearly in the revision (not just the rebuttal) where you did/did not correct for multiple comparisons and rationalization for including 'non-significant' correlations in further analysis.</p><p>4) Reviewer 3 has substantial concern whether the data allow you to claim that FoxP2 binds to in the MAPK11 promoter rather than intron. Calling it a regulatory region might be more appropriate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have revised the manuscript substantially, addressing several of the main issues that were previously raised. This includes a re-analysis of the 'learning-associated' module in control birds, as well as further data showing the endogenous expression of the truncated FOXP2 protein isoform and providing evidence for binding of FOXP2 binding to a predicted site in the MAPK11 candidate target gene. The authors also provided clarifications on several other important methodological and interpretation points. The manuscript is thus much stronger and better supported by the data.</p><p>Some concerns remain, however. The authors have not directly addressed the multiple comparisons and statistical significance. They acknowledge the issue in the rebuttal, but apparently have not made significant related adjustments in the paper, and still show all the correlations performed. Arguably the study lacked statistical power to perform all these multiple comparisons and correlations, given the sample size and the scope of the effort. The authors state, though, that some correlations were stronger and remained significant even after FDR corrections. Thus, perhaps a reasonable compromise would be to indicate which correlations survived the FDR correction, and suggest that others might be significant with a larger n and/or different design.</p><p>The effort to demonstrate FOXP2 binding to a predicted genome region is a very significant experimental result and considerably strengthens the paper, providing a plausible link between FOXP2 protein and MAPK11 as a likely target. However, the concern remains whether the authors have identified the 'promoter' region for MAPK11. As detailed below, some important lines of evidence question that assumption, as can be verified by examining genome alignments on a browser like UCSC's:</p><p>1) There is no expression evidence (cloned mRNAs/cDNAs with intact 5'UTRs, RNAseq maps, or data from a primer extension assay or equivalent), to verify the transcription start site (TSS) for this gene. Thus, the identification of the putative TSS relies solely on the position of the first exon predicted by the RefSeq model. This is worrisome as there are several gaps in the zebra finch genome upstream of the identified MAPK11 exons, and no confirmation that this RefSeq is complete.</p><p>2) The Ensembl model for zebra finch MAPK11 is longer than the RefSeq (Ensembl: 323 vs RefSeq: 285 residues), due to a longer N-terminus region, but it still does not contain a predicted starting ATG, further indicating that the RefSeq prediction for zebra finch MAPK11 is incomplete at the 5' end.</p><p>3) The chicken MAPK11 RefSeq (NM_001006227.1) is considerably longer than the zebra finch RefSeq (361 vs 285 predicted residues) and contains a predicted N-terminus peptide (MSERGGFYRQELNKTVWEVPQRYQNLTPVGSGAYGSVC) that maps to the chicken genome at ~12kb upstream of the second exon of chicken MAPK11. This peptide and corresponding exon position are well supported by chicken cloned mRNAs (e.g. AJ720776). This peptide is missing from the zebra finch MAPK11 RefSeq and does not map to the zebra finch genome, likely because of the gaps located ~13kb upstream of the first identified exon of zebra finch MAPK11 as predicted by Refseq or Ensembl (3 gaps between bp 19,659,000 and 19,665,000 on chr1A).</p><p>4) While the lack of alignment of the first chicken exon to the finch genome could be due to low conservation, the predicted N-terminus peptides of MAPK11 in at least 5 other songbird species (the closely related Bengalese finch, as well as starling, white-throated sparrow, great tit and Tibetan ground-tit) are practically identical to that in chicken, and similarly do not align to the zebra finch genome. However, the same N-terminus peptides in all these 5 songbird species align well to the chicken genome at the exact location of the 1st exon of chicken MAPK11. Further, this same N-terminus peptide from these birds is also present in MAPK11 in mouse and humans and aligns well at the position of the first exon, indicating its high conservation. This further strengthens the conclusion that the zebra finch RefSeq is incomplete at the 5' end and does not contain the first exon for MAPK11, and thus cannot be relied on to define the TSS for this gene in this species.</p><p>Rather than having identified the TSS and thus the promoter region for zebra finch MAPK11, it is much more likely that the authors' data provide evidence for FOXP2 binding at an internal, presumably intronic site. This is quite interesting in itself, and consistent with data from other genes and organisms that relevant transcription factor binding sites are not restricted to promoter regions. The author's interpretation that they have identified the promoter region for MAPK11 is less tenable without further data, as it would imply that this gene in zebra finches has a considerable truncation at its 5'-region, resulting in the loss of a N-terminus peptide that is conserved across vertebrates, including other closely related songbirds and mammals.</p><p>These issues should be acknowledged and the claim that the TSS/promoter has been identified needs to be toned down. It would also be helpful if the authors could deposit the sequence(s) identified in the ChIP assay for FOXP2 in GenBank, to allow for precise mapping onto the zebra finch genome.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I was asked to review the original version of this paper but could not at the time due to time constraints. However, I reviewed the revised version, and did so first without looking at the original version or the reviewer's comments on that version. So this represents a fresh view of the revised paper. I only looked over the prior reviews and reviewer comments afterwards.</p><p>I think the underlying question, experiments, and raw data generated in this manuscript is very good. This includes finding that 2 different isoforms of FoxP2 have different functions in the striatal song nucleus AreaX for song production and song learning, and that there are differences as well as overlaps in the song production and song learning gene regulatory networks of juveniles versus adults.</p><p>However, I see issues with the preparation of the paper, interpretations, and one of the important experiments on viral manipulation of gene expression as measured by RNASeq in Area X. For preparation, the manuscript is not presented clearly enough, causing confusion to the reader. Sometimes discussion is in the results and vice versa; figures are not explained well enough. For interpretations, an example is the words 'learning' and 'song', which are used too loosely, as opposed to 'song learning' and 'song production'. Another is the function of the VSP, with is mostly a motor area, but not explained. There are more of these examples highlighted in my specific comments below. The most worrying item is the RNASeq FoxP2 manipulation analyses. The authors skipped a step in the analyses in the paper, which is determining the differences of FoxP2 manipulation in the basal- and singing-driven gene expression of Area X. It looks like this might not be possible to do with their current data, because they punched biopsied of the entire Area X, and not the 25% of it that had the gene manipulation. They might have been able to see that 25% if they used a GFP marker under a fluorescent scope in their dissections of the tissue. What they did instead was group all the samples together (control and manipulated animals) and created a network expression analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, with the assumption that it is affected by the viral vector manipulations in Area X. One would hope that there is a partial affect from the 25% of cells of the manipulated Area X on the RNASeq data, and this can be tested. It took me some effort in re-reading to figure out what the authors did.</p><p>After reading the reviews, I see original reviewers 1 and 2 had the same concern, just maybe not expressed as clearly. In response to that concern, the authors did a GFP manipulated Area X only analyses and came up with the same results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> of the response letter). This is good and should be included in the main paper. However, they did not show network analyses of the viral FoxP2 manipulated animals, but instead show that clustering of expression does not differ between the GFP and FoxP2 manipulated Area X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig7">Author response image 7</xref> of response letter). So, if we take their analyses at face value, this would mean that the combined network analyses of control and FoxP2 manipulated animals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> of the manuscript may not be influenced by the FoxP2 manipulation, and instead is simply a control network similar to unmanipulated animals. This needs to be shown. Further, if it is not affected by the FoxP2 manipulations, then it is a flaw of the experimental design of the punch biopsy approach and the sentence, in subsection the “Gene modules in juvenile Area X that correlate to vocal behavior were enriched for communication and intellectual disability risk genes”: “We used RNA-seq to quantify gene transcription in Area X of 65d juveniles overexpressing GFP, FoxP2.FL or FoxP2.10+, then used WGCNA to identify gene co-expression modules and link them to song learning”). If a lack of a difference in control and FoxP2 manipulated animals is true, then I think the RNASeq experiments should be presented in another paper, because the potential FoxP2 manipulation would have been drowned out and this is still an interesting finding in the normal singing juvenile vs adult states. However, if a small affect is found in the noise of the 75% unmanipulated Area X, then that affect would belong in this paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors have been very responsive in their revisions and have made several key additions and clarifications that substantially improve the manuscript. Specific comments are included below regarding these main points. The residual issues raised below are ones that the authors should be able to address in Discussion section or with modest additional work.</p><p>1) Particularly nice is that they have found a correlation between the &quot;learning network&quot; and tutor song similarity for the GFP control group of birds. This significantly addresses one of my primary concerns in the initial submission regarding whether the network that was identified in FOXP2 manipulated birds would be present and correlated with learning in a control population. It is impressive that the green module was recovered in the GFP-only samples and that its correlation with tutor similarity was maintained. I find this result particularly interesting in conjunction with the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, showing that MAPK11 levels perfectly correlate with tutor similarity within virus conditions.</p><p>2) An important related addition is the PCR analysis of FOXP2 expression levels in ventral striatum. These data further support the authors contention that the presence of the learning network in both Area X and ventral striatum is not a direct result of the viral manipulations (spillover to ventral striatum) in both nuclei.</p><p>3) The further elaboration regarding MAPK11-ATF2-H2B potential link to learning is also a good addition that is more clearly grounded in previous work and seems less speculative.</p><p>4) Related to 3: the intent behind the FOXP2 ChIP experiments is excellent, and such data could potentially provide further support the authors' conclusions. However, to be compelling they would require two additions:</p><p>a) Presentation of qPCR instead of (non-quantitative) endpoint PCR data.b) Inclusion of at least 2 negative control regions to enhance the evidence for specificity (The IgG control is good but does not control for within-antibody noisiness).</p><p>I think the authors ought to be able to provide these additional data without too much additional work. If, however, this is problematic, an alternative would be to exclude these data and instead expand the bioinformatic analysis as suggested in the previous round of reviews to assess the statistical significance of the FOXP2 motif upstream of the MAPK11 TSS (I.e. to judge how likely this is by chance.)</p><p>5) The clustering analysis of the samples by their expression profiles is good and should be included in the text.</p><p>6) General Interpretation. The revised manuscript more firmly establishes an association between the 'green network' and tutor song similarity. This association rationalizes the use of 'learning network' to refer to the green network. However, the authors should be clear in their discussion of this association that these data are primarily correlative and the role of this network in learning per se remains speculative and a subject for future investigation. I think that the authors intend to make the point that the presence of this network in the VSP indicates that it may capture more general (not song specific) aspects of nervous system development or plasticity that correlate with song learning; if so, this could be made more explicit in Discussion section. Along those lines, it seems that such generalized changes could arise (and be correlated with tutor song similarity) in a variety of ways, which could reflect more or less direct involvement of this pathway in song learning. For example, both song learning and general ns development (captured by green network) might depend on a third variable (hormonal status, variation in neuromodulatory tone, social interactions and stimulation associated with effective tutor song experience, etc.). Indeed, it even seems possible that tutor song similarity achieved by different individuals itself feeds back to influence social and hormonal status of birds in ways that promote or inhibit more general aspects of nervous system development, or plasticity networks that could be captured by the green network. The authors need not belabor these points, but I think they would be well served to at least briefly discuss alternatives to the possibility that variation in the green network is tightly linked to, and is causally driving, variation in song learning (which is how the treatment currently reads to me). In this context, the mechanistic investigations of network identity/membership/function (e.g. MAPK11-ATF2-H2B) are nice in that they illustrate how candidate mechanisms can be identified through network analysis and begin to build a stronger case for specific mechanisms.</p><p>7) In general the authors addressed many issues in reasonable fashion in the rebuttal but for many of them did not address these points in the revision. In some cases the authors note that the requested analyses were not included in the revision because 'the results were negative', but in these cases a negative result is informative and effectively addresses potential concerns about interpretation of the primary data. Where these data (in rebuttal) address concerns raised by the reviewers they are also likely to be of interest to readers of the published manuscript, and as much as possible the authors would be well served to include most of these analyses in the revised manuscript – perhaps in supplementary material.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30649.056</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors might consider one of the following trajectories:</p><p>a) Carrying out additional experiments to test whether any of the 'learning' networks normally are engaged during learning. For example, testing whether the levels of network expression co-vary with learning in unmanipulated birds. This is a significant enterprise that seems like it falls outside of the 'experiments that could be done in 2 months' criterion. However, it has the potential to show that networks identified in Area X and VSP through FOXP2 manipulation are actually relevant to normal developmental song learning. As I understand the authors' claims, a central prediction is that the 'learning networks' that they have identified are indeed relevant to normal function. I therefore think that this trajectory has the greatest likelihood of further substantiating the author's current conclusions. I think the results of such experiments are genuinely uncertain but would not be surprised if the 'learning' networks identified in the current manuscript are not identified in an analysis of gene expression changes during normal learning (as opposed to being a signature for circuit damage/dysfunction driven by FOXP2 overexpression).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by both the editors and reviewers, we were able to use the existing data set to address ‘trajectory A’ and found that the ‘learning’ networks are indeed engaged during normal learning in our control animals. To do so, we constructed a gene co-expression network from only the 7 GFP control samples that made up a portion of the network presented in the manuscript (herein referred to as the ‘all-samples network; See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, below), then performed differential network analysis between the two networks.

The greatest issue is the interpretation of modules as 'learning related'.</p><p>I) There are a couple of ways to interpret the data showing correlations between a 'learning eigengene' and behavioral measures of learning:</p><p>1) Observed expression differences are due to direct action of Foxp2 isoform overexpression.</p><p>2) Expression differences are due to secondary effects from behavioral changes induced by Foxp2 OE.</p><p>It's the second interpretation the authors seem to rely on, using the molecular perturbation as a mechanism to generate behavioral diversity, possibly driving the system to extremes to better reveal underlying singing- and learning-related processes. This approach is potentially a powerful way to reveal mechanistic connections that may be undetectable by relying solely on natural variation in quality of learning and modulation of song variability. But it makes interpretability of a lot of the data difficult. For instance, assigning the label 'learning-related' to a given module seems uncertain given the learning-related effects are secondary to the manipulation. One could imagine a scenario in which FOXP2 overexpression drives some process that generally disrupts the functioning of Area X (for example a gross alteration in neuronal functioning, alteration in wiring, increase in apoptosis, etc.). Then we expect that learning will be impaired in proportion to disruption of Area X (since it is previously well established that damage of Area X impairs learning) and gene network analysis should detect networks associated with disruption and damage that do not necessarily relate to normal mechanisms of learning (such as apoptosis, microglia infiltration, axonal pruning, etc.). It would be incorrect in this scenario to conclude that the gene networks identified in this analysis are 'learning modules' rather than 'damage modules'. This seems to me to be a fundamental issue of interpretation for this study that significantly undermines the conclusions that the authors wish to draw.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we appreciate the reviewer's sentiment that our approach has the potential to be 'a powerful way to reveal mechanistic connections.' With regard to the second interpretation, that our intervention led to damage, we offer the following three broad arguments. First, we failed to point out that the behavioural changes seen here are vastly different than those induced by damage to Area X. As shown by Scharff and Nottebohm, 1991), damage to Area X leads to high sequence entropy and longer syllables, neither of which were observed here. Rather, like Haesler et al., (2010) who knocked down FoxP2, and Heston et al., (2015) in which we overexpressed FoxP2, we found incomplete syllable copying, poor syllable copying and feature specific errors. Moreover, birds in both this study, our prior one, and in Haesler et al. were still able to change their songs over development. They were just unable to match them to the tutor. We have added language to address this point in subsection “Virus-mediated overexpression of FoxP2 isoforms affected song learning and/or vocal variability” in the fourth paragraph and present below a learning trajectory curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>) where birds’ songs throughout the song learning period are compared to their ~65d song instead of the tutor’s. We opt not to include these data as a figure in the manuscript because the results are negative and the findings have been presented in the manuscripts mentioned above.</p><fig id="respfig4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30649.045</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Learning trajectories demonstrate that birds’ songs change over song development.</title><p>Learning trajectory is calculated by quantifying acoustic similarity between birds’ songs over the course of the experiment and their song on the day of sacrifice (~65d). Upward trajectory indicates the songs for all three virus groups change over time. In agreement with the work of Heston &amp; White, (2015), the FoxP2.FL group’s (black) song changes over time but, as illustrated in main text <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, not to match the tutor’s song.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30649-resp-fig4-v3"/></fig><p>Second, if disruption and damage had occurred, we might not have expected to recover the song modules, presented in main text <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. As the reviewer notes below, song modules were originally identified in adult birds that were unmanipulated (Hilliard et al., 2012). Their preservation in our study, conducted using a different platform, years later, in different animals at a different age and by different experimentalists provides support that Area X was not grossly aberrant.</p><p>Third, the work of Heston &amp; White, (2015) using identical viruses and injection volumes revealed no abnormal histology in the striatopallidum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, in the comparison between juveniles and adults, there is the argument the learning-related modules are present in both Area X and VSP in juveniles but in neither area of adults. However, in addition to age, a major difference between the groups is simply that juveniles have overexpression of Foxp2 isoforms while the adults are unmanipulated. This suggests that the observed effects might not be age-dependent but simply Foxp2 manipulated versus Foxp2 unmanipulated. The determination of whether FOXp2 isoforms are altered in VSP (as requested below), perhaps as a direct consequence of virus spillover into VSP, would aid in interpretation of these effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We note the preservation of song module genes between manipulated and unmanipulated animals mentioned above. In response to the reviewer's request here and below, we investigated whether or not FoxP2 isoforms were upregulated in outlying VSP. Using the same qRT-PCR protocol that was sufficient to detect overexpression of the FoxP2 isoforms in Area X samples and presented in main text <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, we observed no significant difference in FoxP2 level across virus groups with either primer set in the VSP samples (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref>, below). We have added language to this extent in the Results section.

The green module’s co-expression pattern exists in birds injected with only the GFP control virus construct and is strongly and positively correlated to learning behavior in those animals. The green module also exists in the VSP samples from all of the birds in the study, a region which does not show signs of FoxP2 overexpression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One compelling way to address the concerns expressed above would be to test whether the 'learning modules' identified under conditions of FOXP2 overexpression bear any resemblance to modules that are engaged during normal developmental learning. For example, within the GFP experimental group (or other control populations) there can be substantial variation in the quality of learning. If the authors could show that the learning modules identified in this study correlate with the quality of learning in control populations, that would go a long way towards substantiating the identity of these modules as learning related. Rather than carry out a full network analysis on additional birds that might be required to validate learning modules in control populations, the authors could alternatively analyze expression levels of a set of hub genes identified as part of the learning module.</p></disp-quote><p>The presence of the learning modules in the GFP control birds, detailed above, addresses this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More broadly, further analysis of the nature of expression changes driven by FOXP2 overexpression would be helpful in interpreting data.</p><p>a) It would be helpful to show a plot demonstrating the differential expression of FoxP2 in the overexpression conditions relative to the control GFP condition. Particularly informative would be separation of the two isoforms using reads mapped to distinguishing exons. This should be done for both Area X and VSP datasets to get a sense of how much overexpression there is in VSP. This point seems particularly important as the data from these analyses should reveal the effectiveness of the causal manipulations in the study, and aid in interpretation of learning effects and the links between modules and behavioral traits.</p></disp-quote><p>With regard to differential FoxP2 overexpression, we refer to the reviewer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> in which qRT-PCR was used to quantify FoxP2 transcript levels in Area X as a function of viral construct (i.e. GFP, FoxP2.FL, and FoxP2.10+) and compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref> (above) where no overexpression is evident in VSP.</p><p>The sequencing data alone do not demonstrate overexpression of the FoxP2 isoforms. Quantification of the cells infected at the injection site using the identical procedures to ours here (see Heston &amp; White, 2015) indicates 20-25% of cells, the majority of which are FoxP2+ medium spiny neurons, are infected by the virus. Therefore, in our Area X samples, 70-75% of the medium spiny neurons are not overexpressing FoxP2. This presents a challenging situation: a clear and reproducible behavioral effect is observed with the virus manipulation, but the transcriptional basis for it is only visible in the qRT-PCR data presumably due to the amplification required to overcome a low signal-to-noise ratio.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Also required is some form of differential expression analysis comparing Area X and VSP as well as Area X control versus overexpression conditions. Correlation-based network analysis can be an extremely effective tool in reducing the complexity of large expression datasets (as nicely shown here). But its use does not supplant the need for some basic understanding of what FoxP2 overexpression does to gene expression levels. This requirement is particularly germane with the manipulation of a transcription factor, which, if effective, should have direct effects on expression. Regarding the interpretation that there are learning modules in juvenile VSP and Area X that are absent in adults, it is especially important to establish whether viral infection has driven changes in FOXP2 expression in VSP, perhaps due to direct viral infection of that region. If FoxP2 overexpression is driven in VSP (as well as Area X) this would further accentuate concern that the 'learning module' detected in both VSP and Area X reflects direct consequences of overexpression in both of these regions, rather than processes in these regions that are specifically linked to learning.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree regarding the necessity to present detailed differential expression analyses between Area X and VSP. In this study and in our prior work (Hilliard et al., 2012), differential expression between Area X and VSP are presented directly adjacent to figures plotting differential connectivity (see main text <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Our data indicate that a gene’s regionality and/or relevance to behavior is captured more effectively by considering its transcriptional context (i.e. connectivity) through network analysis instead of through changes in absolute expression level. Moreover, our expression data will be made available through GEO upon the manuscript’s publication so that interested parties can conduct differential expression analyses.</p><p>As indicated above, we find no evidence of FoxP2 overexpression in VSP either by: (1) <italic>in situ</italic> analysis, (2) examination of RNA-seq data from VSP punches, or (3) now in response to the Reviewer, qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref>, above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) For gene expression data it would be helpful to provide a plot showing sample distance determined from the expression data to give an indication of how well the replicate datasets are clustering.

This is likely the product of a fairly subtle manipulation (&lt;25% cellular transduction), noted above. Further, as described in this manuscript and our prior work (Hilliard et al., 2012), the act of singing has a dramatic effect on the transcriptome, correlating with changes in expression of thousands of genes. The animals in this study sang across a wide continuum (0 to ~1900 motifs) in the two hours immediately preceding sacrifice. Thus, our study does have biological replicates within the virus groups, but there are no replicates for singing since the animals were allowed to sing ad libitum before sacrifice. This variability is ideal for gene network analysis but creates the situation where a virus by singing interaction may occur, driving the clustering pattern we observe here.</p><fig id="respfig6"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30649.047</object-id><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>The intersample correlation (y-axis) delineates a clear split between Area X samples (green) and VSP samples (red).</title><p>One VSP sample (White383V) clustered with the Area X samples but was not included in the Area X network.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30649-resp-fig6-v3"/></fig><fig id="respfig7"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30649.048</object-id><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>The intersample correlation for the Area X samples does not clearly delineate clusters by virus construct.</title><p>Virus construct is indicated in green (GFP), black (FoxP2.FL), and red (FoxP2.10+).

While more analyses, presentation of statistics, and discussion has the potential to be persuasive, the most compelling way to validate the conclusions from the analysis of the FOXP2 manipulated birds is to show that the conclusions derived from the analyses accurately predict or inform findings in other settings. As outlined above, most compelling would be demonstration that the 'learning modules' identified under conditions of overexpression are also relevant to the normal juvenile song learning process. The MAPK11 analyses are also a start in the direction of demonstrating the utility of the network analysis, and if further supported would provide another way of validating the network structures identified in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the most compelling demonstration is to find the ‘learning modules’ in normal juvenile birds. Thanks to the reviewer’s point which was shared with the other reviews, this has now been demonstrated using birds injected with the GFP-expressing virus. Going further and as also requested, we present new data from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicating that FoxP2 binds the MAPK11 promoter, providing a mechanistic basis for a prediction made by our network data. The results of these experiments have been added to the main text in the subsection “A bioinformatics approach indicates MAPK11 as an entry point to neuromolecular networks for vocal learning” and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. The methods for these experiments have been added to the Materials and methods section of the manuscript. It is our hope that by publishing the manuscript we can share the dataset with the scientific community enabling additional follow up on the highlighted pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors find that MAPK11 expression is most strongly correlated with learning and is a Foxp2 target as determined in a mouse knockout study. However, this conclusion needs further support: identification of a single TFBS in a promoter can potentially not be that meaningful. For the analysis to be stronger, the following questions should be addressed:</p><p>What is the probability that this motif was found randomly?</p><p>Is the Foxp2 motif enriched in MAPK11 connected genes or learning-associated modules?</p><p>If you perform a standard differential expression analysis between control and Foxp2 conditions, do you find a consistent set of misregulated genes? Are these gene promoters enriched for Foxp2 motifs?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer's queries, we conducted a direct functional test of the predicted interaction between FoxP2 and MapK11. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we used a cocktail of anti-FoxP2 antibodies to pull down FoxP2 bound to fragmented chromatin. Upon isolating the fragments, we performed RT-PCR using primers for MapK11. As predicted by our study, the fragment corresponding to MapK11 that encompasses the transcription binding site was identified. This data has been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> as Panel D and is now included in subsection “A bioinformatics approach indicates MAPK11 as an entry point to neuromolecular networks for vocal learning”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the drawing of connections between MAPK11, ATF2, and H2B needs further support to be persuasive. This is especially apparent in the reasoning concerning H2B. Histone H2B is a core nucleosome component, constitutively expressed across tissues. Its post-translational modification has important roles in regulating transcription, but it's unclear if regulation of its expression per se has roles in modifying the expression of specific genes. The argument here is that H2B expression levels are modulated in response to singing due to the gene's inclusion in the blue network. The authors include a citation in support of this argument. However, the paper cited describes H2B acetylation differences in a learning paradigm and not expression differences, which would be the more direct comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>Remarkably, in experiments conducted in <italic>Aplysia</italic> more than ten years ago, Kandel, Schwartz and colleagues proposed that the pathway from MAPK11 to histone acetylation via phosphorylated ATF2 mediates short and long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in addition to epigenetic changes. Moreover, mice expressing the Foxp2 mutation that disrupts language in affected KE family members perform poorly on a wheel running task compared with controls. This task relies on striatal LTD. Accordingly, LTD is deficient in these mice, and the dendrites on medium spiny neurons are reduced (Groszer et al., 2008). Conversely, mice that express the normal human FoxP2 isoform exhibit enhanced sensorimotor learning, enhanced LTD, and increased dendritic spines on MSNs (Enard et al., 2009; Schreiweis et al., 2014). LTD within Area X is one of the few forms of synaptic plasticity demonstrated in song control circuitry (Ding et al., 2003). Together with our network data, these observations link FoxP2 to altered Area X function via a broadly conserved pathway for learning and memory. We now cite that publication (Guan et al., 2003) in addition to citing the rodent learning and memory work regarding an interaction between MAPK11, ATF2 and H2B.</p><p>Still, we appreciate the point that the reviewer is making: we cite prior evidence that indicates the protein-level interaction between ATF2 and H2B is the driver for a learning behavior. Our own data indicate that H2B expression is positively correlated to singing but we do not present evidence supporting its acetylation being related to learning in our animals. This speaks to a point we make in the Discussion section and in main text <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and 8. Gene co-expression does not indicate functional interaction between proteins. Our statements regarding the acetylation of histone H2B are a hypothesis about an interaction that is underlying vocal learning that is based upon the combination of prior work in other model systems and what our network data suggest to be relevant. The interaction between ATF2 and H2B serves as the functional link between “do singing” and “do learning” co-expression that co-occur in 65d and not adult Area X. We use this principle to guide the construction of the protein interaction network presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and generate hypotheses en-masse. There are multiple other pathways in our protein interaction network analogous to ATF2 and HISTH2B, where a well-connected member of a learning module interacts with a singing related gene. The advantage of using networks to guide the interpretation of transcriptomic data is clear here: The prioritization of nodes by their network position allows for molecules with no a priorirelationship to a trait to ‘rise to the top’ and reveal themselves as worthwhile targets for investigation. Our data-sharing plan is to make these interactions publicly available upon publication of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This study examines the relationships between striatal expression of FOXP2 isoforms and vocal learning and variability in a songbird. This is an important contribution, in particular because this gene's involvement in vocal learning cannot be properly studied in models like mice, which lack this behavior. The study takes advantage of the knowledge on vocal learning and circuitry in finches and makes extensive use of weighted co-expression analysis across ages and basal ganglia subregions. It contributes novel data and insights, indicating that different gene sets are co-expressed in correlation with different states of singing or learning. It also points to novel relationships among genes, and candidates for mechanistic studies.

The fact that this variant transcript exists is not sufficient, as transcripts do not reliably reflect expression at protein level. Because this point is novel and central, the authors should consider options for demonstrating the endogenous occurrence of this protein isoform, such as mass spectrometry to detect the isoform's unique peptide or developing a specific antibody. The lack of direct evidence weakens a major underlying assumption of the study and will require toning down several statements about expression of that isoform and the implications for many of the datasets presented.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s query, we now provide evidence in the form of an immunoblot that indicates endogenous expression of the truncated FoxP2 isoform in zebra finch. Briefly, 5 or 10 ug of adult whole brain homogenate were probed with an antibody against the N-terminus of FoxP2 (ProteinTech Cat. No. 20529-1-AP). Bands are revealed at ~72kDa, reflecting the fulllength isoform, and at ~55kDa reflecting the truncated form.

In silico predictions are often incomplete and need to be taken with caution in the absence of data like cDNAs with intact 5' caps, or primer extension assays. The orthologous MAPK11 RefSeq models from other species (chicken, mammals, Xenopus) do not map to the zebra finch genome for their first 100-200 nucleotides (readily verified with alignments in UCSC's genome browser). In fact, this 5' segment in other species corresponds to a first exon that maps several kb upstream of the second exon for this gene in the respective genomes (~12 kb in chicken, where the gene has 12 exons). Assuming the study was based on Ensembl's prediction in zebra finch (please indicate if otherwise), this first exon is not predicted: the model has only 11 exons and does not have a starting ATG, indicating 5' end incompleteness. A 5'-most exon, if found, would bring the exon number to 12 and likely lie several kb upstream (possibly in a gap) to the first exon of the Ensembl model. Thus, the authors have most likely not identified the correct TSS/promoter region for this gene in finch. Further, to assess the significance of the occurrence of any given DNA binding motif, an estimate of chance occurrences in the genome needs to be provided. In sum, the claims about the presence of a possible FOXP2 binding site(s) in promoter region of MAPK11 are not supported by the evidence provided.</p></disp-quote><p>In the subsections “A bioinformatics approach indicates MAPK11 as an entry point to neuromolecular networks for vocal learning” and “Transcription Factor Binding Site Analysis”, we define the promoter region as the first 1000 bases upstream of the transcription start site, as defined by RefSeq.

We agree that in silico validations need to be interpreted with caution, so in response to this concern, and to a related concern of reviewer 1, above, we conducted a direct functional test of the predicted interaction between FoxP2 and the MAPK11 promoter.

This 'learning network' is present in both control (GFP) and all animals combined and is generally correlated with tutor song similarity across groups, but there is no evidence that it or any other network was affected by the FoxP2 manipulations. Short of asking you to redo the experiment of analyzing gene expression in only virally transduced regions, you are strongly encouraged to dig further into the analyses comparing specific genes, including more qRT-PCR on control genes to find that maybe there is a viral FoxP2 manipulated gene expression signal in the Area X punches.

The manuscript is thus much stronger and better supported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 1 for his/her positive comments about the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some concerns remain, however. The authors have not directly addressed the multiple comparisons and statistical significance. They acknowledge the issue in the rebuttal, but apparently have not made significant related adjustments in the paper, and still show all the correlations performed. Arguably the study lacked statistical power to perform all these multiple comparisons and correlations, given the sample size and the scope of the effort. The authors state, though, that some correlations were stronger and remained significant even after FDR corrections. Thus, perhaps a reasonable compromise would be to indicate which correlations survived the FDR correction, and suggest that others might be significant with a larger n and/or different design.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this concern and as suggested by reviewer 3, we have denoted in the figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> that we present uncorrected p-values, then direct the reader to subsection “Correlation of Gene Expression to Behavior” wherein we provide rationale for our statistical approach, summarizing what was said in response to the first comment made by reviewer 2 (now reviewer 1) in the previous review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Rather than having identified the TSS and thus the promoter region for zebra finch MAPK11, it is much more likely that the authors' data provide evidence for FOXP2 binding at an internal, presumably intronic site. This is quite interesting in itself, and consistent with data from other genes and organisms that relevant transcription factor binding sites are not restricted to promoter regions. The author's interpretation that they have identified the promoter region for MAPK11 is less tenable without further data, as it would imply that this gene in zebra finches has a considerable truncation at its 5'-region, resulting in the loss of a N-terminus peptide that is conserved across vertebrates, including other closely related songbirds and mammals. These issues should be acknowledged and the claim that the TSS/promoter has been identified needs to be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 1 for this thoughtful analysis and presentation of the data and agree that we have not provided sufficient evidence to suggest that we are looking at the zebra finch MAPK11 promoter region. In this revision, we have removed such claims, acknowledged that the RefSeq model for zebra finch MAPK11 is likely incomplete, and suggested that we are perhaps viewing a regulatory region within MAPK11 that is bound by FoxP2 instead of the promoter. We now refer to this region as the “promoter”, quotes included. Finally, we have added a new subsection ‘MAPK11 Annotation Note’ summarizing these helpful comments in the Materials and methods section and referenced it in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also be helpful if the authors could deposit the sequence(s) identified in the ChIP assay for FOXP2 in GenBank, to allow for precise mapping onto the zebra finch genome.</p></disp-quote><p>We sequenced a genomic fragment that was pulled down by FoxP2 ChIP and found it aligned well with the NCBI sequence for MAPK11. We provide that sequence here as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. The sequence is less than 200bp and thus GenBank will not accept it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I was asked to review the original version of this paper but could not at the time due to time constraints. However, I reviewed the revised version, and did so first without looking at the original version or the reviewer's comments on that version. So this represents a fresh view of the revised paper. I only looked over the prior reviews and reviewer comments afterwards.</p><p>I think the underlying question, experiments, and raw data generated in this manuscript is very good. This includes finding that 2 different isoforms of FoxP2 have different functions in the striatal song nucleus AreaX for song production and song learning, and that there are differences as well as overlaps in the song production and song learning gene regulatory networks of juveniles versus adults.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate Dr. Jarvis’s fresh perspective on the paper and positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, I see issues with the preparation of the paper, interpretations, and one of the important experiments on viral manipulation of gene expression as measured by RNASeq in Area X. For preparation, the manuscript is not presented clearly enough, causing confusion to the reader. Sometimes discussion is in the results and vice versa; figures are not explained well enough. For interpretations, an example is the words 'learning' and 'song', which are used too loosely, as opposed to 'song learning' and 'song production'.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point and have tried to clarify our use of the words ‘learning’ and ‘song’ throughout the manuscript. For example, we now refer to the ‘song-related’ modules as ‘song production’ modules since their co-expression patterns correlate with the amount of singing. When viewed strictly in Area X, the modules referred to as “learning” modules could be described as “song learning” modules, as the reviewer suggests, since their co-expression patterns correlate with song learning; a key finding of the paper. However, since these co-expression patterns exist outside of Area X, referring to them in that context as “song learning” modules may not be entirely accurate. We thus now refer to them as ‘learning-related’ modules throughout the manuscript. We hypothesize that in VSP, these ‘learning-related’ co-expression patterns underlie non-vocal motor learning and/or general plasticity. In line with this idea, we videotaped animals on the morning of sacrifice and used an observer to score the non-vocal behaviors. We did not find any correlation between these behaviors and gene expression patterns in the outlying VSP. We hypothesize that this is because none of those non-vocal behaviors were being actively learned.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another is the function of the VSP, with is mostly a motor area, but not explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that we did not define VSP early in the paper. This is now remedied in subsection “Virus-mediated overexpression of FoxP2 isoforms affects song learning and/or vocal variability”. We have also added reference to Reiner et al., 2004 in subsection “Virus-mediated overexpression of FoxP2 isoforms affects song learning and/or vocal variability”. For context about the function of VSP, we rely on the work of Pfenning et al., (2014) and, more specifically, Feenders et al., (2008) which provide foundational evidence for the function of these regions, including VSP, directly adjacent to song control nuclei as being the neural substrates for non-vocal movement-associated pathways. These publications are cited in the reference section of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are more of these examples highlighted in my specific comments below. The most worrying item is the RNASeq FoxP2 manipulation analyses. The authors skipped a step in the analyses in the paper, which is determining the differences of FoxP2 manipulation in the basal- and singing-driven gene expression of Area X. It looks like this might not be possible to do with their current data, because they punched biopsied of the entire Area X, and not the 25% of it that had the gene manipulation. They might have been able to see that 25% if they used a GFP marker under a fluorescent scope in their dissections of the tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that specific dissection of virus-infected cells marked by a GFP reporter could alleviate signal-to-noise problems. To achieve long-lasting overexpression of FoxP2, however, we used an AAV1 vector with a limited cloning capacity (~5 kb). In experiments not presented in this manuscript, viruses that expressed both FoxP2 and GFP separated by a P2A sequence, which reached 99.5% of the virus’s cloning capacity, yielded poor expression of the gene product and would have been useless for the behavioral experiments. In order to drive overexpression of FoxP2 to behaviorally relevant levels, our AAV1 vector had no tag on the FoxP2 transcript itself, making infected cells visually indistinguishable from uninfected cells.</p><p>Given that a single amino acid alteration in human FOXP2 leads to a severe speech and language disorder, we opted not to otherwise tag the zebra finch FoxP2 sequence that was inserted into the virus, avoiding any concern about altered function due to altered sequence. Another benefit of the construct was that it is the same as that used by Heston et al., (2015) enabling comparison and validation across studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What they did instead was group all the samples together (control and manipulated animals) and created a network expression analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, with the assumption that it is affected by the viral vector manipulations in Area X. One would hope that there is a partial affect from the 25% of cells of the manipulated Area X on the RNASeq data, and this can be tested. It took me some effort in re-reading to figure out what the authors did.</p><p>After reading the reviews, I see original reviewers 1and 2 had the same concern, just maybe not expressed as clearly. In response to that concern, the authors did a GFP manipulated Area X only analyses and came up with the same results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> of the response letter). This is good and should be included in the main paper.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have added the GFP-only network analysis to the main paper as (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Module preservation statistics indicate co-expression patterns that are distinct from the other construct-specific networks. This finding supports our claim of construct-specific gene co-expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, they did not show network analyses of the viral FoxP2 manipulated animals, but instead show that clustering of expression does not differ between the GFP and FoxP2 manipulated Area X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig7">Author response image 7</xref> of response letter). So, if we take their analyses at face value, this would mean that the combined network analyses of control and FoxP2 manipulated animals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> of the manuscript may not be influenced by the FoxP2 manipulation, and instead is simply a control network similar to unmanipulated animals. This needs to be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to the GFP network, we now include individual network analyses for the FoxP2.FL and FoxP2.10+ groups. These are now included in the main paper as (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> to Figure 1—figure supplement 5). The key findings are:</p><p>1) Differential network analyses across the two FoxP2 (FoxP2.FL and FoxP2.10+) and GFP networks reveal a spectrum of module preservation with some modules being highly preserved across the three groups and others being poorly preserved. Notably, the green learning-related module is well-preserved across all groups. Birds in these experimental conditions were siblings, and in some cases from the same clutch, suggesting that the driving effect of network differences is the construct-specific manipulation.</p><p>2) The green learning-related module is preserved across the GFP and both FoxP2 networks and shows a strong correlation to learning (that passes FDR correction) in the GFP network.</p><p>These new observations have been added to the Results section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, if it is not affected by the FoxP2 manipulations, then it is a flaw of the experimental design of the punch biopsy approach and the sentence, in subsection the “Gene modules in juvenile Area X that correlate to vocal behavior were enriched for communication and intellectual disability risk genes”: “We used RNA-seq to quantify gene transcription in Area X of 65d juveniles overexpressing GFP, FoxP2.FL or FoxP2.10+, then used WGCNA to identify gene co-expression modules and link them to song learning”). If a lack of a difference in control and FoxP2 manipulated animals is true, then I think the RNASeq experiments should be presented in another paper, because the potential FoxP2 manipulation would have been drowned out and this is still an interesting finding in the normal singing juvenile vs adult states. However, if a small affect is found in the noise of the 75% unmanipulated Area X, then that affect would belong in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to the construct-specific network analyses noted above and presented in the present revision of this manuscript that indicate FoxP2 isoforms are altering gene co-expression patterns in Area X, we have shown in the main text that our FoxP2 viruses:</p><p>1) Differentially affect behavior, specifically vocal learning (FoxP2.FL) or variability-induction (FoxP2.10+) relative to birds injected with the GFP-expressing construct.</p><p>2) Drive overexpression of their specific isoforms, as assessed by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; recently replicated in a new time-course study; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig8">Author response image 8</xref> below).</p><p>3) Drive overexpression of their specific isoforms, as assessed by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, we did recover overexpression of GFP in the group of birds that received the GFP construct in our RNA-seq data. The lack of significant increases in FoxP2 expression in birds that received FoxP2 constructs (which only differ from the GFP construct in the inserted sequence: GFP versus FoxP2.FL versus FoxP2.10+) in the RNA seq data may be due to: (1) Weaker signal-to-noise (as construct-driven overexpression lies on top of endogenous, changing FoxP2 levels; which is not the case for GFP); (2) Insufficient sample size; (3) Poor sensitivity of RNA-seq vs. qPCR, and/or 4) in vivo-down regulation of endogenous FoxP2 to compensate for exogenously-driven levels.</p><p>To check for the latter possibility, we conducted a new time course study. As in the original study, young birds were injected with the FoxP2.FL overexpressing construct at ~30 days of age. They were then sacrificed (in the morning at lights on, before any singing) at 10-day intervals up to ~60 days of age. Area X was again micro-punched and FoxP2 levels were measured by qRT-PCR. Compared with uninjected age-matched controls, we found significant elevation of FoxP2 levels in Area X (blue bars in the below graph) at 10, 20 and 30 days post-injection including at the ~60 day old time point. This argues against endogenous down-regulation (#4 above). As in the original manuscript, no significant elevation of FoxP2 levels was observed in outlying VSP (yellow bars in the below graph). In sum, this confirmatory result conducted on 3 birds per time point/condition replicates our prior qRT-PCR analysis and shows significantly elevated FoxP2 transcript expression in birds that receive the FoxP2- construct relative to uninjected controls.</p><fig id="respfig8"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30649.049</object-id><label>Author response image 8.</label><caption><title>FoxP2 expression in Area X is elevated for up to 30 days following AAV-FoxP2 injection.</title><p>Juvenile birds (~30d) were injected with our FoxP2 overexpressing construct, bilaterally into Area X.

In contrast, the qRT-PCR analysis was sensitive enough to detect overexpression in both the original samples and now in new samples, despite a low sample size and ~25% transfection rate.</p><p>In preparation of this manuscript, we considered the possibility of presenting these data as two separate manuscripts, one in which we discuss the behavior and the other in which we discuss the gene expression data. Rather than do so, we reasoned that a great strength of our approach lies in linking gene expression with behavior. Indeed, behavior guides the focus on and interpretation of the network modules. For example, based on network analysis alone (not considering behavior) the green learning-related module is densely interconnected and of great network importance in this study. We strongly feel, however, that what is really exciting is its correlation with learning in juveniles. This gene-behavior link provides key context for understanding its poor preservation in adulthood.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors have been very responsive in their revisions and have made several key additions and clarifications that substantially improve the manuscript. Specific comments are included below regarding these main points. The residual issues raised below are ones that the authors should be able to address in Discussion section or with modest additional work.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewer 3’s enthusiasm for the updated manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Particularly nice is that they have found a correlation between the &quot;learning network&quot; and tutor song similarity for the GFP control group of birds. This significantly addresses one of my primary concerns in the initial submission regarding whether the network that was identified in FOXP2 manipulated birds would be present and correlated with learning in a control population. It is impressive that the green module was recovered in the GFP-only samples and that its correlation with tutor similarity was maintained. I find this result particularly interesting in conjunction with the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, showing that MAPK11 levels perfectly correlate with tutor similarity within virus conditions.</p><p>2) An important related addition is the PCR analysis of FOXP2 expression levels in ventral striatum. These data further support the authors contention that the presence of the learning network in both Area X and ventral striatum is not a direct result of the viral manipulations (spillover to ventral striatum) in both nuclei.</p><p>3) The further elaboration regarding MAPK11-ATF2-H2B potential link to learning is also a good addition that is more clearly grounded in previous work and seems less speculative.</p><p>4) Related to 3: the intent behind the FOXP2 ChIP experiments is excellent, and such data could potentially provide further support the authors' conclusions. However, to be compelling they would require two additions:</p><p>a) Presentation of qPCR instead of (non-quantitative) endpoint PCR data.b) Inclusion of at least 2 negative control regions to enhance the evidence for specificity (The IgG control is good but does not control for within-antibody noisiness).</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the ChIP-qPCR as requested including two negative controls, β actin and 3000 bp upstream of Cntnap2. β actin was chosen based on previous FoxP2 ChIP-chip experiments in embryonic mice (Vernes et al., 2011). FoxP2 has been shown to bind to the promoter region of Cntnap2 (Adam et al., 2017), thus moving further upstream from the promoter region was determined as a negative control to demonstrate proper sonication fragment length as well as a region close to a known binding site. These negative controls show the specificity of our antibody pull down. Additionally, qPCR data highlighting our proposed FoxP2 binding motif is shown by the MAPK11 primers. We chose to show the primers covering the region of the binding motif and the adjacent regions.

If, however, this is problematic, an alternative would be to exclude these data and instead expand the bioinformatic analysis as suggested in the previous round of reviews to assess the statistical significance of the FOXP2 motif upstream of the MAPK11 TSS (I.e. to judge how likely this is by chance.)</p><p>5) The clustering analysis of the samples by their expression profiles is good and should be included in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) General Interpretation. The revised manuscript more firmly establishes an association between the 'green network' and tutor song similarity. This association rationalizes the use of 'learning network' to refer to the green network. However, the authors should be clear in their discussion of this association that these data are primarily correlative and the role of this network in learning per se remains speculative and a subject for future investigation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the first paragraph of the Discussion section to further denote that the associations observed in this manuscript are correlative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think that the authors intend to make the point that the presence of this network in the VSP indicates that it may capture more general (not song specific) aspects of nervous system development or plasticity that correlate with song learning; if so, this could be made more explicit in Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the third paragraph of the Discussion section to underscore this important point. We also make this point graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along those lines, it seems that such generalized changes could arise (and be correlated with tutor song similarity) in a variety of ways, which could reflect more or less direct involvement of this pathway in song learning. For example, both song learning and general ns development (captured by green network) might depend on a third variable (hormonal status, variation in neuromodulatory tone, social interactions and stimulation associated with effective tutor song experience, etc.). Indeed, it even seems possible that tutor song similarity achieved by different individuals itself feeds back to influence social and hormonal status of birds in ways that promote or inhibit more general aspects of nervous system development, or plasticity networks that could be captured by the green network. The authors need not belabor these points, but I think they would be well served to at least briefly discuss alternatives to the possibility that variation in the green network is tightly linked to, and is causally driving, variation in song learning (which is how the treatment currently reads to me). In this context, the mechanistic investigations of network identity/membership/function (e.g. MAPK11-ATF2-H2B) are nice in that they illustrate how candidate mechanisms can be identified through network analysis and begin to build a stronger case for specific mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>Our intent was not to indicate that the green learning-related module is the driver of the vocal learning process. Instead, we present the connectivity of genes within the green module as an indication of being in a state of striatal learning, be it vocal (in Area X) or non-vocal (in VSP). The biological factors that lead to the co-expression/connectivity within the green module go beyond the scope of this manuscript but presumably those factors are what cause the formation of this module in juveniles and its dissolution in adults. As reviewer 3 points out, the MAPK11-ATF2-H2B pathway is an example of how the network can be mined for mechanisms underlying the behavior. Further analysis of these genes and how their role in the network changes with age will allow for piecing together the factors that control the network topology and, we believe, the behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In general the authors addressed many issues in reasonable fashion in the rebuttal but for many of them did not address these points in the revision. In some cases the authors note that the requested analyses were not included in the revision because 'the results were negative', but in these cases a negative result is informative and effectively addresses potential concerns about interpretation of the primary data. Where these data (in rebuttal) address concerns raised by the reviewers they are also likely to be of interest to readers of the published manuscript, and as much as possible the authors would be well served to include most of these analyses in the revised manuscript – perhaps in supplementary material.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have included many of the figures previously found only in the first response to reviewer letter as supplementary figures.</p></body></sub-article></article>
