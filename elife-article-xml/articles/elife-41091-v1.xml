Despite its importance in creating resilient barriers, the mechanisms that ensure stable continuity and preserve morphological and molecular symmetry upon fusion remain unclear. Using the segmented embryonic epidermis whose flanks fuse during Drosophila dorsal closure, we demonstrate that epidermal flanks modulate cell numbers and geometry of their fusing fronts to achieve fusion fidelity. While fusing flanks become more matched for both parameters before fusion, differences persisting at fusion are corrected by modulating fusing front width within each segment to ensure alignment of segment boundaries. We show that fusing cell interfaces are remodelled from en-face contacts at fusion to an interlocking arrangement after fusion, and demonstrate that changes in interface length and geometry are dependent on the spatiotemporal regulation of cytoskeletal tension and Bazooka/Par3. Our work uncovers genetically constrained and mechanically triggered adaptive mechanisms contributing to fusion fidelity and epithelial continuity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>reepithelialisation</kwd><kwd>precision</kwd><kwd>symmetry</kwd><kwd>embryonic segments</kwd><kwd>junction remodeling</kwd><kwd>emergent mechanisms</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001405</institution-id><institution>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Das Gupta</surname><given-names>Piyal Taru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001502</institution-id><institution>Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Narasimha</surname><given-names>Maithreyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Restoration of molecular and morphological symmetry and mechanical integrity following epithelial fusion relies on adaptive changes that are mediated by cytoskeletal tension and Bazooka dependent modulation of fusing interface geometry.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epithelial fusion results in the formation of continuous epithelial sheets from the fusion of two epithelial flanks that are spatially separated by an intervening tissue or a gap, and accomplishes the closure of the neural tube, palate and epidermis in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jacinto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiehart et al., 2017</xref>). In these contexts, fusion must not only ensure stable epithelial continuity but must also maintain morphological (size matching) and molecular (matching gene expression patterns) symmetry between the two fusing flanks. Defects in epithelial fusion morphogenesis can have disastrous consequences on embryonic viability resulting not only from the loss of tissue integrity but potentially also from the failure to maintain symmetry in gene expression patterns. An understanding of the molecular, cellular and physical principles that govern fusion fidelity and impart integrity to the newly formed seam is therefore essential from both fundamental and clinical perspectives.</p><p>Embryonic segmentation is a striking example of a molecular or genetic pre-pattern that also has a morphological correlate, and is a hallmark of both vertebrate and invertebrate body plans. Although the gene regulatory networks that govern segmentation were first identified in Drosophila over 40 years ago, the mechanisms that ensure segment continuity and the maintenance of symmetric segmentation gene expression patterns during fusion morphogenesis are remarkably poorly understood. Drosophila dorsal closure is a morphogenetic movement that relies on epithelial fusion and accomplishes the closure of a curved epithelial sheet, the embryonic epidermis, through the meeting of their separated edges in the midline. The embryonic epidermis is morphologically and molecularly segmented along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. This segmentation is evident in the morphologically identifiable segmentation grooves and in the columnar expression patterns of segmentation genes during and after fusion. Epithelial fusion during dorsal closure must therefore not only ensure strong and stable epithelial continuity, but also the faithful matching of morphology and segmentation gene expression patterns.</p><p>Earlier studies on epithelial fusion driven morphogenetic movements including Drosophila dorsal closure (DC), ventral closure in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and neural tube closure in the chick have identified the cellular origins of forces that drive fusion. These studies have demonstrated roles for a) patterned and heterogeneous apical constriction in driving contraction of the intervening tissue, b) cell elongation and intercalation in driving the movement of the flanks and c) the supracellular actin cable and actin based lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions assembled in the leading edge cells in enabling proximity and recognition between fusing partners during fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eltsov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haigo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacinto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kiehart, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiehart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meghana et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Millard and Martin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Narasimha and Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peralta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saravanan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sokolow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Solon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Toyama et al., 2008</xref>). Genetic and biophysical studies on Drosophila dorsal closure have revealed that the contraction of the amnioserosa to which the epidermal flanks are attached provides the major force that brings the flanks into close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harden et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Narasimha and Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pasakarnis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scuderi and Letsou, 2005</xref>). Additionally, two forces originate in the epidermal flanks: a retarding force in the cells of the lateral epidermis and a driving force in the leading edge (or Dorsal Most Epidermal/DME) cells. The latter has been attributed to the apical supracellular actomyosin cable assembled in the DME cells of the two epithelial flanks at its fusing interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kiehart, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiehart et al., 2000</xref>). Recent studies have argued that the actin cable is dispensable for driving closure, but demonstrate an effect on dorsal closure dynamics in its absence and suggest a role for the actin cable in facilitating scar less closure(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ducuing and Vincent, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pasakarnis et al., 2016</xref>). An actin cable is also assembled in wound, ventral and eyelid closure, but its requirement for the latter has been ruled out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raich et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Williams-Masson et al., 1997</xref>). Dynamic, short, actin based filopodia and lamellipodia that emanate from the fusing cell interfaces during dorsal closure are thought to contribute to forces that enable further proximity between the fusing flanks and to cell recognition and adhesion priming between fusing partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eltsov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacinto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Millard and Martin, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms that ensure symmetry between the two fusing flanks and establish seamless epithelial continuity during Drosophila dorsal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiehart et al., 2017</xref>). Uncovering these mechanisms is of outstanding importance given the requirement of both stable epithelial continuity and geometric and molecular symmetry for the maintenance of integrity and the subsequent patterning of the structures engaged in fusion. Dorsal closure accomplishes the covering of the dorsal surface of the embryo by the cuticle producing epidermis and the alignment and registry of the embryonic segments Lb-A8. Pioneering studies that visualised labelled Drosophila embryonic epidermal segment compartments fusing during dorsal closure in real time, demonstrated their faithful pairing and alignment, and hinted at the requirement for cell pair matching between the fusing epidermal flanks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacinto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Millard and Martin, 2008</xref>). Studies based on electron microscopy images revealed filopodial interdigitations between fusing cell partners during Drosophila dorsal closure and suggested that such filopodial interdigitations must enable the fusing cell pairs to recognize each other and establish contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacinto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eltsov et al., 2015</xref>). An alternative possibility is that fusion fidelity is achieved through the spatiotemporal regulation of fusion, ensuring that only one pair of cells is proximate enough to fuse at any given time. Such a model would necessitate the spatiotemporal regulation of distance between the two flanks and of adhesion between the two fusing partners, one pair at a time. Whether this relies on the regulation of adhesion or contractility also remains unclear. Additionally, the nature and regulation of junctional changes that might impart mechanical integrity to and enable seamless continuity of the fused epithelial sheet remain unknown.</p><p>Using live confocal microscopy, quantitative morphodynamics and genetic perturbations, we qualitatively and quantitatively examine the progress of fusion of the embryonic epidermis during Drosophila dorsal closure. We investigateÂ theÂ basis of fusion fidelity and epithelial continuity and uncover their dependence on changes in geometry and cell number in the fusing flanks. We furtherÂ find thatÂ cytoskeletal tension and the polarity regulator Bazooka/ParÂ 3 modulate fusing interface geometry and fusion front cell numbers to impart fidelity and enable seamless, stable epithelial continuity. Our findings reveal that fusion is not genetically pre-set to be accurate at the length scale of fusing cell pairs. Instead, we find that active, adaptive mechanisms that are spatially constrained to embryonic segment compartments and are mechanically triggered, contribute to fusion fidelity. Our work also uncovers for the first time, junction remodelling events that accompany epithelial fusion during dorsal closure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chronology of segment fusion during dorsal closure</title><p>In a dorsal-up view of the embryo (used throughout in this study) with anterior to the left, the upper and lower arcs are the right and left arcs of the embryo.

These studies did not address how symmetric the two flanks were, or whether, when and how is this symmetry achieved. To address these questions, we performed real-time, 3D confocal microscopy of dorsal closure in the embryos described above, and measured the lengths of the upper and lower arcs, the widths of each segment or segment compartment at the leading edge and the number of DME cells in each arc, each fusing segment or segment compartment during the course of dorsal closure. A population level analysis of cell numbers and widths of the compartments of all segments revealed that (i) the posterior compartment has fewer DME cells and is narrower than the anterior compartment and (ii) the posterior compartments of the last fusing segments (T3, A1-A4) exhibit the greatest plasticity, inferred from their heightened ability to modulate cell number and width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâM</xref>).</p><p>In order to obtain an estimate of fusion fidelity, and specifically to assess how symmetric or well matched the fusing right and left epidermal flanks or segments are, we performed a pairwise analysis of lengths and cell numbers between contralateral fusing partners (right and left flanks of the same segment) and measured the differences in these parameters between the fusing partners at multiple time-points during the course of fusion. For the analysis of fusion of segments or compartments, we defined two time points: one at the time of fusion of that segment (t<sub>F</sub>) and another at an early time point (t<sub>E</sub>). We also assessed whether fusing (contralateral) partners were more âmatchedâ than ipsilateral (non-fusing neighbours on the same side) compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; See Materials and methods).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The evolution of high fidelity during dorsal closure</title><p>We first performed a pair-wise analysis of changes in DME cell number and arc length in the two flanks over the course of dorsal closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2AâB</xref>).

For both parameters, significant reductions in the disparity between the two fusing flanks were observed later. Reductions in the disparity in absolute and normalized arc length preceded the reduction in disparity in absolute and normalized cell number (100 and 50 minutes prior to closure for arc length and DME cell number respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and J</xref>; nÂ =Â 16 embryos).

Surprisingly, mechanisms that contribute to equalization begin to operate well before fusion, suggesting they must operate at a distance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Differential contributions of segment compartments to equalization in cell number and geometry of the fusing fronts</title><p>To identify the cellular mechanisms that contribute to equalization in arc length and cell number between the two fusing flanks and to examine whether arc length and cell number equalization occurred uniformly along the anterior-posterior extent of the flank, we determined widths of and cell numbers in each pair of segment compartments that align and fuse during dorsal closure. For this analysis, we focused on the central segments that showed the maximum plasticity. Indeed, a higher proportion of central stripes showed a reduction in DME cell number disparity between fusing partners than the peripheral stripes or the central interstripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1EâJ</xref>; nÂ =Â 6). On average, the stripes had only half as many DME cells as the interstripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâD</xref>; nÂ =Â 48 pairs).</p><p>Within the central stripes, DME cell number differences between contralateral fusing pairs ranged from 2 to 0 at t<sub>-100</sub> but reduced to 1 and 0 at t<sub>F</sub>. Overall, the normalized disparity in cell number between contralateral stripes reduced by two-fold at fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Significantly, while no stripe pairs with a difference in cell number of two were found at fusion, close to half of the stripe pairs examined showed a difference in cell number of one even at fusion (46.2%; nÂ =Â 21 pairs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1FâG</xref>). This demonstrates that a cell number difference of one between the fusing fronts of the posterior compartment at fusion is surprisingly common. In contrast, no significant reduction in cell number differences was observed between contralateral interstripe pairs during the course of dorsal closure, and differences of one (in approximately 30%) or two cells (in 13%) persisted even at fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1IâJ</xref>). Indeed, the normalized difference in DME cell number of the stripe pair at fusion was similar to that exhibited by the interstripe at both time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This suggests that stripe pairs match cell numbers more effectively than the interstripe pairs at fusion.</p><p>In contrast, interstripes more effectively matched the widths of their fusing fronts (a 3 to 4-fold decrease in disparity at fusion) than the stripes, and contributed substantially to the equalisation of segment width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Together, these results reveal that the anterior and posterior compartments of the central embryonic segments contribute different mechanisms to the temporal evolution of fidelity in fusion, and suggest that their ability to modulate the length and geometry of their fusing fronts may be genetically constrained.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Differences in cell number are sensed and corrected within each segment compartment</title><p>The distinct contributions of the anterior and posterior compartments to fusion fidelity suggest that their differential gene expression patterns might contribute to it. We wanted to determine whether each segment compartment behaved autonomously to achieve symmetry in cell numbers. To address this, we examined whether ipsilateral compartments (adjacent stripes/interstripes on the same flank that do not fuse with each other) also exhibit a tendency to reduce disparity in cell numbers between them as we have demonstrated in contralateral partners (fusing partners on opposite flanks). For this, we compared the variance in DME cell number between ipsilateral and contralateral partners. Ipsilateral stripe pairs exhibited a significant increase in the variance in DME cell numbers at fusion compared to contralateral stripe pairs, but no significant differences in the variances in DME cell numbers were observed at early time points or between ipsilateral interstripes at fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; nÂ =Â 21 contralateral pairs and 28 ipsilateral pairs). The observation that contralateral stripe pairs are more âsymmetricâ with respect to DME cell numbers than ipsilateral stripes suggests that the segment compartment is the smallest unit within which differences in cell number are sensed and corrected. Together, our findings suggest that distinct genetically hardwired mechanisms operating within the posterior and anterior compartments must enable cellular rearrangements that facilitate changes in segment DME cell number.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Cell addition to the leading edge does not reduce cell number disparity but may contribute to width equalization</title><p>To determine how differences in cell number between the fusing segment compartments are reduced during the course of dorsal closure, we visualised the evolution of changes in cell number by live confocal microscopy. We observed that all DME cell number changes in the stripe resulted from an increase in cell number in one or both flanks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3AâD</xref>). Two sources of cell addition were found: âmixer cellsâ (MC) - DME cells that are plastic and cross from the anterior compartment and become integrated into the leading edge of the posterior compartment (and turn on engrailed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gettings et al., 2010</xref>]) and âposterior intercalating cellsâ (PIC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Millard and Martin, 2008</xref>) â cells that move from a row ventral to the DME cells in the posterior compartment and become incorporated in the leading edge (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1âvideo 2</xref>). Cell addition occurred at different times in different stripes but reduced cell number disparity in only a third of the cases. Cell addition also occurred when there was no initial disparity, and in some cases cell addition increased the disparity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3AâD,AââDâ, E</xref>). In every instance, cell number addition was followed by a transient or sustained equalization of compartment width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3AââDâ and F</xref>, nÂ =Â 19 pairs). This suggests that cell addition may be primarily deployed to equalize the width of the posterior compartment.</p><p>Collectively, our results so far reveal that cell number matching occurs with less than perfect fidelity within segment compartments and point to the importance of matching fusing front geometry in the face of differences in cell number to ensure segment alignment. Our findings also suggest that mechanisms other than cell addition must contribute to width matching.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Modulation of fusion front width is achieved by changes in fusing interface lengths within each segment compartment</title><p>Earlier work had demonstrated that the segment boundaries align at fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacinto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Millard and Martin, 2008</xref>). To determine the mechanisms by which the fusing fronts of the flanks become matched in length, we examined fusion in sqh::Utrophin GFP embryos in which the stripes were marked with nuclear RFP. This revealed that the dorsal-ventral aligned (D/V) interfaces of the DMEÂ cells at the posterior compartment (stripe) boundaries became aligned, with the anterior boundary more pronouncedly linear than the posterior boundary, through dynamic alterations in the length of theÂ fusing anterior -posteriorly (A/P) oriented cellular interfaces despite differences in cell number in the fusing compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref> and Figure 6âvideo 3B).

To identify the nature of the contacts that formed between fusing segments to ensure segment alignment and epithelial continuity, we examined the formation of the fusion front at high temporal and spatial resolution during and after fusion in embryos carrying ubi::ECadherin GFP. We also examined the nature of contacts in fixed enGal4Â &gt;UAS GFP embryos post-closure that were labelled with ECadherin and GFP. Our analysis revealed that despite a difference of one or two DME cells in the fusing segment compartments, the compartment boundaries aligned to formÂ '+'Â shaped junctions. Such junctions formed between the straight, en-face contacts along the anterior-posterior axis in the dorsal midline (A/P oriented) and the aligned D/V interfaces of the cells at the compartment boundaries and ensured that the fusing fronts were now equal in width. Invariably, the shorter of the two fronts elongated till the boundaries were in alignment. In contrast, cells within segment compartments often contacted two cells on the opposite flank forming 'T'shaped junctions. Such junctions were formed between straight, en-face contacts formed along the anterior-posterior axis in the dorsal midline (A/P oriented) and the D/V interfaces of the cells within the compartment (Figures 2A and 5A,D, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2âvideo 1</xref>).

This pattern evolved from the en-face contacts through the gradual sliding and relaxation of straight, horizontal, A/P oriented interfaces, rendering them less taut, and their subsequent repositioning along the adjacent D/V interface which was shifted away from the dorsal midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Junction remodelling culminated in the formation of nearly evenly spaced, 'Y'shaped tricellular junctions between two adjacent A/P interfaces and the D/V interface and obliterated the midline seam approximately 15 minutes after fusion. This remodelling was associated with a small decrease in ECadherin GFP intensity in the fusing interfaces as they interlocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2âvideo 1</xref>). These findings reveal that fusion does not always culminate in the accurate matching of cell pairs and suggest that the final conformation of junctions (interlocked, tricellular) confers stability and mechanical strength to the newly formed seam, rendering it less susceptible to tears. Thus, the geometric and molecular remodelling of the newly formed ECadherin-based contacts that includes changes in interface length, position and possibly also tension accomplishes strong and stable epithelial continuity upon fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). To identify the mechanisms that contribute to the remodelling of contacts between the two fusing flanks, we examined the spatiotemporal organization of the actomyosin cytoskeleton and of regulators of adhesion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Spatiotemporal regulation of actomyosin organisation: clearance of actin from fused interfaces</title><p>The transition in interface geometry that we described above is reminiscent of the changes that accompany cell intercalation during germ band extension in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, in which the conversion from Type I to Type II junctions involves the resolution of one or more four-point vertices by junction growth in the perpendicular direction.

We therefore examined cytoskeletal organization and dynamics at the fusing interfaces during fusion. Changes in the levels of actin (visualised using Utrophin GFP) and myosin (visualised using sqh GFP) accompanied interface remodelling. Specifically, while both were enriched in unfused interfaces and en-face contacts, their levels reduced significantly in angled, bent and interlocked interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2âvideo 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video3">3</xref>).

The D/V oriented interfaces of DME cells showed no change in the levels of actin or ECadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1EâF</xref>).

Live imaging of genomic Bazooka GFP (Baz GFP) embryos revealed striking spatiotemporal changes in Bazooka distribution. Bazooka was absent from pre-fusion DME interfaces that were rich in actin and myosin but became recruited to these interfaces as the en-face contacts began to form. Its intensity at these interfaces increased as the contacts began to bend and reposition (11.2Â Â±Â 0.3 mins after initial contact; nÂ =Â 71 interfaces), and peaked when the interfaces became configured to create an interlocking cell arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>; nÂ =Â 11 embryos and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video4">Figure 2âvideo 4</xref>). Bazooka colocalised with ECadherin containing cell junctions at the fusing interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1G</xref>). These results reveal the complementary patterns of distribution of actomyosin and Bazooka at the fusing interfaces. While the intensities of Bazooka GFP in the fusing interfaces of both the stripe and the interstripe were comparable, Bazooka distribution in other A/P or D/V oriented interfaces was lower in the stripe than in the interstripe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

We examined Vinculin distribution using an antibody that recognizes Vinculin and in embryos carrying a Vinculin GFP transgene. In sharp contrast to Bazooka, Vinculin in the DME cells was enriched in unfused interfaces and in en-face contacts where its highest levels were found in dot like structures. After fusion, the dots were no longer visible at the apical membrane, and lower levels of Vinculin were detectable along the length of the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Live imaging with Vinculin GFP revealed that while the dots observed pre-fusion persist for some time after fusion, they appear to have repositioned basally. This was particularly evident in orthogonal sections from such embryos and in fixed embryos carrying Vinculin GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1CâD</xref>). This reciprocity suggests that Bazooka enrichment at the newly formed cell junctions is associated with reduced interfacial tension.

This suggests that there is a progressive relaxation of the fusing interfaces after fusion. We therefore examined the role of tension generated by the cytoskeleton on fusion fidelity and epithelial continuity. For this, we measured the fidelity descriptors described earlier (DME cell numbers and widths of the fusing segment compartment fronts as well as the alignment of segment boundaries) in embryos expressing a contraction defective form of myosin (ZipDN) previously shown to function in a dominant negative manner, in the stripes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dawes-Hoang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saravanan et al., 2013</xref>)Â (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâB</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3âvideo 1</xref>). We perturbed the stripes rather than just the DME cells since the cell rearrangements we had documented include cells that are not initially at the leading edge. In such embryos, both the fusion of stripe pairs and dorsal closure was delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1BâD</xref>). Additionally, the arc lengths and DME cell numbers were more variable than controls during early closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1EâF</xref>; nÂ =Â 16 and 10 for control and UAS ZipDN respectively). Despite this, both parameters reduced in mutant embryos with the progression of closure, albeit with different kinetics compared to control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1EâF</xref>). Within individual embryos,neither parameter exhibited the temporal evolution that was observed between contralateral partners in control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3CâD</xref>). Instead, the mutant embryos appeared invariant over time compared to control embryos, and the maximum reduction in disparity was also lower. The stripe and interstripe widths did not show any change between early (t<sub>-100</sub>) and late (t<sub>F</sub>) time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3EâF</xref>; nÂ =Â 40 stripes/interstripes). Additionally, unlike controls, the interstripes in these embryos also did not show a significant reduction in width disparity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; nÂ =Â 20 pairs). Thus, cytoskeletal tension generated by actomyosin interactions entrains the temporal progression to high fusion fidelity. ZipDN expressing stripes were also significantly less well aligned at and after fusion compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; nÂ =Â 10 pairs each for control and Zip DN).

To examine whether Bazooka might also influence interface remodelling during the formation of new contacts during fusion (reepithelialisation), we expressed GFP tagged full length Bazooka, Bazooka RNAi and a GFP tagged C terminally truncated (Î969â1464/BazÎ) Bazooka transgene in the stripes. The latter was previously demonstrated to exhibit dominant negative effects in the context of neuronal polarity and shown to prevent its membrane recruitment by interfering with its interactions with phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krahn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2003</xref>). To examine the effects of Bazooka RNAi in the stripes, we used UAS GFP (in fixed preparations) or UAS NLS RFP (for live imaging) to label the stripe, and sqh::Utrophin GFP to enable the visualization of changes in cell and interface geometry and cytoskeletal organization in real time. We chose Utrophin GFP (rather than ECadherin GFP or sqh GFP) since Bazooka has been shown to regulate both ECadherin and myosin albeit in different contexts. It was therefore possible that ECadherin GFP or sqh GFP may modify the phenotype resulting from Bazooka knockdown.</p><p>We first analysed the effect of Bazooka perturbations on interface remodelling in fixed preparations. The expression of Baz RNAi or BazÎ in stripes resulted in a significant increase of fused interfaces that were curved/squiggly compared to controls, and a significant decrease in angled interfaces. In contrast Bazooka overexpression did not significantly alter the distribution of interface types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5DâJ</xref>). Further, the average angle of the fusing interfaces was significantly reduced upon expressing Baz RNAi (32.3Â Â±Â 2Ë) and BazÎ (25.1Â Â±Â 2.7Ë) compared to the control (39.7Â Â±Â 2Ë) and Baz overexpression (39.1Â Â±Â 1.7Ë) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>).

However, in the few embryos that do progress through dorsal closure, the seam is characterized by straight interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1J</xref>). These results suggest that Bazooka function modulates interface morphology to facilitate interlocking.</p><p>We then examined fusing interface morphologies in the three perturbations in real time. For the full length and truncated Bazooka transgenes, we used their GFP tags to visualize interface morphologies at the fusing DME interfaces. As mentioned above, we used sqh::Utrophin GFP to visualize interface morphologies in Baz RNAi. Live imaging of fusion in stripes overexpressing full length Bazooka recapitulated the recruitment dynamics seen in genomic Baz GFP embryos. Overexpressed Bazooka was recruited to enface contacts of DME cells and subsequently becameÂ enriched (15â20 minutes after the initiation of fusion) in interlocking interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6âvideo 1A-B</xref>). This suggests that Bazooka overexpression does not influence its subcellular distribution dynamics. In contrast both the subcellular distribution and recruitment kinetics of BazÎ differed from the full length Bazooka. Î vesicular, cytosolic pool of BazÎ was present in addition to the membrane pool, and BazÎ recruitment to en-face DME interfaces was both delayed and less tight (11.8Â Â±Â 1.2 mins and 20.4Â Â±Â 2.2 mins for UAS Baz GFP and UAS BazÎ respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6âvideo 2</xref>).

In contrast, stripes expressing BazÎ or Baz RNAi were kinked, exhibited overhangs at fusion and often contained more than one engrailed negative cell at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6âvideos 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video4">4</xref>).

These results strongly suggest that spatiotemporally regulated changes in Bazooka levels, distribution and/or function regulate the adaptive changes in cell number, cell rearrangements and cell shape to contribute to fusion fidelity, epithelial continuity and epithelial order.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41091.027</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Bazooka downregulation reduces fusion fidelity and epithelial order.</title><p>(<bold>AâC</bold>): Post fusion images of the dorsal midline from movies of embryos expressing UAS Baz RNAi driven by enGal4 (embryos also express Utrophin GFP and UAS NLS RFP) showing abnormalities in fusion fidelity including aberrant fusion (A, yellow dashed lines indicate the stripes), overhangs between contralateral partners at fusion (B, dashed yellow line marks the anterior boundary of the stripe) and stripe width disparities (C, black brackets indicate wider stripes and red bracket indicates constricted stripes).

Earlier work on Drosophila germband extension uncovered the mutual exclusion of Bazooka and myosin from A/P and D/V interfaces of cells respectively and suggested mutual negative regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">SimÃµes et al., 2010</xref>). To determine whether cytoskeletal tension might influence the recruitment of Bazooka to DME interfaces, we used laser ablation to create a linear discontinuity within the stripe along its A/P axis during (pre-fusion) and after (post-fusion) the completion of dorsal closure in embryos overexpressing Bazooka in the stripe. This creates two flanks on the same side of the embryo. In pre-fusion stripes, such an ablation did not impede the fusion of the contralateral partners at the dorsal midline. The dorsal part of the cut stripe surged ahead after ablation, and remodelled its fusing interfaces with orderly Bazooka recruitment and the appearance of interlocked interfaces. The cut ends of the stripe were depleted of Bazooka for about 20 minutes after ablation when punctae of Bazooka became detectable. Notably, Bazooka recruitment was detected as the distance between the cut ends reduced, and preceded actual contact between the fusing interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1AâB</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video5">Figure 6âvideo 5</xref>). These results suggest that tension release promotes Bazooka recruitment. Similar results were observed when stripes were cut post-fusion except that both the recruitment of Bazooka and the reestablishment of continuity were more rapid presumably due to the lack of interference from fusion as part of dorsal closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1CâD</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video5">Figure 6âvideo 5</xref>). Remarkably in both cases, directed, intercalatory movements of cells within the cut stripes contributed to the establishment of a linear seam. The onset of muscle contraction however precluded the assessment of the precise nature of interface remodelling. These results suggest that Bazooka recruitment, which is influenced by tension, may be a generic regulator of epithelial continuity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Much work has informed our understanding about the nature and origin of forces that drive cell sheet movements during fusion morphogenesis. Biophysical studies in the genetically and cell biologically tractable model, dorsal closure, have uncovered the remarkable resilience of the process to perturbations in the participating tissues and suggested that multiple forces contribute to its progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hutson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kiehart, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiehart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin and Parkhurst, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin and Wood, 2002</xref>). While the cellular and molecular origins of the forces have been identified, how fidelity in fusion is achieved and how stable epithelial continuity is established is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiehart et al., 2017</xref>). These are questions of fundamental importance. They address not only how contacts formed during re-epithelialisation become strong and stable but also how the physical sizes of (geometric/morphological symmetry and scaling) and the genetic pre-patterns in the fusing flanks are matched and maintained in the face of large-scale cell movements. In addition to establishing epithelial continuity and integrity, fusion morphogenesis also ensures the positions of cells of specific fates. A failure in fusion can thus have consequences not only on tissue integrity and morphology but also on tissue function. The work we describe here uncovers the cellular and molecular mechanisms that ensure fusion fidelity and impart mechanical integrity to the newly formed seam.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Fidelity in epithelial fusion: the logic and the mechanisms</title><p>Our work uncovers for the first time, the principles that govern fidelity in epithelial fusion during <italic>Drosophila</italic> dorsal closure. Our findings demonstrate that fidelity does not rely on pre-set, invariant and equal parameters (DME cell numbers and fusing front geometry) in the two fusing flanks. Rather, spatially constrained adaptive mechanisms that primarily modulate the length and geometry of the fusing front result in the temporal evolution to high fidelity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1Q</xref>). Genetically hardwired mechanisms (segmentation genes) spatially constrain adaptive mechanisms (cell shape changes and cellular rearrangements) to distinct embryonic segments and segment compartments but do not predetermine the exact numbers of cells in each fusing segment or arc. The adaptive mechanisms are modulated by changes in cytoskeletal tension and are mediated by anisotropic cell shape changes that alter fusing interface lengths, and possibly also by cell rearrangements. These mechanisms ensure that fused segments are matched in width despite a cell number disparity of one or two. Our findings thus argue that cell number matching during dorsal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacinto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Millard and Martin, 2008</xref>) operates at less than perfect fidelity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Establishing stable epithelial continuity by interface remodelling after fusion</title><p>Our results also uncover for the first time, changes in interface geometry that accompany fusion. These changes, characterized by the rapid remodelling of horizontal en-face interfaceÂ configurations formed at fusion to angled interfaces that reposition along the D/V interfaces, result in the formation of tricellular vertices and cell interlocking across the fusing front. This conversion obliterates the straight seam evident at fusion, and we speculate, achieves a more stable junctional configuration that imparts mechanical integrity to the epithelial sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This remodelling presumably also obviates the need to precisely match cell numbers at fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>System variables, spatial constraints and the temporal evolution to high fidelity</title><p>Our quantitative spatiotemporal analysis of disparities in cell number and geometry in the fusing fronts revealed that neither parameter was pre-set to be identical in the two fusing fronts at the outset. Rather, significant reductions in disparity were observed over the course of closure, first in arc length and then in cell number, suggesting that the system evolves to become better matched. Our findings also uncover error correction mechanisms that primarily modulate of the width of the fusing front to ensure segment alignment even in the face of disparities in cell number that persist at fusion.</p><p>The observation that fusing front geometry and cell numbers are differentially regulated along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo and within each embryonic segment suggests genetic control by homeotic and segment polarity genes. Indeed, homeotic genes of the Abd A/B complex have been shown to regulate cell mixing between anterior and posterior compartments in segments T3-A6, the same segments that contribute to the cell number changes we observe during the evolution of fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gettings et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roumengous et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, genetically hardwired mechanisms must spatiotemporally constrain cellular mechanisms that contribute to fidelity. Whether and how segment polarity genes confer differences in cell behaviour that explain the differential contributions of anterior and posterior compartments of embryonic segments to fusion fidelity remain to be determined.</p><p>Our results also reveal that cell rearrangements occur well before fusion, even in the absence of cell number disparity, and coincide temporally with width equalization. Conversely, disparities in cell number at fusion are corrected by rapid modulation of fusion front length. These results argue that both cell rearrangements and cell shape changes enable the equalization of geometry albeit at different times and with different efficiencies/speeds. The early cell number and width modulation we observe suggests that sensing mechanisms must operate at a distance within each segment compartment. The width adjustments that occur after fusion operate up close and align compartment boundaries. These findings suggest that distinct mechanisms separated in time and distinguished by different length scales of operation must contribute to sensing cell number and width within each compartment and enable D/V interfaces at the compartment edges to sense and find each other.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Cytoskeletal tension as a trigger for adaptive mechanisms</title><p>Our work suggests that tension generated by the cytoskeleton may serve as a sensing mechanism that sets in motion adaptive mechanisms that contribute to fusion fidelity. Indeed, tension entrained the temporal evolution of all the fidelity parameters examined. Perturbations that lowered tension also affected segment matching in a small fraction of embryos examined, as had been previously observed in heterozygous <italic>zip</italic> (non muscle myosin heavy chain) mutants that also expressed ZipDN in the engrailed compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Franke et al., 2005</xref>). How and where tension is sensed and how it triggers these adaptive mechanisms are areas of future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Bazooka: a key regulator of interface geometry</title><p>Our work uncovers the importance of modulating interface geometry for ensuring fusion fidelity and epithelial continuity. Interface length was modulated by anisotropic cell shape changes and ensured fusion fidelity even in the face of large cell number disparities induced by Bazooka overexpression. These results suggest a role for Bazooka in modulating junction length. Consistent with this, Bazooka colocalised with ECadherin at fusing interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1G</xref>) and high intensity Bazooka GFP patches shifted dynamically along the length of the interface during junction remodelling, sparing the vertices or tricellular junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2DâE</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video4">Figure 2âvideo 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6âvideo 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video5">Figure 6âvideo 5</xref>). These findings suggest that the dynamic repositioning of Bazooka patches modulates interface length and geometry.</p><p>Interface remodelling accomplished the repositioning of A/P oriented en-face contacts and enabled cell interlocking. Our work demonstrates that this remodelling depends on the reciprocal spatiotemporal regulation of cytoskeletal tension and Bazooka. Bazooka has been previously shown to contribute to anisotropic cell shape change in the epidermis and to the resolution of unstable junctional intermediates during cell intercalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bulgakova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">SimÃµes et al., 2010</xref>). The former has been shown to rely on the regulation of ECadherin turnover. The latter may rely on its ability to exclude myosin from resolving interfaces. Our results identify one potential mechanism that may contribute to Bazookaâs effects on interface remodelling: the regulation of interfacial tension. Our results revealed that Bazooka and actomyosin contractility/cytoskeletal tension (actin, myosin and vinculin) were reciprocally regulated in space and time at the fusing/fused interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Notably, Utrophin GFP appeared to accumulate at fusing interfaces in cells lacking Bazooka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These results tempt the speculation that Bazooka may mediate its effects on junction remodelling through the regulation of actomyosin contractility and through it, interfacial tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Additionally, Bazooka heterogeneities within a fusing interface may enable the modulation of tension along each interface. Thus, Bazooka may regulate the modulation of interface tension locally and its relative depletion at the vertices may help maintain high tension there. Indeed, Bazooka has been shown to interact either genetically or physically with myosin, the Rho1 GTPase effector ROCK and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Î²-Catenin homolog Armadillo, and the effects we see on actin may be mediated by any of these interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">SimÃµes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">St Johnston and Sanson, 2011</xref>). Our results also revealed that Bazooka downregulation has only a modest effect on ECadherin anisotropy. We have however not examined it effects on ECadherin turnover at the fusing DME cell interfaces, which is technically challenging on account of the fact that the interfaces are dynamic. What molecular interactions drive the effects of Bazooka we observe is a matter currently under investigation.</p><p>Bazooka also influenced epithelial organization, producing noticeable differences in cell packing within the stripe. While Bazooka over expression produced neatly ordered cell rows, both BazÎ and Baz RNAi increased cell dynamics. These results suggest that the relative distribution of Bazooka at cellular interfaces, which is both genetically hardwired (A/P vs D/V boundary differences) and emergent (fusing interface recruitment and dynamics within the interfaces), controls cell shape and cell dynamics through its effects on interface morphology. Whereas overexpressed Bazooka maintained these differential distributions, the recruitment of BazÎ specifically to the fusing DME interfaces was delayed, enabling us to examine the effect of dysfunctional Bazooka recruitment. The efficacy of BazÎ in disrupting fusion fidelity, epithelial organization and interface remodelling as well as its phenotypic similarities with Baz RNAi allow us to conclude that the spatiotemporal regulation of Bazooka entrains the temporal evolution of changes in interface length and geometry that contribute to fusion fidelity, seamless epidermal continuity and epithelial order.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Adaptive mechanisms in the regulation of fusion fidelity</title><p>Initially identified as a regulator of apicobasal polarity, Bazookaâs roles have expanded to include adhesion junction remodelling (during cell intercalation), anisotropic cell shape change and boundary positioning (during the formation of segment boundaries) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">St Johnston and Sanson, 2011</xref>). Bazooka and myosin also exhibit reciprocally planar polarized patterns within the same cells and can influence each other negatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">SimÃµes et al., 2010</xref>). Our ablation experiments suggest that release of interfacial tension is sufficient to recruit overexpressed Bazooka to the wound edge interfaces and to drive healing by intercalatory movements and cell interlocking rather than by wound edge contraction. Combined with the effects that Bazooka knockdown produces on actin, our findings tempt the suggestion that a biomechanical feedback loop operating at the scale of single interfaces facilitates junctional changes that accompany fusion. In this feedback loop, Bazooka negatively influences actomyosin contractility in the DME cells, which in turn promotes Bazooka recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Potentially, such a mechanism can enable tension-dependent regulation of interface geometry, analogous to what has been suggested for the regulation of pulsed constrictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Munjal et al., 2015</xref>). Together, out results identify Bazooka as a tension sensitive regulator of interface geometry. What molecular interactions promote Bazooka localization and dynamics at fusing interfaces in a tension sensitive manner and enable the modulation of interface geometry remain questions for future investigation.</p><p>The spatiotemporal regulation of tension also governs the directional temporal progression of fusion during neural tube closure in the ascidian <italic>C.Â intestinalis.</italic> The sequential fusion of individual cell pairs provides the force dynamics (relaxation) necessary for the fusion of the subsequent cell pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hashimoto et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, junction relaxation may be a conserved feature in the progression of epithelial fusion. Junction relaxation and elongation have recently been demonstrated to be active processes that are regulated by directed cytoskeletal tension in neighbouring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bardet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collinet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2016</xref>).

Stripes or interstripes from segments Lb and A7 were not considered.

Laser pulses (at 800 nm wavelength) were generated by a titanium-sapphire pulsed femtosecond laser (MaiTai DeepSee, Spectra Physics) coupled to a Zeiss 710 Meta microscope and delivered on to the sample using a 63X1.4 NA oil immersion objective essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meghana et al., 2011</xref>). The laser power at the sample plane measured using a 10X 0.3 NA dry objective was approximately 720 mW. For ablations, 18% laser power was used with 18 iterations (pixel dwell time/iterationÂ =Â 8.15Âµs) over a rectangular ROI positioned a row ventral to the DME cells. The ROI spanned the width of the stripe (approx. 10â15 Âµm) and was 1.05 Âµm in height. After ablation, the entire stripe was imaged for approximately 35 to 60 min at a temporal resolution of four 3D frames/minute. To assess the distance between the cut edges, a straight line was drawn between the furthest points on the two edges post ablation (approximately between the centers of the two cut edges) and the length of this line was measured at every time point using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism six software.

Therefore, we must decline to consider the paper further in its present form.

During this process, the two lateral epidermal sheets move dorsalwards and eventually fuse at the dorsal midline. Up to now, very little is known about the fusion process, in particular with respect to the precision by which cells of both sides recognise each other in order to form a uniform epithelial sheet.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors set out to describe this process in great detail, focusing on the number and shape of the dorsalmost epidermal cells (DME) and the length covered by cells in stripes and interstripes, i. e. in the posterior and anterior compartments of the segments, respectively. Interestingly, they found that precision emerges over time, in particular with respect to the arc length, but that a certain degree of &quot;imprecision&quot; with respect to the cell number in contralateral stripes/interstripes is tolerated. Addition of cells from neighbouring compartments or from more ventral areas reduced the discrepancy in cell number in only some cases. They move on to show that the geometry of the junctions after fusion changes, from an &quot;en-face&quot; geometry to an &quot;interlocked&quot; pattern. This change is associated with a decrease of actin, Sqh and vinculin expression, being high in unfused cells, lower in en-face fused cells and even lower in &quot;interlocked&quot; cells. They further show that the proper change in junctional geometry depends on tension. As shown in other processes, e.g. germ band extension, expression of Bazooka (Baz)/Par3 shows an opposite behaviour, in that it is highest in &quot;interlocked&quot; cells. Upon overexpressing a truncated version of Baz, which is unable to localise at the membrane, this process is affected and goes along with reduced ECadherin expression, precocious interlocking, increased cell number disparity and changes in stripe width. Overall, most of the data presented here, which were obtained by an extremely careful analysis, add novel very important aspects for understanding epithelial fusion, showing that precision is not pre-set, but emerges.</p><p>The experiments are carefully described, and the data are very well presented. However, I have a problem to follow the conclusion made on the role of Baz in this process. From the experiments presented in Figure 5E-5G they suggested that &quot;Bazooka enrichment is associated with reduced interfacial tension&quot;. To corroborate this assumption, they first showed that impaired tension (achieved by expression ZipDN or SqhAA) affects junction remodelling. Do the authors have any idea why dominant negative Zip and Sqh have different effects on the process?</p><p>They go on to express either GFP tagged full-length Baz, a GFP tagged C-terminally truncated Baz (Baz[Î969-1464]) or Baz-RNAi. Expression of either full-length Baz or Baz[Î969-1464] resulted in similar phenotypes, including weaker ECadherin staining, whereas expression of Baz-RNAi had only mild effects, but showing increased E-Cad staining. Baz-GFP was recruited with a similar dynamics as endogenously-tagged Baz. In contrast, Baz[Î969-1464] recruitment was delayed, which was associated with an extended time required to reach the interlocked stage. Finally, they induced a wound in the epidermis on one side of the embryo and observed the fusion event in the wound. From all this they conclude that &quot;â¦ changes in interface length and geometry are dependent on regulation of cytoskeletal tension and Baz/Par3&quot; (Abstract). While the data are convincing with respect to the importance of cytoskeletal tension in this process, the role of Baz is unclear. The fact that overexpression of Baz versions, in particular the truncated one, impairs this process, does not imply that Baz plays a role in this process, given that expression of RNAi has a different outcome. Rather, expressing this form results in a dominant phenotype, but does not provide convincing evidence on the role of Baz in this process.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Das Gupta and Narasimha employs an elegant combination of genetics, live imaging, and morphometric analyses to study re-epithelialization in <italic>Drosophila</italic> dorsal closure. The authors first perform a detailed descriptive analysis of segment matching in terms of cell number and cell shape and uncover a role for myosin regulation (or, in their terms, tension) in this process. The authors then explore the resolution of junctional geometry following fusion. The results suggest that reciprocal regulation of Bazooka/Par-3 and vinculin localization downstream of cytoskeletal tension are required to effectively restore epithelial integrity.</p><p>While the study includes an impressive volume of detailed, quantitative analyses, the manuscript suffers from poor organization and lack of structure, which makes it challenging for the reader to tease apart the real significance of the authors' contributions. The finding that cell numbers between opposing sides of the embryo are not initially precisely regulated is interesting, as are the authors' data on reorganization of junctions following fusion. However, these two components of the story have not been well melded together, and it is difficult for the reader to see the forest for the trees. Despite these qualms, the videos are stunning, and the experiments are, for the most part, well controlled and carefully presented in the figures and captions-too much so at times, in terms of the amount of detail presented.</p><p>Major Concerns:</p><p>1) In the Introduction and Discussion section, the authors could do a better job explaining how the aspects of dorsal closure they are studying might have implications beyond this particular system. Concepts key to the authors' work, such as fidelity and precision, as they apply to this particular system, should be more clearly defined in the Introduction.</p><p>2) The authors perturb myosin as a way to make inferences about the role of tissue tension in this process. However, their strategy is somewhat problematic, as it relies on constitutive expression of a DN-zipper construct in engrailed stripes. While it is likely that tension does play a role in this process, it is difficult to interpret whether the observed changes in precision parameters occur because of a direct role for actomyosin-based tension in cellular rearrangements (which I believe that the authors want to imply) or that other aspects such as cell proliferation might be impaired. To address this problem, the authors should treat embryos with ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 during dorsal closure, which will allow more temporal control over manipulation of contractility.</p><p>3) As written, the manuscript is largely descriptive and difficult to digest. The novel points of the paper, although beautiful, are subtle and might be lost on readers unfamiliar with the extensive literature on dorsal closure. In its current form, this study may be better suited for a more specialist audience than the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>. This outcome would be a shame because the problem of re-epithelialization is of broad interest, and the authors' observations regarding interface remodelling after fusion are interesting, but they are regrettably buried in a sea of difficult-to-follow quantifications of unclear broader biological significance.</p><p>4) To begin to unclutter the story, Figure 1 and Figure 2, a tour de force of measurements and quantifications, could be simplified, with many of the detailed comparisons between stripes and interstripes removed or moved to supplemental. Similarly, Figure 7 and Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 could be presented with fewer time points, just those illustrating the authors points. It is hard for the reader to digest so many panels.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript focuses on the important problem of fusion fidelity and seamless epithelial continuity in the dorsal closure model for epithelial cell sheet migration and fusion. The authors find that differences in the length of the leading edge (here referred to as &quot;arc length&quot;) of the fusing cell sheets is resolved long before fusion and that small differences in arc cell number are tolerated at fusion. The authors conclude that precision evolves over time and because arc length matches before cell number, suggest that two processes lead to these emergent properties. Such differences in arc cell number are accommodated by cell shape changes that are modulated by cell tension. When tension is perturbed by the expression of dominant negative myosin, matching is also perturbed. The authors also have documented changes in the structure of the formed seam with time, a process they call remodeling, and show that an initially flat interface between the zipped cell sheets becomes interlocked. Interestingly, the process of interlocking is accompanied by a loss of cadherin, actin and myosin at the interface between cells that came from contralateral sides of the embryo. The decrease in myosin occurs concomitantly with an increase in Bazooka/Par3, whereas patterns of vinculin accumulation is more similar to myosin. The authors conclude that such patterns of myosin and Bazooka accumulation are consistent with reduced tension in the formed seam. As described below, I do not understand how the observations that accompany attempts to reduce tension in stripes influence junctional remodeling, at least in part because I find Figure 6 very hard to understand and I find comparing the heat maps in Figure 7 hard to compare to the presentation of data in the rest of the Figures.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting topic and a revised manuscript would make a compelling publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. My sense is that modifications to the presentation, and few if any new experiments, will make it ready for publication.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>The only way the authors could do these experiments were through live imaging and the data set they present is rich and valuable. Nevertheless, such live imaging requires the expression of fluorescently tagged cadherin, to label cell junctions and GFP-actin to delineate stripes vs. interstripes. Can the authors be sure that the expression of these transgenes doesn't affect the processes they are studying? Perhaps analysis of fixed and stained, control and experimental embryos could confirm that at least the overall pattern of mismatching, segment and intersegment widths and cell numbers is preserved? The analysis I envisage is to replicate the measurements on several fixed embryos stained with antibodies to cadherin and engrailed, to confirm that the patterns are not distorted in control vs. experimental animals.</p><p>Critical reading of the Ducuing and Vincent, (2016) and Pasakarnis et al., (2016) papers suggest that the authors of both studies have over interpreted their data to rule out a contribution of actin-myosin rich cables to wild type closure. Numerous other studies show that the cables are not strictly required for closure, but nevertheless normally contribute to the process. Similarly, the cables present but not necessary for wound healing. This does not mean that they do not normally facilitate the process. The authors should amend their Introduction appropriately. Indeed, the authors own observations that show expressing dominant negative myosin constructs in epithelial stripes slows closure is consistent with (but does not prove) a role for the purse strings in closure.</p><p>It is not clear to me why that authors normalize the difference in upper and lower arc lengths using Norm. ÎArc Length = (L<sub>u</sub> â L<sub>l</sub>)/(L<sub>u</sub> + L<sub>l</sub>). Shouldn't the ÎArc Length be normalized with the length of one arc, not two? That is, it would seem that (L<sub>u</sub> â L<sub>l</sub>)/((L<sub>u</sub> + L<sub>l</sub>)/2) is a more appropriate measure of the normalized arc length difference. A similar issue arises from the calculation of Norm. ÎWidth and with DME cell number. I think equations 4 and 5 are more appropriate normalization schemes. It seems that the authors' normalization scheme in equations 1, 2 and 3 underestimates all differences by two fold.</p><p>Shouldn't the authors be evaluating standard deviation rather than standard error of the mean? I'm not an expert on statistics, but see Barde and Barde, 2012, Perspectives in Clinical Research 3: 113.</p><p>Subsection âPopulation analysis of precision descriptorsâ states: &quot;(control in Figures S3E and S3F)&quot;. I don't understand how the data in the two cited panels, which pertain to embryos expressing a dominant negative form of non muscle myosin constitute a &quot;control&quot;. The authors should explain.</p><p>Subsection âPopulation analysis of precision descriptorsâ: there is an &quot;are&quot; before &quot;remain&quot; that should be deleted.</p><p>Subsection âCell addition to the leading edge contributes to cell number and width equalizationâ. The authors conclude &quot;This suggests that cell addition may be deployed to equalize number or width of the posterior compartment.&quot; I don't see how, taken at face value, that sentence is consistent with the observations reported in the rest of the paragraph. At the very least, it is misleading since cell addition occurs even when no disparity exists (previous to addition). The wording here should be amended to better reflect the observations reported in the remainder of the paragraph and accurately reflect a consistent interpretation of the data.</p><p>Subsection âSubsection âCytoskeletal tension contributes to the evolution of precision and prevents segment misalignmentâ. On a sentence that starts with &quot;Furthermoreâ¦&quot; and focuses on the role of tension in cell matching, the authors describe the effects of the expression of dominant negative myosin in stripes and note that in one quarter of embryos there were fusions with &quot;non-partner contralateral stripes&quot;. Such non-partner fusions were described by Franke et al., 2005 in embryos that had compromised myosin function (see their Figure 7). The authors should cite that work.</p><p>I am having trouble understanding how the experiments described in subsection &quot;Bazooka and tension-dependent cell interlocking contributes to establishment of a continuous epithelial sheet&quot; fits with their model of how tension influences remodeling of the formed seam. The authors show that cadherin, myosin, actin and vinculin are all decreased at the interface of the epidermal cell sheets from opposite flanks once the flanks are zipped. Moreover, they show that Bazooka is increased concomitantly with the decrease in myosin. They argue that tension is also decreased, and this allows an initially straight seam to become zig-zagged or interlocked. But here, they attempt to reduce tension by expressing either dominant negative myosin heavy chain or non phosphorylatable light chain and this disturbs remodeling. Shouldn't it do the opposite (i.e., like the over expression of Bazooka, described later in subsection &quot;Bazooka and tension-dependent cell interlocking contributes to establishment of a continuous epithelial sheet&quot;)?</p><p>I find Figure 6 very confusing. First, D â F are labeled &quot;closure&quot; and G-I are labeled post closure, but each panel has a label &quot;zipping&quot; with an arrow. Isn't all zipping done post closure? Similarly, panels A, B and C have cartoons that are sketches of the interfaces seen in the micrographs and they too are labeled with zipping and arrows. But those arrows, in the control panel A are beneath mature interlocked cells, whereas the middle has T or + boundaries that show cells early in fusion. The authors clearly understand what they are trying to show. They need to figure out how to modify the Figure so it is more easily interpretable by the reader. I find the magnified inserts and schematics very helpful in A, B and C (but NOT the zipping arrows, which I don't fully understand). Why not have all of the panels comparable to A, B and C? I don't understand the point of showing zipping in two directions in A, B and C. The authors describe no differences between the anterior and posterior seams formed, so why bother showing both? The layout of panels, D â F is compelling because the dorsal opening is shown so it helps the reader orient the panel properly. Why not do that for A, B and C? Finally, are each pair D and G, E and H and F and I from the same embryo? If not, why not?</p><p>The authors wait until the Discussion section to tell us what the significance of a truncated form of Baz is. They add a sentence in the results to inform the reader.</p><p>I don't understand why the authors have switched to a heat map presentation in Figure 7. Of course, heat maps are useful for highlighting relative intensities, but the bulk of the rest of the paper depends on inverse fluorescent gray scale to depict cellular morphologies. So that the reader can better understand the effects of the various permutations of baz expression, the authors should present the data as they have for the other Figures. If heat maps are important, put them in a supplemental figure.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised article &quot;Cytoskeletal tension and Par3 tune interface geometry to ensure fusion fidelity and sheet integrity in dorsal closure&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

It is from an accomplished lab that has contributed key findings to the field. The authors show that initially, the lateral epidermal cells that surround the dorsal opening are different in number and the perimeter of the dorsal opening measured on the right side of the embryo is different than the left side. The embryo adjusts length earlier than cell number and fusion between advancing cells sheets can occur even if the number of cells is not perfectly matched. The authors go on to show that an initially T or + seam that forms becomes interlocked and jagged. They go on to explore what might be responsible for regulating the process and investigate both tension (by perturbing myosin function and with laser cuts) and by manipulating Baz/Par3. They find effects with both, some of which are new and some of which are not (for example, the finding that DNZip causes segment misalignment). Overall, this is a very careful analysis, and the data add novel and important aspects to our understanding of epithelial fusion, showing that precision is not pre-set, but emerges.</p><p>This revised version of the manuscript is a major improvement to the manuscript submitted previously. The manuscript is easier to read, since they have put quite a few data into the Supplementary material. The figures are also significantly de-cluttered and it is now easier to digest the main points. We also appreciate the authors' efforts to address our point regarding better spatiotemporal control of their myosin experiments â we agree there is no easy way to do this without the development of new tools (ie. optogenetics as they point out) â and we concede that the alternative Gal4 driver (LE-Gal4) is a good compromise.</p><p>However, although the reviewers agree that the manuscript is easier to read, there are some concerns summarised below:</p><p>- If the authors could justify the assertions they summarize in their manuscript's Abstract, the paper would be a very nice contribution. Unfortunately, it is not clear that the assertions made are justified based on the data presented. Furthermore, the writing can still be improved. The reader is still left with a lot of detailed data. In order not to get lost, it would be helpful to add a summary sentence after each paragraph, if possible.</p><p>- The new Figure 5 and Figure 6 are still very difficult to follow. Is it possible to reduce the number of panels or perturbations in the main figures and move the remainder to supplementary figures? Some of the difficulty arises from the lengthy labels, e.g., &quot;enGal4&gt;UAS GFP,&quot; &quot;enGal4&gt;UAS ZipDN,&quot; &quot;enGal4&gt;UAS BazGFP â969-1464.&quot; Figure 5H is still rather confusing, in particular due to the inclusion of the significance within the columns. The authors may consider a modification of this graph, perhaps by showing three individual columns for each genotype, with the significance on top. Can the authors come up with more compact and understandable ways to label the different scenarios?</p><p>- A very interesting finding that is not well, if at all, highlighted is when equalization occurs. If the reviewers understand Figure 1âfigure supplement 1Q correctly, don't the data suggest &quot;action at a distance&quot;? If geometry equalization occurs so early and number equalization occurs later, but still there is tens of microns between advancing cell sheets, how does one row of DME cells &quot;know&quot; to adjust its length and/or? Please clarify.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cytoskeletal tension and Bazooka tune interface geometry to ensure fusion fidelity and sheet integrity in dorsal closure&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

During this process, the two lateral epidermal sheets move dorsalwards and eventually fuse at the dorsal midline. Up to now, very little is known about the fusion process, in particular with respect to the precision by which cells of both sides recognise each other in order to form a uniform epithelial sheet.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors set out to describe this process in great detail, focusing on the number and shape of the dorsalmost epidermal cells (DME) and the length covered by cells in stripes and interstripes, i. e. in the posterior and anterior compartments of the segments, respectively. Interestingly, they found that precision emerges over time, in particular with respect to the arc length, but that a certain degree of &quot;imprecision&quot; with respect to the cell number in contralateral stripes/interstripes is tolerated. Addition of cells from neighbouring compartments or from more ventral areas reduced the discrepancy in cell number in only some cases. They move on to show that the geometry of the junctions after fusion changes, from an &quot;en-face&quot; geometry to an &quot;interlocked&quot; pattern. This change is associated with a decrease of actin, Sqh and vinculin expression, being high in unfused cells, lower in en-face fused cells and even lower in &quot;interlocked&quot; cells. They further show that the proper change in junctional geometry depends on tension. As shown in other processes, e.g. germ band extension, expression of Bazooka (Baz)/Par3 shows an opposite behaviour, in that it is highest in &quot;interlocked&quot; cells. Upon overexpressing a truncated version of Baz, which is unable to localise at the membrane, this process is affected and goes along with reduced ECadherin expression, precocious interlocking, increased cell number disparity and changes in stripe width. Overall, most of the data presented here, which were obtained by an extremely careful analysis, add novel very important aspects for understanding epithelial fusion, showing that precision is not pre-set, but emerges.</p><p>The experiments are carefully described, and the data are very well presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these positive comments on the manuscript. Indeed, very little is known about whether and how precise cell matching occurs between the fusing flanks. Our work shows for the first time that while segment/compartment boundaries are respected, small differences in cell number between the fusing compartments is well tolerated. This begs an understanding of the nature of contacts formed upon fusion and motivated us to uncover the morphological/geometric and molecular changes that accompany it. Our work demonstrates for the first time that the contacts formed upon fusion remodel to generate an interlocked cell packing geometry at the dorsal midline. We also identified Bazooka and cytoskeletal tension as regulators of cell morphology, cell dynamics and interface remodelling. Both are themselves spatiotemporally regulated during the process, in a reciprocal manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, I have a problem to follow the conclusion made on the role of Baz in this process. From the experiments presented in Figure 5E-5G they suggested that &quot;Bazooka enrichment is associated with reduced interfacial tension&quot;. To corroborate this assumption, they first showed that impaired tension (achieved by expression ZipDN or SqhAA) affects junction remodelling. Do the authors have any idea why dominant negative Zip and Sqh have different effects on the process?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question that we also pondered about. ZipDN has stronger effects on epithelial order but milder effects on interlocking. In contrast, SqhAA has stronger effects on interlocking and milder effects on epithelial order. One explanation is that perturbing actinmyosin interactions (ZipDN) and perturbing actomyosin contractility by reducing phosphorylation on the myosin RLC (SqhAA) produce qualitatively distinct effects. An alternate possibility is that as both transgenes are expressed in otherwise wildtype backgrounds, their effects are different on account of the varying stoichiometries of wildtype and mutant myosins in each perturbation. At present, we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. A strict assessment of the reason behind the difference will require an analysis of their relative stoichiometries and the ability to target the mutants solely to the fusing interfaces at different times during the process. In the new data we provide using the leading edge Gal4 (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1), we show that a phosphomimetic myosin RLC mutant (SqhEE, that enhances contractility) also effectively abolishes interlocking and renders the midline seam ramrod straight. In contrast, the other two perturbations resulted in a wavy dorsal midline and produced patches of defective interlocking. This local perturbation (in contrast to the expression in stripes) lends support to the idea that the downregulation of contractility in the leading edge cell fusing interfaces is necessary for their relaxation and remodeling. It also brings out the importance of the spatiotemporal regulation of actomyosin based contractility (see also response to reviewer 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They go on to express either GFP tagged full-length Baz, a GFP tagged C-terminally truncated Baz (Baz[Î969-1464]) or Baz-RNAi. Expression of either full-length Baz or Baz[Î969-1464] resulted in similar phenotypes, including weaker ECadherin staining, whereas expression of Baz-RNAi had only mild effects, but showing increased E-Cad staining. Baz-GFP was recruited with a similar dynamics as endogenously-tagged Baz. In contrast, Baz[Î969-1464] recruitment was delayed, which was associated with an extended time required to reach the interlocked stage. Finally, they induced a wound in the epidermis on one side of the embryo and observed the fusion event in the wound. From all this they conclude that &quot;â¦ changes in interface length and geometry are dependent on regulation of cytoskeletal tension and Baz/Par3&quot; (Abstract). While the data are convincing with respect to the importance of cytoskeletal tension in this process, the role of Baz is unclear. The fact that overexpression of Baz versions, in particular the truncated one, impairs this process, does not imply that Baz plays a role in this process, given that expression of RNAi has a different outcome. Rather, expressing this form results in a dominant phenotype, but does not provide convincing evidence on the role of Baz in this process.</p></disp-quote><p>In the earlier version of the manuscript, we had analysed the effects of Bazooka using three perturbations targeted to the stripe: full length Bazooka overexpression, overexpression of a truncated version of Bazooka and Bazooka RNAi. The phenotypes of the former two were assessed both with live imaging (GFP tagged constructs) and in fixed preparations. The latter was only analysed in fixed preps (with UAS GFP/engrailed antibody to mark the engrailed domain). In the present version, we have examined Bazooka RNAi embryos using fixed preparations in greater detail (Figure 5, Figure 5âfigure supplement 1) and also in real time using sqh::Utrophin GFP (Figure 6, Figure 7). We chose Utrophin GFP as it is neutral (binds actin) and is unlikely to modify the phenotype of Bazooka RNAi, a fear we had with using ECadherin GFP or sqh GFP. We also analysed epithelial order and junction remodeling in fixed preparations as well as in real time. Our new analysis reveals that the expression of either Baz RNAi or BazÎ in stripes produces a significant increase in the percentage of fused interfaces that were curved/squiggly compared to controls, and a significant decrease in both angled and straight interfaces. In contrast Baz overexpression only modestly reduced the proportion of straight interfaces (Figure 5). In Baz RNAi and BazÎ expressing stripes, cells in the stripe appeared more âfluidâ and mobile and transgressed the dorsal midline leading to an obliterated seam, suggesting that Bazooka restrains/ regulates cell dynamics and ensures epithelial order at the midline (Figure 5). In contrast Bazooka overexpression led to the ordered stacking of cell rows and increased order at the dorsal midline and reduced cell shape anisotropy (squarish rather than rectangular cells; Figure 5,Figure 5âfigure supplement 1G and Video 8A,B).</p><p>We also reexamined the effect of the three perturbations on the levels of E cadherin. Both Baz overexpression transgenes reduced the intensity of Ecadherin throughout the stripe. The most striking effect in Baz RNAi and BazÎ was a reduction in the anisotropy in the distribution of Ecadherin in DME cells. This was not observed upon Baz overexpression. In 15% of Baz RNAi expressing stripes, an enrichment of E Cadherin specifically at the fusing interfaces was observed even after fusion. The mobility of the interfaces we are examining makes it difficult to determine whether Bazooka influences the relative distributions of mobile and immobile ECadherin at these interfaces (Figure 5).</p><p>We have now examined the effect of Baz RNAi on actin remodeling during fusion in real time and find that the clearing of actin from the fusing interfaces after fusion is impaired in the absence of Baz (Figure 6, Figure 7, Video 10, Video 11). In Baz RNAi, actin persists for longer at these interfaces. Thus, our view of Bazooka function based on the effects of RNAi is that Bazooka restrains cell movement within a sheet and negatively regulates the actomyosin contractility at the fusing interfaces. The temporally regulated appearance of Bazooka at the fusing interfaces thus ensures junction relaxation and stabilization of adhesion in the midline. Our results do not rule out a role for Bazooka dependent ECadherin regulation. Precisely how Bazooka influences junction and cytoskeletal remodeling is an ongoing project in the lab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript by Das Gupta and Narasimha employs an elegant combination of genetics, live imaging, and morphometric analyses to study re-epithelialization in Drosophila dorsal closure. The authors first perform a detailed descriptive analysis of segment matching in terms of cell number and cell shape and uncover a role for myosin regulation (or, in their terms, tension) in this process. The authors then explore the resolution of junctional geometry following fusion. The results suggest that reciprocal regulation of Bazooka/Par-3 and vinculin localization downstream of cytoskeletal tension are required to effectively restore epithelial integrity.</p><p>While the study includes an impressive volume of detailed, quantitative analyses, the manuscript suffers from poor organization and lack of structure, which makes it challenging for the reader to tease apart the real significance of the authors' contributions. The finding that cell numbers between opposing sides of the embryo are not initially precisely regulated is interesting, as are the authors' data on reorganization of junctions following fusion. However, these two components of the story have not been well melded together, and it is difficult for the reader to see the forest for the trees. Despite these qualms, the videos are stunning, and the experiments are, for the most part, well controlled and carefully presented in the figures and captions-too much so at times, in terms of the amount of detail presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for your valuable comments. In the revised version of the manuscript, we have both rewritten and reorganized the sections (and therefore figures) to ensure better clarity, readability and better melding of the two parts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) In the Introduction and Discussion section, the authors could do a better job explaining how the aspects of dorsal closure they are studying might have implications beyond this particular system. Concepts key to the authors' work, such as fidelity and precision, as they apply to this particular system, should be more clearly defined in the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the Introduction to include our definitions of precision/fidelity, highlighted the need to understand the underlying mechanisms both from the perspective of how molecular and morphological symmetry is ensured during large-scale cell movements and also from the perspective of reepithelialisation. We have also posed alternative hypotheses of how this might be achieved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors perturb myosin as a way to make inferences about the role of tissue tension in this process. However, their strategy is somewhat problematic, as it relies on constitutive expression of a DN-zipper construct in engrailed stripes. While it is likely that tension does play a role in this process, it is difficult to interpret whether the observed changes in precision parameters occur because of a direct role for actomyosin-based tension in cellular rearrangements (which I believe that the authors want to imply) or that other aspects such as cell proliferation might be impaired. To address this problem, the authors should treat embryos with ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 during dorsal closure, which will allow more temporal control over manipulation of contractility.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our perturbations targeted to the engrailed compartment do not allow us to confine them temporally and spatially to the period of dorsal closure during which time neither the DME nor the amnioserosa cells divide. We have also confirmed this in our experiments using UAS histone RFP that allows us to see mitotic figures and watch divisions as they happen. The use of drugs is also problematic: they do not allow the spatial control of contractility as they cannot be injected specifically into the relevant cells. The amnioserosa will also be affected and this can influence the phenotypes we see. Given the spatiotemporal dynamics of actomyosin we see, and the fact that different stripes in the same embryo are in different stages of fusion at any given stage, the ideal way of addressing this is question is to use optogenetics to trigger and target the perturbations to single interfaces. This is currently not possible. Another compounding feature is that changes in cytoskeletal tension regulate more than just cell rearrangements: they influence junction remodeling at fusing interfaces and affect dorsal closure dynamics. We therefore reasoned that a good compromise would be to drive the three perturbations that alter tension, ZipDN, SqhAA and SqhEE exclusively in the leading edge cells using the leading edge Gal4 whose expression levels increase and patchiness decreases as dorsal closure progresses. While the patchiness does not allow us to assess fidelity at the level of each compartment, we find effects on straightness of the dorsal midline that suggest reduced fidelity (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1). In both ZipDN and SqhAA, the dorsal midline is wavy along the AP axis where as in SqhEE, the midline is ramrod straight. In all three perturbations, and in particular, in SqhEE, poor interlocking is observed in post-closure embryos. These experiments have allowed us to confirm that altering contractility in just the leading edge cells during dorsal closure (at stages when proliferation is complete) influences junction remodeling, fusion fidelity and epithelial order at the dorsal midline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As written, the manuscript is largely descriptive and difficult to digest. The novel points of the paper, although beautiful, are subtle and might be lost on readers unfamiliar with the extensive literature on dorsal closure. In its current form, this study may be better suited for a more specialist audience than the readers of eLife. This outcome would be a shame because the problem of re-epithelialization is of broad interest, and the authors' observations regarding interface remodelling after fusion are interesting, but they are regrettably buried in a sea of difficult-to-follow quantifications of unclear broader biological significance.</p></disp-quote><p>We have incorporated these suggestions in rewriting this version of the manuscript. We have now moved quantifications that are not essential to the supplementary materials along the lines suggested in 4. We hope you will agree that the most important results now stand out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) To begin to unclutter the story, Figure 1 and Figure 2, a tour de force of measurements and quantifications, could be simplified, with many of the detailed comparisons between stripes and interstripes removed or moved to supplemental. Similarly, Figure 7 and Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 could be presented with fewer time points, just those illustrating the authors points. It is hard for the reader to digest so many panels.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have incorporated these changes in the in the revised figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript focuses on the important problem of fusion fidelity and seamless epithelial continuity in the dorsal closure model for epithelial cell sheet migration and fusion. The authors find that differences in the length of the leading edge (here referred to as &quot;arc length&quot;) of the fusing cell sheets is resolved long before fusion and that small differences in arc cell number are tolerated at fusion. The authors conclude that precision evolves over time and because arc length matches before cell number, suggest that two processes lead to these emergent properties. Such differences in arc cell number are accommodated by cell shape changes that are modulated by cell tension. When tension is perturbed by the expression of dominant negative myosin, matching is also perturbed. The authors also have documented changes in the structure of the formed seam with time, a process they call remodeling, and show that an initially flat interface between the zipped cell sheets becomes interlocked. Interestingly, the process of interlocking is accompanied by a loss of cadherin, actin and myosin at the interface between cells that came from contralateral sides of the embryo. The decrease in myosin occurs concomitantly with an increase in Bazooka/Par3, whereas patterns of vinculin accumulation is more similar to myosin. The authors conclude that such patterns of myosin and Bazooka accumulation are consistent with reduced tension in the formed seam. As described below, I do not understand how the observations that accompany attempts to reduce tension in stripes influence junctional remodeling, at least in part because I find Figure 6 very hard to understand and I find comparing the heat maps in Figure 7 hard to compare to the presentation of data in the rest of the Figures.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting topic and a revised manuscript would make a compelling publication in eLife. My sense is that modifications to the presentation, and few if any new experiments, will make it ready for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>The only way the authors could do these experiments were through live imaging and the data set they present is rich and valuable. Nevertheless, such live imaging requires the expression of fluorescently tagged cadherin, to label cell junctions and GFP-actin to delineate stripes vs. interstripes. Can the authors be sure that the expression of these transgenes doesn't affect the processes they are studying? Perhaps analysis of fixed and stained, control and experimental embryos could confirm that at least the overall pattern of mismatching, segment and intersegment widths and cell numbers is preserved? The analysis I envisage is to replicate the measurements on several fixed embryos stained with antibodies to cadherin and engrailed, to confirm that the patterns are not distorted in control vs. experimental animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We had already done this. In one set of experiments in which we were examining the effect of Bazooka RNAi (presented in the earlier version of the manuscript), we used the engrailed antibody to mark the engrailed domain in controls and mutants, and Ecadherin antibody to label cell outlines, with no additional transgenes. We did this also to see whether the addition of UAS GFP/RFP to label the compartment may have reduced phenotypic severity. A second set of controls used UAS GFP (neutral) to mark stripes in controls and mutants (controls for UAS Baz RNAi, UAS SqhAA, UAS SqhEE) in which the stripes were labelled with UAS GFP and cell boundaries with Ecadherin antibody. Although a dynamic analysis of the parameters could not done in these two data sets, DME cell numbers and their differences, compartment widths and interface geometry were comparable in both sets. For the real time analysis, we used two control genotypes: i) Ecadherin GFP with en&gt;UAS actin GFP (Zip DN experiments) and ii) sqh::Utrophin GFP (also neutral in that it expresses a GFP that can bind actin) with en&gt;UAS NLS RFP (UAS Baz RNAi experiments). In each case, the mutant and controls both had ECadherin GFP or sqh::UtrGFP. Furthermore, the two control genotypes yielded similar results for DME cell numbers and cell number difference evolution, stripe widths as well as for the timescales for interface remodelling suggesting that the parameters we are measuring are not influenced by the transgenes used for live imaging. Specifically, in this manuscript, we show (in Figures 6F,G) that the values of the differences in DME cell number and constriction index (stripe width/stripe cell number) are in the same range in two different controls used: ECadhGFP with en&gt;UAS actin GFP and sqh::Utrophin GFP with en&gt;UAS NLS RFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Critical reading of the Ducuing and Vincent, (2016) and Pasakarnis et al., (2016) papers suggest that the authors of both studies have over interpreted their data to rule out a contribution of actin-myosin rich cables to wild type closure. Numerous other studies show that the cables are not strictly required for closure, but nevertheless normally contribute to the process. Similarly, the cables present but not necessary for wound healing. This does not mean that they do not normally facilitate the process. The authors should amend their Introduction appropriately. Indeed, the authors own observations that show expressing dominant negative myosin constructs in epithelial stripes slows closure is consistent with (but does not prove) a role for the purse strings in closure.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this view and have amended our statement in the Introduction and also included a statement in the Discussion section. Indeed, our new results (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1) with leading edge Gal4 that is expressed only in the DME cells also confirms the view that tension generated in the leading edge cell entrains the spatiotemporal dynamics of dorsal closure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not clear to me why that authors normalize the difference in upper and lower arc lengths using Norm. ÎArc Length = (L<sub>u</sub> â L<sub>l</sub>)/(L<sub>u</sub> + L<sub>l</sub>). Shouldn't the ÎArc Length be normalize with the length of one arc, not two? That is, it would seem that (L<sub>u</sub> â L<sub>l</sub>)/((L<sub>u</sub> + L<sub>l</sub>)/2) is a more appropriate measure of the normalized arc length difference. A similar issue arises from the calculation of Norm. ÎWidth and with DME cell number. I think equations 4 and 5 are more appropriate normalization schemes.

The current Figure 1H is also now represented in this way rather than as a histogram with mean and SEM. We have used standard deviation where we were keen to determine the data spread/scatter/variability. We have replaced the error bars in the current Figure 4C to be standard deviations rather than SEM. In some graphs in which we are expressing differences in relative frequency (eg: Figure 5H and Figure 1âfigure supplement 3F), we have used the SEM (which relies on the SD and the sample size) as we were interested in determining the accuracy of the mean.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âPopulation analysis of precision descriptorsâ states: &quot;(control in Figures S3E and S3F)&quot;.

The authors conclude &quot;This suggests that cell addition may be deployed to equalize number or width of the posterior compartment.&quot; I don't see how, taken at face value, that sentence is consistent with the observations reported in the rest of the paragraph. At the very least, it is misleading since cell addition occurs even when no disparity exists (previous to addition). The wording here should be amended to better reflect the observations reported in the remainder of the paragraph and accurately reflect a consistent interpretation of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.

On a sentence that starts with &quot;Furthermoreâ¦&quot; and focuses on the role of tension in cell matching, the authors describe the effects of the expression of dominant negative myosin in stripes and note that in one quarter of embryos there were fusions with &quot;non-partner contralateral stripes&quot;. Such non-partner fusions were described by Franke et al., 2005 in embryos that had compromised myosin function (see their Figure 7). The authors should cite that work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for pointing this out to us. We have now cited this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am having trouble understanding how the experiments described in subsection &quot;Bazooka and tension-dependent cell interlocking contributes to establishment of a continuous epithelial sheet&quot; fits with their model of how tension influences remodeling of the formed seam. The authors show that cadherin, myosin, actin and vinculin are all decreased at the interface of the epidermal cell sheets from opposite flanks once the flanks are zipped. Moreover, they show that Bazooka is increased concomitantly with the decrease in myosin. They argue that tension is also decreased, and this allows an initially straight seam to become zig-zagged or interlocked. But here, they attempt to reduce tension by expressing either dominant negative myosin heavy chain or non phosphorylatable light chain and this disturbs remodeling. Shouldn't it do the opposite (i.e., like the over expression of Bazooka, described later in subsection &quot;Bazooka and tension-dependent cell interlocking contributes to establishment of a continuous epithelial sheet&quot;)?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand your concern. In the experiments presented we perturb tension in the entire DME cell and in the entire engrailed compartment. We however show that tension is anisotropic. Thus, although tension is normally reduced in the fusing interfaces, in our perturbations, it is also abolished in the non-fusing interfaces, as for instance the DV oriented interfaces of the leading edge cells along which it is positioned and potentially also in the apicomedial pool. In both germ band extension and pulsed constriction in the amnioserosa, it has been shown that junction relaxation relies on directed actomyosin contractility that pulls the vertices outward. In our context, the neighbours could be DME cells in the same flank or in the opposite flank, where cytoskeletal tension may need to be high. Alternatively, tension in the compartment boundaries may also have an effect. Our results with LE Gal4 (which is patchy) suggest that perturbing cytoskeletal tension only in the leading edge cells is sufficient to influence both interface remodeling and fusion fidelity. Indeed, in the work we present in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1, we show that all affect interlocking in patches, with SqhEE having the strongest effect. We believe that we have now established a nice model system in which can address autonomy, non-autonomy and the impact of tension anisotropies within the DME cells in real time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I find Figure 6 very confusing. First, D â F are labeled &quot;closure&quot; and G-I are labeled post closure, but each panel has a label &quot;zipping&quot; with an arrow. Isn't all zipping done post closure? Similarly, panels A, B and C have cartoons that are sketches of the interfaces seen in the micrographs and they too are labeled with zipping and arrows. But those arrows, in the control panel A are beneath mature interlocked cells, whereas the middle has T or + boundaries that show cells early in fusion. The authors clearly understand what they are trying to show. They need to figure out how to modify the Figure so it is more easily interpretable by the reader. I find the magnified inserts and schematics very helpful in A, B and C (but NOT the zipping arrows, which I don't fully understand). Why not have all of the panels comparable to A, B and C? I don't understand the point of showing zipping in two directions in A, B and C. The authors describe no differences between the anterior and posterior seams formed, so why bother showing both? The layout of panels, D â F is compelling because the dorsal opening is shown so it helps the reader orient the panel properly. Why not do that for A, B and C? Finally, are each pair D and G, E and H and F and I from the same embryo? If not, why not?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the confusion. This was a semantic error: zipping was wrongly used to indicate the direction of fusion (from the canthi inwards). We simply wanted to indicate that the segments at the anterior and posterior ends of the ellipse fuse first while the central segments fuse last and that remodeled interfaces are found outwards from the canthi while remodeling interfaces are found closer to the canthi. We have now removed âzippingâand âremodelingâ from the figures and instead indicated the position of the midpoint along the AP axis to orient the reader to region of the dorsal epidermis from which the image is obtained. The data in each pair are not from the same embryo because this data was obtained from fixed preparations of embryos that were either still completing closure (some amnioserosa still visible) or immediately after closure is complete (no amnioserosa visible on the dorsal surface).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors wait until the Discussion section to tell us what the significance of a truncated form of Baz is.

Of course, heat maps are useful for highlighting relative intensities, but the bulk of the rest of the paper depends on inverse fluorescent gray scale to depict cellular morphologies. So that the reader can better understand the effects of the various permutations of baz expression, the authors should present the data as they have for the other Figures. If heat maps are important, put them in a supplemental figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We have switched to the grey scale images and have used some heat maps where spatiotemporal regulation of intensity is what we want to show, in the supplementary figures.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a potentially interesting paper that addresses cell matching during the process of dorsal closure. It is from an accomplished lab that has contributed key findings to the field. The authors show that initially, the lateral epidermal cells that surround the dorsal opening are different in number and the perimeter of the dorsal opening measured on the right side of the embryo is different than the left side. The embryo adjusts length earlier than cell number and fusion between advancing cells sheets can occur even if the number of cells is not perfectly matched. The authors go on to show that an initially T or + seam that forms becomes interlocked and jagged. They go on to explore what might be responsible for regulating the process and investigate both tension (by perturbing myosin function and with laser cuts) and by manipulating Baz/Par3. They find effects with both, some of which are new and some of which are not (for example, the finding that DNZip causes segment misalignment). Overall, this is a very careful analysis, and the data add novel and important aspects to our understanding of epithelial fusion, showing that precision is not pre-set, but emerges.</p><p>This revised version of the manuscript is a major improvement to the manuscript submitted previously. The manuscript is easier to read, since they have put quite a few data into the Supplementary material. The figures are also significantly de-cluttered and it is now easier to digest the main points. We also appreciate the authors' efforts to address our point regarding better spatiotemporal control of their myosin experiments â we agree there is no easy way to do this without the development of new tools (ie. optogenetics as they point out) â and we concede that the alternative Gal4 driver (LE-Gal4) is a good compromise.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their positive comments on our revised manuscript. Our manuscript demonstrates for the first time that precision emerges during the process of fusion and identifies the cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to it. Although Zip DN has previously been shown junction remodeling events we describe here for the first time. We also demonstrate for the first time, the requirement of Bazooka for ensuring fusion fidelity and to enable junction remodeling. While the effects of some of the perturbations we have analysed may seem small yet significant, we believe from our examination of zygotic Bazooka mutant embryos that these are the result of incomplete loss of function. Indeed, Bazooka mutant embryos often fail in dorsal closure (new data added in this revision), precluding our ability to perform the kind of detailed analysis done on the other perturbations. The junctional morphologies evident in these mutants convince us that the effects are real and are stark. We also concede that there is variability in interface morphologies at fusion. Our quantitative analysis of remodeling in control embryos and in mutants captures this variability but also uncovers significant shifts in the frequency distribution of junctions of different morphologies. In this revised version of the manuscript, we present data that captures the differences in frequency distribution of interface orientation angles as well as the central tendencies of the three described categories of interfaces for all the Bazooka perturbations (Figures 5H-K) and for myosin perturbation SqhAA (now in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, although the reviewers agree that the manuscript is easier to read, there are some concerns summarised below:</p><p>- If the authors could justify the assertions they summarize in their manuscript's Abstract, the paper would be a very nice contribution. Unfortunately, it is not clear that the assertions made are justified based on the data presented. Furthermore, the writing can still be improved. The reader is still left with a lot of detailed data. In order not to get lost, it would be helpful to add a summary sentence after each paragraph, if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We do believe that we have justified all the assertions in the Abstract: (i) that precision is not preset but evolves; (ii) that cell matching happens at less than perfect fidelity; (iii) that fusion happens despite differences in cell number; (iv) that changes in interface length and geometry ensures segment alignment and seamless continuity and (v) that tension generated by the actomyosin cytoskeleton and the polarity protein Bazooka modulate cellular rearrangements and changes in interface morphology that mediate precision and seamless continuity. We address the other concerns below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The new Figure 5 and Figure 6 are still very difficult to follow. Is it possible to reduce the number of panels or perturbations in the main figures and move the remainder to supplementary figures? Some of the difficulty arises from the lengthy labels, e.g., &quot;enGal4&gt;UAS GFP,&quot; &quot;enGal4&gt;UAS ZipDN,&quot; &quot;enGal4&gt;UAS BazGFP â969-1464.&quot; Figure 5H is still rather confusing, in particular due to the inclusion of the significance within the columns. The authors may consider a modification of this graph, perhaps by showing three individual columns for each genotype, with the significance on top. Can the authors come up with more compact and understandable ways to label the different scenarios?</p></disp-quote><p>We have split the erstwhile Figure 5H to include additional panels H-J and have now moved panels Figure 6 H,I to Figure 6âfigure supplement 1. We have made the labels less long.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A very interesting finding that is not well, if at all, highlighted is when equalization occurs. If the reviewers understand Figure 1âfigure supplement 1Q correctly, don't the data suggest &quot;action at a distance&quot;? If geometry equalization occurs so early and number equalization occurs later, but still there is tens of microns between advancing cell sheets, how does one row of DME cells &quot;know&quot; to adjust its length and/or? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. Our results in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1Q reveal that mechanisms that contribute to equalization happen well before fusion and suggest action at a distance. We are currently investigating whether sensing operates across the amnioserosa or along the circumference of each segment compartment and whether this is mechanically or chemically regulated. Our results also show that although the mechanisms kick in well before fusion, final adjustments in compartment width after fusion ensure segment alignment in compartments in which there is still a stagger or width discrepancy. This suggests that while there are hardwired mechanisms that are deployed to ensure precision, their deployment is based on an as yet unidentified âsensingâ mechanism. The mechanisms that contribute to the evolution of precision are in some ways reminiscent of âkinetic proofreadingâ during translation. We have now discussed this in the revised text.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I greatly appreciate the changes the authors have made to restructure the presentation of data, in particular by moving some of the data to supplementary material.
