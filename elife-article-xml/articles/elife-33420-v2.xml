Both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission are blocked by protein synthesis inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krug et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Linden, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lisman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stanton and Sarvey, 1984</xref>).</p><p>Although the requirement for protein synthesis in long-term plasticity is widely recognized, the identities of proteins that are differentially synthesized in response to experience and their functions in neuronal and behavioral plasticity are still largely unknown. Several studies focused on specific candidates based on their known functions in synaptic plasticity, for example alpha calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (Î±CaMKII), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Miller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schwartz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). These studies demonstrated that regulation of synthesis of individual candidates is critical for synaptic plasticity but failed to introduce novel candidates. Other studies used label-free synaptic proteomic analysis to identify candidates which changed in abundance in response to activity, but could not determine if the changes resulted from alterations in newly synthesized proteins or preexisting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Butko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">KÃ¤hne et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liao et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>It is challenging to detect changes resulting from differences in <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis by comparing the whole proteome between different conditions because the dominant preexisting proteins can mask the changes in newly synthesized proteins (NSPs), which are relatively low-abundance. Bio-orthogonal metabolic labeling (BONCAT) solves this problem by adding a tag to NSPs for enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dieterich et al., 2007</xref>). BONCAT allows identification of NSPs following incorporation of non-canonical amino acids, such as azidohomoalanine (AHA), which is incorporated into NSPs in place of endogenous methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ngo and Tirrell, 2011</xref>). AHA is then tagged with biotin alkyne using click chemistry, followed by direct detection of biotin tags (DiDBiT), a method to increase tandem mass spectroscopic (MS/MS) coverage and sensitivity of detection of biotin-labeled proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schiapparelli et al., 2014</xref>). We previously combined BONCAT and MS/MS to identify NSPs generated under normal physiological conditions <italic>in vivo</italic> in rat retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schiapparelli et al., 2014</xref>) and in <italic>Xenopus</italic> brain, where we labeled proteins that were newly synthesized over a 24 hr period of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). BONCAT has also been used for quantitative analysis of BDNF-, (RS)â3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), tetrodotoxin-, or bicucculine-induced proteomic changes <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowling et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">SchanzenbÃ¤cher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> application of BONCAT as a discovery tool for novel candidate plasticity mechanisms based on quantitative analysis of proteomic changes in response to sensory experience has not been reported.</p><p>Visual experience induces plasticity in the developing <italic>Xenopus</italic> visual system from synapses to circuit properties to behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aizenman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cline, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Engert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mu and Poo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schwartz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sin et al., 2002</xref>).

Here we conducted an unbiased quantitative proteomic screen to systematically examine visual experience-induced changes in the nascent proteome in <italic>Xenopus</italic> optic tectum and investigated the role of select candidates in tectal cell structural plasticity and behavioral plasticity. We identified candidate plasticity proteins (CPPs) based on quantitative increases and decreases in the nascent proteome from optic tecta of tadpoles exposed to visual experience compared to controls. CPPs were annotated to several biological functions, including RNA splicing, protein translation, and chromatin remodeling. We showed that synthesis of CPPs, eukaryotic initiation factor three subunit A (eIF3A), fused in sarcoma (FUS), and ribosomal protein s17 (RPS17), are required and work coordinately to facilitate visual experience-dependent structural and behavioral plasticity. These results indicate that synthesis of the machinery that regulates RNA splicing and protein translation is itself tightly controlled in response to visual experience, suggesting that <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of core cellular machinery is a critical regulatory node for experience-dependent plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visual experience induces nascent proteome dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic> </title><p>To identify NSPs that are differentially synthesized in response to visual experience, we conducted quantitative proteomic analysis using dimethyl labeling in combination with BONCAT with MS/MS analysis, using multidimensional protein identification (MudPIT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

identifies NSPs by virtue of the detection of biotin in MS spectra, providing high confidence in calling AHA-labeled proteins. This is particularly valuable for unbiased discovery-based proteomic studies where antibodies used to validate candidates may not be available. We validated several CPPs by western blot, where we compared total and enriched AHA-labeled midbrain protein homogenates from tadpoles exposed to visual experience or ambient light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We detected increases in AHA-labeled Î±CaMKII, as a positive control, and CPPs including FUS, RPS17 and 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 2 (PSMD2). For the non-CPPs, L1CAM and calmodulin, AHA-labeled L1CAM did not change significantly, but AHA-labeled calmodulin decreased significantly in response to visual experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Although, we rarely detected experience-dependent changes in total protein of individual CPPs by western blot, total Î±CaMKII levels showed a small but significant decrease with visual experience, and eIF3A increased with visual experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similar differences in CPPs were seen after 30 min or 4 hr of visual experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We could not quantify AHA-labeled eIF3A due to technical issues. Increased synthesis of FUS, RPS17, eIF3A and PSMD2 was detected in the MS/MS experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), indicating that changes in AHA-labeled CPPs detected with western blot corroborate the quantitative proteomic analysis. These results indicate that the nascent proteome is dynamic in response to visual experience and the ability to enrich NSPs from total proteins enables us to observe changes in protein synthesis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33420.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Validation of visual experience-dependent changes in CPP synthesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Protocol to prepare AHA-labeled samples.

We tested the effects of CPP knockdown on basal levels of dendritic arbor growth during development by comparing dendritic arbor structure (TDBL) at the first imaging timepoint before the visual experience protocol, and found dendritic arbors in tecta treated with both eIF3A MO and RPS17 MO for 2 days were significantly less complex than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p><p>We next tested whether simultaneously interfering with both eIF3A- and RPS17-mediated protein translation and FUS-mediated RNA splicing would have more severe deficits compared to knockdown of individual candidates or double knockdown of candidates involved in the same biological function.

Moreover, treatment with FUS, eIF3A and RPS17 MOs significantly reduced developmental dendritic arbor growth, as seen with double eIF3A and RPS17 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Finally, analysis of the proportion of neurons with visualÂ experience-dependent dendritic arbor growth in each experimental condition indicates that only 29% of neurons in tecta with triple knockdown of eIF3A, RPS17, and FUS show experience-dependent dendritic arbor structural plasticity, the lowest percentage of VE-responsive cells. By contrast, 97% of control neurons showed experience-dependent plasticity, compared to 59â70% of neurons with single knockdown and 55% of neurons with double knockdown of eIF3A and RPS17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Chi Square analysis of independence with Bonferroni correction indicates that the proportions of neurons that respond to VE in control morpholino and triple knockdown conditions are significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).

Visual avoidance behavior is an innate behavior where tadpoles change swimming direction to avoid an approaching object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dong et al., 2009</xref>). The behavior is quantified as an avoidance index (AI), the ratio of avoidance responses out of 10 encounters with an approaching visual stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shen et al., 2011</xref>). AI improves after tadpoles are exposed to visual experience and this behavioral plasticity requires protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Baseline avoidance behavior was tested two days after optic tecta were electroporated with control MO or eIF3A MOÂ +Â RPS17 MO + FUS MO, then animals were exposed to 4 hr visual experience and tested for visual avoidance behavior 1 hr and 20 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

In this study, we performed quantitative proteomic analysis in response to a protein translation-dependent plasticity-inducing visual experience protocol in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tadpoles using BONCAT labeling and DiDBiT. We identified 83 CPPs, many of which had not been reported to affect neuronal plasticity and therefore represent novel CPPs.

Considering that for any CPP, NSPs may be a fraction of the total protein, these data suggest the experience-dependent NSPs may play a privileged role in regulating plasticity.</p><p>Prior studies used strong induction protocols, such as kainic acid injection or electroconvulsive stimuli, to identify activity-induced genes.

Identification and validation of CPPs using this strategy strengthen the conclusion that these CPPs function in experience-dependent plasticity mechanisms. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> screen would not be expected to detect NSPs that require strong induction conditions, that are rapidly synthesized and degraded or NSPs that are synthesized at delayed time-points after plasticity-induction. Indeed, our CPP dataset does not overlap with previously reported immediate early genes or candidate plasticity genes induced by strong induction protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leslie and Nedivi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">West and Greenberg, 2011</xref>), however 7/83 (8.4%) of CPPs were recently identified as visual stimulus-responsive genes in mouse visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hrvatin et al., 2018</xref>) and 8/83 (9.6%) of CPPs from our dataset were identified as changing in mouse hippocampus in response to 21 days of environmental enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez-Castelao et al., 2017</xref>). Further studies using a variety of experimental protocols will be required to generate more comprehensive datasets of activity-regulated changes in NSPs and identification of CPPs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Proteomic analysis of NSP dynamics</title><p>Analysis of the visual experience-dependent nascent proteome revealed several interesting facts. First, we observed not only increases, but also decreases in NSPs in response to visual experience. Previous studies showed that inhibiting protein synthesis globally blocks plasticity, however, our data indicating that the synthesis of some CPPs was reduced during induction of plasticity suggest that experience-dependent changes in protein synthesis related to neuronal plasticity may be more fine-tuned and complex than previously thought. The observation that comparable numbers of CPPs increase and decrease synthesis in response to visual experience further suggests that a general increase in basal translation does not account for visualÂ experience-dependent structural plasticity or behavioral plasticity, however the valence of responses of NSPs to visual experience could reflect corresponding increases and decreases in activity-regulated gene expression. Given the extensive regulation of post-transcriptional and translational mechanisms in the nervous system, for instance by RNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klann and Dever, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Udagawa et al., 2015</xref>), direct comparisons between activity-regulated genes and NSPs in response to the same stimulation conditions should reveal interesting spatial and temporal complexities of the relation between activity-induced transcription and translation. The mRNA binding protein, FMRP, is a good example of this complexity. FMRP is thought to inhibit translation of its target mRNAs downstream of activity-dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ceman et al., 2003</xref>). About 20% of the CPPs we identified are FMRP targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>), the majority of which decreased their synthesis in <italic>Xenopus</italic> optic tectum with visual experience. Decreased FMRP expression, as occurs in Fragile X Syndrome, is thought to impair behavioral plasticity by increasing synthesis of FMRP targets. We previously reported that FMRP knockdown blocks maintenance but not induction of experience-dependent behavioral plasticity, suggesting that in healthy brains FMRP limits translation of proteins that interfere with the maintenance of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu and Cline, 2016</xref>). Our present analysis of experience-dependent NSP dynamics indicates that neurons maintain a delicate balance in protein synthesis by taking advantage of regulatory mechanisms specialized to increase or decrease distinct subsets of proteins.</p><p>Second, we found that the percentage of cytoskeletal proteins in the experience-dependent NSPs is greater than the nascent or global proteomes. It is widely recognized that cytoskeletal dynamics underlie experience-dependent structural plasticity in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benito and Barco, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leslie and Nedivi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Van Aelst and Cline, 2004</xref>). Although studies have identified specific cytoskeletal proteins and their regulators that undergo dynamic rearrangements in response to activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lamprecht and LeDoux, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tada and Sheng, 2006</xref>), whether experience-dependent <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of cytoskeletal proteins is required for neuronal or behavioral plasticity is still unclear. Our unbiased search of experience-regulated NSPs indicates that cytoskeletal proteins are a predominant category that is differentially synthesized under plasticity-inducing conditions. Previous transcriptional screens identified cytoskeletal mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cajigas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moccia et al., 2003</xref>). Our findings provide direct evidence that translational regulation of cytoskeletal proteins is an important mechanism for experience-dependent control of neuronal structure</p><p>Third, about 20% of our CPPs have been identified as ASD genes or FMRP targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>). The fact that their translation is visual experience-dependent suggests that the neuronal phenotypes observed in FXS or ASD patients caused by mutation or malfunction of these genes and proteins could arise from mis-regulation of their synthesis in response to sensory experience or plasticity-inducing conditions. Furthermore, about 65% of the CPPs are annotated as synaptic proteins, according to the SynProt classic and PreProt databases, indicating that diverse protein constituents of synapses are dynamically regulated by translational mechanisms. Label-free synaptic proteomic analysis identified changes in protein abundance in response to activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Butko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">KÃ¤hne et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liao et al., 2007</xref>). Although these studies suggested novel candidates affecting plasticity, they did not distinguish between preexisting proteins and NSPs.</p><p>Fourth, STRING analysis identified functional protein interaction networks of CPPs and biological processes that may be regulated by visual experience-dependent changes in protein synthesis. The interaction networks identified with human and mouse databases are slightly different because different topics are studied in mice and human tissue. For example, the human database has more references for RNA splicing than the mouse database. For protein translation, the situation is reversed. The mouse database is curated to include an interaction between eIF3A and RPS17, which is missing in the human database, based on studies in mice examining the structure of the 43S pre-initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hashem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, combining data from two databases allows a more complete analysis of the functions/pathways enriched in CPPs.</p><p>Finally, when we compared the nascent proteome comprised of NSPs labeled with AHA over 5 hr in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> optic tectum to our prior dataset of NSPs labeled over 24 hr of normal development in the entire tadpole brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shen et al., 2014</xref>), we find that only 104 proteins overlap between two datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). The differences in the datasets likely reflect differences in the AHA labeling periods, the brain regions and the visual experience conditions between two experiments and suggest that NSPs required to generate basic components of the entire developing nervous system differ from those associated with development and plasticity of the optic tectal circuit. In addition, we note that targeted search for NSPs using BONCAT combined with western blots can be used to validate CPPs that are challenging to detect in unbiased proteomic screens, based on high sensitivity of these methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). Further studies using a variety of stimulus conditions and time points for NSP analysis will be required to generate a comprehensive understanding of proteomic dynamics contributing to neuronal plasticity during development, learning and aging.</p><p>To further examine the roles of CPPs in structural plasticity, we selected four candidates, FUS, NONO, eIF3A, and RPS17, from networks identified by the STRING analysis. We measured changes in dendritic arbor elaboration, which is highly correlated to the number of synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2011</xref>), as well as the complexity and function of brain circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sin et al., 2002</xref>). Knocking down FUS, eIF3A, and RPS17 significantly decreased dendritic arbor plasticity in response to visual experience. These deficits were rescued when we co-expressed MO-insensitive forms of the transcripts with the MOs, indicating that the deficits resulted from decreased synthesis of the individual candidates. In these experiments, we electroporated tecta with translation blocking morpholinos and evaluated visual experience-dependent structural plasticity two days later. Our proteomic analysis indicates that synthesis of these CPPs specifically increases in response to visual experience. Furthermore, our analysis of dendritic arbor structure indicates that individual morpholino treatments did not interfere with basal arbor development before animals were exposed to the visual experience protocol. Together, these results indicate that blocking the visual experience-induced <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of the CPPs interferes with structural plasticity, however, depending on basal levels of CPP proteostasis, it is possible that blocking CPP translation over 1â2 days before the visual experience protocol could contribute to the impaired experience-dependent structural plasticity. In previous studies, we found that delivery of CPEB morpholinos immediately before the visual experience protocol, blocked tectal cell structural and functional plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shen et al., 2014</xref>), demonstrating that newly synthesized CPEB in response to visual experience is required for neuronal plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>FUS regulates downstream RNA targets important for neuronal plasticity</title><p>FUS, a RNA binding protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), is involved in multiple steps of RNA processing, such as transcription, splicing, transport and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lagier-Tourenne et al., 2010</xref>). Increases in FUS expression in response to mGluR activation <italic>in vitro</italic> suggested a role for FUS in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fujii et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sephton et al., 2014</xref>). In our study, both proteomic analysis and western blots showed visual experience-dependent increases in FUS expression. Analysis of FUS knockdown indicates that FUS is required for experience-dependent structural plasticity. In addition, FUS knockdown reduces <italic>gria1</italic> mRNA, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Udagawa et al., 2015</xref>). Together these data suggest that FUS may regulate experience-dependent structural plasticity by stabilizing <italic>gria1</italic> mRNA and increasing GluA1 synthesis, which may in turn enhance AMPAR-mediated glutamatergic transmission. We and others have previous shown that experience-dependent dendritic arbor structural plasticity requires AMPAR-mediated transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jablonski and Kalb, 2013</xref>). Consistent with this, activity-dependent synthesis of GluA1 is induced in the dendrites of hippocampal neurons by dihydrexidine, a dopamine D1/D5 receptor agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith et al., 2005</xref>) and has been reported to be required for memory consolidation in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Slipczuk et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Role of eIF3A and RPS17 in neuronal plasticity</title><p>Post-translational modifications of components of translational machinery, such as phosphorylation of eIF4F or eIF2Î±, are well-studied mechanisms regulating plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klann and Dever, 2004</xref>). Our screen identifying CPPs in the visual experience-dependent nascent proteome, together with evidence that acute eIF3A and RPS17 knockdown interferes with neuronal plasticity, suggest a previously unrecognized plasticity mechanism by regulating experience-dependent <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of translational machinery. eIF3A and RPS17 are part of the 43S pre-initiation complex which scans along the mRNA for the start codon to initiate protein translation after association with other initiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hashem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this model in which eIF3A and RPS17 affect global protein synthesis, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies reported broad deficits in protein synthesis with eIF3A knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wagner et al., 2014</xref>). An <italic>in vivo</italic> study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> showed that haploinsufficiency of RPS17 reduced protein synthesis during early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boring et al., 1989</xref>). When we used FUNCAT to visualize the amount and distribution of NSPs with eIF3A or RPS17 knockdown in <italic>Xenopus</italic> tectum, we observed increased protein synthesis with eIF3A knockdown and no change in FUNCAT labeling with RPS17 knockdown after 1 hr of AHA labeling. These data are consistent with other studies suggesting non-canonical functions of eIF3A and RPS17. For instance, despite its canonical role in initiating protein translation, several studies reported additional functions for eIF3A in translational activation or repression of specific mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dong and Zhang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Using photoactivatable ribonucleotide-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP), Lee et al. reported that eIF3 complex, which contains eIF3A, binds to a specific subset of mRNA involved in cell proliferation and selectively acts as an activator or a repressor of translation for different targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Other studies suggest that ribosomal proteins, instead of being a constitutive subunit of the 40S or 60S subunits, act as regulators for expression of a subset of gene as part of the ribosome complex or even outside of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kondrashov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Topisirovic and Sonenberg, 2011</xref>). Ribosomal protein L38 (Rpl38) is an example where, when it is mutated, global protein synthesis is unchanged but translation of a subset of Hox genes is affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kondrashov et al., 2011</xref>). The increase in FUNCAT labeling observed in eIF3A knockdown animals suggests that more genes may be repressed than activated by eIF3A in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> tectum in response to visual experience. Interestingly, 7 of our candidates were reported in the Lee et al. study to be directly bound by eIF3 complex in human 293 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that synthesis of these eIF3 targets could be regulated as CPPs by eIF3A, one of the 13 subunits of eIF3 complex, with visual experience. Future studies for the specific targets of eIF3A and RPS17 in the developing brain would provide more insight into the underlying mechanism regulated by these candidates whose synthesis was increased in response to visual experience.</p><p>FUNCAT labeling shows that double knockdown of eIF3A and RPS17 increases NSPs in the neuropil but not the neuronal cell body layer. This pattern is different from knockdown of eIF3A or RPS17 alone and is not a simple combination of knocking down the individual CPPs, suggesting that eIF3A and RPS17 may function coordinately to regulate protein translation. Double knockdown of eIF3A and RPS17 exhibits stronger deficits in experience-dependent structural plasticity than single CPP knockdown. Animals with simultaneous FUS, eIF3A, and RPS17 knockdown showed the most profound deficits, including the most severe impairment in experience-dependent structural plasticity and reduced dendritic arbor growth during normal development. Moreover, triple knockdown animals have the highest percentage of cells that failed to exhibit visual experience-dependent structural plasticity. These data suggest that inhibiting synthesis of FUS, eIF3A, and RPS17 blocks core mechanisms that neurons employ to generate visual experience-dependent structural plasticity, whereas inhibiting synthesis of one or two of these pivotal CPPs may allow others to compensate for certain functions.</p><p>In summary, we report an <italic>in vivo</italic> proteomic screen for experience-dependent CPPs in a behaving vertebrate, using quantitative proteomic analysis, bioinformatic predictions and <italic>in vivo</italic> validation with visual experience-dependent plasticity protocols including both structural and behavioral outcome measures. With the unbiased screen, we discovered novel CPPs contributing to the multifaceted plasticity events that occur in response to visual experience, and demonstrated that CPPs participating in RNA splicing and translation function in concert to mediate visual experience dependent plasticity. In total, we identified 83 CPPs that are differentially synthesized in <italic>Xenopus</italic> optic tectum in response to visual experience using BONCAT and DiDBiT methods. These CPPs were annotated to multiple cellular compartments, molecular functions, and biological processes, indicative of the complexity of the underlying mechanisms of visual experience-dependent plasticity. We further demonstrated that synthesis of global regulators of gene expression such as eIF3A, FUS, and RPS17 was increased in response to visual experience and required to mediate experience-dependent structural and behavioral plasticity. We propose that the dynamic synthesis of the core neuronal machinery that regulates RNA splicing and protein translation allows these proteins to serve as master regulators which control downstream effector proteins, including receptors, cytoskeletal proteins or kinases. The effector proteins then modulate synaptic structure and function, and maintain experience-induced plasticity. The master regulators could be involved in visual experience-dependent plasticity by playing their canonical roles, such as FUS, which is involved in multiple steps of RNA processing. Other CPPs, such as eIF3A and RPS17, may affect plasticity by playing their canonical roles in global protein translation, or they may play or non-canonical roles, for instance by regulating translation of a subset of targets in response to plasticity-induction protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>mouse-anti-CaMKIIÎ± antibody</td><td>Novus</td><td>Cat# NB100-1983, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10001339">AB_10001339</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit-anti-Î²-tubulin</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>Cat# sc-9104, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2241191">AB_2241191</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>mouse-anti-L1CAM</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat# ab24345, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_448025">AB_448025</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit-anti-BSA</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>Cat# PA1-29262, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1956427">AB_1956427</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>mouse-anti-FUS/TLS</td><td>BD Bioscience</td><td>Cat# 611385, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_398907">AB_398907</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit-anti-eIF3A</td><td>Novus</td><td>Cat# NBP1-79628, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11042798">AB_11042798</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>mouse-anti-RPS17</td><td>Abnova Corporation</td><td>Cat# H00006218-M01, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2285214">AB_2285214</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit-anti-PSMD2</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>Cat#14141 (This product is discontinued)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>mouse-anti-calmodulin</td><td>Millipore</td><td>Cat# 05â173, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_309644">AB_309644</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Stage 46â48 albino <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tadpoles of either sex were bred in house or purchased (Xenopus Express, Brooksville, FL) and used for all experiments.

Next, they were pressure-loaded onto a 250 Âµm i.d capillary with a kasil frit containing 2 cm of 10 Âµm Jupiter C18-A material (Phenomenex, Ventura, CA) followed by 2 cm 5 Âµm Partisphere strong cation exchanger (Whatman, Clifton, NJ). This loading column was washed with buffer A. After washing, a 100 Âµm i.d capillary with a 5 Âµm pulled tip packed with 15 cm 4 Âµm Jupiter C18 material (Phenomenex, Ventura, CA) was attached to the loading column with a union and the entire split-column (loading columnâunionâanalytical column) was placed in line with an Agilent 1100 quaternary HPLC (Palo Alto, CA). The sample was analyzed using MudPIT, which is a modified 12-step separation described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Washburn et al., 2001</xref>). The buffer solutions used were buffer A, 80% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (buffer B), and 500 mM ammonium acetate/5% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (buffer C). Step 1 consisted of a 90 min gradient from 0â100% buffer B. Steps 2â11 had the following profile: 3 min of 100% buffer A, 5 min of X% buffer C, a 10 min gradient from 0â10% buffer B, and a 105 min gradient from 15â45% buffer B. The buffer C percentages (X) were 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 60, 100%, respectively for the 11-step analysis. In the final two steps, the gradient contained: 5 min of 100% buffer A, 5 min of 90% buffer C plus 10% B, a 10 min gradient from 0â15% buffer B, and a 105 min gradient from 15â100% buffer B. As peptides eluted from the microcapillary column, they were electrosprayed directly into an Elite mass spectrometer (ThermoFischer, Palo Alto, CA) with the application of a distal 2.4 kV spray voltage using the rapid scan settings previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Michalski et al., 2012</xref>). Applications of mass spectrometer scan functions and HPLC solvent gradients were controlled by the Xcalibur data system. MudPIT analysis was performed twice for two AHA peptide samples from two biological samples. The flow-through samples were analyzed by three MudPITs for each biological sample (i.e. three technical replicates). The MS data from the technical replicates were combined into one dataset prior to data analysis.

No enzyme specificity was considered for any search. The following modifications were searched for a static modification of 57.02146 on cysteine and a differential modification of 523.2749 on methionine for AHA. The âlightâ and âheavyâ dimethylation of NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus and lysine were searched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boersema et al., 2009</xref>).

DTASelect 2.0 uses a linear discriminant analysis to dynamically set XCorr and DeltaCN thresholds for the entire dataset to achieve a user-specified false discovery rate (FDR). In addition, the modified peptides were required to be fully tryptic, less than 5ppm deviation from peptide match, and a FDR at the spectra level of 0.01. The FDRs are estimated by the program from the number and quality of spectral matches to the decoy database. For all datasets, the protein FDR wasÂ &lt;1% and the peptide FDR wasÂ &lt;0.5%. Census was employed to generate heavy/light peptide ratios using the MS1 files and confident identifications from DTASelect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park et al., 2008</xref>). The average AHA peptide ratio for each protein was shifted to 1:1 based on the median ratio of the quantified unmodified peptides from the flow-through for each experiment. The normalized fold changes VE:control (V/C) in AHA labeling from three databases were averaged to represent the fold change in each experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

The click reaction and protein precipitation were performed as described for the proteomic analysis. The dried protein pellets were suspended in 100 ÂµL of 6M Urea/25 mM ammonium bicarbonate/0.5% SDS in PBS with vortexing for 10â20 min or until the pellet was dissolved. We added 50â100 ÂµL washed Neutravidin beads (Pierce, 29200) and added PBS to a final volume of 1000 ÂµL. Samples were subjected to head-over-head rotation for at least 2 hr at room temperature.

Experimental and paired control samples were prepared and processed side by side. Tissues were homogenized in RIPA buffer and boiled for 5 min before brief sonication. After measuring protein concentration with BCA Protein Assay Kit, 2X sample buffer was added to the sample and boiled for 5â10 min. 5â10 Âµg of lysate was loaded onto an Mini-Protean TGX precast gels (BioRad) and proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane with Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (BioRad). The membrane was incubated in 5% non-fat milk/0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma) in TBS for an hour for blocking, and then transferred to primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution and incubated 1â2 overnight at 4Â°C. After three brief washes with 0.05% Tween-20 in TBS, membranes were transferred to secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary (BioRad), diluted in blocking solution for an hour at room temperature. Blots were rinsed and incubated with HRP-linked mouse/rabbit/goat IgG (BioRad). The Pierce ECL western Blot substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 32209) was used to visualize labeling. For quantification of western blots, different exposure periods were used for the same blots to avoid saturation. The blots were scanned and band intensities were measured from non-saturating exposures with ImageJ. For the BONCAT samples which had biotinylated BSA spiked in, the band intensity of each candidate protein was first normalized to its BSA loading control band (which was obtained after stripping the same membrane) and then that value was normalized to the Î²-tubulin loading control band from input/total protein samples. For other samples, the band intensity of each candidate protein was normalized to its Î²-tubulin loading control band. For comparison between VE and control, we calculated the ratios of normalized intensity values (VE/control or control/control) in each set of paired conditions. We use total Î²-tubulin as a loading control, based on our previous study showing that total Î²-tubulin is stable in response to visual experience, whereas newly synthesized Î²-tubulin increases in response to visual experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shen et al., 2014</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Role of the Visual Experience-Dependent Nascent Proteome in Neuronal Plasticity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Elly Nedivi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors of this manuscript have developed the Xenopus optic tectum as a model system for studying cellular mechanisms of activity-dependent neuronal plasticity. Previously they have established that de novo protein synthesis is required for experience-dependent structural and functional plasticity of optic tectum neurons in vivo and they have reported their development of a high sensitivity mass spec-based assay for nascent protein synthesis in this system. Here they now use this method to identify proteins newly synthesized in the optic tectum in response to visually evoked activity. All of the reviewers agreed that overall the biochemical experiments were performed to a high standard, and that the data resulting from this technically demanding effort, which identified 83 proteins showing activity-dependent increases in protein synthesis, would be of significant interest as a resource to a broad group of readers interested in mechanisms of neuronal plasticity.</p><p>The second half of the manuscript tests the function of three activity-regulated candidates from this list via morpholino-based knockdown in optic tectum <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although these experiments are useful as validation of the biochemical screen, there was substantial debate among the reviewers about the significance of the findings. The authors claim these data are important because &quot;they indicate that de novo synthesis of proteins required for RNA splicing and protein synthesis are themselves required for plasticity, introducing a new locus for control of experience-dependent plasticity.&quot; The simple fact that regulators of splicing and translation are among the gene products that can be regulated at the level of translation is interesting but conceptually incremental from the work the authors have already done to establish the importance of translation for neuronal plasticity in this system, and notably the authors have previously shown that other kinds of RNA regulatory proteins (e.g. the RNA binding protein CPEB) show de novo protein synthesis-dependent effects on optic tectum plasticity.</p><p>In response to a previous review that raised similar concerns about significance of the candidate testing, the authors wrote that they &quot;demonstrate that it is their activity-dependent synthesis that is required for experience-dependent plasticity, not simply the presence of the candidate protein.&quot; Despite the fact we largely agreed (with caveats) that the authors show that knockdown of eIF3A, RPS17, and FUS selectively impair optic tectum neuron structure or function selectively during the experience-dependent phase, given the way this study was performed those effects are due to knockdown of the candidate proteins over the 2 days preceding experience and therefore cannot be selectively attributed to loss of the ~20% change in expression of these proteins following visual experience. Although the reviewers debated possible additional experiments that could strengthen the second section, many options were seen as beyond the scope of the current study, and one reviewer felt the new suggestions did not change the fundamental argument about the timing of the function of the RNA regulators tested here.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Given this analysis, we propose that the authors revise the submission as a Tools and Resource paper rather than a Research Article. By centering on the dataset rather than the functional analysis the manuscript will reflect the most impactful points. We also offer a series of textual revisions below that will strengthen the paper.</p><p>We appreciate that this is a large list but feel that all of the following points can and should be addressed with text revisions.</p><p>1) The authors determined which of their 83 candidates overlapped with FMRP targets and with the SAFARI database of autism spectrum-associated genes, but they did not report which of these genes are novel candidate plasticity genes and which had been identified in previous screens for candidate plasticity genes. What percentage of the proteins that they identified were novel, and what percentage were already known to be activity-regulated? This is important for establishing the significance of the unbiased screen.</p><p>2) The mRNAs identified by FRMP Clip can't really be called ASD genes. This should be reserved for proteins that actually are implicated in autism (the SFARI database), not indirectly proposed as candidates because they are regulated by FMRP. Indeed, since a reasonable number of FMRP clipped targets are in the SFARI database, the result of an enrichment in CLIP targets, but not SFARI targets suggests enrichment for a set of FMRP targets that are not implicated in autism.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> is the image shown from a control cell?</p><p>4) There are several issues with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Firstly, representative images of western blots should be included. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B and 2C</xref> are very unclear. Why is eIF3A only shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and not 2B? The statistical analysis should use ANOVA and not t-test since multiple samples are being compared. Also, there are no lines to indicate which samples are being compared to each other so the stars above each column for p values are ambiguous.</p><p>5) For the proteomic screen, it should be explicitly stated how many animals were used and how many repeats were done in the main text or in the Figure legends. This information is suggested in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and can be found by reading the Materials and methods section very carefully but it is too important to be difficult to figure out.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> has no error bars or statistical analysis. Were multiple cells imaged per animal? Again, what is the n? ANOVA should be used instead of a t-test. The way the data is presented in the Figure legend of 7B,C is appropriate and all the legends in the manuscript should include this type of information.</p><p>7) In Subsection âBlocking both protein translation and RNA splicing has profound effects on visual experience-dependent structural and behavioral plasticityâ please clarify how dendritic growth rate is measured.</p><p>8) There are confusing statements about Fus alternative splicing without any explanation. Why was the splice junction targeted, what are the splice variants, what splice is remaining here? This should be explained.</p><p>9) While the observation of changes in growth were only down in the electroporated cells, changes in behavior presumably require electroporation of a large percentage of the tectal neurons. This should be discussed or explained.</p><p>10). Based on the time points that the authors have used, only a subset of proteins that are likely to be important for translation-dependent plasticity have probably been identified and this would miss many proteins that are synthesized quickly and then degraded, such as Arc and BDNF. Indeed, this same group examined a subset of selected proteins for increases in AHA-labeling acutely after learning (30 minutes of training, 2 hours afterwards), somewhat shorter than the time course examined here (4 hours afterwards). Relatively strong increases in CAMKII, GAD65, MEK1 and HDAC were observed. These were not replicated in the present study. Indeed, they still use CAMKII as their positive control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> despite the lack of a change in their proteomics. Discussion of this is warranted.</p><p>11) There is no evidence that there is a specific increase in the translation rate of the proteins identified, as opposed to an increase in the amount of protein made due to increased transcription followed by translation. An increase in transcription and basal translation would still lead to an increase in AHA-labeling, particular in a 4 hour labelling period. Again, this needs to be discussed.</p><p>12) Knockdowns of eIF3A and Rps17 are likely to decrease overall protein synthesis and this is a confound to the interpretation of these experiments. Indeed, the authors acknowledge this (haploinsufficiency of Rps17 causes small <italic>Drosophila</italic>; large effects on translation with knockdowns of eIF3A). However, whether or not the morpholinos cause a change in overall translation is not measured by the applicants (i.e. AHA labeling with immunocytochemistry comparing knockdown cells to adjoining cells without the knockdown). Since the plasticity requires protein synthesis, it is not clear that these experiments are not just the equivalent of adding anisomycin. A more general problem is that knocking down overall synthesis for a long period of time is not equivalent to knocking down the small increase in newly synthesized protein, since much larger changes in the proteome are induced by the manipulation than occur during memory. Both of these caveats should be discussed.</p><p>13) The methods in immunoblotting state that &quot;Outliers, defined as those with AI greater that two SDs from the mean, were excluded from the analysis of total proteins&quot;. I assumed that many animals were pooled for these experiments (30-50 tecta), so I do not understand this statement.</p><p>14) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> is never mentioned in the text.</p><p>15) It is not clear what statistical test was used to sow that the effect of the double and triple Kos were larger than the single Kos as 7 there is no statistical comparison between the CMO and triple knockout. What was the definition of a 'non-plastic' cell. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the p value for the 'non-significant' result needs to be given as it appears to be close to significance. This should be given for all cells, or at least a general statement such as non-significant, p&gt;0.5.

We also offer a series of textual revisions below that will strengthen the paper.</p><p>We appreciate that this is a large list but feel that all of the following points can and should be addressed with text revisions.</p><p>1) The authors determined which of their 83 candidates overlapped with FMRP targets and with the SAFARI database of autism spectrum-associated genes, but they did not report which of these genes are novel candidate plasticity genes and which had been identified in previous screens for candidate plasticity genes. What percentage of the proteins that they identified were novel, and what percentage were already known to be activity-regulated? This is important for establishing the significance of the unbiased screen.</p></disp-quote><p>Our CPP dataset did not overlap with previously reported immediate early genes or candidate plasticity genes induced by strong induction protocols, however some CPPs from our screen were recently identified in two screens for stimulus-responsive genes and proteins in mouse. We have added this to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The mRNAs identified by FRMP Clip can't really be called ASD genes. This should be reserved for proteins that actually are implicated in autism (the SFARI database), not indirectly proposed as candidates because they are regulated by FMRP. Indeed, since a reasonable number of FMRP clipped targets are in the SFARI database, the result of an enrichment in CLIP targets, but not SFARI targets suggests enrichment for a set of FMRP targets that are not implicated in autism.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, its legend and the text in the manuscript to distinguish ASD genes and FMRP targets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> is the image shown from a control cell?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. This is now mentioned in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are several issues with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Firstly, representative images of western blots should be included. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B and 2C</xref> are very unclear. Why is eIF3A only shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and not 2B? The statistical analysis should use ANOVA and not t-test since multiple samples are being compared. Also, there are no lines to indicate which samples are being compared to each other so the stars above each column for p values are ambiguous.</p></disp-quote><p>We added representative images of western blots to Figure 2DFigure.</p><p>We state in the text that eIF3A was not included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> because we couldn't detect AHA-labelled eIF3A for technical reasons. Nonetheless, eIF3A did show significant increases in total protein after VE compared to control.</p><p>There are no lines to indicate which samples are compared because each data point is the ratio of NSP expression (B) (or total CPP expression (C)) in VE samples relative to a paired control. The band intensity of each NSP candidate protein was first normalized to its BSA loading control band (which was obtained after stripping the same membrane) and then that value was normalized to the Î²-tubulin loading control band from input/total protein samples. For samples in panel C, the band intensity of each candidate protein was normalized to its Î²-tubulin loading control band. For comparison between VE and control, we calculated the ratios of normalized VE and control intensities in each set of experiments.</p><p>We used t-tests or Mann-Whitney for statistical analysis because the comparisons between control and VE treatment for each candidate protein were made from paired control and experimental samples run in parallel for each data point. This information is now included the Figure legend and Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For the proteomic screen, it should be explicitly stated how many animals were used and how many repeats were done in the main text or in the Figure legends. This information is suggested in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and can be found by reading the Materials and methods section very carefully but it is too important to be difficult to figure out.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this information to the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> has no error bars or statistical analysis. Were multiple cells imaged per animal? Again, what is the n? ANOVA should be used instead of a t-test. The way the data is presented in the Figure legend of 7B,C is appropriate and all the legends in the manuscript should include this type of information.</p></disp-quote><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, we present the proportion of all cells analyzed in each experimental condition that showed visual experience-dependent dendritic arbor growth. This type of data presentation does not include error bars. We added the following statistical analyses of these data. We analyzed the distribution using the Chi-square test of independence. The overall comparison yields a chi-square value of 28.98 and <italic>p</italic> =2.34Ã10<sup>â5</sup>, which is highly significant and indicates there is a significant difference between groups. We then examined which groups have significantly different proportions of the cells that respond to VE compared to the rest of the groups and determined p values for each comparison. In total there are 6 comparisons: Control MO vs. all others (p=0.0000026), eIF3A MO vs. all others (p=0.3772412), FUS MO vs. all others (p=0.8407727), RPS17 MO vs. all others (p=0.9773516), eIF3A MO+RPS17 MO vs. all others (p=0.2501854), and eIF3A MO+FUS MO+RPS17 MO vs. all others (p=0.0000791). <italic>P</italic> value has to be less than 0.05/6=0.0083 to be significant at the <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 level with the Bonferroni correction. Both control morpholino and triple knockdown conditions have significantly different proportions of cells that respond to VE compared to the rest of the groups. We include this information in the text (subsection âBlocking both protein translation and RNA splicing has profound effects on visual experience-dependent structural and behavioral plasticityâ), Figure legend and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>.</p><p>We have modified the legends. The data and statistical analyses for all graphs are included the Figure source data files.</p><p>Single neurons were imaged per animal for all imaging experiments, as now stated in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Subsection âBlocking both protein translation and RNA splicing has profound effects on visual experience-dependent structural and behavioral plasticityâ please clarify how dendritic growth rate is measured.</p></disp-quote><p>Dendritic growth rate is the change in total dendritic branch length (TDBL) over the 4h imaging interval, now stated in subsection âReduced synthesis of RNA splicing and protein translation machinery blocks visual experience-dependent structural plasticityâ. We also changed the y axis labels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> so that we uniformly use âGrowth Rate (Âµm/4h)â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) There are confusing statements about Fus alternative splicing without any explanation. Why was the splice junction targeted, what are the splice variants, what splice is remaining here? This should be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>The FUS MO we used in this study is the same as the fusMO4 previously described (Dichmann and Harland, 2012). fusMO4 targets the first splice donor site of <italic>fus</italic>mRNA and is predicted to cause inclusion of intron 1 and reduce the amount of both <italic>fus-a</italic> and <italic>fus-b</italic> splice variants by premature termination (Dichmann and Harland, 2012). To evaluate MO efficiency, we used RTâPCR with primers covering the first four exons. We added this information to the Results section and the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) While the observation of changes in growth were only down in the electroporated cells, changes in behavior presumably require electroporation of a large percentage of the tectal neurons. This should be discussed or explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We refer to our previous work demonstrating widespread delivery of morpholinos by electroporation and that this allows investigation of circuit function and behavior (subsection âBlocking both protein translation and RNA splicing has profound effects on visual experience-dependent structural and behavioral plasticityâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10). Based on the time points that the authors have used, only a subset of proteins that are likely to be important for translation-dependent plasticity have probably been identified and this would miss many proteins that are synthesized quickly and then degraded, such as Arc and BDNF. Indeed, this same group examined a subset of selected proteins for increases in AHA-labeling acutely after learning (30 minutes of training, 2 hours afterwards), somewhat shorter than the time course examined here (4 hours afterwards). Relatively strong increases in CAMKII, GAD65, MEK1 and HDAC were observed. These were not replicated in the present study. Indeed, they still use CAMKII as their positive control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> despite the lack of a change in their proteomics. Discussion of this is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We now discuss caveats mentioned in this and the following 2 comments in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) There is no evidence that there is a specific increase in the translation rate of the proteins identified, as opposed to an increase in the amount of protein made due to increased transcription followed by translation. An increase in transcription and basal translation would still lead to an increase in AHA-labeling, particular in a 4 hour labelling period. Again, this needs to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We discuss this point in subsection âProteomic Analysis of NSP Dynamicsâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Knockdowns of eIF3A and Rps17 are likely to decrease overall protein synthesis and this is a confound to the interpretation of these experiments. Indeed, the authors acknowledge this (haploinsufficiency of Rps17 causes small Drosophila; large effects on translation with knockdowns of eIF3A). However, whether or not the morpholinos cause a change in overall translation is not measured by the applicants (i.e. AHA labeling with immunocytochemistry comparing knockdown cells to adjoining cells without the knockdown). Since the plasticity requires protein synthesis, it is not clear that these experiments are not just the equivalent of adding anisomycin. A more general problem is that knocking down overall synthesis for a long period of time is not equivalent to knocking down the small increase in newly synthesized protein, since much larger changes in the proteome are induced by the manipulation than occur during memory. Both of these caveats should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We added data assessing overall protein synthesis in the optic tectum using fluorescent non-canonical amino acid tagging (FUNCAT) to visualize <italic>in vivo</italic> AHA-labeled NSPs in the optic tectum (subsection âBlocking both protein translation and RNA splicing has profound effects on visual experience-dependent structural and behavioral plasticityâ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These experiments show that eIF3A and RPS17 knockdown individually or in combination do not result in overall decreases in protein synthesis, suggesting that the effects of eIF3A and RPS17 knockdown in visual experience-dependent structural plasticity are not due to large scale decreases in protein synthesis. We discuss both of the caveats mentioned in subsection âProteomic Analysis of NSP Dynamicsâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The methods in immunoblotting state that &quot;Outliers, defined as those with AI greater that two SDs from the mean, were excluded from the analysis of total proteins&quot;.
