The structure of the ATG14-containing PI3KC3-C1 was determined by single-particle EM, revealing a V-shaped architecture. All of the ordered domains of VPS34, VPS15, and BECN1 were mapped by MBP tagging. The dynamics of the complex were defined using hydrogen–deuterium exchange, revealing a novel 20-residue ordered region C-terminal to the VPS34 C2 domain. VPS15 organizes the complex and serves as a bridge between VPS34 and the ATG14:BECN1 subcomplex. Dynamic transitions occur in which the lipid kinase domain is ejected from the complex and VPS15 pivots at the base of the V. The N-terminus of BECN1, the target for signaling inputs, resides near the pivot point. These observations provide a framework for understanding the allosteric regulation of lipid kinase activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05115.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05115.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05115.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To survive starvation and other hard times, cells have developed a unique recycling strategy: they can scavenge the resources they need from within the cell itself. To do this, the cell forms a double-layered envelope around particular sections of the cell to seal them off from the rest. Then, the contents of the envelope are taken apart and the resulting raw materials are sent elsewhere in the cell where they can be used as required. This process is called autophagy.</p><p>In more complex organisms like humans, autophagy can have additional roles. One of the key proteins involved in autophagy—called BECN1—suppresses the growth of tumors, and the gene that makes BECN1 is missing in 40–70% of human breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Autophagy may also help to prevent Huntington's disease and other similar conditions by stopping disease-causing proteins or broken cell parts from building up inside brain cells.</p><p>The BECN1 protein does not work alone. Instead, it becomes part of a group, or ‘complex’, of several proteins that are required to form the envelope made during autophagy. However, the three-dimensional structure of the protein complex is unclear.</p><p>Baskaran et al. used electron microscopy and other techniques to investigate this structure and found that the complex forms a V shape with two arms, which is held together by its largest protein, VPS15. This protein also acts as a bridge between BECN1 and another protein that is a target for new cancer drugs, called VPS34.</p><p>Next, Baskaran et al. used a different set of techniques to determine how the complex moves. This revealed that many of the connections between proteins in the complex are flexible. However, one of the arms is inflexible and this limits the ability of the VPS34 protein to move. Understanding this structural constraint may help us to design drugs that are able to target the protein complex more efficiently.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05115.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05115.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>three dimensional electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>hydrogen–deuterium exchange</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>lipid kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM111730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hurley</surname><given-names>James H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nogales</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stanley</surname><given-names>Robin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005137</institution-id><institution>L'Oreal USA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Women in Science Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stanley</surname><given-names>Robin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Long-Term Fellowship (LT001037/2011-L)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carlson</surname><given-names>Lars-Anders</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first three-dimensional structure of the PI3KC3 complex I, which is involved in autophagy, provides a framework for understanding the allosteric regulation of lipid kinase activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macroautophagy (hereafter, ‘autophagy’) is a conserved eukaryotic pathway for cellular self-preservation through cellular self-consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mizushima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rubinsztein et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reggiori and Klionsky, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Green and Levine, 2014</xref>). The most ancient role for autophagy is surviving during starvation. Bulk cytosol is captured in a growing double membrane structure termed the phagophore. Upon sealing, the resulting double membrane vesicle is known as an autophagosome. The autophagosome fuses with the lysosome or vacuole, resulting in the degradation of its contents and the recycling of biosynthetic precursors by export across the lysosomal membrane. In higher eukaryotes, autophagy has acquired many additional roles in cellular protection. For example, the core autophagy protein BECN1 (Beclin 1) is a tumor suppressor. <italic>BECN1</italic> is deleted in 40–75% of human breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liang et al., 1999</xref>). Autophagy is also thought, under most conditions, to protect cells from the accumulation of pathogenic inclusions that can lead to Huntington's, Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rubinsztein et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nixon, 2013</xref>).</p><p>During the initiation of autophagy, an autophagy-specific form of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex (PI3KC3-C1) is activated and recruited to the site of phagophore nucleation. Class III PI3Ks synthesize phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) from phosphatidylinositol (PI), as compared to the class I and II PI3Ks that generate PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Backer, 2008</xref>). In yeast, where the complex was first characterized, there are two PI 3-kinase complexes, known as complexes I and II, with clear-cut distinctions in their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kihara et al., 2001</xref>). Both yeast complexes contain the core subunits Vps34, Vps15, and Atg6. Vps34 contains the catalytic domain responsible for lipid kinase activity, as well as a putative lipid-binding C2 domain and a helical domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schu et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miller et al., 2010</xref>). Vps15 is a large (150 kDa) protein essential for the activity of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stack et al., 1993</xref>). Vps15 contains a protein kinase domain whose function and possible substrates are uncertain, as well as HEAT and WD40 repeats. Atg6 is the yeast ortholog of the human tumor suppressor BECN1 and contains an intrinsically disordered region, a coiled coil, and a BARA domain. Yeast complex I further contains the coiled coil subunit Atg14 and is the complex that is involved in autophagy initiation. Yeast complex II contains instead another coiled coil protein, Vps38, and functions in endosome maturation.</p><p>The yeast complexes are prototypes of two human PI 3-kinase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Volinia et al., 1995</xref>), which both contain the common core subunits VPS34 (also known as PI3KC3), VPS15, and BECN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Backer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Funderburk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He and Levine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wirth et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The human cognate of PI3KC3 complex I contains ATG14 (also known as ATG14L or BARKOR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Itakura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matsunaga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhong et al., 2009</xref>). We will refer to this complex as PI3KC3-C1. ATG14 is specifically recruited to sites of autophagosome initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matsunaga et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fogel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graef et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hamasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wirth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ge et al., 2014</xref>). A second human PI3KC3 contains, in place of ATG14, the UV resistance-associated gene product, UVRAG. We will refer to this complex as PI3KC3-C2. PI3KC3-C2 has been proposed to function at later stages in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liang et al., 2006</xref>) but is not currently thought to participate in the initiation of autophagosome biogenesis. The overall objective of this study was to define the architecture of the two human PI3KC3 complexes. One aspect of the larger goal was to ascertain whether there are gross structural differences between PI3KC3-C1 and -C2 that might affect their relative ability to target the ER and initiate autophagy.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05115.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reconstitution and 3D reconstruction of the PI3KC3-C1 complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain structures of the four subunits of PI3KC3-C1.

To date, crystal structures have been obtained for the catalytic core and helical domains of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Vps34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miller et al., 2010</xref>), the WD40 propeller domain of yeast Vps15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heenan et al., 2009</xref>), the coiled coil domain of human BECN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2012</xref>), and the BARA domains of yeast and human Atg6/BECN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Noda et al., 2012</xref>). Structures of homologs of the Vps34 C2 domain and the Vps15 HEAT repeats and protein kinase domains are available. These various regions have to work together in a single complex in autophagy initiation. Currently, there are essentially no data on the structure of the 361.8 kDa quaternary assembly of these subunits with each other in PI3KC3-C1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hurley and Schulman, 2014</xref>). We view this information as essential, if we are to begin to understand how autophagy is initiated and how it is regulated and to address the potential for therapeutic modulation of PI3KC3-C1.</p><p>To this end, we reconstituted active human PI3KC3-C1 and PI3KC3-C2 by co-expression of all four subunits and imaged the complex by electron microscopy (EM). The complexes are elongated, loosely connected, and dynamic; yet by careful selection of class averages and Bayesian data processing, we were able to generate a three-dimensional reconstruction of PI3KC3-C1 at 28-Å resolution. We have mapped the positions of the various domains of the subunits by tagging with maltose binding protein (MBP). Insight into large-scale conformational fluctuations of PI3KC3-C1 was obtained from EM, while local dynamics was mapped by hydrogen–deuterium exchange. Taken together, the data led us to a model for the subunit architecture and dynamics of PI3KC3-C1. The main architectural principles also hold for the PI3KC3-C2 complex. The structural model suggests that the VPS15 kinase domain acts as a latch to regulate PI 3-kinase activity in both the PI3KC3-C1 and -C2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reconstitution and imaging of PI3KC3-C1</title><p>In order to generate sufficient quantities of compositionally homogeneous PI3KC3-C1, synthetic DNA constructs encoding VPS34, VPS15, BECN1, and ATG14 were co-transfected in HEK293 cells.

The N-terminus of scaffolding VPS15 subunit is located near the C-terminus of VPS34 in the right arm. Finally, the N-terminus of ATG14 is near that of BECN1. Strikingly, this suggests that the BECN1 and ATG14 coiled coils must be parallel to each other, in contrast to the antiparallel coiled coil described for the BECN1 homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Three-dimensional subunit architecture of PI3KC3-C1</title><p>Given the added guidance provided by MBP tags, we docked the known crystal structures or homology models of the structured domains of VPS34, VPS15, and BECN1 on to the density and the docked volume accounted for 65% of the total density.

The helical and catalytic domains of VPS34 are integrated into a single structural unit referred to as the ‘HELCAT’ region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miller et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which matches in size and shape the density identified near the C-terminal MBP tag in this subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4B and 5C</xref>).

The remaining large density features were assigned to VPS15, beginning with the N-terminally tagged kinase domain. A homology model for the VPS15 kinase catalytic domain was derived from the structure of protein kinase A (PKA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knighton et al., 1991</xref>). The model was docked into a major density feature adjoining the position of the tag and matching its size and shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4B and 5C</xref>). A model for the 498-residue HEAT repeat domain of VPS15 was generated by threading the corresponding sequence onto the backbone of the HEAT repeat portion of the exportin subunit Cse1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsuura and Stewart, 2004</xref>) and provided an excellent match to the arch-shaped density adjoining the C-terminus of the VPS15 kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4B and 5C</xref>). Indeed, the kinase and HEAT repeat domains of VPS15 seem to be fused into a single contiguous unit. The most C-terminal domain of VPS15, the WD40 propeller region, is connected to the HEAT by a 180-residue linker. This propeller was assigned to the last unaccounted for density feature, located next to the BECN1 BARA domain, which has a donut-like shape that matches the crystal structure of the yeast Vps15 propeller domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heenan et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4B and 5C</xref>). Collectively, the docked or assigned regions of the VPS34 C2 and HELCAT, VPS15 kinase, HEAT, and WD40, BECN1 BARA domains account for 2162 residues of the 3187 present in ATG14–PI3KC3.</p><p>Two long, narrow tubes of density are present in the area where the ATG14 and BECN1 coiled coil regions would be expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,D</xref> third panel, see arrows). One tube is adjacent to the VPS15 WD40 domain. It points towards the BECN1 BARA domain at one end and towards the second tube at the other. Following a gap in the density between the two tubes, the second one continues until it merges with the density for the VPS15 HEAT domains. The BARA domain marks the C-terminus of the BECN1 coiled-coil, and MBP marks the N-termini of ATG14 and BECN1 coils, so we assigned this region to the coiled coil dimer. Because there is a break between the two tubular regions and the BARA density, we did not build an explicit molecular model of this region. One of the few unassigned density features projects away from the VPS15 HEAT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>), very near the MBP markers for the N-termini of ATG14 and BECN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This suggests that at least parts of the N-termini of one or both of these subunits have some ordered structure.

The HDX-MS experiments together with the EM analysis highlight the dynamic nature of the complex. At the available resolution, the overall architecture is essentially the same for PI3KC3-C2 and PI3KC3-C1. The reconstruction thus provides a unified model for VPS34 complex organization. The overall structure allows us to rationalize a variety of previous data on subunit organization. The BARA domain of BECN1 is essential for the incorporation of BECN1 into the PI3KC3-C1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Furuya et al., 2005</xref>), consistent with its interactions with the VPS15 WD40 domain in the EM structure. Similarly, the ATG14 coiled coil region is essential for its association with VPS34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Itakura et al., 2008</xref>), consistent with the interactions of both the ATG14 coiled coil and VPS34 with the central VPS15 scaffold. The C2 domain of VPS34 was previously shown to be the main locus for the incorporation of VPS34 into the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liang et al., 2006</xref>). This fits with the structural observation that VPS34-C2 is integral to the core architecture, while the C-terminal HELCAT region is readily dislodged. An interaction was reported between the C-terminal helix of VPS34 and the VPS15 kinase-HEAT region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Budovskaya et al., 2002</xref>), consistent with the contacts we observed between the kinase domains of VPS15 and VPS34. The C-terminal helix of VPS34 is critically involved in membrane interaction upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miller et al., 2010</xref>), and this raises the interesting speculation that VPS34 could be regulated via inter-subunit sequestration of the same helix. The congruence of the size and shape of density features with subunit domains, the connectivity of the domains within VPS34 and VPS15, the localization of the tags, and the consistency with published interactions all lend high confidence to our structural assignments and the defined architecture of the complex.</p><p>The 2D class averages highlight the globally dynamic nature of the VPS34 HELCAT module relative to the rest of the complex. Many of these class averages show that VPS34-HELCAT is dislodged from the rest of the complex, even though the rest of the complex is intact. The class averages also provide some insight into the nature of the motions. It should be emphasized that, while there is evidence for domain movements, the exact extent and direction of the movements are unknown. The range of movements may be constrained in our experiments by the presence of the carbon film on which the complex is imaged. Thus, the movements noted here may be a subset of the range that could occur in solution. VPS34-HELCAT makes contacts principally with the kinase domain of VPS15. In many of the class averages, the VPS15 kinase domain pivots toward the other arm of the V. The pivoting motion includes the VPS15 HEAT repeat domain. Thus the VPS15 kinase and HEAT regions function as a single module. By analogy to the HELCAT terminology for VPS34, we refer to it as the KINHEAT module. VPS15 is not obviously a pseudokinase on the basis of its sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>), yet there is no compelling evidence that VPS15 can phosphorylate substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Backer, 2008</xref>). The VPS15-KINHEAT physically contacts the VPS34-HELCAT region, which suggests that regulation could occur through direct and stable interactions without covalent phosphorylation.</p><p>While the V-shaped PI3KC3-C1 complex flexes on a large scale, the EM and HDX data also show that there are limits to the types of motions that occur. The HDX data show that the VPS15 HEAT-WD40 linker is essentially completely disordered, yet the WD40 domain is firmly lodged in the complex in all class averages. The WD40 is thus clearly not undergoing tethered diffusion or ‘fly-casting’ in the context of the assembled complex. The only part of the structure that we observed to undergo fly-casting is the VPS34 HELCAT module. Even in this case, the motions are constrained. Although the linker between the VPS34 C2 and helical domains spans 130 residues, the presence of the anchored CHIL domain in the center of this linker sharply restricts the range of motion. There are ∼50–65 residues between the CHIL and the boundaries of the nearest ordered modules, which would limit the maximum reach of the fully extended linker to ∼20 nm. This is consistent with the maximum 18 nm displacement of the HELCAT region seen in EM images.</p><p>It is striking that no direct contacts are seen between the ATG14 and BECN1 module and VPS34. Given the resolution of the reconstruction, it is certainly possible that direct interactions exist though they were not visualized. Nevertheless, the structure highlights a central and extensive role for VPS15 in scaffolding and bridging between the ATG14:BECN1 regulatory subcomplex and the VPS34 catalytic subunit. VPS15 is capable of pivoting about the KINHEAT-WD40 junction. The base of the V is mainly formed from the HEAT repeats of VPS15. The base of the V is also the locus for the unstructured or unresolved N-terminal regions of ATG14 and BECN1.</p><p>Most of the known signaling inputs into PI3KC3-C1 converge on the N-terminus of BECN1. This region is subject to activating phosphorylations by the upstream autophagy initiating kinase ULK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Russell et al., 2013</xref>) and the AMP-activated kinase AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). The BECN1 BH3 domain responsible for binding to Bcl-2, which inhibits autophagy, is located in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pattingre et al., 2005</xref>). Along the same lines, a Cys-rich region of ATG14 immediately N-terminal to the coiled coil has been proposed to be the site of ER targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matsunaga et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, this region of the PI3KC3-C1 structure might act as an allosteric reporter for localization to the ER membrane. It is tempting to speculate that the right arm of the complex transmits signals from the region of the BECN1 N-terminus to the VPS34 lipid kinase domain. It is exciting to finally have a structural context in which to test how the many signals that impinge on BECN1 and PI3KC3-C1 are processed.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The full length DNAs encoding VPS15, VPS34, BECN1, ATG14, and UVRAG were codon optimized for expression in HEK293 cells. Synthetic genes encoding VPS15, VPS34, BECN1 DNAs were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pCAG vector coding for an N-terminal twin-STREP-FLAG tag using KpnI and XhoI restriction sites. The ATG14 and UVRAG DNAs were cloned in the pLEXm vector encoding an N-terminal GST tag followed by TEV restriction site.

The 2D class averages thus generated served as templates for subsequent automated particle selection. Template-based automated particle picking was performed using the FindEM program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roseman, 2004</xref>). The contrast transfer functions (CTFs) of the micrographs were estimated using the CTFFIND for untilted images and CTFTILT for tilted images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mindell and Grigorieff, 2003</xref>). CTF correction of the micrographs was performed by Wiener filter using ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mallick et al., 2005</xref>) for the micrographs used for subunit localization and by tilt- and position-dependent phase flipping using EMAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ludtke et al., 1999</xref>) for micrographs used for the 3D reconstructions. Particles were extracted using a 192 × 192 (T12) or 256 × 256 (F20) pixel box size and binned by a factor of 2. Each particle was normalized to remove pixels whose values were above or below 4.5 σ of the mean pixel value using the XMIPP normalization program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scheres et al., 2008</xref>). In order to remove incorrectly selected protein aggregates or other artifacts, images whose mean or standard deviation deviated a lot from the typical values of the dataset were removed. The remaining particles were subjected to five rounds of iterative classification using a topology-representing network and 2D MRA in IMAGIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Heel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ogura et al., 2003</xref>). The resulting 2D class averages were manually inspected to remove protein aggregates, contaminants, lower-resolution classes, as well as particles with a dislodged VPS34 HELCAT domain. The remaining particles were subjected to another five rounds of classification and MRA to produce the final 2D class averages, each being calculated from an average of 200–250 raw images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>EM analysis of tagged complexes</title><p>Datasets consisting of 53,649, 36,997, 3799, 20,065, 40,854, and 12,804 particles were collected for the MBP-VPS34, VPS34-MBP, MBP-BECN1, BECN1-MBP, MBP-ATG14, and MBP-VPS15, respectively. For the subunit and domain localization, reference-free 2D class averages were generated as described above for each tagged dataset and the native dataset. Class averages from each dataset were grouped by projection matching to re-projections of a filtered reference volume of the native complex using SPIDER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shaikh et al., 2008</xref>). The corresponding class averages in the different projection groups of the native and tagged datasets were manually examined to locate the position of the tag. For the difference map generation class averages in the same projection group were individually normalized and the native class averages were subtracted from the tagged class averages. Extra density for the MBP tags was clearly visible in 31% of the class averages for MBP-VPS34, 9.1% for VPS34-MBP, 10% for MBP-BECN1, 23.5% for BECN1-MBP, 14% for MBP-ATG14, and 3.6% for MBP-VPS15.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Three-dimensional structure determination</title><p>An ab initio structure was determined by random conical tilt (RCT) using SPIDER routines integrated into Appion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Radermacher et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lander et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, 23 tilt-pair images yielded an initial dataset of 12,027 tilt-pair particles. The untilted particles were aligned and classified in 2D using reference-free classification and MRA as described above, followed by a single round of 2D reference-based alignment using Spider's AP MQ command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frank et al., 1996</xref>). The final 14 classes ranged from 725 to 1198 untilted particles each and class-volumes were calculated from the matching tilted particles by backprojection. The class-volumes were then refined against the entire dataset (both tilted and untilted) using an iterative projection matching procedure combining SPARX and EMAN2 libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldwin and Penczek, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tang et al., 2007</xref>). Each class-volume that corresponded to the whole complex converged to the same 3D reconstruction (with a final resolution of 27–30 Å, according to the FSC at 0.5 cutoff criterion). This map was used as the starting model for all subsequent structure refinements. Structure refinement was performed using images acquired at 0°, 30°, and 45°. The initial particle selection gave 109,776 particles at 0°, 24,085 at 30°, and 25,694 at 45°. Reference-free 2D class averages were calculated as described above, with images recorded at different tilt angles treated separately to allow assessment of tilt-dependent orientations and image quality. Initial attempts to perform 3D classification using RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scheres, 2012</xref>) with respect to the position on the VPS34 HELCAT region did not result in robust 3D classes. Thus, particles belonging to class averages of lower resolution, as well as class averages with a dislodged VPS34 HELCAT region, were excluded from further processing. This resulted in a dataset of 24,116 particles at 0°, 8643 at 30°, and 5986 at 45°. The final structure (deposited at EMDB with accession number 2846) was calculated using a single 3D class in RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scheres, 2012</xref>), with the main RCT structure low-pass filtered to 80 Å as initial reference. The distribution of Euler angles assigned by RELION was visualized with UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). The structure had a resolution of 28 Å according to the gold standard FSC criterion as implemented in RELION and was used for docking of homology models of domains. The density map was further validated by tilt-pair analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</xref>) with image pairs collected at 0° and 15° using software made available by John Rubinstein (U Toronto).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior Editor), a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The study presents a significant step forward towards a structural understanding of the autophagy process. Despite the fact that the structure is of low resolution and mechanistic insights are limited, it is of significant interest as it is technically challenging and many difficulties in complex preparation and image analysis had to be overcome.</p><p>Substantive concerns:</p><p>1) The inherent limitations of the EM data quality are not discussed. These limitations should be made clear to a wider audience, as the current presentation may be misleading for non-specialists. For example, the map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) appears to be distorted in one direction, which is likely the combined result of preferential orientation, missing views, and flattening in negative stain. In addition, the missing cone makes the map resolution anisotropic. As a result, the WD40 domain envelope is much wider than expected from the fit. A more thorough discussion of resolution anisotropy is needed.</p><p>2) The stated resolution of 26 Å appears to be an overestimate, perhaps again as a result of anisotropy. Although the WD40 propeller is resolved, the resolution of other map regions is likely to be significantly lower, given the dynamic nature of the complex. Currently, the FSC up to 1/40 Å is about 1 and drops abruptly to 0.143 within 5 Fourier pixels. This RELION-specific is hardly appropriate for low resolution maps in negative stain. The FSC should be recalculated by adjusting the low-resolution cutoff to lower spatial frequencies for a more realistic falloff in resolution. Alternatively, a more conservative mask may provide a more realistic resolution estimate.</p><p>3) The presentation of the model, which has several major gaps and uncertainties, is overconfident (e.g. “it was possible to account for almost all of the EM density” or “Having assigned nearly all of the electron density features to known well-ordered regions”). Furthermore, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> parts of the model are color-coded, for which there are no atomic models (cf <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> should be revised to leave unassigned densities white. As the exact orientations and connections of the domains are uncertain, the most appropriate presentation of the model is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, which highlights the tags that have been used to locate the domains. The legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C and D</xref> should state that at the current resolution, the fit of the x-ray structures can be only approximate. Moreover, the authors should quantify the percentage of the EM volume that is reliably accounted for by atomic models.</p><p>4) Some of the apparent dynamic behaviour of the complex may simply be the result of carbon film/specimen interactions in negative stain. For example, the images show that the movement of the Vps34 HELCAT domain is limited to in-plane rotation parallel to the carbon film, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref> presents a schematic model that suggests a functional role of this particular movement. It should be made clear that, while there is evidence for domain movements, the exact extent and direction of the movement is unknown.</p><p>5) Only about 50% of the complexes form a V-shape. In other class averages, the HEAT-repeat and kinase domain portion of Vps34 is dislodged/separated from the rest of the complex and VPS15 pivots at its position at the base of the V. The authors interpret these changes either as the complex falling apart (this happens to lots of complexes on an EM grid) or else, and this model is very extensively developed, flexibility indicating allosteric communication via the VPS15 HEAT repeat domain. There is, however, no data that supports the latter possibility over the former at this stage.</p><p>6) The highly speculative discussion of allostery should be shortened. As the evidence for allostery is very weak, the authors should remove or at least tone down the last sentence of the abstract (“This suggests a mechanism for the allosteric communication via the kinase and HEAT domains of VPS15”).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05115.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The inherent limitations of the EM data quality are not discussed.

Alternatively, a more conservative mask may provide a more realistic resolution estimate</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the default of 1/40Å as a de facto starting point for the gold standard FSC calculation was not ideal in this case. We recalculated the FSC, averaging half-maps up to 1/60Å and updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> accordingly. While the new FSC curve looks very similar, the recalculation changed the nominal resolution to 27.5 Å, and we have updated the text accordingly. As for the mask, we would like to note that the only mask used during the structure calculation was a spherical mask with a soft edge as implemented in RELION and a radius of 166 Å. This mask will not artificially boost the resolution calculation.</p><p><italic>3) The presentation of the model, which has several major gaps and uncertainties, is overconfident (e.g. “it was possible to account for almost all of the EM density” or “Having assigned nearly all of the electron density features to known well-ordered regions”).

A density map was generated for the integrated docked PDB structure model and the volume of the density was computed in chimera, with the threshold of the volume manually set so that the surface coincided with the docked PDB structure model. The calculated density accounted for 65% of the actual experimental density volume. The text mentioned has been modified. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> has been redone to leave the unaccounted density regions in grey as suggested by the reviewers. The region assigned to the coiled coil is now colored white, since it was not fitted with an atomic model. We have retained the label “CC”, however, since we are confident of the assignment.</p><p><italic>4) Some of the apparent dynamic behaviour of the complex may simply be the result of carbon film/specimen interactions in negative stain. For example, the images show that the movement of the Vps34 HELCAT domain is limited to in-plane rotation parallel to the carbon film, but</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9C</italic></xref> <italic>presents a schematic model that suggests a functional role of this particular movement. It should be made clear that, while there is evidence for domain movements, the exact extent and direction of the movement is unknown</italic>.</p><p>These are excellent points and we have taken the liberty of paraphrasing some of the wording above in the second paragraph of the discussion.</p><p><italic>5) Only about 50% of the complexes form a V-shape. In other class averages, the HEAT-repeat and kinase domain portion of Vps34 is dislodged/separated from the rest of the complex and VPS15 pivots at its position at the base of the V. The authors interpret these changes either as the complex falling apart (this happens to lots of complexes on an EM grid) or else, and this model is very extensively developed, flexibility indicating allosteric communication via the VPS15 HEAT repeat domain. There is, however, no data that supports the latter possibility over the former at this stage</italic>.</p><p>As described below under point 6, we have sharply reduced the amount of speculation on the possible role of VPS15 in transmitting signals. What remains is explicitly couched as speculation.</p><p><italic>6) The highly speculative discussion of allostery should be shortened. As the evidence for allostery is very weak, the authors should remove or at least tone down the last sentence of the abstract (“This suggests a mechanism for the allosteric communication via the kinase and HEAT domains of VPS15”)</italic>.</p><p>The last sentence of the abstract was modified per this suggestion. The speculations about the detailed mechanism of allostery in the discussion were consolidated into a single sentence, beginning with the phrase “It is tempting to speculate…”</p></body></sub-article></article>
