However, it remains unknown whether a given sensory memory trace is being maintained as a unitary item to associate. Here, we used conditioned taste aversion learning in the rat model, wherein animals associate a novel taste with visceral nausea, and demonstrate that there are two parallel memory traces of a novel taste: a short-duration robust trace, lasting approximately 3 hr, and a parallel long-duration weak one, lasting up to 8 hr, and dependent on the strong trace for its formation. Moreover, only the early robust trace is maintained by a NMDAR-dependent CaMKII- AMPAR pathway in the insular cortex. These findings suggest that a memory trace undergoes rapid modifications, and that the mechanisms underlying trace associative learning differ when items in the memory are experienced at different time points.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07582.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07582.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07582.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The survival of animals, including us humans, depends on the ability to discriminate good food from bad. We would prefer eating a given taste if it did not cause any negative feelings after eating it for the first time; however, we would avoid eating that specific taste if it caused any digestive discomfort. This ability to connect sensory events that happen close in time is called associative learning.</p><p>One longstanding theory of associative learning suggests that if the neurons that are activated by a taste fire at the same time as those that control nausea, the connections between the two groups of neurons are strengthened. This helps that particular taste to become associated with the feeling of illness. Animals can also link events that are separated in time – for example, they can become averse to a food even when its ill effects are felt several hours after eating it. An important question is how a new event (such as a new food) is internally represented and maintained for a certain time so that it associates with a response (sickness) that occurs much later.</p><p>One method used to investigate associative learning is to feed rats a new food, and then later make them feel nauseous to measure how much this causes them to avoid the food in the future. The gustatory cortex is the part of the brain responsible for perceiving taste.</p><p>Chinnakkaruppan and Rosenblum now use this experimental method to investigate the molecular mechanisms in the gustatory cortex that enable the internal representation (or memory trace) of a new taste to be associated with an unwell feeling that occurs much later.</p><p>The results of the experiments show that rats will avoid food with a certain flavor if they feel unwell within eight hours of eating it. However, the response of the rats differs depending on when the rat becomes ill. Underpinning these behaviors is the formation of two parallel internal representations of the new taste: a short-term, robust trace that lasts for three hours; and a parallel, longer lasting, weaker trace that lasts for eight hours to associate the taste with its outcome. The weaker, longer-lasting memory trace only forms if the shorter, stronger trace also occurs.</p><p>Chinnakkaruppan and Rosenblum found that forming the shorter, stronger memory requires the activity of a signaling pathway in the gustatory cortex that involves biochemical molecules called NMDAR-CaMKII-GluA1. These molecules can increase the strength of signaling between neurons and are already implicated in learning and memory. The next challenge is to put this newly identified molecular mechanism within the relevant neural circuit in the gustatory cortex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07582.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07582.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>consolidation</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>multiple memory trace</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Israeli Science Foundation Legacy Heritage</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1315/09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenblum</surname><given-names>Kobi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001736</institution-id><institution>German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO3971/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenblum</surname><given-names>Kobi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1003/12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenblum</surname><given-names>Kobi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The role of CaMKII-GluA1 in the cortex in maintaining a given taste memory trace for an aversive association has been elucidated.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Association between events in time and space is a major mechanism for all animals, including humans, to learn about the world, which can potentially change their behavior in future circumstances. The most influential books concerning learning theory published early in the 20th century were <italic>Animal Intelligence (1911),</italic> wherein Thorndike proposed that the rate of learning diminishes as the interval between response and discomfort/satisfaction is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thorndike, 1911</xref>), and <italic>Conditioned Reflexes (1927),</italic> wherein Pavlov highlighted that a connection is formed in the nervous system, not between a conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US) separated in time, but between the sensory aftereffects, i.e., trace of the CS, and the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pavlov, 1927</xref>). Thus, in essence, these theories mention that temporal contiguity has a vital influence on associative learning.</p><p>The prevailing dogma for cellular mechanisms underlying associative learning is based on modifications of Hebb’s pioneering cell assembly theory (1949) which posits that ‘cells which fire together, wire together', and thus the firing cells epitomize the internal representations of the two sensory events related in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hebb, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miltner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nabavi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johansen et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that at least in certain cases, selective facilitation of densely connected neurocircuits through excitability and/or synaptic plasticity, as a result of an experience, constitutes the basis for learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nabavi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johansen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Most of these studies have examined the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying trace associative learning processes using classical conditioning paradigms in which the association takes place within the timescale of msec to sec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johansen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kitamura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beylin et al., 2001</xref>). However, evolution has produced other type(s) of associative learning, wherein the CS and US can be experienced several minutes to hours apart. For example, the inter-time-interval (ITI) between the CS (novel taste) and the US (visceral information) in the conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm can last for hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia et al., 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalat and Rozin, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chambers, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rosenblum et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamamoto et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hashikawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adaikkan and Rosenblum, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stern et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chinnakkaruppan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parkes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sano et al., 2014</xref>).

Upper panel depicts the experimental design. (<bold>B</bold>) Rats demonstrated high aversion to a novel palatable taste upon sampling for the first time. This is referred to as neophobia, i.e., reluctance to consume a novel taste due to lack of knowledge regarding the post-ingestive consequences. However, rats exhibited less aversion upon the second and third encounter, demonstrating that taste preference is an adaptive process. This phenomenon is called attenuation of neophobia.

The long-trace CTAs were not different from an unpaired control group by extinction day4, in comparison with day7 aversion index (AI) in short-trace CTAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Reverse conditioning did not lead to taste aversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which indicates the importance of temporal order between taste and nausea in CTA learning. The strength of an association can be affected by ITI between CS and US or by the strength of US. We thus conducted an ITI-CTA with a weak US (0.025M LiCl) to test whether weaker CTA learning can be acquired when an association is made during the short- (1–3 hr) but not the long-trace (4–8 hr) intervals. We found that CTA was formed following the short-trace intervals, and interestingly, also following a 4 hr but not 5 hr trace interval. Together these results suggest that there is a shift in the associability of the taste memory trace at around 3–4 hr after exposure to the taste stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>The long ITI between CS and US in CTA is reasonable from physiological, ecological, and evolutionary perspectives. The minutes to hours process of digestion followed by absorption may dictate the animal to associate between the taste consumed and its delayed physiological consequences (for more information see reviews, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gal-Ben-Ari and Rosenblum, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kong and Singh, 2008</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that depending on the ITI there are two taste memory traces (as indicated by the behavioral readout): the first one is strong, but lasts for approximately 3 hr (short-trace), whereas the second trace is weak, but lasts for up to 8 hr (long-trace). This observation is further supported by the previous demonstration that micro-injection of the protein synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin, into the insular cortex (IC) within 3 hr but not 4 hr after the taste inhibits associative taste memory in the latent inhibition of CTA paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Merhav and Rosenblum, 2008</xref>). It is therefore plausible to hypothesize that the underlying biological mechanism(s) of taste-nausea association may differ between short- and long-trace CTAs. Next, we set out to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Given ample evidence that novel taste experience impacts the phospho-proteome in the IC (see reviews, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adaikkan and Rosenblum, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gal-Ben-Ari and Rosenblum, 2012</xref>) and the idea that calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has the potential to store information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lisman, 2014</xref> and the references therein), we aimed to test the possibility that CaMKIIα, through auto-phosphorylation (at T286; which can act as a molecular positive feedback loop), maintains the taste memory trace in the IC. Moreover, we were encouraged by the previous report that showed that novel taste consumption increases CaMKIIα expression in the IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belelovsky et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we followed up this finding and expanded it by measuring the phosphorylation/expression levels of CaMKIIα in the IC for up to 8 hr after the consumption of novel taste. We subjected IC samples of rats exposed to either water or novel taste solution (0.1% saccharin) to biochemical fractionation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stern et al., 2013</xref>), and examined the phosphorylation and expression levels of CaMKIIα in the crude synaptosomal fraction (P2-fraction) by Western-blotting analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref> and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We replicated the finding from the previous report (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), that 15 min after novel taste consumption, CaMKIIα expression is increased in the IC. Interestingly, we observed that the T286 phosphorylation of CaMKIIα (pT286CaMKIIα) was increased in the P2-fraction 30 min following novel taste consumption, persisting for up to 3 hr (1 and 3 hr), but not 5 or 8 hr afterwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07582.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Novel taste experience induces CaMKIIα phosphorylation in the IC in an NMDAR-dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design depicting biochemical fractionation from the IC after behavioral training.

Intriguingly, the temporal dynamics of pT286CaMKIIα in the IC after the novel taste experience corresponds to the short-trace timescale, indicating a possible link between CaMKIIα and short-trace CTA learning.</p><p>It is possible that NMDAR activation is upstream to CaMKIIα phosphorylation, because activation of NMDAR in the IC is crucial for taste-malaise association and NMDAR regulates CaMKIIα phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosenblum et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferreira et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanhueza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Halt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parkes et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we examined if NMDAR activation is necessary for novel taste-dependent CaMKIIα activation. Indeed, novel taste experience-induced phosphorylation of T286CaMKIIα is NMDAR-dependent, since i.p. injection of the NMDAR antagonist, MK801 (0.2 mg/kg b.w), 30 min before novel taste learning precluded phosphorylation of T286CaMKIIα in the IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref> and Figure 2—figure supplement 3). pT305CaMKIIα and total CaMKIIα levels did not differ among the water group injected with saline and the novel taste groups injected with either saline or MK801 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J,K</xref> and Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><p>Taste memory trace can persist for an association, and at the very same time can undergo sensory information processing to form incidental taste learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chinnakkaruppan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rosenberg et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the correlation between the consumption of novel taste and NMDAR-dependent T286CaMKIIα phosphorylation can serve the taste memory trace for an association, and/or incidental taste memory. In order to dissociate between these possibilities, we investigated the role of NMDAR and CaMKIIα in non-associative incidental and associative CTA learning by micro-infusing the NMDAR antagonist APV (10 μg/1 μl/hemisphere) or CaMKIIα inhibitor TatCN21 (0.3 nM/1 μl/ hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buard et al., 2010</xref>)) bilaterally into the IC. Consistent with the literature, our data reveal that NDMAR in the IC is dispensable for incidental taste learning but necessary for CTA learning (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosenblum et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barki-Harrington et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parkes et al., 2014</xref>). We also found that CaMKIIα in the IC is dispensable for incidental taste learning but necessary for CTA learning (Figure 3—figure supplement 1,2).</p><p>Given that NMDAR-dependent T286CaMKIIα phosphorylation in the IC is required specifically for CTA, we sought to test whether NMDAR-CaMKIIα signaling in the IC maintains the taste memory trace for the association with the US by infusing the respective antagonist or inhibitor into the IC at various time points between the CS and US. We micro-injected the NMDAR antagonist into the IC 25 min from the beginning of the taste consumption in 1 hr ITI-CTA conditioning with a weak US and observed an attenuated CTA memory, consistent with a previous report in which a strong US was administered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosenblum et al., 1997</xref>; but also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferreira et al., 2002</xref>) (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A). Intriguingly, we did not observe any effect when we made a similar manipulation in the IC 4 hr after the taste consumption in 5 hr ITI-CTA conditioning with a strong US (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B; all the remaining experiments were done with a strong US). Next, we micro-injected CaMKIIα inhibitor TatCN21 or Tat control (Tatcont) into the IC 25 min from the beginning of the taste consumption in short-trace 3 hr ITI-CTA conditioning, and observed an attenuated CTA memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

If this is the case, then inhibiting CaMKII 2 hr after novel taste consumption in 3 hr ITI-CTA should still impede the CS-US association. To answer this, we performed a 3 hr ITI-CTA experiment in which we micro-infused CaMKIIα inhibitor TatCN21 2 hr after the taste consumption, and administered the LiCl 1 hr later. We observed a small non-significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

However, when it encounters nausea, it forms an associative aversive taste memory (CTA). The strength of the CS or the US or the time lapse between the two or other sensory cues at the time of learning can affect the formation of the internal representation. Here, we focused on the variable of ITI between the CS and US. (<bold>B</bold>) In the present model we aim to explain the temporal constraints and biological mechanisms underlying trace-CTA. Using sodium saccharin as CS and 0.14M LiCl as strong US we found that the novel taste memory trace is generated after the consumption of novel taste, and lasts for approximately 8 hr to associate with its outcome. The associability of the taste memory trace changes at around 4 hr after the novel taste consumption with the US. Taken together, the behavioral readout with different ITIs and pharmacological manipulations of the NMDAR-CaMKIIα-GluA1 axis in the IC using different ITI-CTA training, we reason that there are two parallel taste memory traces with different underlying mechanisms: one that is robust but decays quickly (strong-trace; solid blue line) and the second trace, which is weak but lasts longer (weak-trace; dashed blue line). X-axis depicts the time in hours between the taste and malaise. Y-axis indicates the strength of the associable taste memory trace. It is possible that the weak taste-memory trace is parallel to that of the strong taste-memory trace or independent of the strong trace. Given our findings that different pharmacological manipulations in the insular cortex (APV, TatCN21, CNQX) affect the associability of the taste-memory trace when applied only during the strong-trace timescale but not in the weak taste-memory trace timescale (longer than 3 hr), we suggest that the weak-taste memory trace is parallel to that of the strong one. (<bold>C</bold>) Finally, we add the dimension of additional information registered during the association phase by additional brain areas. We propose a multiple memory systems/trace theory, which posits that CTA learning may engage multiple memory systems to take part in the long-trace associative process and that after experiencing the taste, the NMDA receptor-dependent CaMKIIα and GluA1 pathway in the insular cortex plays a critical role only during the short-trace, whereas NMDA receptors in the hippocampus play a crucial role as the time increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chinnakkaruppan et al., 2014</xref>), for the association with the US. Note that the background information/experience exists right from the CS stimulus experience but arguably they accumulate more with time.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07582.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07582.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07582-fig4-figsupp5-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>To examine whether pT286CaMKIIα is required for the increased GluA1 expression in the P2-fraction after the taste consumption, we micro-infused CaMKIIα inhibitor TatCN21 into the IC 30 min before novel taste exposure and measured GluA1 expression 1 hr later. TatCN21 application reduced novel taste experience-dependent GluA1 expression in the P2-fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Moreover, NMDAR antagonist MK801 injection 30 min before the novel taste also reduced GluA1 expression (Figure 4—figure supplement 3), indicating that NMDAR- and CaMKIIα-dependent increased synaptic expression of GluA1 in the IC mediates short-trace taste memory for the association with the US.</p><p>If indeed GluA1 in the IC mediates the taste memory trace for the association, we hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition of AMPAR following taste experience would interfere with the association with the US. Microinjection of AMPAR antagonist, CNQX, (1 μl/hemisphere; 3 nM/μl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tse et al., 2011</xref>) into the IC 1 hr after the taste consumption in short-trace 3 hr ITI-CTA conditioning attenuated the CTA memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Interestingly, CNQX micro-injection into the IC 2 hr after the taste consumption in 3 hr ITI-CTA learning also attenuated CTA memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Furthermore, microinjection of CNQX into the IC 1 hr (short-trace timescale) after the taste consumption in long-trace 5 hr ITI-CTA conditioning also attenuated the CTA memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). However, in accordance with the timescale of short-trace and CaMKIIα-GluA1 activation, we found that CNQX micro-injection 4 hr after novel taste consumption in 5 hr ITI-CTA had no effect on CTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>It is intriguing that the inhibition of CaMKIIα or AMPAR in the IC during short-trace timescale attenuated short-trace CTA memory. In addition, inhibition of the CaMKIIα-GluA1 pathway during short-trace timescale also attenuated long-trace CTA. However, long-trace CTA was not affected when CaMKIIα-GluA1 pathway in the IC was left intact for 3 hr. Together, these data reveal that there are two parallel taste memory traces which are subserved by different mechanisms: one that is robust but decays quickly, and another which is weak but lasts longer.</p><p>It is important to note that NMDAR-CaMKIIα-AMPAR in the IC are not necessary for incidental taste learning and memory, whereas muscarinic receptors are critical for incidental taste learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferreira et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parkes et al., 2014</xref>). It is interesting that different molecular mechanisms take place in the same cortex, the insular cortex, to mediate associative and non-associative taste learning and memory.</p><p>We should emphasize that different pharmacological manipulation (APV, TatCN21, CNQX) in the IC when applied within 3 hr after the CS presentation only modifies but not completely erases the CTA memory. It is also noteworthy that several previous reports demonstrate that pharmacological perturbations in the IC during CTA conditioning only partially disrupt CTA memory, and that the disrupted CTA appears similar to long-trace CTA memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rosenblum et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosenblum et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eisenberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutiérrez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barki-Harrington et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stern et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parkes et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it is possible that over time, there is a transformation from the taste memory trace dominance (i.e. short-trace) and IC dependency to multiple memory traces (i.e. during long-trace) due to the multi-channeled background experience, e,g., time, space, food digestion-dependent body physiology, etc. Such transformation, which involves multiple memory traces, for instance, episodic memory trace (how long ago the taste was consumed and under what context?), may result in a wider distribution and processing of the taste memory trace with the passage of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalat and Rozin, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Revusky, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalat and Rozin, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chinnakkaruppan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Since the initial demonstration of CTA by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia (1955),</xref> several studies have proposed that the reduced aversion index followed by the increased interval between the taste and malaise in CTA conditioning could be attributed to (i) the learned safety about the taste, (ii) accumulating background interference, and (iii) taste memory trace decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalat and Rozin, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rozin and Kalat, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Revusky, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalat and Rozin, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutiérrez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chinnakkaruppan et al., 2014</xref>). First, in support of the learned safety theory, and in line with the previous reports, we found that animals exhibit higher preference to the taste hours following the first-time experience (Figure 3—figure supplement 4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalat and Rozin, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutiérrez et al., 2003</xref>). Second, with regards to background interference theory, we propose that the multi-channeled background information can be viewed as episodic components and that, for example, the hippocampus is critical to assimilate the episodic component in CTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chinnakkaruppan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koh et al., 2009</xref>). Third, in line with the trace decay theory, our findings demonstrate that the robust short-trace fades within 3 hr in the IC but the long-trace, which is weak, lasts longer. Moreover, the non-linear decay of the short trace suggests that it dominates over the long trace, so that and when the former fades, the latter is revealed (Figure 4—figure supplement 5). We propose a multiple memory trace theory, wherein we suggest that CTA learning may engage multiple memory systems to take part in the long-trace associative process and that after experiencing the taste, the IC plays a critical role during short-trace (Figure 4—figure supplement 5).</p><p>Although multiple lines of evidence support that NMDAR-CaMKII-AMPAR signaling in the IC plays a crucial role in maintaining the short-trace for the association with the US, we do not rule out the possibility that other molecular mechanisms in the IC may participate as well in the long-trace CTA. For instance, protein acetylation, phosphorylation, and induction of proteins were observed in the IC many hours following novel taste consumption, and it is possible that these correlative molecular changes (proteins synthesis and epigenetic regulation) may contribute to the long-trace CTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Swank and Sweatt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yefet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elkobi et al., 2008</xref>; for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gal-Ben-Ari and Rosenblum, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Conceptually, on the one hand, our short-trace CTA complies with the commonly held assumption of neuroscience theories of associative learning that convergence of CS and US information onto particular cells/circuits leads to changes in synaptic strength at the synapses mediating the CS input to those commonly activated cells/circuit and that it underlies association formation, i.e. Hebbian plasticity (NMDAR-CaMKII-AMPARs in the IC probably in co-ordination with the amygdala; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yasoshima et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferreira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hashikawa et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, the long-trace CTA challenges this assumption, and it is possible that because of the multi-channeled background information with an increasing time interval as discussed above, homeostatic plasticity may play a crucial role to encode multiple memory traces via coordinating several brain structures such as the IC, amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortices in the long-trace CTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vitureira et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pozo and Goda, 2010</xref>).

CNQX disodium salt (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione disodium, Tocris, Bristol, UK) was prepared in saline to a concentration of 3 mM, aliquoted and stored in -20°C. CNQX was freshly prepared for most of the experiments or was used within 2 weeks of preparation. Before micro-injection CNQX was thawed at 40°C and injected. APV (2R-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared in saline to a final concentration of 10 μg/μl, aliquoted, and stored at -20°C. Before microinjection APV was thawed at room temperature and injected.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-4"><title>Histology</title><p>At the end of the behavioral experiments, the rats were sacrificed. The brains were removed, frozen with dry ice and kept at -80°C. Randomly chosen rats were micro-injected into the IC with 0.5 or 1 μl/min cresyl violet 30 min before sacrifice. Coronal 50-μm sections were cut in a cryostat, stained with cresyl violet, and examined with a computerized Olympus microscope camera to verify cannula placement.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All grouped data are presented as mean ± SEM. Comparisons between data of two independent groups were analyzed by unpaired Student's t test and the differences between the variances of groups were corrected following Levene’s test for equality of variances. Multiple group comparisons were assessed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and repeated-measures ANOVA. Follow-up analyses were conducted using Fisher’s least significant difference, Bonferoni, and independent sample t-tests, when significant main effects or interactions were detected. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, Friedman's test, and Mann Whitney U test were conducted when the data were non-normally distributed. Pearson’s correlation was conducted to analyze the association between GluA1 and pT286CaMKIIα. All of the comparisons were conducted using two-tailed tests of significance. The null hypothesis was rejected at the p &lt;0.05 level. Data analysis was performed using SPSS-version 19.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Ulrich Bayer for providing us TatCN21 and Tatcont peptides, Dr. Takanobu Nakazawa for pY1472GluN2B antibody, and Dr. Thomas McHugh, Dr. Genela Morris, and members of KR lab for helpful discussions.

Your full submission has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>After careful discussion among the reviewers, we found that your paper contained interesting findings, but the evidence for some key conclusions is too thin and requires a lot more work. We also felt that the rational for the two parallel memory traces are not clear. We therefore came to the conclusion that the manuscript is not suitable for <italic>eLife</italic> at this time. We hope that the comments of the reviewers are helpful in further improving the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> The authors investigate a special form of memory, conditioned taste aversion (CTA) which can be often learned in a single trial. They first describe the temporal dependence of convergence of CS and US information for successful establishment of CTA and discover two components with different dwell time and strength, the first lasting app. 3 hours, with robust retentions, while US applied later than 3 hours and until 8 hours showed significant less learning. Subsequent combination of behavioral testing with biochemical analysis showed that after novel taste experience, CaMK2 phosphorylation is increased for up to 3 hours that CaMKII activity is required in IC and that GluA1 receptor number increases.</p><p>A major claim of the authors is that the drop in learning efficacy after 3 hours signifies the presence of two parallel mechanisms of CTA acquisition, a claim that is also supported by a previous study from the same group (Merhav &amp; Kornblum, 2008) that shows that protein synthesis inhibitors have a stronger impact on CTA shorter than 3 hours. However, this claim receives overall weak support, as retention of the CS signal may simply be decaying nonlinear with time; or alternatively, the underlying processes linked to novel taste acquisition and induction of CTA crosses below a threshold for efficient learning acquisition after app. 3 hours.</p><p>The authors state that short-memory trace is required to generate the weak memory trace which lasts longer, yet the authors claim that the two memory traces are parallel. This is confusing, as when one trace requires the other one, they are by definition not parallel processes.</p><p>There are also several issues about the experimental design, in particular appropriate control experiments. For example, the authors show that MK-801 pre injection obliterated the CS impact, and the authors claim this to be a sign that NMDA receptors are required for CS induced CTA. Unfortunately, the result does not allow to distinguish whether NMDA receptors are required for learning or whether it is required for sensory perception. MK-801 as a general blocker of NMDA receptor function may affect many other aspects of CS learning including perception of taste, general sensory processing. Similar concerns relate to manipulations used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> using CNQX.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> In this paper, Chinnakkaruppan &amp; Rosenblum used behavioral, biochemical and pharmacological approaches to characterize two different, and potentially parallel, taste memory traces: a short-trace taste conditioning (1-3 h between taste and malaise) leading to strong conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and a long-trace taste conditioning (4-8 h between taste and malaise) leading to weak CTA. In particular, the authors provide an original demonstration that the short-trace CTA critically dependent on CaMKII-GluA1 pathway in the insular cortex whereas the long-trace CTA seems to be partially independent of these processes. The authors then propose that there are two parallel taste memory traces, a stronger one dependent on insular cortex and another weaker one independent of the insular cortex.</p><p>In my opinion, the rationale for the study is clearly presented, the experiments are well designed, and the data are appropriately analyzed. I have some major comments meant to encourage the authors to clarify their interpretations of the two parallel memory traces. If these concerns can be addressed the work could yield an important paper.</p><p>I encourage the authors to elaborate on the existence of the two parallel memory traces. In particular I suggest several points:</p><p>1) Short-trace: in order to clearly demonstrate that the 1-3 h taste trace is dependent on CaMKII-GluA1 pathway in insular cortex, the authors should evaluate the impact of intra-insular infusion of TatCN21 and CNQX 2h after saccharin consumption and 1h before LiCl (ITI 3h). If their assumption is right these treatments should still impair 3h ITI-CTA.</p><p>2) Long-trace: the authors clearly demonstrate that the long-trace (&gt; 3h ITI) is not dependent on CaMKII-GluA1 pathway in insular cortex. However, as they have previously shown that novel taste is able to enhance protein expression (C/EBPbeta) in insular cortex long after its consumption (i.e. 18h, Merhav et al. 2006), they should consider that the long-trace CTA could still depend on molecular mechanism in insular cortex (but not on CaMKII-GluA1 pathway).</p><p>3) Long-trace: the authors propose that the taste memory trace results in a wider distribution with the passage of time and that there is competition across multiples memory systems. Therefore they should propose a network of brain areas able to sustain the long-trace different from the network sustaining short-trace.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors appealed against the decision and were later encouraged to resubmit.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;A Molecular Mechanism Underlying Gustatory Memory Trace for an Association in the Insular Cortex&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has now been considered by a Senior editor, the original Reviewing editor, and an additional reviewer, and we are prepared to consider a revised submission with no guarantees of acceptance.

Before you submit your revised paper please include a thorough explanation of the model and provide additional data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this article, Chinnakkaruppan &amp; Rosenblum raise an interesting question regarding the nature of memory trace formation following conditioned taste aversion, a special form of single trial associative learning where rats can acquire a memory for a specific taste (CS) associated with malaise (US) up to several hours following the presentation of the CS. They suggest the possible existence of two parallel taste memory traces: one which is strong but limited in time and lasts up to 3 hours and a second one weaker but longer in duration and lasts up to 8 hours from CS presentation. Furthermore, by applying biochemical and pharmacological techniques they suggest the involvement of specific molecular mechanism mediated by CamKII-GluA1 pathway that underlies the strong and shorter memory type but not of weak and longer memory type. Importantly, their results help to explain previous results from the same and other groups regarding the partial disruption of CTA memory by some pharmacological interventions.

Given this, we were surprised that the manuscript was rejected based on the opinion of Reviewer 1. As detailed in our point-by-point response below, data which address most, if not all, of the concerns that Reviewer 1 raised was already present in the supplemental data portion of the submitted paper. We apologize if this was not made clear in our initial submission and are happy to address these semantic shortcomings in the revised version.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>[…] A major claim of the authors is that the drop in learning efficacy after 3 hours signifies the presence of two parallel mechanisms of CTA acquisition, a claim that is also supported by a previous study from the same group (Merhav &amp; Kornblum, 2008) that shows that protein synthesis inhibitors have a stronger impact on CTA shorter than 3 hours. However, this claim receives overall weak support, as retention of the CS signal may simply be decaying nonlinear with time; or alternatively, the underlying processes linked to novel taste acquisition and induction of CTA crosses below a threshold for efficient learning acquisition after app. 3 hours.</italic> We would like to emphasize that three different lines of evidence (behavioural, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; biochemical, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>; and pharmacological, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) support the possibility of two parallel taste memory traces.</p><p>The reviewer commented that ‘retention of the CS signal may simply be decaying nonlinear with time’. It is clearly a possibility; however, our experiments and the respective statistical analyses did not support this possibility, but instead support the parallel memory traces hypothesis.</p><p>First, non-parametric one way ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis) and non-parametric repeated measures ANOVA (Friedman’s) revealed that the aversion index measure following 1h, 2h, and 3h ITI-CTAs significantly differs from that of 4h-8h ITI-CTAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The follow-up unbiased cluster analysis revealed that 1h-8h ITI-CTAs fall into two different clusters; 1h,2h, and 3h ITI-CTAs as small cluster, and 4h-8h ITI-CTAs as large cluster and they are statistically different from each other (Mann Whitney U test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Moreover, as we have presented in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), the associability of the CS with the weak US completely drops at around 4h-5h.</p><p>Secondly, in striking opposite to the reviewer’s comment, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> we have demonstrated (consistent with the previous reports, Kalat and Rozin, 1973; Gutierrez et al., 2003) that the retention of the CS signal gets stronger with time.</p><p>The reviewer again presented an alternative comment ‘the underlying processes linked to novel taste acquisition and induction of CTA crosses below a threshold for efficient learning acquisition after app. 3 hours’. This is counter-intuitive to what we have presented in the manuscript: that the underlying process (NMDAR-CaMKII-GluA1 pathway) for formation of CTA with upto a 3h ITI is different from those who have an ITI &gt;3h (4h-8h ITI CTA).</p><p><italic>The authors state that short-memory trace is required to generate the weak memory trace which lasts longer, yet the authors claim that the two memory traces are parallel. This is confusing, as when one trace requires the other one, they are by definition not parallel processes.</italic> </p><p>We see the point of the reviewer. We would like to clarify this point with a graphical representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07582.024</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immediately after ingesting a novel taste a robust taste memory trace is generated and it lasts for about 3h. (<bold>B</bold>) concurrently, the weak taste memory trace is also generated and it lasts longer, for about 8h. (<bold>C</bold>) As presented in the manuscript that “inhibition of the CaMKII-GluA1 pathway during short-trace timescale attenuated long-trace CTA, however, long-trace CTA is not affected when CaMKII-GluA1 pathway in the IC was left intact for 3h” and that we suggest that there are two parallel taste memory traces; one that is robust but decays quickly and the second which is weak but lasts longer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07582.024">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07582.024</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07582-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Furthermore, as we mentioned in the submitted manuscript “that several reports including ours demonstrate that pharmacological perturbations (before the acquisition or during the short-trace timescale) in the IC during CTA conditioning only partially disrupt CTA memory, and that the disrupted CTA appears similar to long-trace CTA memory (Rosenblum et al., 1993; Rosenblum et al., 1997; Berman et al., 2000; Eisenberg et al., 2003; Gutiérrez et al., 2003; Barki-Harrington et al., 2009; Inberg et al., 2013; Stern et al., 2013; Parkes et al., 2014)”. Therefore, we reason that the long (weak)- taste memory trace overlaps with the short-trace (CaMKII-GluA1 in the insular cortex) during short-trace timescale.</p><p>As mentioned by reviewer 2 ‘they should propose a network of brain areas able to sustain the long-trace different from the network sustaining short-trace’, it is possible that amygdala together with the PFC, or the brain-stem gustatory circuit such as parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and nucleus of solitary tract (NTS) could sustain the long-taste memory trace (Parabuchi and Netser 2014; Carter et al., 2015). These possibilities can be discussed in the updated/revised version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>There are also several issues about the experimental design, in particular appropriate control experiments. For example, the authors show that MK-801 pre injection obliterated the CS impact, and the authors claim this to be a sign that NMDA receptors are required for CS induced CTA. Unfortunately, the result does not allow to distinguish whether NMDA receptors are required for learning or whether it is required for sensory perception. MK-801 as a general blocker of NMDA receptor function may affect many other aspects of CS learning including perception of taste, general sensory processing. Similar concerns relate to manipulations used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> using CNQX.</italic> </p><p>We believe that these comments are not valid. It is well demonstrated that NMDAR in the insular cortex is necessary for the associative CTA learning but dispensable for taste perception and incidental taste learning (Rosenblum et al., 1997; Gutierrez et al., 2003; Parkes et al., 2014). Moreover, we replicated these findings and they are included in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We have also observed that CNQX micro-injection did not have any effect on the taste perception and incidental taste learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>[…] In my opinion, the rationale for the study is clearly presented, the experiments are well designed, and the data are appropriately analyzed. I have some major comments meant to encourage the authors to clarify their interpretations of the two parallel memory traces. If these concerns can be addressed the work could yield an important paper.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments and encouragement.</p><p><italic>I encourage the authors to elaborate on the existence of the two parallel memory traces. In particular I suggest several points:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Short-trace: in order to clearly demonstrate that the 1-3 h taste trace is dependent on CaMKII-GluA1 pathway in insular cortex, the authors should evaluate the impact of intra-insular infusion of TatCN21 and CNQX 2h after saccharin consumption and 1h before LiCl (ITI 3h). If their assumption is right these treatments should still impair 3h ITI-CTA.</italic> </p><p>We have addressed this constructive comment in the revised manuscript.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have performed two 3h ITI-CTA experiments in which we micro-infused CaMKII inhibitor TatCN21 or AMPAR antagonist CNQX 2h after the taste consumption and administered the LiCl 1h later. Indeed, when we performed this experiment with CNQX, we observed a significant effect of CNQX on 3h ITI-CTA memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, we observed a small non-significant trend when we used the TatCN21.</p><p>We would like to reiterate three main points: 1) CaMKII-dependent GluA1 induction occurs as early as 1h after the consumption of novel taste. 2) There is a persistent activation of CaMKII for upto 3h after the consumption of a novel taste. 3) The above two new pharmacological experiments, as well as our previous results, demonstrate differential time effects between CaMKII and GluA1. Taken together, we suggest that it is the downstream of CaMKII (i.e. GluA1) that mediates the trace longer than 1h for the association with the US. This interpretation is discussed in the revised manuscript (Results and Discussion).</p><p><italic>2) Long-trace: the authors clearly demonstrate that the long-trace (&gt; 3h ITI) is not dependent on CaMKII-GluA1 pathway in insular cortex. However, as they have previously shown that novel taste is able to enhance protein expression (C/EBPbeta) in insular cortex long after its consumption (i.e. 18h, Merhav et al. 2006), they should consider that the long-trace CTA could still depend on molecular mechanism in insular cortex (but not on CaMKII-GluA1 pathway).</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer on this point and presented a detailed explanation in the revised manuscript (Results and Discussion, eighteenth paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Long-trace: the authors propose that the taste memory trace results in a wider distribution with the passage of time and that there is competition across multiples memory systems. Therefore they should propose a network of brain areas able to sustain the long-trace different from the network sustaining short-trace.</italic> </p><p>In the last paragraph of the Results and Discussion, we elaborated on the neuronal network that might underlie long-trace CTA.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors appealed against the decision and were later encouraged to resubmit.]</p><p><italic>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;A Molecular Mechanism Underlying Gustatory Memory Trace for an Association in the Insular Cortex&quot; for consideration at eLife.

We also provide a result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>) that further supports that AMPAR in the IC is dispensable for taste perception. In addition, we provide detailed explanation of the parallel taste memory trace model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>As requested by Reviewer #2 we have performed an additional experiments with a 3h inter-time interval of conditioned taste aversion (ITI-CTA) using CaMKII inhibitor TatCN21 (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and AMPA/Kainate receptor antagonist CNQX (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>As requested by Reviewer #3 we have performed an additional standard ITI-CTA experiment with a weak unconditioned stimulus (US) to provide a greater insight into the shift in the associability of the taste memory trace that happens at around 4h after the consumption of a novel taste (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition, we have conducted two pharmacological experiments in which we micro-infused an NMDAR antagonist into the IC 30min or 4h after taste consumption in a 1h ITI-CTA with a weak US or a 5h ITI-CTA with a strong US, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>At the request of all the reviewers we have substantially expanded our discussion concerning the molecular and circuit mechanisms that might underlie long-trace memory and parallel memory trace model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>A major claim of the authors is that the drop in learning efficacy after 3 hours signifies the presence of two parallel mechanisms of CTA acquisition, a claim that is also supported by a previous study from the same group (Merhav &amp; Kornblum, 2008) that shows that protein synthesis inhibitors have a stronger impact on CTA shorter than 3 hours.
