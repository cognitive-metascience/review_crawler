Here we provide direct evidence for a functional role for the ATN in memory formation from rare simultaneous human intrathalamic and scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from eight volunteering patients receiving intrathalamic electrodes implanted for the treatment of epilepsy, demonstrating real-time communication between neocortex and ATN during successful memory encoding.

Scientists have long sought to establish exactly how our memories are formed; how does an experience, with its sights, sounds and feelings, become a mental representation stored within our brain?</p><p>One way to investigate this question is to look at the activity of different parts of the brain. Brain imaging techniques have helped researchers identify two key brain regions that are involved in the process of memory formation: the neocortex and the hippocampus. The neocortex forms the outer layer of the brain, and performs complex tasks such as decision-making and language comprehension. The hippocampus, which sits deeper within the brain, deals primarily with memory and navigation. Research has shown that memory formation depends on communication between the neocortex and the hippocampus. However, scientists suspected that additional structures located beneath the neocortex—among them, the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN)—are also crucial for forming memories. This has been difficult to confirm as the small size of the ATN, and their location deep within the brain, make their activity almost impossible to monitor using standard brain imaging techniques.</p><p>One way reliable data can be recorded from the ATN is by inserting electrodes into the brain. Brain surgery of course cannot be carried out on healthy human participants, but occasionally an opportunity arises to study the brain activity of patients who have electrodes inserted for therapeutic purposes. For example, in cases where a patient's epilepsy does not respond to conventional treatments, electrodes may be implanted to electrically stimulate the ATN in an attempt to improve their symptoms.</p><p>Sweeney-Reed et al. asked eight volunteers to perform a memory task, and monitored the activity of each volunteer's ATN via electrodes that had already been implanted in their brain to treat epilepsy. Simultaneously, electrodes attached to the scalps of the volunteers recorded the activity of the neocortex. When a memory was successfully stored in the brain, the activity of the two regions became synchronized. This suggests that successful memory formation depends upon communication between the ATN and the neocortex.</p><p>While the involvement of the ATN in human memory formation has long been a topic of speculation, Sweeney-Reed et al. now provide direct biological evidence for its crucial role in the process. Consequently, future research into memory formation should focus upon the ATN in addition to the more familiar structures of the neocortex and the hippocampus.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold><ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05352.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05352.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>thalamus</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>synchrony</kwd><kwd>cross-frequency coupling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richardson-Klavehn</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1847/1-1, SFB779 TPA10N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richardson-Klavehn</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrates a role for the anterior thalamic nucleus in human memory formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) are thought to play an important role in an extended hippocampal network central to memory formation (encoding) and novelty processing, which coordinates synaptic changes involving widespread neocortical areas, enabling life events to be recorded and later reinstated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knight, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nyhus and Curran, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ritchey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schott et al., 2013</xref>). While corticothalamic interactions are well-known to be crucial for adaptive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saalmann et al., 2012</xref>), the functional role of the ATN in humans has resisted investigation with non-invasive techniques owing both to its depth and small size. Here we had the rare opportunity to record electrophysiological activity during memory encoding directly from the ATN and dorsomedial thalamic nuclei (DMTN) of eight epileptic human volunteers with electrodes implanted for epilepsy treatment, as well as from frontal (and in two cases, parietal) scalp electrodes, reflecting neocortical activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Damage to the human ATN results in amnesia for new episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van der Werf et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton et al., 2010</xref>), and reciprocal frontal and parietal connections with the ATN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggleton, 2012</xref>) have led to the hypothesis that ATN-hippocampal connections play a regulatory role in encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vertes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, 75% of ATN oscillatory power in non-human animal studies is in the theta (4–8 Hz) range, the dominant hippocampal rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vertes et al., 2001</xref>), which is also implicated in ATN-hippocampal communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vertes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Neural communication and synaptic plasticity rely on long-range phase–phase and phase–amplitude synchrony of neural oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lachaux et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lisman and Jensen, 2013</xref>). Fronto-hippocampal theta synchrony accompanies memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nyhus and Curran, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, theta synchrony is reported to bind medial temporal (MT) and parietal areas during associative encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crespo-Garcia et al., 2010</xref>), and MT with frontal and parietal cortex during successful retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Watrous et al., 2013</xref>). Neocortical and hippocampal gamma (&gt;30 Hz) oscillations appear to reflect local processing related to activation and maintenance of neuronal object representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jensen et al., 2007</xref>), binding diverse perceptual and contextual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nyhus and Curran, 2011</xref>). Spatially separate gamma oscillations have been found to be locked to the phase of the theta oscillation, supporting binding of the coherent ensemble underlying a given memory trace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mizuhara and Yamaguchi, 2011</xref>). Indeed such gamma-power-to-theta-phase cross-frequency coupling (CFC) has been identified within human neocortex during word recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canolty et al., 2006</xref>), working memory maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axmacher et al., 2010</xref>), and in successful long-term memory encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friese et al., 2012</xref>), as well as within the rat hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>), and has been proposed as a mechanism for transiently coupling distributed cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canolty et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friese et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lisman and Jensen, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Together, these findings suggest that neocortical-ATN communication might be related to local ATN processing during encoding.

Response times for the indoor/outdoor judgment at encoding were compared between successfully (group mean = 1.04 s) and unsuccessfully (group mean = 1.14 s) encoded scenes for the seven participants for whom the paradigm was identical (see ‘Materials and methods’), and no difference was detected (paired T-test: T = 1.81, p = 0.12, with 6° of freedom, DF). For each participant, the difference between their expected probability of sequential successful encoding, calculated according to their overall rate of successful encoding, and their observed probability of sequential successful encoding, was calculated. The mean difference between these probabilities across the group did not significantly differ from zero (one-sample T-test: T = 1.35, p = 0.22, with 7 DF). Both these behavioral findings suggest that the neural findings to be reported did not reflect simple global attentional fluctuations (see ‘Discussion’).</p><p>We contrasted key oscillatory features of the EEG (512 Hz sampling frequency) during successful compared with unsuccessful encoding. To assess long-range communication, we calculated an amplitude-independent measure of phase synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lachaux et al., 1999</xref>) of oscillations in local field potentials recorded from thalamus and neocortex. We then employed CFC to assess the relationship between long-range communication and local neural processing, and Granger causality (GC) to assess likely direction of influence.</p><p>Mean fronto-thalamic phase-locking values (PLVs) across all eight participants during encoding are plotted against time and frequency in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Corticothalamic theta synchrony differences in a late (0.5–1.5 s) time window were predicted, given the theoretical importance of theta oscillations in memory, and the typical late timing of encoding-related differences in frontal and parietal event-related potentials (ERPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schott et al., 2002</xref>) and in post-stimulus MT theta oscillatory power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hanslmayr and Staudigl, 2014</xref>). Frontal-right-ATN (RATN) theta synchrony was indeed greater during successful than unsuccessful encoding at 5–6 Hz between 0.5 and 1.5 s after picture presentation (permutation tests, PT: p = 0.001; paired T-tests, TT: T = 9.9, p = 0.000022; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Conservative false discovery rate correction (PT; 57 frequencies, 0–100 Hz; 1024 data-points, 0–2 s) yielded a threshold of p = 0.0019 (overall criterion p = 0.05). Cluster-size PT (CSPT) on binary TT outcomes (significant/nonsignificant at p = 0.05) showed the second cluster of this late theta synchrony to be significant (∼1.0–1.5 s; p = 0.016; observed contiguous cluster 437 pixels; criterial cluster 285 pixels for overall p = 0.05). Synchrony at 5.2 Hz, averaged from 0.5 to 1.5 s for each participant, was greater during successful than unsuccessful encoding in seven of eight participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), yielding a group difference in median synchrony (Wilcoxon test: p = 0.038).

The mean PLVs showed a significant interaction between frequency and encoding success (p &lt; 0.001).

Of note is that the gamma range was narrower (∼40–50 Hz compared with ∼40–70 Hz) during successful than during unsuccessful encoding, resulting in significantly greater within-RATN CFC involving higher gamma-frequency amplitudes during unsuccessful compared with during successful encoding (paired T-test, TT, T = 3.6, p = 0.0086; cluster-size permutation test, CSPT: p = 0.045; observed contiguous cluster 15 pixels; criterial cluster 14 pixels for overall p = 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). The CFC patterns during successful and unsuccessful encoding were then compared directly. Within-RATN CFC during successful encoding was compared with a distribution of 1000 phase-scattered surrogates, and the theta-gamma (3.8–8.1 Hz, 30.5–64.6 Hz) cross-frequency points at which CFC during successful encoding exceeded a threshold with criterion p = 0.05 were identified. The same analysis was performed for unsuccessful encoding. The two resulting CFC patterns differed significantly (two-dimensional Kolmogorov–Smirnov test—2-D KS test: d = 0.81, p = 0.048), with a wider gamma range during unsuccessful encoding. Assuming that an assembly of synchronously firing neurons is associated with a particular memory trace, the narrower RATN gamma range coupled with theta phase during successful memory formation could be interpreted as reflecting firing of only relevant neural assemblies, thus reflecting neural specificity during encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Desimone, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Düzel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schott et al., 2006</xref>). We correspondingly postulate that the corticothalamic coupling may coordinate the firing of particular thalamic neural assemblies underpinning the memory to be encoded, facilitating synaptic strengthening and relevant memory formation. Indeed, ongoing CFC has been detected in the centromedian thalamic nucleus during cognitive task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fitzgerald et al., 2013</xref>). Again, there was no encoding-related CFC difference apparent for thalamic high gamma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canolty et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>CFC findings within the frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>) were consistent with the literature. Theta-to-gamma CFC was peak-to-peak at higher theta frequencies, and occurred for both successful and unsuccessful encoding (phase-scattered surrogate-data tests for successful and for unsuccessful encoding: p = 0.001). There was no significant relationship to encoding success (TT, p &gt; 0.05; CSPT: p &gt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>), consistent with hippocampal CFC patterns during working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axmacher et al., 2010</xref>). By contrast, theta-to-gamma CFC was trough-to-peak at lower theta frequencies, and was greater during successful than unsuccessful encoding (TT, T = 3.6, p = 0.0087; CSPT: p = 0.017; observed contiguous cluster 19 pixels; criterial cluster 11 pixels for overall p = 0.05), consistent with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canolty et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Theta-gamma CFC patterns within RATN and within frontal neocortex differed from the frontal-RATN pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 1–2</xref>). Frontal-RATN theta-gamma (3.8–8.1 Hz, 30.5–64.6 Hz) coupling during successful vs unsuccessful encoding was compared using the above paired T-tests, to provide the cross-frequency pattern, and the same was performed for within-RATN CFC. These CFC patterns differed significantly (2-D KS test: d = 0.83, p = 0.024). Frontal-RATN and within-frontal CFC patterns also differed significantly (2-D KS test: d = 0.98, p = 0.011).</p><p>GC revealed that frontal theta better predicted RATN theta than vice-versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In GC analyses, the peak model order provides an indication of how far into the past one signal provides information about another, and may thus be interpreted as indicating the approximate delay in transfer of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staudigl et al., 2012</xref>). We found that frontal theta prediction of RATN theta peaked at a model-order of 32, which corresponds to 63 ms, or one third of a theta cycle phase-lag between frontal and RATN theta. Such a delay is broadly consistent with frontal-RATN theta-to-gamma CFC being trough-to-peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and intra-RATN theta-to-gamma CFC being peak-to-peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.

Our amplitude-independent phase synchrony measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lachaux et al., 1999</xref>) show that timing of post-stimulus ATN theta activity alone (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>), and its relation to local ATN processing as indexed by gamma amplitudes, is critical in successful memory encoding, providing the first electrophysiological evidence concerning the role of ATN in human memory formation. The absence of neocortical-DMTN synchrony differences, together with their recent detection during verbal memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staudigl et al., 2012</xref>), fits with evidence suggesting ATN specialization for encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van der Werf et al., 2003</xref>), and DMTN for retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van der Werf et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggleton, 2012</xref>). RATN involvement is moreover consistent with the non-verbal scene stimuli employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maillard et al., 2011</xref>), and with evidence that left thalamus lesions produce more severe memory deficits for verbal than non-verbal material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Squire et al., 1989</xref>). The late theta synchrony is in accord with the timing of differences in ERPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schott et al., 2002</xref>) and post-stimulus MT theta power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hanslmayr and Staudigl, 2014</xref>) during successful compared with unsuccessful encoding of episodic memories. While oscillations in the delta frequency range have recently been found to show a memory-related difference in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Watrous et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lega et al., 2014</xref>), we did not detect a significant difference between corticothalamic delta phase synchrony during successful compared with unsuccessful encoding.</p><p>While we provide here novel evidence that the coordination of theta and gamma oscillations involving the ATN plays a critical role in trial-by-trial memory ability, it should be noted that memory encoding is recognized to include not only content processing and information storage, but also attention (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim, 2011</xref>). Item-specific attention indeed has a well-recognized effect on whether an item is successfully encoded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raz and Buhle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Muzzio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burke et al., 2014</xref>). Attention is not only necessary for optimal memory encoding, but multiple brain structures involved in memory formation may be subject to attentional modulation, including the hippocampus itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Muzzio et al., 2009</xref>). There are several indicators, however, that our findings reflect memory encoding processes beyond simply global arousal or attention fluctuations.</p><p>Firstly, the timing of the key memory differences here at around 1 s post-stimulus is strongly suggestive of a memory-related difference. Neural encoding differences related to later memory have been identified using ERPs and cortical theta/gamma oscillations, generally peaking at around 1 s after stimulus presentation, continuing up to 1.5 s post-stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paller et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schott et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sederberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osipova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lega et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hanslmayr and Staudigl, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2014</xref>). Secondly, whereas oscillatory dynamics between the pulvinar thalamic nucleus and the parietal cortex support visual attention in macaques, consistent with attention deficits following focal pulvinar lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saalmann et al., 2012</xref>), our main findings pertain to the ATN, for which lesion and animal studies suggest a role in memory. Moreover, based on current knowledge about the ATN and the DMTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van der Werf et al., 2003</xref>) one would rather expect attentional differences to be reflected in DMTN activity, which we did not find. Most critically, if global attentional fluctuations were responsible for our theta synchrony findings, one would expect longer response times during the encoding phase for later forgotten compared with later remembered scenes, due to lack of attention to the encoding task. However, response times did not differ. Finally, global attentional fluctuations over time would also imply a dependency between the probability of successful encoding on successive trials during the study phase of the experiment, and we found no dependency.</p><p>We note, however, that variability in factors such as attention and the emotional valence of stimuli are fundamental to the study design in subsequent memory paradigms, affecting the probability of successfully encoding each item and thus enabling comparison of successful with unsuccessful encoding. Indeed, the early upper theta and alpha synchrony immediately following stimulus presentation during successful memory encoding is likely to reflect enhanced item-specific attention and perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Düzel et al., 2005</xref>), with the later theta synchrony timing fitting well with previous findings relating to memory encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schott et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hanslmayr and Staudigl, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The ATN is the target of stimulation in the treatment of focal epilepsy on the basis that seizure activity starting focally is propagated through this site to widespread cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lega et al., 2010</xref>). Regional cortical specificity in frontal-RATN synchrony would support our argument that the differences that we have identified are memory-specific. While the phase synchrony pattern we report is discernible in all three electrode placements (frontopolar, other frontal, and parietal), it is indeed not identical across regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>). We also show the difference between fronto-RATN theta-gamma CFC involving the different frontal electrode placements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Again, the patterns are similar but not identical. The limited available scalp electrode coverage in our participants, however, precludes drawing strong conclusions in this regard. We note also, though, that both frontal and parietal cortices are well-recognized as being involved in memory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weiss and Rappelsberger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otten et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sauseng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Uncapher and Wagner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friese et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sweeney-Reed et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The encoding and retrieval tasks were chosen for their simplicity, because recording was only possible at the bedside in the few days following intracranial surgery, and because we did not wish to lose data owing to failure of these rare participants to succeed at the tasks. Under these circumstances, we were able to achieve large and comparable behavioral trial numbers for successful and unsuccessful encoding, which could then be submitted to oscillatory analysis. Pilot testing revealed that one participant (not included in the current cohort) could not adequately perform an objective source-memory task under these post-operative conditions, and we thus additionally judged it unlikely that the participants could properly implement the more complex ‘remember/know/guess’ instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gardiner and Richardson-Klavehn, 2000</xref>) necessary to obtain reports of subjective recollection and familiarity during recognition. Moreover, given the nature of the data ultimately obtained from our eight participants, we elected to collapse the data across the levels of response certainty to maximize trial numbers in each category for electrophysiological synchrony analysis, in a pragmatic trade-off between the power of the electrophysiological analyses and behavioral/psychological resolution.</p><p>Thus, a limitation of the study is that we cannot conclusively link our results to recollection, and therefore episodic memory formation, separately from familiarity. Our findings concerning ATN electrophysiological involvement in human memory formation are, however, consistent with the theoretical proposal that the ATN is a part of an extended hippocampal system supporting episodic recollection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggleton, 2012</xref>), whether during encoding or retrieval, and with the competing theoretical proposal that the ATN is specialized for encoding rather than retrieval, whether the information involved is episodic (recollection) or semantic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van der Werf et al., 2003</xref>). The latter proposal is consistent with human lesion data, showing that sufferers from Korsakoff's syndrome with lesions to the ATN fail to acquire new semantic as well as new episodic information (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al., 2000</xref>) and is thus particularly consistent with our new data. We note, furthermore, that whether recollection and familiarity are separate processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eichenbaum et al., 2008</xref>), or reflect a single process, with familiarity and recollection reflecting different degrees of memory strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wixted and Squire, 2008</xref>), is an area of continuing debate (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gardiner and Richardson-Klavehn, 2000</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yonelinas, 2002</xref>) for relevant information regarding humans. Despite this lack of behavioral/psychological resolution, our data nevertheless provide novel evidence concerning the real-time role of the human ATN in memory formation.</p><p>It should also be noted that memory processing may be divided into different subsystems, with different components of memory processing involving different thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mennemeier et al., 1992</xref>). For example, whereas human lesion and animal studies suggest a regulatory role for the ATN in memory encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vertes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van der Werf et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggleton, 2012</xref>) and for the DMTN in retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van der Werf et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staudigl et al., 2012</xref>), other thalamic nuclei have also been found to be involved in different aspects of memory processing. For example, evidence supports a role for the nucleus reuniens in fear conditioning and memory generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vertes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu and Südhof, 2013</xref>), as well as spatial processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jankowski et al., 2014</xref>), for the pulvinar nucleus in attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saalmann et al., 2012</xref>) and nonverbal memory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson and Ojemann, 2000</xref>), and for the left ventro-lateral thalamus in verbal memory encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson and Ojemann, 2000</xref>). Our focus on the ATN and DMTN is based on the rare availability of human electrophysiological data from these sites, which was determined by clinical requirements, and is consistent with extant data concerning the amnesic effects of lesions in these thalamic areas in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van der Werf et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our findings shed new light on real-time interaction between the ATN and the neocortex, thus broadening understanding of the brain structures involved in memory formation from a focus on the hippocampus and neocortex to recognition of a pivotal role for the ATN. More generally, the CFC theta-gamma findings, together with the amnesic effects of lesions to the human ATN, provide evidence that the ATN plays an active role in encoding, instead of simply relaying cortical or hippocampal signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants, and intracranial and scalp recording</title><p>Intrathalamic data were recorded from 1.5 mm platinum-iridium electrodes implanted bilaterally (four contacts each) in the thalamus for stimulation therapy for multiple pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy in eight adult participants, all of whom were not suitable candidates for resective surgery. A minimum sample size was not set, because memory-dependent phase synchrony has been detected on an individual level in intracranial recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staudigl et al., 2012</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6 fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplements 6–7</xref>). The final number of participants was determined by the number of patients available in the days just following implantation during the approximately 2 years of the relevant therapeutic program, and also willing to participate in the study. This sample size was considerably greater than that usually available for intracranial studies in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canolty et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fitzgerald et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonini et al., 2014</xref>), and in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saalmann et al., 2012</xref>). The mean age of the participants was 37.5 years (range 28–52 years, standard deviation 8.2 years), and four participants were female. Stimulation via intracranial electrodes did not occur during the data recording. The measurements were approved by the Ethics Commission of the Medical Faculty of the Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg (application number 0308), and all participants gave written informed consent in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000 and 2008. Consent to participate in our study, as well as for publication of results in an anonymized format, was obtained by the neurosurgeon at the same time as consent was obtained for the surgical procedure.</p><p>Contacts were located in the ATN for all eight participants and in the DMTN for seven of the participants (with Participant 5 not having DMTN contacts). Placement of the thalamic electrodes was performed stereotactically. The angle of entry through the skull and the depth of each electrode was calculated based on MRI images of each patient's brain pre-operatively. An intra-operative X-ray and postoperative CT-scans were carried out in order to confirm correct localization of each electrode, by reference to the Schaltenbrand and Pick Atlases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schaltenbrand and Wahren, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maldjian et al., 2003</xref>). Scalp EEG data were simultaneously collected from frontal electrodes (Fz, AFz, or Fpz) in all eight participants, and from parietal electrodes only in Participant 1 (P3, Pz, P4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>) and Participant 2 (Pz only; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). Positioning of post-operative dressings meant that parietal electrodes could not be placed for the other six participants. Frontal electrodes were centered over Fz (frontal), AFz (anterior frontal), and Fpz (frontopolar), with the data from the most frontal available electrode from each participant included in the group analyses. These scalp sites reflect underlying cortical activity from midline frontal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paller et al., 1987</xref>). Data from the two participants with parietal electrodes were analyzed as single cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6 fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplements 6–7</xref>), as well as contributing to the group analyses for frontal electrodes.</p><p>Nose-referenced voltages were amplified with a Walter Graphtek (Lübeck, Germany) EEG amplifier and recorded with a 512 Hz sampling frequency. Offline re-referencing of thalamic voltages to the next deepest contact rendered six bipolar channels. Radiological intracranial electrode localization was performed for all participants intra- and postoperatively by the neurosurgeons and a physicist. Electrode location is provided in detail for Participant 1 for illustration purposes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The deepest two thalamic contacts were located in the DMTN, and the most superficial in the ATN. The second most superficial was at the ATN/DMTN border. The critical results from this participant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>) were obtained from a bipolar recording from the two most superficial right-sided thalamic contacts. We confirmed that the synchrony patterns were not observed when the second most superficial contact was referenced to either of the two deeper contacts, suggesting that the critical signals originated from the most superficial contact, which was clearly located in ATN, and not from its reference contact.</p><p>Note that no measureable temporal phase-shifts that simply reflect the physical (e.g., capacitative) properties of the brain-to-scalp-electrode interface have been detected at typical EEG frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006</xref>). Any phase-lags between the scalp and intrathalamic recordings should, therefore, reflect genuine neural conduction delays between neocortex and thalamus. Such phase-lags should not in any case affect the corticothalamic phase synchrony measurements detailed below, which were independent of phase-lag as well as amplitude, but were taken into account in the Granger causality calculations detailed below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental paradigm</title><p>During encoding, the participants viewed a series of 200 (100 for Participant 1) photographs of unfamiliar real-world scenes on a computer screen. Each scene was shown for 2.4 s, followed by a fixation cross for 1.4 s, and the participant judged whether the depicted scene was indoors or outdoors (average response time around 1 s after scene presentation). The responses were made using left and right index fingers, and the response hand was counterbalanced across participants. Recognition testing occurred after a short distraction break to ensure retrieval based on long-term memory. Each participant viewed all 200 scenes from the encoding phase in a different random order, randomly interspersed with 100 similar but new scenes. The total pool of 300 scenes was randomly assigned into 3 groups of 100. Which of these 3 groups formed the old and new scenes for a particular participant was systematically counterbalanced across participants by rotation.</p><p>A short practice session with both encoding and recognition test phases was provided for each participant, rendering the experiment itself an intentional encoding paradigm, because participants knew during encoding that they would later be tested. Nevertheless, the focus of the encoding task was on deciding whether each depicted scene was indoors or outdoors.</p><p>In the recognition test, each scene was first shown for 1.25 s, then a 6-point scale was superimposed on the scene for 2.8 s, along which a marker was moved by pressing one of two keyboard buttons, with the index finger of each hand, to indicate degrees of confidence as to whether the scene was old or new (direction and response hand counterbalanced across participants). A fixation cross then appeared, jittered between 0.75 and 1.25 s. Behavioral data from the test phase are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. The data presented here were collapsed across the three scale points indicating ‘old’, and the three scale points indicating ‘new’ at test, to obtain binary ‘old’/‘new’ judgments. All eight participants showed a greater percentage of hits (correct ‘old’ responses to old scenes) than of false alarms (incorrect ‘old’ responses to new scenes), demonstrating that they had formed memories for scenes from the encoding phase. The encoding data (electrophysiological data and response times) were then sorted, according to test phase responses, into epochs with successful encoding (later correct ‘old’ judgments to old scenes at test, hits) and epochs with unsuccessful encoding (later incorrect ‘new’ judgments to old scenes at test, misses) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paller and Wagner, 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data pre-processing</title><p>The electrophysiological encoding data were segmented into epochs 1 s pre-stimulus (i.e., scene presentation at encoding) to 2 s post-stimulus, because work on memory encoding measuring ERPs and theta/gamma oscillations has demonstrated differences in electrophysiological activity related to later memory up to 1.5 s post-stimulus, generally peaking at around 1 s after stimulus presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paller et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schott et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sederberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osipova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lega et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2014</xref>). Data were also recorded during retrieval, but we focus on the encoding data here. Note that the time axes in all figures (except in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, where time is arbitrary) are set such that the stimulus was shown at time = 0 s.</p><p>Recording of intracranial signals was performed at the bedside in the few days following electrode implantation, before the electrodes were attached to a stimulator under the skin over the chest wall for epilepsy treatment, in a second operation approximately 1 week later. No seizures took place during the testing sessions, and all patients were fully alert and cooperative throughout. Epochs were individually visually inspected and cleaned of ocular and other artifacts using temporal-decorrelation-separation independent component analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sweeney-Reed et al., 2012</xref>). Spikes and spike-waves were also removed using this approach, to maximize the number of epochs for analysis. We deemed the differences in electrophysiological activity detected between epochs recorded during successful compared with unsuccessful encoding in our simple task to be unlikely to result from global attentional fluctuations due to epileptiform activity for several reasons. Firstly, accuracy was close to ceiling for the indoor vs outdoor judgment during encoding. Secondly, there was no difference in response times during encoding for successful compared with unsuccessful memory formation. Thirdly, successful and unsuccessful encoding of successive scenes in the series showed no sequential dependency. Furthermore, while the cortical site of the epileptic focus differed across participants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), the reported results were highly consistent across the group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2 fig2s6 fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplements 2, 6–7</xref>).

Across these three participants, the mean difference in these percentages between successful and unsuccessful encoding was only 1.83% (i.e., slightly greater for successful encoding), suggesting that concerns about spikes and spike-waves being confounded with the two data categories of interest are minimal. Nevertheless, the analyses were also performed excluding epochs with spikes and spike-waves, and the findings reported remained statistically significant.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05352.020</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Clinical information</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold><ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05352.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05352.020</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Pt</th><th>M/F</th><th>Age at surgery</th><th>Age at first seizure</th><th>Epilepsy syndrome</th><th>Seizure origin</th><th>Current medication</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">1</td><td rowspan="2">F</td><td rowspan="2">42</td><td rowspan="2">13</td><td rowspan="2">PLE</td><td rowspan="2">bilateral</td><td>LTG 200 mg</td></tr><tr><td>LCM 400 mg</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">2</td><td rowspan="2">F</td><td rowspan="2">52</td><td rowspan="2">33</td><td rowspan="2">TLE</td><td rowspan="2">bilateral</td><td>LCM 400 mg</td></tr><tr><td>LTG 200 mg</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">3</td><td rowspan="2">M</td><td rowspan="2">34</td><td rowspan="2">26</td><td rowspan="2">TLE</td><td rowspan="2">right</td><td>LEV 4000 mg</td></tr><tr><td>ESL 1200 mg</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">4</td><td rowspan="2">F</td><td rowspan="2">29</td><td rowspan="2">16</td><td rowspan="2">TLE</td><td rowspan="2">bilateral</td><td>LTG 400 mg</td></tr><tr><td>RTG 600 mg</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">5</td><td rowspan="2">M</td><td rowspan="2">39</td><td rowspan="2">9</td><td rowspan="2">TLE</td><td rowspan="2">left</td><td>LTG 400 mg</td></tr><tr><td>LCM 400 mg</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">6</td><td rowspan="3">M</td><td rowspan="3">32</td><td rowspan="3">1</td><td rowspan="3">TLE</td><td rowspan="3">frontal and right temporal</td><td>STP 4500 mg</td></tr><tr><td>OXC 900 mg</td></tr><tr><td>CLB 5 mg</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">7</td><td rowspan="2">M</td><td rowspan="2">41</td><td rowspan="2">29</td><td rowspan="2">FLE</td><td rowspan="2">bilateral</td><td>LTG 400 mg</td></tr><tr><td>ZNS 400 mg</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>F</td><td>44</td><td>14</td><td>TLE</td><td>left</td><td>CBZ 1200 mg</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Pt = participant.

After wavelet transformation, a phase series was extracted for each epoch, and the phase differences between scalp and thalamic channels were calculated (for details of this well known method (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lachaux et al., 1999</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sweeney-Reed et al., 2012</xref>). Phase-locking values (PLVs) could vary between 0 (no PL) and 1 (complete PL). In order to enhance time resolution (at the expense of frequency resolution), we also applied 1-cycle wavelets, confirming that the synchrony that we report (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) took place post-stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Statistical analysis thus focused on the 2 s post-stimulus period of 1024 time-points. It should be noted that the calculation of PLVs may be influenced by a common reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vinck et al., 2011</xref>), and we addressed this issue by using bipolar referencing in our thalamic recordings (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staudigl et al., 2012</xref>). Volume conduction may also influence PLVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vinck et al., 2011</xref>), but in the present study, phase synchrony is calculated between the frontal cortex and the RATN, whose spatial separation should exclude this influence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical tests were two-tailed. After PLVs were calculated for each epoch in each category (successful encoding and unsuccessful encoding), permutation tests, which are conservative in that they do not make parametric assumptions, were initially used to evaluate the significance of differences between successful and unsuccessful encoding for each pixel within the 2-dimensional time-frequency space of 57 frequencies (0–100 Hz) and 1024 post-stimulus time-points (0–2 s). A mean PLV was calculated for successful and for unsuccessful encoding for each of the eight participants, and the 16 PLVs were pooled, reassigned to two artificial categories 1000 times, and a PLV difference between categories calculated, in order to obtain a two-tailed error distribution of differences against which the observed mean difference between successful and unsuccessful encoding was tested. A statistical comparison of mean PLVs across successful and unsuccessful encoding necessitates an equal number of epochs per category, so that, prior to calculating the mean PLVs for each participant, epochs were randomly selected from the larger category to match the size of the smaller (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref> shows the mean PLVs calculated from the equal number of epochs per category that were included in the statistical analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> shows the results of the group permutation tests.</p><p>We also confirmed the key corticothalamic synchrony findings with paired T-tests (with mean PLVs calculated for each participant as just described for permutation testing). The assumptions of paired T-tests were satisfied (i.e., an approximately normal distribution of the differences between PLVs for successful and unsuccessful encoding across participants, and a positive correlation between PLVs for successful and unsuccessful encoding across participants). Mean PLVs differed significantly, in a pattern similar to that found using the permutation tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). All paired T-tests had 7° of freedom except where otherwise noted.</p><p>The electrophysiological literature on memory formation clearly suggests a focus on theta (4–8 Hz) oscillations, a range covered by 14 frequencies (i.e., wavelets). However, in view of the scarcity and novelty of memory-related intrathalamic data in humans, a highly conservative approach to evaluating these observed uncorrected p values was taken. For the permutation tests, a false discovery rate correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canolty et al., 2006</xref>) was applied for the 57 frequency (0–100 Hz) and 1024 time-point (0–2 s) comparisons, which was especially conservative given the dependency between adjacent time and frequency points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For the T-tests, a cluster-size permutation test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>) was performed, in which a cluster was defined as adjacent significant (criterion: p = 0.05 by paired T-test) time-frequency points. Mean PLV matrices for each participant for each condition were randomly assigned to two groups 1000 times, and T-tests were performed across time and frequency for each permutation. T-test outcomes were rendered binary (1 = significant, 0 = nonsignificant) for each of the 57 frequencies and 1024 time-points, and the maximum cluster size (as defined above) emerging randomly in each iteration was calculated in order to provide a distribution against which to determine the significance of the observed cluster size. The same approach was taken for cluster-size significance in the cross-frequency coupling analysis described below. Finally, we evaluated the consistency of the results across the eight participants by applying a nonparametric (and thus conservative) Wilcoxon test of the differences between theta (5.2 Hz) PLVs for successful and unsuccessful encoding in the 0.5 to 1.5 s time-window in which theta differences had been revealed by the above-described conservative methods (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The significance of the difference between PLVs for successful vs unsuccessful encoding was additionally calculated on an individual case basis for Participants 1 and 2, because they were the only participants with parietal electrodes. Participant 1 had only 26 unsuccessful encoding epochs, so 26 successful encoding epochs were randomly selected from the 74 available and the mean PLV calculated. In order to use all available data to calculate the PLV difference between successful and unsuccessful encoding, this selection of 26 epochs and mean PLV calculation was carried out 200 times and an overall observed mean PLV was then calculated for successful encoding. For significance testing by permutation tests, this difference was compared to an error distribution, which was obtained by randomly assigning 52 epochs, irrespective of encoding success, to two artificial categories 1000 times (each time randomly selecting 26 of the 74 successful encoding epochs, and using all 26 unsuccessful encoding epochs) and calculating the mean PLV difference each time. The observed mean PLV difference was compared to this error distribution. A test with criterion p = 0.05 was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>, right). For descriptive purposes, the mean PLV across all 74 epochs of successful encoding is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>, left). Permutation of epochs was also performed for Participant 2, with all 68 unsuccessful encoding epochs being used, and 68 encoding epochs being randomly selected from the 132 successful encoding epochs. The same procedure was then followed, except that given the larger number of trials in the smaller category compared with Participant 1, the observed mean PLV for successful encoding was calculated only once. For descriptive purposes, the mean PLV across all 132 epochs of successful encoding is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>, left).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cross-frequency coupling</title><p>Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) was calculated as per the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canolty et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axmacher et al. (2010)</xref>. The frontal and RATN signals were wavelet transformed, then the theta phase and the gamma amplitude time series were extracted from the frontal and thalamic signals for each epoch. New complex signals were created by combining phases (ranging from 4–16 Hz, to include frequencies in the theta and alpha range) with gamma amplitudes (30–256 Hz) from the channels between which coupling was assessed, and the complex signals were averaged over time for each epoch. The phase was then extracted from the new complex value for each epoch by taking the arctangent of the imaginary divided by the real part. The average complex value across epochs was then also calculated, and from this value, the modulatory phase was determined by taking the arctangent of the imaginary over real parts, thus quantifying the average phase of the lower frequency oscillation at which the amplitude of the high frequency oscillation was highest. The theta amplitudes were then shifted by minus modulatory phase, and the correlation coefficient (CC) between the shifted theta oscillations and the gamma amplitudes was found. The CC was Fisher-Z transformed, then a mean was taken over epochs for each participant to provide the modulation index, separately for successful and unsuccessful encoding. Paired T-tests comparing successful with unsuccessful encoding were then performed for each pixel within the 37 theta-phase frequency by 21 gamma-amplitude frequency matrix, comparing the degree of theta-phase with gamma-amplitude coupling. The resulting p values, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, were then subjected to a cluster-based correction via permutation testing as described above for synchrony differences.</p><p>To illustrate the coupling in a single participant, the frontal and RATN theta phases and RATN gamma power are shown for Participant 7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, averaged across epochs during successful encoding. Note that to enable comparison across frequencies, the temporal mean was subtracted from the power values, and they were then divided by the temporal standard deviation of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canolty et al., 2006</xref>). Gamma power and theta troughs were aligned to the first theta trough in the 0.5 to 1.5 s post-stimulus window for each epoch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staudigl et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The absence of an encoding-related difference in frontal CFC between upper theta peaks and gamma amplitudes is consistent with working memory findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axmacher et al., 2010</xref>). In order to confirm the presence of this CFC for both successful and unsuccessful encoding, levels of CFC were also compared with a distribution of CFC indices generated from 1000 phase-scattered surrogate data sets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Granger causality</title><p>Granger causality (GC) was used to investigate information flow direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staudigl et al., 2012</xref>) at time-frequency locations (4–12 Hz; 0.5–1.5 s) encompassing the significantly greater theta phase synchrony during successful compared with unsuccessful encoding. GC uses multivariate autoregressive modeling to ascertain whether time series A may be more accurately predicted from time series B, with a certain time lag, than B from A. If incorporating values from B in the regression of A allows better prediction of A than vice versa, B is said to influence A. The data were first detrended and rendered zero mean across epochs to remove nonstationarity. The variances of the prediction errors of the autoregressive models were then used to assess likely information flow direction. The Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC, BIC) were employed to calculate a model order balancing overparameterization and adequate spectral resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staudigl et al., 2012</xref>). When a minimum is not reached and the BIC/AIC does not show substantial decreases at higher orders, as here, model orders for EEG are usually chosen over a range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brovelli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staudigl et al., 2012</xref>). We applied model orders from 26 to 36, identifying a peak GC corresponding to a third of a theta cycle. Model coefficients were interpreted in the frequency domain. Significance of the difference between frontal-RATN and RATN-frontal GC in successful and in unsuccessful encoding was assessed by paired T-tests.</p><p>The flow of time is commonly used to make inferences from time series data regarding directional causal influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bollimunta et al., 2008</xref>), and indeed GC is commonly equated with directions of information flow in neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bollimunta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>). The model order specifies the number of time lagged observations made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bressler and Seth, 2011</xref>), and the order at which GC peaks provides an indication of how long into the past one signal provides information about subsequent activity in the other signal. We interpreted the model order corresponding with peak causality as providing an indication of the delay in transfer of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staudigl et al., 2012</xref>), which has been measured directly between the frontal cortex and hippocampus in rats and found to be consistent with the delays suggested by the present data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siapas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Michael Rugg for discussion concerning data analysis, and Erik Dower for discussion concerning analog signals.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Howard Eichenbaum (Reviewing editor) and Guillén Fernández (one of the three peer reviewers).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a timely and valuable study probing the neural correlates of memory formation, presenting rare data on intracranial recordings from human patients focusing on the thalamus, with simultaneous cortical EEG from frontal and parietal sites. The authors assessed phase synchronization and cross frequency coupling in recordings from eight patients with epilepsy, who performed an intentional picture encoding task followed by a recognition memory test. They confirmed the hypothesis that the interaction between the anterior thalamus and frontal cortex is related to successful memory formation and based on cross-region theta synchronization and local theta-gamma coupling. The paper is clearly and concisely written but each of the reviewers had several concerns that should be addressed in a revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>1) The manuscript says very little about the patients and their epilepsy (this should be added). Related to that, the reader does not know whether the data (and performance) is contaminated by epileptic activity. Spike and spike-waves are able to affect cognition, including the ability to encode, and the analyses done by the authors. Thus, they have to make clear by appropriate correction or better trial exclusion that the recording epochs used for analysis are not affected by interictal or even ictal epileptic activity.</p><p>2) The task for the patients was to recognize a large number of photographs making it likely to be solved, at least to a substantial degree, by recognition judgments based on a feeling of familiarity. In other words, this test is not a clean episodic memory task as framed by the authors and thus, this is a limitation that should be discussed.</p><p>3) The authors did some analysis in an attempt to exclude attentional explanations for their findings. I think that this is neither necessary nor convincing. Reaction time differences in the simple orientation task (indoor/outdoor decision) might be related to modulations of attention, but they are dominated by stimulus features. The decision is just more difficult for some items than others. Also analyzing the probability of sequential encoding is not convincing. This analysis might track slowly modulated changes in attentional states, but it fails to detect trial-by-trial fluctuations of attention, which might be most relevant for the subsequent memory effect as assessed here. However, the subsequent memory paradigm depends on fluctuations in the probability to encode a series of items. If you would theoretically be able to align perfectly attention, stimuli, emotional valence and all other factors modulating the likelihood to encode an item successfully, a given subject would encode either all items or none.</p><p>Somewhere, the subsequent memory design needs fluctuations in these factors. If the subject is able to perform the orientation task correctly (and above chance level), we can assume that he/she has processed the items attentively, further fluctuations of attention are most likely present and related to memory formation success, but this is no problem because these fluctuations are needed for this study design. To dissociate attentional from mnemonic components, one would for instance need a factorial design modulating memory formation and attention; very difficult to come up with a clever design (see Rees et al. Science 1999 for an attempt). To my opinion, the authors can just omit this attentional topic in their Results and Discussion section.</p><p>4) The authors are strict in localizing their effect in the anterior thalamic nucleus and distinguish this location from recordings in the dorsomedial thalamic nuclei. The data presented is not sufficient to support this specificity. Also the framing is too focused. For instance, they ignore the nucleus reunions, a most relevant thalamic relay station interacting with the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe during specific mnemonic processes (e.g., Xu and Südhof, Science 2013). Given the connectivity of this nucleus, it is way better suited to support memory formation by connecting to the (medial) prefrontal cortex. I suggest to present the electrode localization in more detail and to broaden the framing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>1) A fairly obvious question: what happens during retrieval? Were the data collected? Are there plans for describing them in a separate publication? That would be fine, but it would be good to know.</p><p>2) Could you please show raw power data for the successful/unsuccessful conditions? It would be important to know whether power also increases in the successful condition, and, in that case, whether the increased PLV computed could be ascribed to improved statistical power. Measures that take power into account as Martin Vinck's WPLI may be considered here.</p><p>3) The authors state “The narrower gamma range involved during successful encoding may be interpreted as selection, via corticothalamic coupling, of RATN neural assemblies specific to a particular memory trace” I'm not sure I follow the logic behind this statement, could you please explain?</p><p>4) The authors also state “Such a delay is broadly consistent with hippocampal-to-medial-prefrontal-cortex delays reported during theta phase synchrony in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benchenane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siapas et al., 2005</xref>)”. Why does it make sense to compare to HC-PFC interactions here? In the present case the cortex is leading, in the former case is lagging.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>1) I am not certain that this study is actually testing episodic memory. The researchers use a recognition memory paradigm that includes a confidence measurement. One might argue that highly confident measurements are episodic-type retrieval more than recognition but in the analysis they appear to collapse all confidence measurements into two different categories. Given the available data, I assume it is difficult to disambiguate highly confident from only partially confident measurements, but I would prefer to see something that attempts to look more strongly at the “recall” type encoding events rather than those that are simply recognition events. Further, in a recognition memory paradigm, activity at retrieval is probably as important as activity during encoding for determining success and an analysis focusing on this epoch would be of interest. Specifically, examining activity time-locked to retrieval item presentation would be interesting. I think the study is still noteworthy, even if it assesses recognition memory and not episodic memory, but they authors may wish to re-cast their findings somewhat.</p><p>2) I am not certain of the region-specificity of the memory-related thalamic-cortical effect. The anterior thalamic nucleus was selected as a target for epilepsy because of wide cortical projections, a “way-station” between localized onset and generalization. Clinically, part of ATN electrode placement includes proving that stimulation elicits a driving response in multiple cortical locations (Lega, B. C., Halpern, C. H., Jaggi, J. L., &amp; Baltuch, G. H. (2010). Deep brain stimulation in the treatment of refractory epilepsy: update on current data and future directions. Neurobiology of disease, 38(3), 354-360.) To my eyes, in the supplementary figures, the parietal response is more robust than the examples of a frontal response that they show. Certainly, the memory-relevant thalamic connections may include multiple cortical areas, but if the memory effect does not have any region-specificity it may indicate orienting or attention, etc. more than a memory specific effect. Obtaining more scalp electrode data in these patients may be possible for future cases (dressing issue can be overcome by placing scalp leads under sterile conditions in the OR), but if the authors have any other contacts to report or can compare the frontal versus parietal activity this may help. They can also maybe differentiate frontal pole from FCz activity in the aggregated data. This would apply both to the synchrony analysis and the CFC analysis.</p><p>3) I have a few concerns about the synchrony analysis. The clustering analysis shows significant synchrony in short time periods within the .5-1.5 second epoch, but for a 5 Hz oscillation I would expect something like .5-1 seconds of continuously significant synchrony difference via the PLV value across subjects. But when they compare the PLV value for the entire time window and compare across the subjects, the effect (p = 0.038) may not survive a correction for multiple comparisons across all of the different tests they performed. I would prefer to see more analyses that look across the relevant time window, long enough to account for a few cycles of the oscillation. Similarly, while the PLV difference is significant, I would like to see something (maybe I missed it) showing the level of synchrony by itself is significant for the same relevant, contiguous time epoch, at least for the putatively higher-synchrony condition (successful encoding). I assume the authors did this following the LaChaux methods but a plot showing the time windows that are significantly synchronous would be helpful.</p><p>4) I would prefer to see an analysis that includes a closer look at the different frequency components. Differential coupling of the higher-frequency (alpha range) component versus the lower frequency (4-8 Hz) component (for example frontal pole versus dorsal frontal versus parietal) would help establish a memory-specific effect for the theta component. Similarly, I would prefer to see the effects into the delta frequency range (2-4 Hz) given human data suggesting a memory-relevant effect in this frequency range (Lega et al., Slow-Theta-to-Gamma Phase-Amplitude Coupling in Human Hippocampus Supports the Formation of New Episodic Memories, Cereb Cortex. 2014 Oct 14. pii: bhu232, Watrous, Andrew J., Itzhak Fried, and Arne D.

Related to that, the reader does not know whether the data (and performance) is contaminated by epileptic activity. Spike and spike-waves are able to affect cognition, including the ability to encode, and the analyses done by the authors. Thus, they have to make clear by appropriate correction or better trial exclusion that the recording epochs used for analysis are not affected by interictal or even ictal epileptic activity</italic>.</p><p>We have added a table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) providing details about the epilepsy diagnosis for each patient.</p><p>We have also added more information to the first paragraph of the 'Participants, and intracranial and scalp recording' section of the 'Materials and methods' section, so the first sentence is now as follows:</p><p>“Intrathalamic data were recorded from 1.5 mm platinum-iridium electrodes implanted bilaterally (4 contacts each) in the thalamus for stimulation therapy for multiple pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy in 8 adult participants, all of whom were not suitable candidates for resective surgery.”</p><p>Recording of intracranial signals was only possible at the patient's bedside during the few days directly following surgery, limiting the time available for such studies, because the electrodes were subsequently attached to a stimulator under the skin during a second operation. To maximize the number of epochs for analysis, for the main analyses reported here, we corrected for artifacts instead of excluding trials. We have re-analyzed the data excluding all trials containing spikes or spike-waves, and the findings reported as significant in the main analyses remain significant. We have correspondingly altered the second paragraph of the 'Data pre-processing' section of the 'Materials and methods' section to the following:</p><p>“Recording of intracranial signals was performed at the bedside in the few days following electrode implantation, before the electrodes were attached to a stimulator under the skin over the chest wall for epilepsy treatment, in a second operation approximately one week later. […] Nevertheless, the analyses were also performed excluding epochs with spikes and spike-waves, and the findings reported remained statistically significant.”</p><p><italic>2) The task for the patients was to recognize a large number of photographs making it likely to be solved, at least to a substantial degree, by recognition judgments based on a feeling of familiarity. In other words, this test is not a clean episodic memory task as framed by the authors and thus, this is a limitation that should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that familiarity cannot be excluded as playing a role in our retrieval task. Given the novelty and scarcity of human intrathalamic recordings, we chose to implement a simple paradigm, which we were confident the patients could successfully perform, given that the only possible time to record such data was during the few days following intracranial surgery. Furthermore, in order to maximize trial numbers for the synchrony analyses, we collapsed the data across the levels of certainty used by the participants for their recognition judgments at test, meaning that we cannot conclusively link our results to recollection separately from familiarity. We do not regard this fact as undermining the novelty and importance of our data, because the ATN has been linked through human lesion data to the formation of episodic memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van der Werf et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al. 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, we do not wish to make strong claims in this regard, and have removed the word 'episodic' from relevant places in the manuscript and have added the following:</p><p>“The encoding and retrieval tasks were chosen for their simplicity, because recording was only possible at the bedside in the few days following intracranial surgery, and because we did not wish to lose data owing to failure of these rare participants to succeed at the tasks. […] Despite this lack of behavioral/psychological resolution, our data nevertheless provide novel evidence concerning the real-time role of the human ATN in memory formation.”</p><p>Please also see our response to a similar point raised by Reviewer 3, point 1.</p><p><italic>3) The authors did some analysis in an attempt to exclude attentional explanations for their findings. I think that this is neither necessary nor convincing. Reaction time differences in the simple orientation task (indoor/outdoor decision) might be related to modulations of attention, but they are dominated by stimulus features. The decision is just more difficult for some items than others. Also analyzing the probability of sequential encoding is not convincing. This analysis might track slowly modulated changes in attentional states, but it fails to detect trial-by-trial fluctuations of attention, which might be most relevant for the subsequent memory effect as assessed here. However, the subsequent memory paradigm depends on fluctuations in the probability to encode a series of items. If you would theoretically be able to align perfectly attention, stimuli, emotional valence and all other factors modulating the likelihood to encode an item successfully, a given subject would encode either all items or none</italic>.</p><p><italic>Somewhere, the subsequent memory design needs fluctuations in these factors. If the subject is able to perform the orientation task correctly (and above chance level), we can assume that he/she has processed the items attentively, further fluctuations of attention are most likely present and related to memory formation success, but this is no problem because these fluctuations are needed for this study design. To dissociate attentional from mnemonic components, one would for instance need a factorial design modulating memory formation and attention; very difficult to come up with a clever design (see Rees et al. Science 1999 for an attempt). To my opinion, the authors can just omit this attentional topic in their Results and Discussion section</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for making these points, and agree completely that variation in attention and other cognitive variables across items at encoding is necessary in order actually to enable a comparison of successful with unsuccessful memory encoding. Reviewer #3 raises the question, however, as to whether our findings reflect attentional processes, and Reviewer #1 (point 1) previously raises the question of whether attentional lapses due to epileptiform activity might be responsible for failures to encode, so we have retained the attention-related behavioral analyses in the Results section, and we have added the following to the Discussion section to incorporate these points made by Reviewer #1:</p><p>“We note, however, that variability in factors such as attention and the emotional valence of stimuli are fundamental to the study design in subsequent memory paradigms, affecting the probability of successfully encoding each item and thus enabling comparison of successful with unsuccessful encoding. Indeed, the early upper theta and alpha synchrony immediately following stimulus presentation during successful memory encoding is likely to reflect enhanced attention and perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Düzel et al. 2005</xref>), with the later theta synchrony timing fitting well with previous findings relating to memory encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schott et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hanslmayr and Staudigl 2014</xref>).”</p><p><italic>4) The authors are strict in localizing their effect in the anterior thalamic nucleus and distinguish this location from recordings in the dorsomedial thalamic nuclei. The data presented is not sufficient to support this specificity. Also the framing is too focused. For instance, they ignore the nucleus reunions, a most relevant thalamic relay station interacting with the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe during specific mnemonic processes (e.g., Xu and Südhof, Science 2013). Given the connectivity of this nucleus, it is way better suited to support memory formation by connecting to the (medial) prefrontal cortex. I suggest to present the electrode localization in more detail and to broaden the framing</italic>.</p><p>The significant theta synchrony difference between successful and unsuccessful encoding which we identified in the ATN was not detected in the DMTN. Moreover, this synchrony difference in the ATN was greater than that in the DMTN on direct comparison. We do not, however, intend to suggest that these findings mean that the ATN is the only thalamic nucleus to have a role in memory processing. Indeed published electrophysiological data from our research group already show a role for the DMTN in retrieval processing in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staudigl et al. 2012</xref>). We thank the reviewer for the suggestion of broadening the framing to comment on the importance of other thalamic nuclei in different aspects of memory processing.</p><p>The nucleus reuniens has indeed been demonstrated in rats to play a role in memory, specifically in fear conditioning and memory generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu and Südhof, 2013</xref>), with prefrontal cortical and hippocampal connectivity supporting a regulatory role in memory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vertes, et al., 2007</xref>). Recently this nucleus has also been found to play a role in spatial processing, which may complement hippocampal spatial processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jankowski et al. 2014</xref>). We do not have recordings from the nucleus reuniens because the electrode placement was determined for clinical purposes. Placement of electrodes in the ATN and DMTN provided a rare opportunity to record electrophysiological data from the human thalamus, and we investigated memory function, because human lesion studies and animal studies suggest that these nuclei play a role in memory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van der Werf et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggleton 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vertes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staudigl et al. 2012</xref>). The location of the nucleus reuniens relative to the ATN and DMTN is such that stereotactic placement of the electrodes in the ATN and DMTN precludes inadvertent placement in the nucleus reuniens (distance between ATN-/DMTN-targets and N. reuniens 10-15 mm), and indeed post-operative imaging was used to confirm correct electrode placement. Furthermore, the connectivity of the nucleus reuniens does not include direct communication with the ATN or DMTN (Cassel et al. 2013). Indeed it has been suggested that the nucleus reuniens is involved in a separate memory processing system to that incorporating the ATN and DMTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mennemeier et al. 1992</xref>).</p><p>We have added the following to the manuscript to broaden the framing as suggested:</p><p>“It should also be noted that memory processing may be divided into different subsystems, with different components of memory processing involving different thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mennemeier et al. 1992</xref>). For example, whereas human lesion and animal studies suggest a regulatory role for the ATN in memory encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van der Werf et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggleton 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vertes et al., 2001</xref>) and for the DMTN in retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van der Werf et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staudigl et al. 2012</xref>), other thalamic nuclei have also been found to be involved in different aspects of memory processing. […] Our focus on the ATN and DMTN is based on the rare availability of human electrophysiological data from these sites, which was determined by clinical requirements, and is consistent with extant data concerning the amnesic effects of lesions in these thalamic areas in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van der Werf et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al. 2000</xref>).”</p><p>We have also added more detail to the 'Participants, and intracranial and scalp recording' part of the 'Materials and methods' section regarding localization of the electrodes:</p><p>“Placement of the thalamic electrodes was performed stereotactically. The angle of entry through the skull and the depth of each electrode was calculated based on MRI images of each patient's brain pre-operatively.

Were the data collected? Are there plans for describing them in a separate publication? That would be fine, but it would be good to know</italic>.</p><p>The retrieval data were collected, and this question is indeed the subject of analyses in progress and the preparation of a separate manuscript. In this context, we note that encoding data are often reported alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paller, Kutas, and Mayes 1987</xref>; Gottlieb et al. 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weiss and Rappelsberger 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sederberg et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friese et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otten, Henson, and Rugg 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long, Burke, and Kahana 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schott et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Düzel et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schott et al. 2006</xref>), and we hope not to delay communication of the present encoding findings. As the reviewer and editors will appreciate from the substantial number of figures needed to illustrate our encoding data alone, including the retrieval data would result in a publication that would be long and difficult to digest for a reader, thus undermining the impact of the principal points made here.</p><p>In order to address the question, we have added:</p><p>“Data were also recorded during retrieval, but we focus on the encoding data here.”</p><p><italic>2) Could you please show raw power data for the successful/unsuccessful conditions? It would be important to know whether power also increases in the successful condition, and, in that case, whether the increased PLV computed could be ascribed to improved statistical power. Measures that take power into account as Martin Vinck's WPLI may be considered here</italic>.</p><p>The significance of the difference between power during successful compared with unsuccessful encoding is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2–figure supplement 8</xref>. We have now added panels showing the raw power data for successful compared with unsuccessful encoding frontally and in the RATN, as requested.</p><p>Given the absence of a significant difference in power, we chose to calculate phase-locking values, which measure timing separately from power. We considered application of the WPLI, but given that the power difference was not significant, and that the other concern WPLI was designed to address, namely volume conduction, is not likely to be a confounding factor in our analyses, given the spatial separation of the frontal cortex and the RATN, we believe the method we chose is appropriate. We have added the following to the manuscript to address this point:</p><p>“It should be noted that the calculation of PLVs may be influenced by a common reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vinck et al. 2011</xref>), and we addressed this issue by using bipolar referencing in our thalamic recordings (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staudigl et al. 2012</xref>). Volume conduction may also influence PLVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vinck et al. 2011</xref>), but in the present study, phase synchrony is calculated between the frontal cortex and the RATN, whose spatial separation should exclude this influence.”</p><p><italic>3) The authors state “The narrower gamma range involved during successful encoding may be interpreted as selection, via corticothalamic coupling, of RATN neural assemblies specific to a particular memory trace” I'm not sure I follow the logic behind this statement, could you please explain</italic>?</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that this statement of ours was not clear. The narrower gamma range could be interpreted as reflecting the firing of fewer neural assemblies, that is, those pertaining to a particular memory trace. We have modified the sentence to clarify this point:</p><p>“Assuming that an assembly of synchronously firing neurons is associated with a particular memory trace, the narrower RATN gamma range coupled with theta phase during successful memory formation could be interpreted as reflecting firing of only relevant neural assemblies, thus reflecting neural specificity during encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Düzel et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Desimone 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schott et al. 2006</xref>). We correspondingly postulate that the corticothalamic coupling may coordinate the firing of particular thalamic neural assemblies underpinning the memory to be encoded, facilitating synaptic strengthening and relevant memory formation.”</p><p><italic>4) The authors also state “Such a delay is broadly consistent with hippocampal-to-medial-prefrontal-cortex delays reported during theta phase synchrony in rats (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5"><italic>Benchenane et al., 2010</italic></xref><italic>;</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58"><italic>Siapas et al., 2005</italic></xref><italic>)”. Why does it make sense to compare to HC-PFC interactions here? In the present case the cortex is leading, in the former case is lagging</italic>.</p><p>We agree and have eliminated this point from the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) I am not certain that this study is actually testing episodic memory. The researchers use a recognition memory paradigm that includes a confidence measurement. One might argue that highly confident measurements are episodic-type retrieval more than recognition but in the analysis they appear to collapse all confidence measurements into two different categories. Given the available data, I assume it is difficult to disambiguate highly confident from only partially confident measurements, but I would prefer to see something that attempts to look more strongly at the “recall” type encoding events rather than those that are simply recognition events. Further, in a recognition memory paradigm, activity at retrieval is probably as important as activity during encoding for determining success and an analysis focusing on this epoch would be of interest. Specifically, examining activity time-locked to retrieval item presentation would be interesting. I think the study is still noteworthy, even if it assesses recognition memory and not episodic memory, but they authors may wish to re-cast their findings somewhat</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that separating responses according to confidence does not provide optimal trial numbers for statistical comparison of the electrophysiological data using synchrony measures. Given the novelty of the thalamic data, we elected to maximize the number of trials to maximize the power of the electrophysiological analyses, and our confidence in their reliability. As a result, as noted by the reviewer, we cannot disambiguate familiarity from recollection, and we have re-cast our findings accordingly in the manuscript. (Please see our response to Reviewer #1, point 2.) We intend to explore retrieval in subsequent work that is beyond the scope of the current manuscript for reasons also mentioned earlier. (Please see our response to Reviewer #2, point 1.)</p><p><italic>2) I am not certain of the region-specificity of the memory-related thalamic-cortical effect. The anterior thalamic nucleus was selected as a target for epilepsy because of wide cortical projections, a “way-station” between localized onset and generalization. Clinically, part of ATN electrode placement includes proving that stimulation elicits a driving response in multiple cortical locations (Lega, B. C., Halpern, C. H., Jaggi, J. L., &amp; Baltuch, G. H. (2010). Deep brain stimulation in the treatment of refractory epilepsy: update on current data and future directions. Neurobiology of disease, 38(3), 354-360.) To my eyes, in the supplementary figures, the parietal response is more robust than the examples of a frontal response that they show. Certainly, the memory-relevant thalamic connections may include multiple cortical areas, but if the memory effect does not have any region-specificity it may indicate orienting or attention, etc. more than a memory specific effect. Obtaining more scalp electrode data in these patients may be possible for future cases (dressing issue can be overcome by placing scalp leads under sterile conditions in the OR), but if the authors have any other contacts to report or can compare the frontal versus parietal activity this may help. They can also maybe differentiate frontal pole from FCz activity in the aggregated data. This would apply both to the synchrony analysis and the CFC analysis</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and now show the difference between PLVs during successful minus unsuccessful encoding as a mean across those participants with frontopolar electrodes, those with other frontal electrodes, and those with electrodes at Pz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2–figure supplement 9</xref>). While the synchrony pattern we report is discernible with all 3 cortical electrode placements, it is not identical. We also show the difference between frontal-RATN theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling involving the different frontal electrode placements. Again, the patterns are similar but not identical. We cannot, however, make strong claims about cortical specificity given the number of participants with each electrode placement. Participants 3-8 had only a single frontal electrode, at Fpz, and only participants 1 and 2 had other frontal and also parietal contacts, meaning that power is inadequate for a group statistical analysis to compare differing frontal and parietal synchrony directly.</p><p>We performed several additional analyses to address the question of the role of attention in our data, and note that attention plays a role in memory formation. (Please see point 3 by Reviewer #1.)</p><p>We have now addressed the issue of cortical specificity as follows, including adding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2–figure supplement 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>:</p><p>“The anterior thalamic nucleus is the target of stimulation in the treatment of focal epilepsy on the basis that seizure activity starting focally is propagated through this site to widespread cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lega et al. 2010</xref>). Regional cortical specificity in frontal-RATN synchrony would support our argument that the differences that we have identified are memory-specific. […] We note also, though, that both frontal and parietal cortices are well-recognized as being involved in memory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weiss and Rappelsberger 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Uncapher and Wagner 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sauseng et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sweeney-Reed et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friese et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otten, Henson, and Rugg 2002</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) I have a few concerns about the synchrony analysis. The clustering analysis shows significant synchrony in short time periods within the .5-1.5 second epoch, but for a 5 Hz oscillation I would expect something like .5-1 seconds of continuously significant synchrony difference via the PLV value across subjects. But when they compare the PLV value for the entire time window and compare across the subjects, the effect (p = 0.038) may not survive a correction for multiple comparisons across all of the different tests they performed. I would prefer to see more analyses that look across the relevant time window, long enough to account for a few cycles of the oscillation. Similarly, while the PLV difference is significant, I would like to see something (maybe I missed it) showing the level of synchrony by itself is significant for the same relevant, contiguous time epoch, at least for the putatively higher-synchrony condition (successful encoding). I assume the authors did this following the LaChaux methods but a plot showing the time windows that are significantly synchronous would be helpful</italic>.</p><p>We performed a cluster analysis in order to account for multiple comparisons in terms of time and frequency bins. The literature suggests that successful encoding might involve theta synchrony, because this frequency dominates in the hippocampus, whose role in memory processing is well-established, is the frequency at which ATN oscillations have been identified, and is the frequency implicated in ATN-hippocampal communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vertes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton et al. 2010</xref>). Moreover, human lesion and animal studies suggest a role for the ATN in successful memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van der Werf et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton et al. 2010</xref>). We provided analyses involving the DMTN, because data from this nucleus were also available, and such analysis supports the proposal that the theta synchrony is specific to the ATN, as predicted. We chose to display time-frequency plots that provide information regarding other frequencies in order to present a complete picture, despite justification for a focus simply on theta. The reviewer is correct that we applied phase synchrony analysis as proposed by Lachaux et al. We have added a further figure supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to address the reviewer's request for a plot showing that theta synchrony against time during the 0.5-1.5 s time window. Compared with surrogate data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Theiler et al. 1992</xref>), the PLV during successful encoding was significant (criterion <italic>P</italic> = 0.05) for 230 ms, which is more than a complete theta cycle at 5 Hz. The timescale is of the order of that over which synchrony is commonly detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varela et al. 2001</xref>).</p><p>We have added the following:</p><p>“The time course of theta synchrony is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Fig. 2 - figure supplement 3</xref>.

Note from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2 - figure supplement 2</xref> that theta synchrony was greater during successful than unsuccessful encoding in all 8 participants from 1.25-1.5 s post-stimulus, and the appearance of two separate episodes at the group level is likely to have arisen due to inter-participant differences in the timing of the synchrony episode over the 1 s time window from 0.5-1.5 s post-stimulus.”</p><p>We have also added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) I would prefer to see an analysis that includes a closer look at the different frequency components. Differential coupling of the higher-frequency (alpha range) component versus the lower frequency (4-8 Hz) component (for example frontal pole versus dorsal frontal versus parietal) would help establish a memory-specific effect for the theta component. Similarly, I would prefer to see the effects into the delta frequency range (2-4 Hz) given human data suggesting a memory-relevant effect in this frequency range (Lega et al., Slow-Theta-to-Gamma Phase-Amplitude Coupling in Human Hippocampus Supports the Formation of New Episodic Memories, Cereb Cortex. 2014 Oct 14. pii: bhu232, Watrous, Andrew J., Itzhak Fried, and Arne D.
