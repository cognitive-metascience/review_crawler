target proteins in specific subcellular regions. An immense disparity exists between promiscuity of WW domain-mediated target bindings and specific roles of WW domain proteins in cell growth regulation. Here, we discovered that WW domain tandems of KIBRA and MAGI, but not YAP, bind to specific target proteins with extremely high affinity and exquisite sequence specificity. Via systematic structural biology and biochemistry approaches, we decoded the target binding rules of WW domain tandems from cell growth regulatory proteins and uncovered a list of previously unknown WW tandem binding proteins including β-Dystroglycan, JCAD, and PTPN21. The WW tandem-mediated target recognition mechanisms elucidated here can guide functional studies of WW domain proteins in cell growth and polarity as well as in other cellular processes including neuronal synaptic signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>WW domain tandem</kwd><kwd>KIBRA</kwd><kwd>YAP</kwd><kwd>Hippo signaling</kwd><kwd>MAGI</kwd><kwd>LATS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Asia Foundation for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AFCR17SC01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Mingjie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA196878</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Kunliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AOE-M09-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Mingjie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C6004-17G</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Mingjie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA217642</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Kunliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM51586</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Kunliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEO15964</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Kunliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A systematic and quantitative investigation showing how highly specific WW domain-mediated protein-protein interaction network is organized in cell growth and polarity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>WW domain, one of the smallest protein-protein interaction domains composed of only ~35 amino acid residues, are widely distributed in many proteins with diverse functions (e.g. a totally of 95 WW domain in 53 proteins in the human proteome). WW domains organize molecular assemblies by binding to short, proline rich peptide motifs each with ~4–6 residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sudol and Hunter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Salah, 2012</xref>). The type I WW domains bind to a consensus ‘PPxY’ motif (where P is proline, x is any amino acid and Y is tyrosine, also known as PY-motif) with very modest affinities (with <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> in the range of a few to a few tens of µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aragón et al., 2011</xref>). The human proteome contains ~1,500 ‘PPxY’ motifs in &gt;1000 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tapia et al., 2010</xref>). Most of the WW domains in the human proteome belong to the type I (52 out of a total of 95). Therefore, the combinations of potential WW domain/‘PPxY’ interactions are enormous. This immediately raises an issue on WW domain-mediated target binding specificities.</p><p>Taking the Hippo signaling pathway for an example, the pathway is organized by serval WW domain proteins (e.g. YAP, TAZ, KIBRA, and SAV1) and a number of PY-motif containing proteins such as LATS (LATS1 and LATS2), Angiomotins (AMOTs, including AMOT, AMOTL1 and AMOTL2), and PTPN14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sudol, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salah and Aqeilan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu and Guan, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The interactions between WW domains and PY-motifs in the Hippo pathway are very promiscuous, as nearly everyone of these WW containing proteins has been reported to interact with anyone of the PY-motif containing targets. For example, YAP WW domains have been reported to bind to PY motifs from LATS, AMOTs, PTPN14, p73, SMAD1, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Strano et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alarcón et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Michaloglou et al., 2013</xref>). KIBRA WW domains have also been reported to bind to PY-motifs from LATS, AMOTs, and PTPN14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumgartner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genevet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knight et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hermann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). The WW domains of SAV1 can bind to PY motifs of LATS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tapon et al., 2002</xref>). Additionally, PY motifs of LATS1, AMOT and PTPN14 have also been shown to bind to WW domain-containing NEDD family E3 ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim and Jho, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nguyen and Kugler, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Salah, 2012</xref>). However, it is not clear how such a large array of WW/PY-motif interactions in the regulation of Hippo signaling are inter-related during cell growth processes and whether all these reported interactions occur in living cells. Since whether YAP is in nuclei or in cytoplasm dictates the fate of cell growth and polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun and Irvine, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moya and Halder, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fulford et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2015a</xref>), it is envisaged that at least some of the WW/PY-motif interactions need to be specific.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49439.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Super strong bindings of the KIBRA WW tandem to PY-motif containing proteins in cell growth control.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram showing the domain organization of selected WW-tandem containing proteins and multiple PY-motifs containing proteins in cell growth and polarity.

KIBRA also contains a WW tandem that binds to PY-motifs from the same set of proteins. Additionally, the cell polarity regulator, MAGIs (MAGI1-3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), each contains a WW domain tandem capable of binding to various PY-motif proteins such as LATS, AMOTs and PTPN14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Couzens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bratt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patrie, 2005</xref>). A systematic and quantitative study of the interactions between the three WW tandem proteins (YAP, KIBRA, and MAGIs) and many of the PY-motif containing proteins in cell growth control (e.g. those highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) will be vitally important to understand how these proteins function to orchestrate cell growth control.</p><p>In this study, we decoded the target binding mechanisms governing the WW tandem-mediated target interactions by focusing on proteins involved in cell growth and polarity regulations. To achieve this goal, we determined the high resolustion structures of 7 representative WW tandem/target complexes, and measured the binding constants of &gt;100 WW domain tandems or isolated WW domains binding to known or previously unknown targets. In sharp contrast to the common perception, we discovered that the WW tandem and PY-motif interactions are often extremely specific and strong, a finding that can rationalize numerous protein-protein interactions in cell growth and polarity. The rules underlying WW tandem/PY-motif interactions revealed in our study also allowed us to predict previously unknown binders of WW domain proteins. The results presented in this study may serve as a portal for future studies of WW domain containing proteins in general.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>WW Tandem-mediated bindings to PY-motif proteins can be extremely specific and strong</title><p>To begin such a systematic study, we first set out to compare bindings of the WW tandems of YAP and KIBRA with PY-motifs from LATS, AMOTs and PTPN14. We also included another PY-motif containing protein Dendrin in the study, serving as a reference for super strong target bindings involving WW domains (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> ~2.1 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>; also see our recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). Similar to the two PY-motifs of Dendrin that are separated by only two residues, the first two PY-motifs of PTPN14 are also next to each other with only two residues in between, and the PY12 motif sequence is evolutionarily conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, PY3 and PY4 of PTPN14 are separated by 178 residues. We found that the KIBRA WW tandem also binds to PTPN14 PY12 with a super strong affinity (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> ~8.2 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). We were not able to perform quantitative binding assay between KIBRA WW tandem and PTPN14 PY34 as we could not obtain purified recombinant PY34. In a pull-down-based assay, the interaction between the KIBRA WW tandem with PY34 was essentially undetectable when using PY12 as the control (data not shown). We further showed that KIBRA WW1 had a very weak binding to PTPN14 PY12 (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> ~32 μM) and KIBRA WW2 had no detectable binding to PTPN14 PY12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Taken together, the above biochemical study revealed that the KIBRA WW tandem, via synergistic binding to the two PY-motifs immediately next to each other (i.e. PY12), can form a very tight complex with PTPN14.</p><p>The very tight bindings of the two closely spaced PY-motifs of PTPN14 (PY12) and Dendrin (PY23) with the KIBRA WW12 tandem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) prompted us to analyze the PY-motif sequences of AMOTs and LATS carefully. We found that the last canonical PY-motif of AMOT (the ‘PPEY’-motif, named as PY3 in the literature) is preceded with an ‘LMRY’-motif, and these two motifs are only separated with two residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, and we define these two motifs as ‘PY34’ from hereon). This sequence is conserved for AMOT and AMOTL1 throughout the evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also found that the second canonical PY-motif of LATS1 (‘PPPY’) is preceded with an ‘APSY’-motif, and the two motifs are separated by only three residues with the sequence of ‘<sup>552</sup>QGP<sup>554</sup>’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, and these two motifs are defined as ‘PY23’). Again, the sequence containing the ‘APSY’- and ‘PPPY’-motifs and the gap residues in between are highly conserved in LATS1 in different species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, a Gly553Glu mutation of LATS1 was found in patients with renal cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2015b</xref>). Unexpectedly, the KIBRA WW tandem binds to AMOT PY34 with a high affinity (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> ~96 nM), although the PY3 sequence severely deviates from the canonical WW domain binding PY-motif of ‘PPxY’. It is important to note that the KIBRA WW tandem binds to AMOT PY12, of which both PY1 and PY2 are canonical PY-motifs but are separated by 130 residues, with a very weak affinity (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> ~16.7 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We further found that the KIBRA WW tandem binds to LATS1 PY23 with a <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of ~0.78 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), but much more weakly to the canonical PY1 motif (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> ~78 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Every WW domain forms a canonical β-sheet fold with three anti-parallel β-strands.

The interactions between WW2 and the first PY-motif are more variable, as their sequences can significantly deviate from the optimal ‘PPxY’-motif (e.g. AMOT’s 1<sup>st</sup> PY motif has an unusual ‘LMRY’ sequence, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Correspondingly, KIBRA WW2 has an Ile (I81) instead of a highly conserved Trp at the end of the β3-strand (e.g. W34 in WW1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). The Leu and Met in the PY3-motif of AMOT form hydrophobic interaction with I81 and Y70 from WW2. This explains why KIBRA WW2 can accommodate non-‘ΨPxY’ motif sequences, as long as the two residues corresponding to ‘Ψ’ and ‘P’ are hydrophobic. The fact that the type I WW domain can bind to a ‘ΦΦxY’ sequence motif (where ‘Φ’ can be other uncharged amino acids in addition to Pro; for example ‘VPSY’ and ‘TPDY’ in PTPN14, ‘APSY’ in LATS1, and ‘LMRY’ in AMOT) significantly expands the target binding repertoire for WW domain-containing proteins.</p><p>In addition to the two PY-motifs, the residues in the linker and the C-terminal extension of the targets also contribute to their bindings to the KIBRA WW tandem. A residue in the PY-motif linker (R440 in PTPN14, Q282 in AMOT and G553 in LATS) uses its carbonyl group to form a hydrogen-bond with the sidechain of Trp34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). The sidechain of R440 of PTPN14 also forms charge-charge interactions with D17 and D19 in β12 loop of WW1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The C-terminal extension of PTPN14 and that of AMOT form additional hydrophobic and charge-charge interactions with the WW1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). All these interactions contribute to the bindings of PTPN14 and AMOT to KIBRA WW tandem.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The WW tandems of MAGI2, MAGI3 and KIBRA resemble with each other in target bindings</title><p>Many WW domain proteins contain multiple WW domains connected in tandem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We asked whether there might exist type I WW tandems adopting similar high affinity target bindings as KIBRA WW tandem does. Since the inter-domain linker and the α-helix following WW2 are critical for forming the supramodular structure and target bindings of KIBRA WW tandem, we searched for possible existences of these two elements in other type I WW tandems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). By sequence alignment of WW tandems, including those from KIBRA, MAGIs, YAP, SAV1, WWOX, ITCH WW12 and ITCH WW34, we found that MAGI2 and MAGI3 WW tandems have striking similarities to KIBRA WW tandem both in the inter-domain linker (23 aa in MAGI2 and MAGI3 vs 24 aa in KIBRA and with ~60% sequence similarity) and in the C-terminal helix regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To our delight, ITC assays showed that MAGI2 and MAGI3 WW tandems indeed bind to PTPN14 PY12 with strong affinities (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> values of ~55 nM and ~103 nM, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). It is noted that although MAGI1 WW tandem shares a similar C-terminal helix extension with the KIBRA WW tandem, it possesses a longer WW12 domain linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Correspondingly, MAGI1 WW tandem was found to bind to PTPN14 PY12 with a modest affinity (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> ~4 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), presumably due to the spatial hindrance caused by the extra amino acids in the linker. We further found that MAGI2 and MAGI3 WW tandems bind to Dendrin PY23 with extremely high affinities (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> values of ~2.3 and~3.6 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), further supporting the conclusion that MAGI2, MAGI3 and KIBRA WW tandems share a high similarity in target bindings. Like KIBRA WW12, MAGI2 and MAGI3 WW tandems bind to LATS1 PY23 with modest affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Finally, the rest of the type I WW tandems analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> were found to bind to PTPN14 PY12 or LATS1 PY23 with very weak affinities or with no detectable binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, the above biochemical and bioinformatics analyses strongly indicated that WW tandems can have very strong affinities and exquisite specificities in recognizing their targets.</p><p>We solved the crystal structure of MAGI2 WW tandem in complex with Dendrin PY23 at the 1.65 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A structural comparison of the MAGI2 WW tandem in complex with Dendrin with those of the KIBRA WW tandem in complex with various ligands shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> showed that the overall structures of KIBRA and MAGI2 WW tandems in these complexes are similar to each other (RMSD values of 2.3–2.7 Å for the Cα atoms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Notably, the extensive interactions between the inter-domain linker and the C-terminal helix stabilize the supramodular structure of the MAGI2 WW tandem, and the Dendrin PY23 binds to the MAGI2 WW tandem following almost the exactly same detailed interactions as those observed in the KIBRA WW12/Dendrin PY23 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ji et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>YAP WW tandem adopts a very different structure and target binding mode compared to the KIBRA WW tandem</title><p>We also tried to determine the structures of the YAP WW tandem in complex with various ligands listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> to understand why YAP binds to these ligands with much lower affinities than does the KIBRA WW tandem. Despite extensive trials, we were not able to obtain any crystals when complexes were prepared by mixing the YAP WW tandem with the ligand peptides, likely due to conformational flexibilities of the WW tandem (see below). We were able to obtain high diffraction quality crystals when the Dendrin PY23 sequence was fused to either the N- or C-termini of the YAP WW tandem. We solved the structures of these two versions of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Although each WW domain engages the ‘PPxY’ motif following the canonical type I WW/target bindings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>), the overall structure of the YAP WW tandem/Dendrin PY23 complex differs substantially from those of the KIBRA/MAGI2 WW tandems in complex with the same ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> for example) in two distinct aspects. First, the inter-domain linker of the YAP WW tandem is unstructured and there is no C-terminal helix following YAP WW2. Thus, the two WW domains of YAP do not form a supramodule due to very limited inter-domain contact. This is supported by the two versions of the complex structures solved, in which the inter-domain orientations are obviously different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Second, the Dendrin PY23 binds to the YAP WW tandem in a parallel orientation (i.e. PY2 binds to WW1 and PY3 binds to WW2), instead of the antiparallel binding orientation observed for the KIBRA/MAGI2 WW tandems. This is again likely attributed by the lack of inter-domain interactions between the two WW domains of YAP so that each domain can freely choose its more preferred PY-motif. The above structural analysis indicates that the YAP WW tandem would bind to the ligands containing two closely spaced PY motifs with only modest affinities due to the lack of large conformational coupling of its two WW domains. The WW tandems of Yorkie and YAP (Yorkie is the YAP ortholog in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) bind to Dendrin PY23 with the comparable affinities (~500 nM vs ~400 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Howerver, the amino acid sequence linking the Yorkie WW tandem is totally different from that of YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>), further indicating that the linker sequence connecting the YAP WW tandem does not play active structural roles during the protein evolution. In contrast, the inter-domain linker sequences of the KIBRA, MAGI2 and MAGI3 WW tandems are highly conserved during the evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Origin of the exquisite target binding specificity of WW tandems</title><p>The similarities both in their structures and binding affinities to a set of common ligands indicate that the WW tandems of KIBRA, MAGI2 and MAGI3 share a common binding mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The extensive interactions between the inter-domain linker and the C-terminal helix couples the two WW domain into a structural supramodule in these WW tandems, thus providing a structural and thermodynamic basis for highly synergistic bindings to target proteins. For example, the formation of the WW tandem supramodule allowed KIBRA WW12 to bind to PTPN14 with an ~3900 fold higher affinity when compared to the isolated WW domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). In contrast, the coupling between WW1 and WW2 in YAP is minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Therefore, the target binding synergism between the two WW domains in the YAP tandem is also low. For example, the binding of YAP WW tandem to Dendrin PY23 is only a few tens tighter than the isolated WW domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B and D</xref>), and this relatively low synergism likely originates from the very closely spaced PY-motifs of Dendrin PY23. Consistent with this analysis, very little synergism could be observed in the bindings of the YAP WW tandem to two PY motifs separated with extended linking sequences such as AMOT PY12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1E</xref>). NMR-based studies revealed that, in the absence of ligands, there is no direct conformational coupling between the two WW domains in the WW tandems of KIBRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ji et al., 2019</xref>), YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Webb et al., 2011</xref>), and MAGI2 (our unpublished data).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49439.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Binding modes of WW tandems to PY motifs.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Combined surface and ribbon diagram showing the domain coupling of the WW tandems of KIBRA (<bold>A</bold>), MAGI2 (<bold>B</bold>), and YAP (<bold>C</bold>), each in complex with Dendrin PY23. The cartoon in each panel is used to show the coupling mechanism of the WW domain tandems in the complexes.

In the WW tandem structures of KIBRA and MAGI2, a hydrophobic residue from WW1 (I35 in KIBRA and L330 in MAGI2) inserts into a hydrophobic pocket formed by WW2 domain and the inter-domain linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Substitution of this hydrophobic residue with a negatively charged Asp should impair this hydrophobic interaction and thus exert a negative impact on the synergism of the two WW tandems. Indeed, the I35D substitution weakened KIBRA’s binding to PTPN14 PY12 by ~50 fold, and the L330D mutation decreased MAGI2’s binding to Dendrin PY23 by ~57 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). L244 in YAP is the structurally equivalent residue of I35 in the KIBRA WW tandem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Totally consistent with the structural finding of very little coupling between the two WW domains in YAP, the L244D mutation had no impact on YAP’s binding to either Dendrin PY23 or AMOT PY12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The L244D mutation data of YAP WW12 further support that the mild synergism of the binding between the YAP WW tandem and Dendrin PY23 originates from the two closely spaced PY motifs of Dendrin.</p><p>The strong structural couplings between the two WW domains of the KIBRA and MAGI WW tandems indicate that their two PY-motif-binding pockets are fixed both in distance and orientation. Indeed, the distances between Cα atoms of the Trp residue at the end of β3 of WW1 (one of the two defining Trp residues in WW domains) and of the His residue in β2-β3 hairpin of WW2 (which is absolutely required for engaging the Tyr residue in the ‘ΨPxY’ motif) are in a very narrow range of 7.2–7.9 Å among the complex structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Correspondingly, the distances between the two PY motifs of the ligands, measured between the Cα of Tyr in the 1<sup>st</sup> PY and the Cα of Pro in 2<sup>nd</sup> PY, are also fixed at ~9.8 Å. The exception is the LATS1 PY23 motifs with the two Cα atoms separated by ~11.5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Notably, the PY-motifs in PTPN14, Dendrin and AMOT are all separated by only two residues, and all three ligands bind to the KIBRA, MAGI2 and MAGI3 WW tandems with very high affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In contrast, the two PY-motifs of LATS1 are separated by three residues (‘QGP’) and LATS1 binds to the three WW tandems with quite modest affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Strikingly, deleting the Gly residue (Gly553) in the three-residue linker of LATS1 PY23 converted the LATS1 mutant (‘LATS1-Δ553’) into a very strong binder of the KIBRA WW tandem (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> ~17 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), indicating that a two-residue linker between the two PY-motifs is optimal for specific and high affinity binding to the KIBRA, MAGI2 and MAGI3 WW tandems. We further showed that shortening the linker of the PTPN14 PY12 to one residue (R, 1res) weakened its binding to both KIBRA and MAGI3 WW tandems by as much as ~4400 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, lengthening the linker of the PTPN14 PY12 to three residues (RRP, 3res) also significantly weakened its bindings to the KIBRA and MAGI3 WW tandems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In contrast, lengthening the linker of the PTPN14 PY12 to three residues had negligible impact on its binding to the YAP WW tandem, presumably its conformational flexibility allows the tandem to adjust the inter-domain distances and orientations.</p><p>In summary, we can divide the bindings between the WW domain tandems and two PY-motifs containing targets into three modes: 1), the highly synergistic and very strong binding mode, represented by the KIBRA, MAGI2 and MAGI3 WW tandems, which requires the tight conformational coupling of the two WW domains as well as two PY-motifs separated by two and only two residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D1</xref>); 2), the low synergistic binding mode with modestly high affinities, represented by the YAP WW tandem, which does not require tight coupling between the two WW domains but with two PY-motifs separated by a short linker of a few residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D2</xref>); and 3), those with no synergism and with weak binding affinities, in which the two WW domains do not couple with each other and the two PY motifs are separated by long linking sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D3</xref>).

The weakened binding of the LATS1-G553E mutant to KIBRA WW12 is likely due to more rigid backbone conformation of Glu over the Glycine residue in the WT protein, such that the defined distance between the two PY-motif binding pockets of KIBRA WW12 can no longer accommodate the LATS1 PY23 mutant.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49439.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Deletion of Gly553 in LATS1 inhibits YAP phosphorylation in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram showing the interaction of LATS with KIBRA or YAP.

First, residues in the two-residue PY-motif linker can enhance binding. For example, R440 of PTPN14 PY12 forms salt bridges with D17 and D19 in the WW1 of the KIBRA WW tandem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Substitution of R440 with Ala weakened PTPN14’s binding to KIBRA by 17-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Second, the C-terminal extension of PTPN14 PY12 tandem enhances its binding to KIBRA WW tandem by forming hydrophobic interactions with its WW1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Truncating this C-terminal extension weakened PTPN14 PY12’s binding to the WW tandems of KIBRA and MAGI3 (‘Del-C’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Third, converting the non-canonical PY-motifs into canonical ones (i.e. ‘PPxY’) further enhanced PTPN14 PY12’s binding to both KIBRA and MAGI3 WW tandems (‘2Pro’ and ‘4Pro’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Finally, although not tested here, one may be able to further enhance the ligand binding to the KIBRA and MAGI WW tandems by utilizing a small unoccupied hydrophobic surface of WW2 to bind to residue(s) N-terminal to the first PY-motif (the dashed oval in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49439.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Specificity determinants of closely spaced PY motif to the WW tandems of KIBRA and MAGI2/3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Surface combined with ribbon-stick model showing the binding between the KIBRA WW tandem and PTPN14 PY12. The figure is to show that, in addition to the WW/PY motif interactions, the inter-PY motif linker and the extension sequence following PY2 (as indicated by the green ovals) also play critical roles for the super strong bindings between the WW tandem and the PY motifs.

However, substitutions of the Pro residue with Cys, Ala, Ser, Thr, and Val lead to only mild weakening of the binding, whereas substitutions with bulky hydrophobic Leu, Met and Ile essentially disrupted the binding. The above results can be rationalized by the structure of the KIBRA WW tandem in complex with PTPN14 PY12 showing that the pocket accommodating the residue (T442 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) is quite small.</p><p>Our structural studies of the five WW tandem/target complexes also revealed that the sequence requirement for the first PY motif is relatively loose.

Such strong bindings are realized by both highly synergistic conformational coupling of two WW domains connected in tandem and two PY-motifs separated by a two and only two amino acid residues linker. If only using either one of the above two elements, the bindings become to be weakly synergistic and with modest affinities with <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of a few hundreds of nM to a few µM. When two uncoupled WW domains binding to two PY motifs separated by more than two residues, their bindings are weak with <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of a few to a few tens µM or even weaker due to very little or no synergism of the bindings between the two domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Weak targeting binding synergisms resulted from week couplings of WW domains connected in tandem have also been reported in several other cases in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aragón et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Verma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fedoroff et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qi et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, it is well known that isolated WW domains bind to their targets with low affinities (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> in the range of a few tens to a few hundreds of µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sudol and Hunter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Salah, 2012</xref>). Therefore, WW domains can bind to their target proteins with a very broad affinity range with <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> values range from a few nM to hundreds of µM or weaker. Presumably, those high affinity WW tandem-mediated target interactions should play specific functions. For example, we recently showed that the tight binding between KIBRA and Dendrin (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> ~2.1 nM) is critical for KIBRA (and its associated AMPA receptors) localization in neuronal synapses and for synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). We have also demonstrated that bindings of short PY motif containing peptides to WW tandems can be readily enhanced to sub-nanomolar affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and these super-strong WW tandem binding peptides may be used as effective tools for studying the role of specific interactions between WW tandem proteins and target proteins (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ji et al., 2019</xref>) for an example). As for the very weak WW domain/target interactions, cautions are required in interpreting potential functional implications of such bindings.</p><p>The enhanced PY-motif containing target binding afforded by WW domains connected in tendem is in line with the Second Law of Thermodynamics. For a tandem/bivalent system, the binding energy can be written as ΔG<sub>total</sub> = ΔG<sub>1</sub> + ΔG<sub>2</sub> - ΔG<sub>c</sub>; where ΔG<sub>1</sub> and ΔG<sub>2</sub> represent the binding free energy of the two individual sites and ΔG<sub>c</sub> can be viewed as amount of energy penalty (or conformational entropy loss) due to non-perfect conformational coupling of the two binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou and Gilson, 2009</xref>). For a system with perfect conformational coupling, ΔG<sub>c</sub> would be approaching zero. For a system without any conformational coupling, the two bind sites can be viewed as completely separate (i.e. the stronger binding site prevails). ΔG<sub>c</sub> often falls in between the above two extreme conditions in real biological systems. For the KIBRA WW tandem, the situation is even more complicated as its WW2 is only partially folded in the absence of ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). The total free energy will also include a binding-induced domain folding energy.</p><p>As for the WW domain-mediated protein-protein interactions in cell growth and polarity, the results presented in the current study will be valuable to re-evaluate many of reported protein-protein interactions and for guiding experimental designs in the future. For example, the bindings of the KIBRA, MAGI2, and MAGI3 tandems to PTPN14 (and PTPN21) are so much stronger than the binding of YAP to PTPN14 (~1,400 fold difference; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, it is almost for sure that PTPN14 should first bind to KIBRA and MAGI instead of to YAP when PTPN14 is not in excess. The binding between PTPN14 to YAP can occur if PTPN14 is in excess of the total amount of KIBRA and MAGI together. Alternatively, PTPN14 may use its PY34 to bind to the YAP WW tandem via rather weaker binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Michaloglou et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, the binding of the KIBRA tandem (or MAGI2 and MAGI3 WW tandems) to LATS1 is ~4.5 fold stronger than YAP tandem to LATS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), therefore KIBRA might be able to modulate the concentration of the LATS1/YAP complex formation by competing with YAP for binding to LATS1. This is supported by the finding that further enhancing the KIBRA/LATS1 binding by deleting Gly553 in the LATS1 PY23 linker can effectively block LATS1-mediated YAP phosphorylation, presumably due to the effective sequestration of LATS1-Δ553 by KIBRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It should be noted that there are multiple strong KIBRA WW tandem binders such as PTPN14, PTPN21, Dendrin, AMOT, β-Dystroglycan, and JCAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), these molecules can tune the availability of free KIBRA in competing with YAP for binding to LATS. One may view that proteins like KIBRA and MAGIs function as an upstream nexus that can sense various cell growth and polarity cues and then determine whether and how much the LATS/YAP complex can form (i.e. determining the level of YAP phosphorylation by LATS) in living tissues. Conversely, certain PY motif containing proteins such as AMOTs can effectively compete with LATS for binding to YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and thereby regulate the LATS/YAP complex formation. It is noted that most of the studies in elucidating molecular roles of WW domain proteins and their PY motif-containing targets involved in cell growth and cell polarity in the literature used protein overexpression or removal approaches. Such methods unavoidably would alter the WW domain-mediated protein-protein interaction network, which is very sensitive to the concentrations of each protein based on the quantitatively binding affinity data presented in this work. Therefore, we advocate that, when studying proteins in cell growth and polarity, cares should be taken to consider the quantitative binding affinities and endogenous concentrations of these proteins. Finally, our study also indicates that mutations of either WW tandem proteins or their PY-motif containing targets found in patients not only can affect the bindings of their direct targets, but may also alter other protein interactions in this intricate cell growth and polarity regulatory protein network organized by the WW tandem/PY-motif interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All reagents and analytical tools used for this paper and described in the methods below are compiled as a table in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs, Protein Expression and Purification</title><p>The coding sequences of desired constructs were PCR amplified from mouse brain cDNA libraries.

All site mutations were created by PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing. All constructs used for protein expression were individually cloned into a pET vector and recombinant proteins were expressed in Codon-plus BL21 (DE3) <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells with induction by 0.3 mM IPTG at 16°C overnight. All recombinant proteins were purified using Ni<sup>2+</sup>-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Ni-NTA) column followed by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 column from GE Healthcare) in a final buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA. The selenomethionine-labeled proteins were expressed by methionine auxotroph <italic>E. coli</italic> B834 cells in LeMaster media and was purified following the same protocol used for the wild-type proteins. All tags of recombinant proteins were removed before crystallization, except for the His<sub>6</sub>-tagged YAP-‘L’-Dendrin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Isothermal Titration Calorimetry assay</title><p>Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) experiments were carried out on a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal) at 25°C. Titration buffer contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA. For a typical experiment, each titration point was performed by injecting a 10 μL aliquot of protein sample (50–300 μM) into the cell containing another reactant (5–30 μM) at a time interval of 120 s to ensure that the titration peak returned to the baseline. For the competition experiments, proteins in the syringe were titrated to a mixture with a 2-fold molar concentration excess of a competitor over the reactants in the cell. For the ITC-based binding assays, most of the PY-motif containing peptide fragments were prepared by fusing each peptide fragment to the C-terminal end of the TRX-tag (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> for details). Several cases were chosen to investigate whether the Trx fusion tag might impose certain impact on the PY motif peptides in their bindings to WW domains. We chose several minimal PY motif peptides (e.g. the Dendrin PY23 and β-DG PY34) for such analysis. It was reasoned if the fusion tag does not affect the minimal PY-motif peptides in binding to their targets, the same fusion tag likely would not alter the bindings of longer PY motif-containing peptides with more flexible residues surrounding the PY motif to WW domains. We showed that the TRX-tag had a negligible impact on the bindings of the Dendrin PY23 peptide and the β-DG PY34 peptide to KIBRA WW12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The titration data were analyzed with Origin7.0 (MicroCal) using a one-site binding or competitive binding model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Crystallization and data collection</title><p>All crystals were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion methods at 4°C or 16°C within 3–5 days.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including William I Weis as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a thorough and rigorous study of the interactions of tandem WW domains with tandem peptide ligands. Although the binding of WW domains to their ligands has been characterized previously, the affinities are low, making it hard to discriminate among potential PY motif-containing ligands. The authors demonstrate that a specific structural arrangement of tandem WW domains can produce to high-affinity binding. The enhancement is tuned by the spacing, rigidity and sequence of the linker, and the tandem also enables binding to non-canonical sequences as well as sequences flanking the PY motifs. An important result is that the specific tandem arrangement of WW domains can relax the canonical &quot;ΨPxY&quot; motif in the ligand that binds to the second WW domain and enable specific interactions with residues that flank the motif. Searching this relaxed, extended motif throughout the human proteome led to the identification of novel high-affinity binders to MAGI3 and KIBRA. This detailed study will have a major impact on how researchers think about WW domain protein interaction networks in processes where numerous WW domains are involved. Understanding these sequence/affinity relationships may help to sort out some of the confusing cell biological data on these interactions. The importance of these tuned affinities is shown by the experiments on YAP/LATS phosphorylation in Figure 5.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers feel that the manuscript is rather dense and hard to digest, and would benefit from reorganizing it around the key take-home message that affinity enhancements provided by tandem WW and PY motifs enable specificity for specific proteins, given the relatively weak binding of single WW domains to PY peptides. This includes the effect of the spacing, rigidity and sequence of the WW-domain linker, and also that the tandem also enables binding to non-canonical PY motifs and flanking sequences. It may help to put some of the detail into the figure legends.</p><p>1) Although the findings are exciting and important, the idea that is illustrated so clearly here is not new. The finding that tandem (bivalent) interactions are higher in affinity than monovalent interactions has been discussed for decades. It is commonly accepted that individual WW domains can bind promiscuously, albeit weakly, and that many proteins use numerous or tandem WW domains to enhance affinity and specificity (e.g. see overview in Dodson et al., 2015). A similar mechanism of affinity enhancement has been demonstrated for tandem SH2 domains, e.g., tandem SH2 domains found in proteins such as ZAP-70 can bind to their native TAMs with low nanomolar affinity, and the spacing of the motifs in the TAMs matter. The authors should include a discussion of such prior work, to provide context for their results. It would also be useful to discuss the expected affinity enhancements from a theoretical perspective. Huan-Xiang Zhou at Florida State has written a lot on this. Is a 1000X enhancement just from having two adjacent domains rigid in a binding competent form (KIBRA) compared to flexible (YAP) expected? Assuming the binding competent form is energetically accessible to YAP, the question is, what fraction of the total conformations does it represent? If it is 1/1000, then the observed result is expected. If it is 1/10 then it is not. Obviously, the number of conformations in YAP (with disordered linker) will depend on its linker length, but Zhou et al. have decent models for this.</p><p>2) In the text you describe large specificity enhancements for ordered tandem WW modules like KIBRA. It would be helpful to define what you mean by specificity, and give specific comparisons that demonstrate the specificity enhancement. It seems likely that the specificity being discussed is large differences in affinities of the tandem for different PY2 motifs compared to small differences in affinities of the corresponding single WW motifs for respective PY1 sequences. If so, please clarify and expand, and if not, please describe what is meant by specificity and what observations support the claim</p><p>3) It is not made clear whether the interactions of the tandem WW domains seen in the ligand complexes are present in the absence of ligand. Apart from the inability to crystallize the YAP complexes without fusions (a fairly weak argument), the authors should discuss whether there is evidence for flexibility between them when not bound. Have NMR or SAXS analyses been done, for example? Also, given that ITC was used to measure the affinities, it would be useful to know if any insights into can be gleaned from the enthalpy/entropy breakdowns. For example, if the formation of the complex immobilizes the two domains, one might expect to see a relatively unfavorable entropy of binding (in addition to possible unfavorable entropy of binding due to immobilizing flexible peptide ligands).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Decoding WW Domain Tandem-mediated Target Recognitions in Tissue Growth and Cell Polarity&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The concept of “tandem (bivalent) interactions are higher in affinity than monovalent interactions” is indeed well established. This concept is rooted in the Second Law of Thermodynamics. For a tandem/bivalent system, the binding energy can be written as ΔG<sub>total</sub> = ΔG<sub>1</sub> + ΔG<sub>2</sub> - DG<sub>c</sub>; where ΔG<sub>1</sub> and ΔG<sub>2</sub> represent the binding free energy of the two individual sites and ΔG<sub>c</sub> can be viewed as amount of energy penalty (or conformational entropy loss; also see Zhou and Gilson, 2009, review) due to non-perfect conformational coupling of the two binding sites. For a system with perfect conformational coupling, ΔG<sub>c</sub> would be approachingzero. For a system without any conformational coupling, the two bind sites can be viewed as completely separate (i.e. the stronger binding site prevails). ΔG<sub>c</sub> often falls in between the above two extreme conditions in real biological systems. For example, in the YAP/Dendrin system, the binding affinity for the YAP WW tandem to PY23 of Dendrin is ~400 nM in <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>. A perfect coupling would give a <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of ~0.6 nM (16 μM x 37 μM; the binding affinities of each WW domain to PY23 are presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). For the KIBRA WW tandem, the situation is even more complicated as its WW2 is only partially folded in the absence of ligands (Ji et al., 2019). The total free energy will also include a binding-induced domain folding energy.</p><p>Since the general thermodynamic concept on the bivalent system is so well-established, we did not elaborate this in any detail in our manuscript. Additionally, the manuscript at the current stage has already contained a huge amount of information, we decided not to make any attempt in dissecting the thermodynamic terms of the binding events. Additionally, we intend to make this paper also accessible to colleagues outside the field of biochemistry and biophysics, so we have been trying to minimize thermodynamic details of the bindings investigated. We have cited the nice review paper by Zhou and Gilson (2009) in the revised manuscript (at the end of the subsection “Origin of the exquisite target binding specificity of WW tandems”) by stating “The above findings are consistent with well-established thermodynamic principles governing multivalent protein/ligand interactions (see Zhou and Gilson (2009) for a review)”.</p><p>What is not known for the WW tandem-mediated target binding system is how such thermodynamic principle is used. Our study uncovered that certain WW tandems have strong couplings, certain ones have weak coupling, and some are essentially with very little coupling. We have also provided structural bases for such different modes of couplings. The findings presented in our study should be valuable for colleagues working on WW tandem-related proteins. Having said this, we totally agree that our study does <italic>not</italic> uncover new thermodynamic concept for the bivalent biomolecular interactions. Accordingly, we did not make any claim on the discovery of thermodynamics concepts of the bindings in our manuscript. Instead, we have used the well-established thermodynamic principle to explain and rationalize the findings for the WW tandem/target interactions investigated in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the text you describe large specificity enhancements for ordered tandem WW modules like KIBRA. It would be helpful to define what you mean by specificity, and give specific comparisons that demonstrate the specificity enhancement. It seems likely that the specificity being discussed is large differences in affinities of the tandem for different PY2 motifs compared to small differences in affinities of the corresponding single WW motifs for respective PY1 sequences. If so, please clarify and expand, and if not, please describe what is meant by specificity and what observations support the claim</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point! Binding specificity is related but does not equal to binding affinity. For a mixture of many proteins capable of forming different complexes in a test tube, the binding specificity of a particular pair is determined by their binding affinity relative to other interactions and the concentration of each component (as we mentioned in the second paragraph in the Discussion section). The binding specificity in living cells is even more complicated due to additional factors such as spatial segregations of different components. This point is very important to the WW domain proteins covered in the current study, as the vast majority of WW domain-mediated target interaction studies published in the literature used either overexpression or removal (knockdown or knockout) approaches. Very often a detected interaction after such protein manipulations may not reflect the true cellular interactions under their native conditions.</p><p>For the WW tandems studied here, their target binding affinity is highly amino acid sequence specific. A high affinity binding requires two PY motifs to be separated by two and only two residues. Residues between the two PY motifs and sequences following the second PY motif further enhance binding affinity to WW tandems. Thus, a super strong WW tandem binding target tends to have very unique amino acid sequence features (i.e. such sequences do not frequently appear in many proteins), and we view this as the intrinsic specificity for WW tandem/target interactions dictated by the structure of each WW tandem and the unique sequences of its PY motif-containing targets.</p><p>But for dissecting the ligand preferences for the PY2 motif in Figure 6, the measured bindings for different residues in the motif simply reflect binding affinities instead of specificities. We have revised the description following the reviewer’s comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is not made clear whether the interactions of the tandem WW domains seen in the ligand complexes are present in the absence of ligand.

WW1 of the KIBRA WW tandem is well folded and WW2 of the tandem is only partially folded. The conformation of the apo-YAP WW tandem has also been characterized by NMR spectroscopy (Webb et al., 2011). It was shown that there is minimal coupling between the two WW domains based on NMR chemical shift-based analysis. We have added the above information in the revised manuscript and cited the relevant references.</p><p>We have also looked into the thermodynamic parameters of the YAP WW tandem/Dendrin PY23 interactions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The data show that formation of the complex WW12/PY23 is indeed somewhat entropically unfavorable compared to the individual WW domain bindings (ΔS for the tandem is -93.3 cal/mol·K, which is larger than the sum of the ΔS for the two isolated WW domain bindings, which is -127.9 cal/mol·K).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>ITC experiments of YAP WW12 tandem and individual WW1 or WW2 titrated to Dendrin PY23.</title><p>The fitted <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> and the corresponding calculated entropy change are indicated in the figure for each titration.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49439-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) For the response to the essential revision 1, the authors have added a general statement in the last paragraph of subsection “Origin of the exquisite target binding specificity of WW tandems” and referenced a review.
