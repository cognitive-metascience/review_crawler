However, PI3K inhibitors primarily induce cell cycle arrest, leaving a significant reservoir of tumor cells that may acquire or exhibit resistance. We searched for genes that are required for the survival of PI3K mutant cancer cells in the presence of PI3K inhibition by conducting a genome scale shRNA-based apoptosis screen in a <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutant human breast cancer cell. We identified 5 genes (<italic>PIM2, ZAK, TACC1, ZFR, ZNF565</italic>) whose suppression induced cell death upon PI3K inhibition. We showed that small molecule inhibitors of the PIM2 and ZAK kinases synergize with PI3K inhibition. In addition, using a microscale implementable device to deliver either siRNAs or small molecule inhibitors in vivo, we showed that suppressing these 5 genes with PI3K inhibition induced tumor regression. These observations identify targets whose inhibition synergizes with PI3K inhibitors and nominate potential combination therapies involving PI3K inhibition.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24523.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24523.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24523.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When cells become cancerous, they accumulate mutations in their DNA that switch on some genes at the wrong time and to higher levels than normal. These over-active genes help cancer cells to survive, grow and evade death. One of the genes that is often mutated and over-active in breast cancer encodes an enzyme called PIK3CA.</p><p>There are several drugs that bind to and inhibit the mutant version of PIK3CA. Recent experiments show that inhibiting over-active forms of this enzyme can stop cancer cells from growing, but it does not cause them to die. This means that the cells have the opportunity to become resistant to the drug, which can subsequently lead to tumor relapse. Therefore, researchers have been looking for other drugs that, when combined with the PIK3CA-inhibiting drug, are able to kill the cancer cells.</p><p>The first step to developing such a therapy is to identify genes that are essential for cancer cells to survive when they are exposed to the PIK3CA-inhibiting drug. One way to achieve this is to test what happens when you switch off individual genes one by one in these cells, an approach known as a functional genomics screen. Zwang et al. used this approach to identify genes in human breast cancer cells that have the potential to be useful drug targets. The screen identified five genes that can be individually switched off to kill the cancer cells.</p><p>Two of these five genes encode enzymes known as PIM2 and ZAK. Zwang et al. went on to find drugs that inhibit PIM2 and ZAK. As expected, administering these drugs together with the PIK3CA inhibitor caused breast cancer cells to die. Further experiments will be necessary to find out what roles these five genes play in breast cancer cells. In the future, these findings may lead to the development of more effective therapies for human cancers in which PIK3CA is over-active.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24523.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24523.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>PI3K inhibition</kwd><kwd>genome-scale shRNA screen</kwd><kwd>response modifying genes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000090</institution-id><institution>Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-12-1-0115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zwang</surname><given-names>Yaara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 CA176058</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hahn</surname><given-names>William C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21-CA177391</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonas</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA130988</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hahn</surname><given-names>William C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A geneome-scale shRNA screen identifies five genes whose suppression promotes cell death upon PI3K inhibition both in vitro and in vivo, thus suggesting potential combination therapies involving PI3K inhibition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is frequently activated in breast cancers due to (i) amplification of <italic>ERBB2</italic>, an oncogene that stimulates the PI3K pathway and (ii) activating mutations of the PI3K catalytic subunit, <italic>PIK3CA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koboldt et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, other genetic aberrations can lead to the activation of the PI3K pathway including <italic>PTEN</italic> deletion or loss-of-function mutations, <italic>PIK3CA</italic> amplification and activating <italic>AKT</italic> mutations. Constitutive PI3K pathway activation promotes cell proliferation and survival, and previous reports have demonstrated that tumors harboring mutations that activate the PI3K pathway require constitutive signaling of this pathway for tumor maintenance. Specifically, tumors that harbor mutant <italic>PIK3CA</italic> alleles exhibit significant dependence on <italic>PIK3CA</italic> expression and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Samuels et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, oncogenic activation of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> leads to intrinsic resistance of HER2-positive breast cancer cells to HER2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berns et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanker et al., 2013</xref>), and is more frequently activated in patients that exhibit acquired resistance to HER2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chandarlapaty et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The prevalence of PI3K pathway activation in breast cancer and its importance to cancer cell proliferation and tumor survival make targeting this pathway an attractive therapeutic approach. However, inhibition of the PI3K pathway often leads to proliferative arrest rather than cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elkabets et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klempner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Serra et al., 2008</xref>) and to date has shown limited clinical benefit. Specifically, PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor therapy induced a partial response in 18–30% of patients whose tumors harbor <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and/or <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Janku et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2012</xref>). Although this rate of partial responses was significantly higher than that achieved following treatment with therapies other than PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors, this response was not associated with an improvement in either progression-free or overall survival of treated patients. Combination therapy consisting of Trastuzumab and Buparlisib, a PI3K inhibitor, resulted in a 17% partial response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saura et al., 2014</xref>), and mTOR inhibition combined with aromatase inhibitors in patients with hormone-receptor positive advanced breast cancer showed extended progression-free survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baselga et al., 2012</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that targeting the PI3K pathway alone is only partially effective clinically.</p><p>We hypothesized that identifying targets whose inhibition in the context of PI3K inhibition leads to cell death would provide a foundation to develop combination therapies. Here using a genome-scale loss of function screen, we identified genes whose suppression induces cell death only in the presence of PI3K inhibition both in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genome scale shRNA screen identifies genes whose suppression facilitates cell death in the setting of PI3K inhibition</title><p>To identify genes whose suppression converts the cytostatic response to PI3K inhibition into a cytotoxic response, we performed a positive-selection genome scale shRNA screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) using MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, which harbor a <italic>PIK3CA</italic> H1047R mutation and <italic>ERBB2</italic> amplification.

Cells that incorporated shRNAs were selected by resistance to puromycin and propagated in culture to deplete cells containing shRNAs targeting essential genes. Seven days post-infection, cells were treated with either the pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC0941 (0.625 μM) or with DMSO (vehicle control). We then isolated apoptotic cells using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) with an antibody specific for cleaved PARP and a fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody. We isolated genomic DNA and identified shRNAs present in this apoptotic population by massively parallel sequencing. To rank the shRNAs by their relative abundance in the PI3Ki-treated samples compared to DMSO-treated samples, we used a T-score to account for both the magnitude of the difference in means and the consistency of replicates. We then used the STARS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doench et al., 2016</xref>) and RIGER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luo et al., 2008</xref>) algorithms, which require that at least two shRNAs targeting a gene are ranked significantly higher than random, to rank genes targeted by the top scoring shRNAs. Based on these two algorithms, 57 genes met this significance threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), of which 36 genes were called by both algorithms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the 57 candidates, we used a GFP-based cell proliferation assay in which shRNAs were introduced into GFP-expressing cells, and fluorescence was used as a surrogate for cell number both prior to and after 9 days of treatment. The fluorescent measurements were then used to calculate the fold-change of proliferation (FC-proliferation), where a value of 1 corresponds to proliferative arrest, and cell death results in FC-proliferation &lt;&lt;1. Cells infected with control shRNAs and treated with GDC0941 exhibited FC-proliferation≈1 and were used to calculate Z-scores for the FC-proliferation of experimental shRNAs, with a Z-score &lt;&lt;0 corresponding to cell death. We first retested the shRNAs that scored in the screen and then performed a second level validation by testing additional shRNAs targeting these genes for their ability to facilitate cell death upon PI3K inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In parallel, we also measured the knockdown efficiency of all shRNAs by qPCR. We used two criteria to select genes for further study: (i) their expression was suppressed by three or more targeting shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and, (ii) their suppression by at least three targeting shRNAs modified the response to PI3K inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Using these criteria, we confirmed five candidate genes: <italic>PIM2, TACC1, ZAK, ZFR, and ZNF565</italic>. In addition, to determine whether suppression of these candidates affected PI3K signaling, we assessed the consequences of suppressing these genes on AKT phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>) and found that suppressing none of these candidates reduced phosphorylation at Ser473 of AKT, indicating that the observed interaction with PI3K inhibition was not due to further inhibition of the pathway.</p><p>To further validate the interaction of the five identified genes with PI3K inhibition, we measured two features characteristic of apoptotic cells. First, we measured PARP cleavage as an indicator of the induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We found that cells infected with control shRNAs (EmptyT or Luciferase) and treated with GDC0941 did not exhibit cleaved PARP. In contrast, every shRNAs targeting the identified genes induced PARP cleavage following treatment with GDC0941, indicating the induction of apoptosis. Notably, although suppression of each of these genes resulted in reduction in the proliferation rate of untreated cells by 2–4 fold as compared to control shRNAs, we did not observe evidence of apoptosis as measured by cleaved PARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that the screen identified genes that only affect cell survival in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor. In addition, we used flow cytometry to examine the cell cycle profile to assess the proportion of cells with a sub-G1 DNA content, as a second measure of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In consonance with the cleaved PARP observations, suppression of each of the five identified genes resulted in an increased percentage of cells with a sub-G1 DNA content in the presence of GDC0941 compared to control cells. Taken together, we identified and validated five genes that convert the cytostatic PI3K inhibitory response into apoptotic cell death. As indicated above, the observed effects were obtained using at least three different shRNAs containing different seed sequences, which ensured that these effects were the consequence of on-target activity of the shRNAs, rather than off-target suppression due to miRNA effects mediated by seed sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jackson et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Validating candidates</title><p>In addition to using multiple shRNAs per target genes, we used two additional strategies to validate on-target effects. First, we expressed the corresponding ORF to rescue the effect of each shRNAs. To prevent the suppression of exogenously expressed ORFs by shRNAs, we introduced at least three synonymous mutations into the shRNA-targeted sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). MDA-MB-453 cells were infected with lentivirally-delivered V5-tagged ORFs, followed by infection with lentivirally-delivered shRNAs. Cells were then treated with DMSO or GDC0941 for 9 days. We used In-Cell-Western to detect expression of the V5 tag as a measure of the ORF-infected cell population. Over-expression of <italic>PIM2, ZNF565</italic>, and <italic>TACC1</italic> rescued the effect of endogenous gene suppression by their corresponding shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also found that over-expression of the kinase-inactive mutant of PIM2 (K61A) failed to rescue the suppression of endogenous <italic>PIM2</italic>, suggesting that the kinase activity of PIM2 is essential for preventing cell death following PI3K inhibition. Overexpression of <italic>ZAK</italic> reduced cell viability in a kinase-dependent manner, but independent of shRNA suppression or PI3K inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>ZAK</italic> overexpression itself reduces cell fitness. We found that overexpression of <italic>ZFR</italic> failed to rescue <italic>ZFR</italic> suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To investigate potential interactions between the five candidate genes, we utilized the rescue assay described here to test whether any of the genes can be rescued by another gene. These experiments revealed that <italic>PIM2</italic> and <italic>TACC1</italic> over-expression partially interfered in the interaction between PI3K inhibition and suppression of the other genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that PIM2 or TACC1 generally contribute to cell survival in the presence of PI3K inhibition.

PIM2 and ZAK are serine/threonine kinases, therefore are potential targets for small molecule inhibitors. Searching for compounds that exhibit a selective and potent binding to either PIM2 or ZAK, we identified two compounds that target PIM2 and three compounds targeting ZAK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Specifically, PIM2 scored high in a kinase selectivity assay for two compounds, HTH-01–091, and HTH-02–096, which also exhibited high potency for PIM2 inhibition in a biochemical assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Of note, the potency of both of these compounds as PIM2 inhibitors is similar to their potency toward PIM1, in contrast to commercially available PIM inhibitors that have a strong preference for PIM1 inhibition. Similarly, ZAK scored high in a focused kinase selectivity assay for one compound (TL-01–124). In a biochemical assay to determine IC50, three compounds exhibited high potency as ZAK inhibitors (TL-01–124, HYJ-2-129-6 and HYJ-2-34-2).</p><p>We used these small molecule inhibitors to further test the capacity of PIM2 or ZAK inhibition to modify the response to PI3K inhibition. We treated MDA-MB-453 cells with either DMSO or GDC0941 (0.625 μM) in combination with each of the several compounds targeting PIM2 and ZAK, and GFP fluorescence was used to determine changes in proliferation. We then used the Bliss independence model to determine synergy based on the expected versus the observed effect for each combination. When significant synergy occurs, as indicated by gray shading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–G</xref>; Bliss index &lt;0.6), the observed effect (red) is greater than the expected effect (black). At higher concentrations, the calculated expected combined effect is limited by population death, which makes it impossible to determine whether synergy exists at these points. Combining inhibitors targeting ZAK (HYJ-2-129-6, HYJ-2-34-2, and TL-01–124) and PI3K resulted in a synergistic response and conversion of the GDC0941-induced proliferation arrest into cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). We also found that TL-02–082, an analog of TL-01–124 that does not bind ZAK, but otherwise has a similar kinase selectivity profile, did not exhibit a synergistic interaction with GDC0941 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Similarly, co-inhibition of PIM2 (HTH-01–091, and HTH-02–096) together with PI3K also resulted in a synergistic response and conversion into cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). These observations further validate that PIM2 and ZAK inhibition synergizes with PI3K inhibition to induce cell death.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Confirming candidates in breast cancer cell lines</title><p>To confirm the relevance of the candidates in other cell lines, we suppressed these same five genes in three additional breast cancer cell lines, including HCC1954, T47D, and HCC1937, which growth arrest upon PI3K inhibition. Each of these cell lines show activation of the PI3K pathway through different mechanisms: <italic>ERBB2</italic> amplification (HCC1954), <italic>PIK3CA</italic> amplification (HCC1937) or activating mutation (T47D, HCC1954), and <italic>PTEN</italic> loss (HCC1937). We introduced shRNAs targeting the five genes into these cell lines and monitored their proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Similar to the effects observed in MDA-MB-453 cells, we found that suppression of these five genes in each of these cell lines lead to apoptosis in the setting of PI3K inhibition. In contrast to the proliferation inhibitory effect of PI3K inhibition on breast cancer cell lines with activated PI3K pathway, inhibition of PI3K in breast cancer cell lines that have a wild-type PI3K pathway (CAL-120 and MDA-MB-231) failed to affect cell proliferation. In these cell lines, suppression of the five genes had no effect on cell proliferation or apoptosis when combined with PI3K inhibition. We also found that although PI3K inhibition in cells with a wild-type PI3K pathway activated by growth factors can suppress proliferation, suppression of these five genes did not modify this response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; MCF10A). In addition to breast cancer cell lines, we also tested four additional non-breast cancer cell lines. The ovarian cancer cell line EFO-21 (<italic>PIK3CA</italic> amplified) exhibited similar response to that observed in breast cancer cell lines with oncogenic PI3K activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, the interactions we observed between PI3K inhibition and suppression of the five candidate genes in breast cancer cell lines did not occur in the three tested GBM cell lines (all that harbor PTEN inactivation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the response to PI3K inhibition can be modified by the suppression of the five identified genes only in the context of oncogenic PI3K pathway activation.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24523.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Effects of manipulating candidate gene expression in multiple cell lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) T47D-eGFP, HCC1954-eGFP, HCC1937-eGFP, CAL-120-eGPF, MDA-MB-231-eGPF, and MCF10A-eGPF were infected with shRNAs targeting the indicated genes.

Following the transduction of the shRNAs, MDA-MB-453 cells were treated with either a HER2 inhibitor (BIBW2992, 1 μM) or an AKT inhibitor (MK2206, 0.5 μM) at doses that induce significant attenuation of cell proliferation. Suppression of all five genes modified the response to HER2 or AKT inhibition, similar to our observation with PIK3CA inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, suppression of the five identified genes combined with inhibition of PDK1 (GSK2334470, 2.5 μM) or mTOR (Sirolimus, 10 nM) modified the response to PDK1 or mTOR inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). These observations demonstrate that the observed synergy between these genes and PI3K pathway inhibition is not specific to the particular PI3K inhibitor (GDC0941) used in the screen. To further explore the specificity of PI3K inhibition, we tested isoform specific inhibitors of PI3K, to inhibit either the alpha (BYL-719) or the beta (GSK2636771) isoforms. In addition, we also tested the beta-sparing PI3K inhibitor GDC0032.

To determine whether this was the case, we combined shRNA-mediated suppression of these candidate genes with two PI3K-independent anti-proliferative drugs, Palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and Fulvestrant, an ER antagonist. In contrast to what we observed following PI3K inhibition, suppression of the five genes did not convert the cytostatic effect of either CDK4/6 inhibitor or ER antagonist into cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These observations indicate that the genes that we identified in this screen are specific modifiers of PI3K pathway inhibition and do not non-specifically affect cells whose proliferation is attenuated by other mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>PIM2 suppression increases mitochondrial priming</title><p>BAD, a BH3-only protein whose phosphorylation leads to its sequestration by 14-3-3 proteins, is a substrate of PIM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Danial, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yan et al., 2003</xref>). We hypothesized that BAD phosphorylation mediates the effect of PIM2 on PI3K inhibition. To test this hypothesis, we first confirmed that BAD phosphorylation was reduced following <italic>PIM2</italic> suppression with either shRNAs or a small molecule PIM2 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>).

Mitochondrial priming level is determined by measuring the ratio between pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. BH3 profiling measures mitochondrial priming by determining whether synthetic peptides modeled after the BH3 domains of Bcl-2 proteins induce loss of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which indicates the likelihood of cells to undergo apoptosis and correlates with patient response to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ni Chonghaile et al., 2011</xref>).

The major advantage of this device is that it allows more precise delivery of siRNA or small molecules to the tumor, allows for better quantification of responses and facilitates the testing of combinations of treatments. Each of 16 reservoirs on the device was loaded with ~1 μg of a unique siRNA or a small molecule. The device allows compounds to be released into confined regions within the tumor over 48 hr for siRNA and for 24 hr for small molecules, respectively. The device was then removed along with a cylindrical column of surrounding tumor tissue, which was stained by IHC and analyzed to determine cellular outcome. To facilitate efficient delivery, siRNAs were Accell-modified (Dharmacon, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and labeled at the 5'-end with a fluorescent Cy3 dye to allow for detection of siRNA delivery into tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24523.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>In vivo validation of the five identified genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A representative image showing siRNA (red) spreading in tumor tissue.

Tissue surrounding the device was stained with hematoxylin and eosin and the density of intact nuclei around each reservoir was quantified as a measure of cell viability. Combining PI3K inhibition with control siGFP did not affect cell density compared to the effect of siGFP on tumor cells from non-treated mice. However, combining PI3K inhibition with any of the siRNAs targeting the five identified genes lead to a significant reduction in the density of intact nuclei as compared to non-treated control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). For all siRNAs targeting any of the five candidate genes, this reduction in density of intact nuclei upon combination treatment was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) when compared to either single treatments. We calculated the proportional effect from non-treated control siRNA (siGFP) for single treatments (each of the siRNAs or PI3K inhibition alone) and combined treatments, and compared it to the expected effect according to the Bliss independence model. All siRNAs targeting the five identified genes combined with PI3K inhibition exhibited greater effect then expected with a Bliss value significantly smaller than 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, siRNA suppression of each of the five identified genes combined with PI3K inhibition lead to a significant increase in cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, we also tested the combined effect of small molecule ZAK inhibitors and PI3K inhibition, and found that the combination resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells as evidenced by staining for cleaved-CASP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Notably, loading doxorubicin into a reservoir of the device lead to cleaved-CASP3 staining in ~20% of the exposed cells in tissue, which was not further affected by PI3K inhibition. This observation indicated that the observed increase in cleaved-CAPS3 with ZAK and PI3K inhibitors reflects a specific synergistic interaction. Taken together, these studies confirm that suppression or inhibition of the genes identified herein show synergistic effects with PI3K inhibition on tumor survival in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we report the identification of genes that when suppressed in the setting of a PI3K inhibitor induce cell death. Specifically, we identified five genes, <italic>PIM2, TACC1, ZAK, ZFR</italic>, and <italic>ZNF565</italic> whose suppression converts the cell cycle arrest induced by PI3K inhibition into apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Of these five genes, two are kinases for which we identified small molecule compounds that recapitulated the effects observed by shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In addition to using multiple distinct shRNAs targeting each of the five genes, we independently confirmed the initial screen using either small molecule inhibitors (for PIM2 and ZAK) or a rescue assay (<italic>PIM2, TACC1</italic>, and <italic>ZNF565</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Although we were unable to independently confirm <italic>ZFR</italic> by either CRISPR-CAS9-mediated gene deletion or by a rescue assay, we included <italic>ZFR</italic> suppression in the experiments herein to provide information on this candidate for future studies. Our observations suggest that co-targeting PI3K and either PIM2 or ZAK is a synergistic combination with therapeutic potential. Furthermore, using a microscale implementable device, we found that inhibition or suppression of these genes also synergizes with PI3K inhibition in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Together these studies identify potential targets whose perturbation augments the effects of PI3K inhibition.</p><p>Although the primary screen described here was conducted in a single cell line, we verified these interactions in additional breast cancer cell lines in which the PI3K pathway is activated by different oncogenic aberrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We also showed that <italic>PIK3CA</italic> is the major isoform that mediates this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). Importantly, these genes did not modulate the effect of drugs unrelated to the PI3K pathway, such as a CDK4/6 inhibitor and an ER antagonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We also note that the five genes failed to interact with PI3K inhibition in cells that lack oncogenic activation of the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These observations serve to further define the context in which these targets could be therapeutically combined.</p><p>Although we identified and validated several candidates, we recognize that this screen was not saturating due to technical shortcomings of the shRNA library and inefficiencies of flow cytometry based assay that we employed. Thus, although we identified genes whose suppression in the presence of a PI3K inhibitor induced apoptotic cell death, extending this approach is likely to identify additional candidates that when suppressed or inhibited synergize with PI3K inhibition.</p><p>A concern in drug-modifier screens is the potential for false positive results due to a combined effect on cell fitness rather than a specific functional interaction. In such cases, each perturbation independently reduces the cellular fitness and when combined, the effect on cellular fitness leads to cell death. One would expect that alternate combinations with other growth-arresting perturbations would have similar cytotoxic consequences. Here we demonstrated that the five identified genes from our screen caused cell death specifically with PI3K pathway inhibition and not with other cytostatic perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that these interactions are specific for this genetic and pharmacologic context.</p><p>We previously showed that over-expression of <italic>PIM1</italic> can similarly rescue cells from lapatinib-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moody et al., 2015</xref>), corroborating a role for <italic>PIM2</italic> in promoting resistance to PI3K inhibition. In addition, it has been shown that PIM and AKT inhibitors synergize in acute myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meja et al., 2014</xref>). PIM2 promotes tumor survival mainly through phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein BAD, as well as through regulation of MYC activity, and Cap-dependent protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nawijn et al., 2011</xref>). Because BAD phosphorylation is a major pro-survival mechanism of PIM2, we tested and confirmed that PIM2 suppression leads to mitochondrial priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, it is likely that additional substrates of <italic>PIM2</italic> contribute to the interaction with PI3K inhibition. Of note, AKT and the PIM family of proteins share several common substrates, including BAD, while also having a number of unique targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaravadi and Thompson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nawijn et al., 2011</xref>). Additional kinases such as PKA and p90RSK, also regulate BAD by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Danial, 2008</xref>). Accordingly, BAD phosphorylation was shown previously to integrate survival signals from the PI3K and MAPK pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">She et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>One of the other candidates identified in this screen, <italic>TACC1</italic>, has been shown to enhance mammary tumor formation induced by heterozygous <italic>PTEN</italic> loss in vivo and was shown to mediate cell survival following PI3K pathway inhibition induced by <italic>PTEN</italic> over expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cully et al., 2005</xref>). TACC1 interacts with Aurora A-chTOG complex at the spindle pole during metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conte et al., 2003</xref>). At later stages of M phase, during anaphase and cytokinesis, TACC1 localizes to the midzone spindle and the midbody together with Aurora B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delaval et al., 2004</xref>). Suppression of <italic>TACC1</italic> leads to formation of multipolar spindles and thus perturbs cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conte et al., 2003</xref>). Notably, PI3K activity contributes to genomic stability by regulating spindle orientation and chromosomal segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Silió et al., 2012</xref>). These converging mechanisms suggest that combined suppression of TACC1 and PI3K may induce cell death by causing un-resolved spindle and chromosomal segregation defects.</p><p>ZAK is a MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K) that transduces signals through JNK and p38, and is associated with activation of AP1 and NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>ZAK</italic> is up-regulated in several cancers including breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>ZAK</italic> over-expression has been shown to promote in vivo transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2004</xref>) and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rey et al., 2016</xref>), and its suppression reduced proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2014</xref>) and β-catenin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Firestein et al., 2008</xref>). Growth-factor stimulation, specifically EGF stimulation, activates ZAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rey et al., 2016</xref>), which then contributes to the activation of ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vinayagam et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, it was recently shown that ZAK inhibition by Sorafinib causes cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma due to suppression of JNK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vin et al., 2014</xref>), which might explain why over-expression of exogenous <italic>ZAK</italic> lead to reduced viability. Taken together, these observations suggest that ZAK influences cell state in a context-dependent manner, and that ZAK can either promote or suppress cell proliferation. Here we have demonstrated that <italic>ZAK</italic> suppression induced cell death upon PI3K inhibition, indicating that ZAK-mediated signaling is essential for cell survival in the context of PI3K inhibition in breast cancer cell lines.</p><p>The role of <italic>ZFR</italic> and <italic>ZNF565</italic> in cellular proliferation and survival, especially in cancer and in the context of PI3K pathway inhibition, are not yet known. Further studies will be necessary to investigate the interaction of ZFR and ZNF565 with PI3K inhibition.</p><p>In consonance with the known pro-survival function of PIM2 and TACC1 in the context of PI3K inhibition, we show here that their over-expression partially rescued the effect of combining PI3K inhibition with the other four candidate genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), further emphasizing the importance of combining their inhibition with PI3K inhibitors.</p><p>Although there is no reason to expect that these 5 genes would be altered in human cancers, analysis of breast cancer genome sequencing data collected by the TCGA project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org">http://www.cbioportal.org</ext-link>) reveals that the five genes are either amplified or their expression is up-regulated in 37% of breast cancer patients. In this dataset, we failed to find co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity between any of the five genes. Samples sub-classified as PI3K pathway active or inactive (classification was based on <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations and amplification, <italic>ERBB2</italic> amplification or over-expression, or <italic>PTEN</italic> deletion or mutation) exhibited similar rates of these alterations, regardless of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation status or breast cancer subtype. Moreover, there is no information regarding the response of the tumors analyzed by TCGA to PI3K pathway inhibition. As data from patients treated with PI3K inhibitors accumulates, it would be important to explore whether these genes are associated with response rate, or resistance.</p><p>In summary, we report the identification of five genes whose suppression both in vitro and in vivo modulates the cellular response to PI3K inhibition, converting cytostatic effects into cytotoxicity. Importantly, we report that small molecule inhibition of two of these genes, <italic>PIM2</italic> and <italic>ZAK</italic>, is synergistic with PI3K inhibition, a finding that has therapeutic implications for the treatment of breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>MDA-MB-453 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0418">CVCL_0418</ext-link>), SKBR3 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0033">CVCL_0033</ext-link>), MDA-MB-231 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0062">CVCL_0062</ext-link>), CAL-120 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1104">CVCL_1104</ext-link>), LN-443 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_3960">CVCL_3960</ext-link>), LN-382 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_3956">CVCL_3956</ext-link>), and SF-295 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1690">CVCL_1690</ext-link>) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.

For siRNA-loaded devices, mice received an additional dose of GDC0941 24 hr after device implantation. siRNAs (Dharmacon, USA) were Accell-modified, Cy3-conjugated at the 5' end, and processed for in-vivo use. Microscale devices for intratumor delivery of siRNA and small molecule compounds were manufactured as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jonas et al., 2015</xref>, and were implanted directly into the mouse xenograft tumor. Devices containing the small molecule compounds remained in situ for 24 hr, while siRNA-loaded devices remained in situ for 48 hr. The flank tumor was excised and the tissue containing the device was fixed for 24 hr in 10% formalin and perfused with paraffin. The specimen was sectioned using a standard microtome and tissue sections were collected from each reservoir level. Sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, as well as antibody-stained by standard immunohistochemistry using cleaved-caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling #9661) and scored using an ImageJ (v1.48) image analysis algorithm in a blinded manner.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank members of the Hahn lab and Dr. Ravid Straussman for fruitful discussions, and the International Centre for Kinase Profiling in University of Dundee.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Chi Dang (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a response to the critiques prior to a formal invitation for submission of a revised manuscript. We would like to determine whether it is realistic for you to adequately address the concerns raised by the reviewers.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript from Zwang and colleagues reports a tour-de-force approach to identify synthetic lethal interactions with PI3K inhibition of PI3K mutant breast cancers using a novel approach of isolation dying/apoptotic cells transfected with an shRNA library. They describe the results of a screen in the MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cell line for shRNAs that induce cell death in combination with the PI3K inhibitor GDC0941. The authors then describe efforts to follow-up on the shRNAs for the 5 genes that were uncovered (PIM2, ZAK, TACC1, ZFR, ZNF565), using cDNA rescue approaches, pharmacological inhibitors of PIM2 and ZAK, and work with additional breast cancer cell lines. The authors conclude that the 5 genes encode proteins that represent potential targets and the work's significance is that it nominates potential combination therapy approaches that might add to PI3K inhibition in cancer treatment.</p><p>The studies and data are solidly pursued and presented, but the significance of the work for informing how the gene products are relevant to PI3K signaling in cancer are limited. The biological connections of the five genes and proteins to one another and to the PI3K signaling pathway seem uncertain, though some prior work suggests some possible relevance to PI3K signaling for PIM2, TACC1, and ZAK.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The in vivo work is weak with respect to the approaches used, the magnitude of the effects reported, and the specific assays and endpoints chosen. In the in vivo experiments, the authors need to provide more definitive information about the significance of the combination approach, relative to each mono-therapy approach, in inhibiting tumor progression and tumor size in the model used. Perhaps more significantly, It is not clear why the authors did not generate MDA-MB-452 and another relevant breast cancer cell line (e.g.,T47D, HCC1954, or HCC1937) that stably carry a Tet-inducible control shRNA or 2-3 different shRNAs for a few of the most promising identified genes and then assess whether shRNA induction +/- GDC0941 treatment has biologically and statistically significant tumor regression effects in xenografts.</p><p>2) Could the synthetic lethal interactions be generalized in other cancer types with oncogenic PI3K pathways? Will over expression of activated PIK3CA generate de novo dependency of the candidate genes (such as PIM2 or ZAK) in the cultured CAL-120 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines?</p><p>3) It seems that some evidence that the genes uncovered are part of a pathway or network could perhaps be uncovered through efforts to see whether ORF over-expression for PIM2, ZNF565, and TACC1 can rescue not only the effects of their own respective shRNAs, but can perhaps even rescue the effects of shRNAs for the other four genes found (e.g., does PIM2 over-expression not only rescue PIM2 shRNA effects, but also apoptosis seen with shRNAs for ZNF565, TACC1, ZAK, or ZFR?).</p><p>4) Do studies of the effects on gene expression in breast cancer cells following inhibition of the five genes by shRNA approaches or following inhibition of PIM2 and ZAK yield any evidence of enrichment of specific pathways or specific groups of genes?</p><p>5) The authors mention in the Discussion that the 5 genes are altered in 37% of breast cancers, but do not offer describe any specifics of whether the data suggest oncogenic activation (e.g., amplification and over-expression), tumor suppressor inactivation (e.g., nonsense, frameshift inactivating), or simply passenger mutations. How do the cancer data clarify how the genes are connected in any way to PI3K signaling or one another?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24523.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The</italic> in vivo <italic>work is weak with respect to the approaches used, the magnitude of the effects reported, and the specific assays and endpoints chosen.

This device has been shown by our collaborator to provide direct evidence of tumor responses in vivo (Jonas et al., 2015) and we have used the same system to interrogate the effects of small molecule inhibitors in patient-derived tumors (Hong et al., 2016). The major advantage of this device is that it allows more precise delivery of siRNA or small molecules, allows for better quantification of responses and facilitates the testing of combinations of treatments.</p><p>In this manuscript, we examined the effects of combining PI3K inhibition with suppression of the five identified genes in vivo. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> presents the reduction in the density of intact nuclei.

To clarify the strength and significance of our observations in vivo, we modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> now shows the analysis shown here. The plot previously shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>. We also added a plot showing the% effect of combining PI3K inhibition with each of the siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

We have extensive experience using such systems and have repeatedly found that it is necessary to clone cells to find clones that exhibit suitable inducible activity. Since we believe that one needs to examine many clones to ensure that the observed phenotype is correct, the number of experiments, which all include in vivo tumor experiments, would require nearly a year of work. Although we recognize that inducible shRNAs are attractive, our initial attempts to create such cell lines showed that polyclonal populations did not exhibit robust inducibility. We hope that our clarification of the microscale device that we used will allow the reviewers to agree that the statistically significant findings support the conclusions of this manuscript.</p><p> <italic>2) Could the synthetic lethal interactions be generalized in other cancer types with oncogenic PI3K pathways? Will over expression of activated PIK3CA generate</italic> de novo <italic>dependency of the candidate genes (such as PIM2 or ZAK) in the cultured CAL-120 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines?</italic> </p><p>To address this question, we examined two additional cancer types, ovarian cancer and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Of note, the main driver of PI3K pathway activation in GBM is PTEN inactivation, rather than PI3K activating mutations. We tested whether suppression of the five genes that we identified in the screen interacted with PI3K inhibition in one ovarian cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and three GBM cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). All four cell lines undergo a proliferative arrest upon PI3K inhibition. Most of the interactions that we observed in breast cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) were reproduced in EFO-21 (ovarian cancer; PIK3CA amplification). However, none of the GBM cell line exhibited similar response to combining suppression of any of the five candidate genes and PI3K inhibition. These experiments suggest that this effect is related to the mechanism of PI3K pathway activation as well as the particular lineage context.</p><p>We now include this new experimentation as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref> and B and include the follow text in subsection “Confirming candidates in breast cancer cell lines.”:</p><p>&quot;In addition to breast cancer cell lines, we also tested four additional non-breast cancer cell lines. […] However, the interactions we observed between PI3K inhibition and suppression of the five candidate genes in breast cancer, did not occur in the three tested GBM cell lines (all that harbor PTEN inactivation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).&quot;</p><p> <italic>3) It seems that some evidence that the genes uncovered are part of a pathway or network could perhaps be uncovered through efforts to see whether ORF over-expression for PIM2, ZNF565, and TACC1 can rescue not only the effects of their own respective shRNAs, but can perhaps even rescue the effects of shRNAs for the other four genes found (e.g., does PIM2 over-expression not only rescue PIM2 shRNA effects, but also apoptosis seen with shRNAs for ZNF565, TACC1, ZAK, or ZFR?).</italic> </p><p>As was suggested, we tested whether PIM2, TACC1, and ZNF565 can interfere in the interaction between PI3K inhibition and the other respective 4 candidate genes suppression. We had shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> that these ORFs can rescue the effects of their respective shRNAs. We combined over expression of these ORFs with knock-down of all other four candidate genes and measured their ability to rescue cell from PI3K inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Over-expression of ZNF565 did not rescue the suppression of any of the other 4 candidate genes, which suggests that ZNF565 cellular function is unique and cannot compensate for the suppression of the other four genes. Both PIM2 and TACC1 over-expression partially interfered in the interaction between PI3K inhibition and suppression of the other genes. Both PIM2 and TACC1 were shown before to contribute to cell survival upon PI3K signaling inhibition (Amaravadi, 2005; Cully et al., 2005). Hence the effect observed here is probably due to PIM2- or TACC1-mediated general increase in pro-survival signaling that alleviate the effect of PI3K inhibition, rather than specific interaction with the cellular function of other candidate genes.</p><p>We now include these experiments as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref> as well as the following text in subsection “Validating candidates”:</p><p>&quot;To investigate potential interactions between the five candidate genes, we utilized the rescue assay described here to test whether any of the genes can be rescued by another gene. […] suggesting that PIM2 or TACC1 generally contribute to cell survival in the presence of PI3K inhibition.&quot;</p><p>This result is also discussed in the Discussion section of the manuscript:</p><p>&quot;In consonance with the known pro-survival function of PIM2 and TACC1 in the context of PI3K inhibition, we show here that their over-expression partially rescued the effect of combining PI3K inhibition with the other 4 candidate genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), further emphasizing the importance of combining their inhibition with PI3K inhibitors.&quot;</p><p> <italic>4) Do studies of the effects on gene expression in breast cancer cells following inhibition of the five genes by shRNA approaches or following inhibition of PIM2 and ZAK yield any evidence of enrichment of specific pathways or specific groups of genes?</italic> </p><p>We harnessed gene expression analysis to explore potential cellular mechanisms by which the five candidate genes synergize with PI3K inhibition, as well as potential interactions between them. To this end, we used five different control shRNAs and at least three different shRNAs to target each of the candidate genes. Seventy two hours after shRNA infection, cells were treated with either DMSO or GDC0941 (0.625uM) for 6 hours. Paired-end RNA-seq was conducted with at least 5 million reads per sample. Preprocessing and sequence alignment were done using GenePattern interface and included FASTQC, Trimmomatic, and TopHat. To avoid the off-target effects of individual shRNAs which affect multiple RNA molecules, we treated the different shRNAs that target the same candidate gene (or control shRNAs) as biological replicates. For each of the candidate genes, we compared gene expression upon it's suppression to control shRNAs using HTSeq followed by DESeq2 analysis. Plotted below, is the fold change (log2 transformed and centered) over control shRNAs of genes that exhibited significant differential expression (adjusted p value&lt;0.05) upon suppression of the indicated candidate gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24523.019</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>RNA-seq data analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes upon suppression of candidate genes.</title><p>(A,C) Centered log2 fold change over control shRNAs of genes that exhibit significant differential expression (Adjusted p value&lt;0.05 according to DESeq2) upon suppression of the indicated candidate gene.

However, 4 genes were affected by the suppression of more than 2 candidate genes. MCM2, which is essential for DNA replication, was significantly down regulated upon suppression of PIM2, TACC1, ZAK and ZFR in the presence of GDC0941. Suppression of ZNF565 in the presence of GDC0941 also lead to MCM2 down-regulation, however, this was not statistically significant. The other three genes are FUS, SLC25A5, and TUBB.

Most of the enriched annotations and pathways are too general, and do not suggest a specific mechanism by which the candidate genes interact with PI3K inhibition. One exception is the enrichment for RNA splicing and binding among the genes that are significantly differential expressed upon ZFR suppression. ZFR is a Zinc-finger RNA binding proteins, that was recently shown to be important for pancreatic cancer cells proliferation and invasion (Zhao et al., 2016).

Of these, 54 samples (4.9%) that harbored deletion or RNA down-regulation of any of the five identified genes were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining samples (1047), 37% had an amplification or RNA up-regulation of at least one of the five identified genes. Based on the available data, we failed to find significant co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity between any of the genes, suggesting that there is no clear interaction between these genes. When we classified the patients according to their PI3K pathway status of activity (determined according to the presence of either mutated or amplified PIK3CA, amplified or over-expressed HER2, or deleted or mutated PTEN), we also did not find a difference in the occurrence of alterations of the 5 genes between patients with or without PI3K pathway activation. It is important to note that data regarding the patients’ response to therapy and specifically to PI3K pathway inhibition, as well as clinical information regarding therapies preceding the collection of the sample are not available.</p><p>The following paragraph (Discussion section) was modified to include this information:</p><p>&quot;Although there is no reason to expect that these 5 genes would be altered in human cancers, […] Moreover, there is no information regarding the response of the tumors analyzed by TCGA to PI3K pathway inhibition. As data from patients treated with PI3K inhibitors accumulates, it would be important to explore whether these genes are associated with response rate, or resistance.&quot;</p><p>References:</p><p>Hong, A.L., Tseng, Y.-Y., Cowley, G.S., Jonas, O., Cheah, J.H., Kynnap, B.D., Doshi, M.B., Oh, C., Meyer, S.C., Church, A.J., Gill, S., Bielski, C.M., Keskula, P., Imamovic, A., Howell, S., Kryukov, G.V., Clemons, P.A., Tsherniak, A., Vazquez, F., Crompton, B.D., Shamji, A.F., Rodriguez-Galindo, C., Janeway, K.A., Roberts, C.W.M., Stegmaier, K., van Hummelen, P., Cima, M.J., Langer, R.S., Garraway, L.A., Schreiber, S.L., Root, D.E., Hahn, W.C., Boehm, J.S., 2016.
