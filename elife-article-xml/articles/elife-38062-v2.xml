Although hair cells are thought to be energetically demanding cells, how mitochondria respond to these demands and how this might relate to cell death is largely unexplored. Using genetically encoded indicators, we found that mitochondrial calcium flux and oxidation are regulated by mechanotransduction and demonstrate that hair cell activity has both acute and long-term consequences on mitochondrial function. We tested whether variation in mitochondrial activity reflected differences in the vulnerability of hair cells to the toxic drug neomycin. We observed that susceptibility did not correspond to the acute level of mitochondrial activity but rather to the cumulative history of that activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lateral line</kwd><kwd>hair cell</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC015783</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raible</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1256082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pickett</surname><given-names>Sarah B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32DC536115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pickett</surname><given-names>Sarah B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The history of mitochondrial activity predicts whether zebrafish mechanosensory hair cells live or die after toxic drug exposure.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons are some of the most energy demanding cells in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ames, 2000</xref>). Because of this, they are particularly vulnerable to disruptions in mitochondrial and metabolic function. Despite the importance of proper mitochondrial function for all neuronal cell types, some subpopulations are more vulnerable than others, such as those affected by Parkinson’s Disease, ALS, and other neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saxena and Caroni, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jové et al., 2014</xref>). This selective susceptibility of affected subpopulations has been attributed in part to their high physiological activity and altered response to oxidative stress. In addition to high activity levels, advanced age is also a major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting a connection between aging and selective cell death. Increased selective susceptibility over time could be attributed, at least in part, to the accumulation of oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), as postulated by the free radical theory of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beckman and Ames, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Finkel and Holbrook, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harman, 1956</xref>). Mitochondria have been identified as a major source of ROS and studies have revealed that ROS production increases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beckman and Ames, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wallace, 2005</xref>). If accumulation of mitochondrial oxidation and stress are related to cellular activity, highly active or older cells that have experienced more accumulated activity over time may be more vulnerable to acute damage.</p><p>Selective susceptibility is not limited to the central nervous system. Peripheral sensory cells are also highly active as they constantly receive and filter sensory input. Among the peripheral receptors, selective cell death has been well documented for hair cells, the mechanosensory cells of the mammalian inner ear that mediate hearing and balance. Auditory hair cell loss is a common feature of hearing impairment and can occur as a result of exposure to loud noise or clinical therapeutic compounds, and with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Hair cell loss occurs in a characteristic pattern relative to both the frequency tuning of the cells and the cell type (inner vs. outer hair cells). After exposure to aminoglycoside antibiotics or with advancing age, for example, hair cells tuned to higher sound frequencies are lost before those tuned to lower frequencies. Similarly, outer hair cells are more susceptible to damage than inner hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alharazneh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mahendrasingam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kamimura et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Forge and Schacht, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Forge and Richardson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Richardson and Russell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kopke et al., 1999</xref>). The cause of selective susceptibility for hair cells remains unclear, although some evidence suggests that differences in hair cell metabolism, free radical damage, or calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) handling may be contributors, thus implicating mitochondrial involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jensen-Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sha et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engel et al., 2006</xref>). A role for mitochondria is further supported by evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction during hair cell damage. Across species, dying hair cells exhibit swollen mitochondrial morphology and generate ROS in response to ototoxic agents, including aminoglycoside antibiotics and copper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Owens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fermin and Igarashi, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mangiardi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lundquist and Wersäll, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagger-Sjöbäck and Wersäll, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Esterberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Esterberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirose et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Olivari et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Esterberg et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigate the relationship between mitochondrial activity and selective toxicity of aminoglycosides using the zebrafish lateral line system. Sensory input from the lateral line is mediated by externally located clusters of mechanosensitive hair cells, called neuromasts. These cells allow fish to detect changes in water flow and to navigate their environment. They also share many similarities with hair cells of the inner ear (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicolson, 2017</xref> for review)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicolson, 2017</xref>). This includes conservation with human deafness genes as well as susceptibility to compounds that are ototoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Whitfield, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nicolson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ton and Parng, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ou et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, the surface location of the lateral line system provides a unique advantage in that we can monitor cellular changes that occur in vivo during physical or chemical manipulation with subcellular resolution. Like auditory hair cells, lateral line hair cells of older zebrafish are more susceptible to aminoglycoside-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Santos et al., 2006</xref>). Unlike cochlear hair cells, lateral line hair cells do not exhibit intrinsic frequency selectivity and, although lateral line hair cells can be classified based on their polarity, they are not otherwise functionally sub-classified by type as are mammalian auditory and vestibular hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kroese and Van Netten, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). For this reason, it has been particularly puzzling why some lateral line hair cells are more susceptible than others. Here we have imaged cumulative mitochondrial responses to hair cell stimulation or application of toxic aminoglycosides. We demonstrate that hair cell mechanotransduction (MET) activity has both acute and long-term effects on mitochondrial activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that cumulative changes in mitochondrial activity correspond with hair cell susceptibility to damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mitochondria respond to acute hair cell stimulation</title><p>To examine mitochondrial responses to hair cell MET activity, we conducted in vivo time-lapse imaging studies of lateral line hair cells expressing genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators.

Hair cells were imaged at a single plane and mechanically stimulated at 10 Hz using a pressure wave applied via a waterjet pipette. Both cytoRGECO and mitoGCaMP fluorescence intensity increased (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), indicating that hair cell stimulation causes an influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into both the cytoplasm and mitochondria of the activated cells. Sample frames from four different videos are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for cytoRGECO (panel A) and mitoGCaMP (panel B). These data demonstrate that mitochondria respond to hair cell stimulation. The two signals differ, however, in their kinetics. While cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels increase and decrease rapidly with the onset and offset of waterjet stimulation, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels exhibit a delayed rise and decay more slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Example images of mitoTimer-expressing hair cells are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>. mitoTimer fluorescence, reported as a ratio of red to green, increases significantly between 3dpf and 4dpf, as well as between 4dpf and 5dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) (3dpf: 1.03 ± 0.05, 4dpf: 2.47 ± 0.66, 5dpf: 7.58 ± 1.2; Kruskal-Wallis test, Dunn’s post-test, p &lt; 0.001; mean ratio ±SD; n = 15–18 fish). The ratio shift corresponds with the timing of functional maturation of the neuromast, including increased hair cell MET activity. These observations suggest that mitochondrial activity increases with cumulative hair cell activity. mitoTimer is a multifaceted indicator that can reflect multiple aspects of mitochondrial activity and metabolism, including oxidation, over time. During hair cell maturation, two factors could contribute to changes in mitoTimer fluorescence: the age of the cell and rate of oxidation in the organelle. Because some hair cells are added to the neuromast during development from 3-5dpf, differences in the mitoTimer ratio may reflect the relative age of hair cells in the cluster. To test this idea, we incubated free-swimming larvae in the nuclear dye Hoechst, which differentially labels mechanotransducing hair cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), for 30 min at 3dpf. This is an intermediate developmental time point relative to neuromast functional maturity, where only some hair cells have active MET and additional hair cells are still being added to the cluster. At 4dpf, we measured the ratio of mitoTimer fluorescence (red:green) in individual cells, comparing older (Hoechst labeled) to younger (unlabeled) hair cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows an example image of Hoechst staining in mitoTimer-expressing hair cells 24 hr after labeling. To directly compare hair cells within the same neuromast, we normalized the mitoTimer ratio for each individual cell to the median ratio of the neuromast as a whole. We found that younger hair cells lacking Hoechst labeling have a mitoTimer ratio near or below the median (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The opposite is true for older hair cells that are positive for Hoechst labeling after 24 hr (Hoechst positive: 1.71 ± 0.52, n = 45 cells; Hoechst negative: 0.80 ± 0.45, n = 80 cells; Mann-Whitney U test, p &lt; 0.001 ; mean ratio (normalized) ±SD; five fish per group). We confirmed that Hoechst labeling itself does not increase the mitoTimer fluorescence ratio by comparing the distribution of single cell red:green fluorescence from zebrafish treated with Hoechst to an untreated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these experiments suggest that cells with increased mitoTimer ratios are older and, as a result, have also been capable of MET activity for a longer period of time.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38062.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>MitoTimer fluorescence ratio increases with neuromast maturation.</title><p>Maximum projections of hair cells from Tg[<italic>myo6b:mitoTimer</italic>]<sup>w208</sup> fish at 3dpf (<bold>A</bold>) and 5dpf (<bold>B</bold>).

Moreover, mitigating mitochondrial ROS generation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake confers enhanced hair cell protection. Previous studies have also noted selective and asynchronous hair cell death as a result aminoglycoside exposure, as well as variation in levels of ROS and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in individual cells.

To do so, time-lapse imaging was conducted with fish labeled with the mitochondrial polarity indicator dye, JC-1. Since the JC-1 fluorescence ratio decreases in the absence of hair cell MET activity, measuring the baseline fluorescence of JC-1 provides an estimate of mitochondrial activity just prior to neomycin exposure.

We observed no difference in the mean fluorescence ratios of living and dying cells using this measure (Living cells: 0.13 ± 0.14, n = 46; dying cells: 0.12 ± 0.11, n = 35; mean ratio ±SD; six fish, 2–3 neuromasts per fish; Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.60) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These results demonstrate that acute differences in mitochondrial activity just prior to neomycin exposure do not correspond with likelihood of subsequent hair cell death. We also examined whether variation in baseline cytoplasmic or mitochondrial calcium indicator fluorescence corresponded with neomycin susceptibility. Hair cell-specific mitoGCaMP3 and cytoRGECO baseline fluorescence were recorded prior to treatment, with values across cells reflecting an 8-fold range and an 11-fold range, respectively.

We labeled fish expressing mitoTimer with Hoechst dye at four dpf, and then treated them with 50 µM or 100 µM neomycin 24 hr later. For both older (Hoechst+) and younger (Hoechst-) cells, we saw a dose dependent decrease in hair cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>; Control Hoechst+: 8.88 ± 1.83; 50 μM Neo Hoechst+: 2.08 ± 1.68; 100 μM Neo Hoechst+: 0.35 ± 0.65; Control Hoechst-: 3.63 ± 1.58; 50 μM Neo Hoechst-: 3.16 ± 1.60; 100 μM Neo Hoechst-: 2.00 ± 1.00; mean cells/neuromast ± SD; nine fish per group).

These results suggest that cells with a higher mitoTimer ratio in both older and younger populations are more susceptible to damage. Together with our previous results, this suggests that the most susceptible cells are the older and historically MET active cells in the cluster.

With acute stimulation, hair cells exhibit increased cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx with distinct kinetic properties. With chronic changes to hair cell MET activity, we observed corresponding changes in mitoTimer fluorescence, indicative of altered mitochondrial oxidation and turnover. In support of this interpretation, we also observed activity-dependent changes in mitochondrial polarization as well as hair cell oxidation. Our ability to visualize the chronic impact of hair cell activity on mitochondria allowed us to identify hair cells that are more susceptible to aminoglycoside-induced damage. Our findings show that the cumulative history of mitochondrial activity, which may be influenced by age and MET activity, is predictive of differential hair cell death.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mitochondrial metabolism and dynamics during normal cellular activity</title><p>Mitochondria are critical organelles, generating ATP through OXPHOS, while also playing an important role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and production of ROS. These mitochondrial activities are all interrelated. ROS production within mitochondria occurs as a result of normal metabolic activity at two sites within the electron transport chain, complexes I and III. Electron leakage at these complexes leads to the generation of superoxide, which is converted into membrane-permeable hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Loschen et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Turrens, 2003</xref>). Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling influences this process as it can stimulate OXPHOS, and therefore, electron flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brookes et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup>, metabolic activity, and ROS production is particularly notable for hair cells, where constant stimulation and sensory input leads to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Increased mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were also observed with MET activity, demonstrating that hair cell activity directly affects mitochondria. Compared to cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the larger integrated area and rise time of the mitochondrial signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref>) are consistent with the idea that mitochondria may act as Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers, mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in addition to other means of cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion. This role for hair cell mitochondria has been postulated in mammalian hair cells based, in part, on apical localization of the organelles and through Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging studies during transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weaver and Schweitzer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rüsch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beurg et al., 2010</xref>). Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering could be further investigated through manipulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and release mechanisms during hair cell stimulation.</p><p>Constant sensory input and Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux likely place high demands on mitochondrial activity with potentially long-term consequences. We were able to probe the relationship between mitochondrial history and hair cell activity by monitoring mitoTimer signal in hair cells. mitoTimer fluorescence ratio (red:green) increased as hair cells functionally matured, and after MET was increased by orbital shaking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). When MET activity is significantly reduced or abolished, as with benzamil treatment or in <italic>sputnik</italic> mutants, we observed a dramatic decrease in mitoTimer ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). mitoTimer is a unique but complex indicator, likely reflecting multiple facets of mitochondrial biology. Thus, although there is a significant dependence on hair cell activity, an exact interpretation of mitoTimer fluorescence shifts is less clear. Based on previous studies, we expect that mitoTimer in hair cells reports mitochondrial age, in addition to oxidation, organelle turnover and/or turnover of mitochondrial protein, or a combination of these, as discussed below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferree et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hernandez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laker et al., 2014</xref>). mitoTimer as a reporter of mitochondrial stress and oxidation was first described in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laker et al. (2014)</xref>. mitoTimer red fluorescence shifts were observed in cultured myoblasts and <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart tube after treatment with agents known to increase mitochondrial ROS production, including rotenone, antimycin A, and paraquat. Additionally, the authors observed a significant red shift in aging flies, suggesting that mitoTimer reflects both the age and redox history of the organelles. Later studies also revealed that mitoTimer can be used to assess oxidative stress following ischemia-reperfusion injury in muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). These findings are consistent with studies of the formation of DsRed fluorescent protein, which in itself is mediated by oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Verkhusha et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yarbrough et al., 2001</xref>). In lateral line hair cells, we observed shifts in the mitoTimer fluorescence ratio relative to increased or decreased MET. Given that altered MET is likely to have a substantial metabolic impact on the cells, the change in mitoTimer fluorescence could very well reflect corresponding changes in mitochondrial stress and oxidation over time. This is bolstered by our observation of (1) increased hair cell oxidation with sustained stimulation as reported by CellROX; and (2) reduced JC-1 fluorescence in the absence of MET, indicating that MET acutely influences mitochondrial polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).</p><p>In addition to reporting mitochondrial redox history, mitoTimer has also been used to investigate mitochondrial dynamics and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferree et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hernandez et al., 2013</xref>). The decreased mitoTimer red:green ratio observed in <italic>sputnik</italic> mutants could be interpreted to reflect increased mitochondrial import (with a corresponding increase of ‘new’ green protein relative to red). An important driving factor for mitochondrial import is mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dudek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wiedemann et al., 2004</xref>); however we did not observe a correspondence between potential and mitoTimer fluorescence ratio. We observed a decrease in mitochondrial polarity in <italic>sputnik</italic> mutants with JC-1 staining, which in isolation would be predicted to result in an increase in the red:green ratio of mitoTimer, rather than the decrease we observed. Decreased red:green ratio might also be interpreted as reflecting increased protein turnover (with degradation of &quot;old&quot; red protein) or increased organelle turnover caused by changes in processes such as mitophagy. We sought to further examine this idea in the context of MET mutants by monitoring changes in red mitoEos fluorescence after photoconversion. A similar strategy has been used previously in mice using the photoconvertible protein Dendra2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pham et al., 2012</xref>). Although this analysis provides only an estimate of turnover (based on the loss of photoconverted protein), our results suggest that increased mitochondrial turnover or turnover of protein occurs when MET activity is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), consistent with the observed changes in mitoTimer. This difference in mitochondrial protein turnover in <italic>sputnik</italic> mutants was unexpected. Previous studies have demonstrated mitochondrial turnover via mitophagy occurs as a quality control process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campanella et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Twig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nowikovsky et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mizushima et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhao et al., 2002</xref>). With increased mitochondrial activity in MET active hair cells, we might predict that these cells would incur more damage over time and, as a result, turnover would be higher compared to <italic>sputnik</italic> mutant siblings. One possibility is that mitochondria in wildtype hair cells undergo more fusion and elongation relative to <italic>sputnik</italic> mutants. In other cell types, increased OXPHOS activity has been associated with elongated mitochondrial morphology and, in studies of isolated mitochondria, OXPHOS has been shown to stimulate fusion (reviewed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mishra and Chan (2016)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mishra and Chan, 2016</xref>). The fact that mitochondrial activity and dynamics have been shown to reciprocally regulate each other suggests that mitoTimer could also reflect the interrelatedness of the two, as well as mitochondrial turnover via mitophagy. Reduced mitophagy has been observed with increased ROS in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qi et al., 2011</xref>). If similarly true in hair cells, increased or sustained MET activity would predictably lead to red-shifted mitoTimer fluorescence. Studies examining mitochondrial dynamics relative to MET will be important for further elucidating this relationship.</p><p>The irreversible nature of mitoTimer conversion afforded us the benefit of examining the cumulative effect on mitochondria over time, but it does not provide a dynamic picture of mitochondrial activity. It should also be noted that our manipulation of hair cell activity is limited to MET, although other aspects of hair cell function contribute to energy consumption, for example neurotransmitter packaging and release. A recent report demonstrates that there is heterogeneity amongst hair cells in their synaptic response to mechanical stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Future studies could assess the contribution of basal cellular activity to mitochondrial metabolism and dynamics, as well as a correspondence with hair cell age or susceptibility.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Selective susceptibility of lateral line hair cells</title><p>Early studies of lateral line hair cell susceptibility to aminoglycoside antibiotics demonstrated that hair cell loss is reliably dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Santos et al., 2006</xref>), where lower doses of neomycin lead to a smaller percentage of hair cell loss. Upon entering hair cells, neomycin disrupts Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling and causes increased mitochondrial ROS production prior to hair cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Esterberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Esterberg et al., 2016</xref>). Blocking mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake as well as treatment with ROS scavengers that specifically target mitochondria mitigate neomycin-induced damage, highlighting the importance of mitochondrial distress in hair cell susceptibility. The fact that some lateral line hair cells die and others survive has been perplexing. Our data suggest that baseline Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels or relative levels of mitochondrial membrane polarization just prior to neomycin exposure do not correspond with hair cell susceptibility. Rather, the cumulative impact of mitochondrial activity over a longer period of time serves as better indicator of susceptibility.</p><p>Given the influence of MET on mitochondrial activity and the vulnerability of mitochondria to neomycin exposure, we hypothesize that the accumulation of mitochondrial stress underlies differential hair cell susceptibility. Live imaging studies with mitoTimer reveal that cells with a red-shifted fluorescence ratio are more susceptible to low-dose neomycin exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). As older cells, they have been mechanotransducing for a longer period of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), but they are not necessarily more active than any other cell, or the most active cells at the time of exposure. We previously showed that maturation of individual hair cells corresponds with neomycin sensitivity: with hair cells in 4dpf fish relatively insensitive to neomycin exposure compared to 5dpf fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Santos et al., 2006</xref>). Here we build on this finding to show an age-dependent difference in cumulative mitochondrial activity that correlates with neomycin susceptibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Hair cells are active sensory receptors receiving constant sensory input. With this in mind, we propose that the normal activity sustained over the life of a hair cell contributes to cumulative mitochondrial insult. As a result, older cells are less capable of overcoming acute mitochondrial insult and are more likely to succumb to neomycin-induced damage. Alternatively, hair cells that have more active mitochondrial turnover or repair may be less susceptible to damage. Experiments looking at turnover in mitochondrially-targeted photoconvertible Eos protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggests that MET activity is associated with decreased mitochondrial turnover. Thus, MET activity might influence hair cell vulnerability not by cumulative mitochondrial damage but by altering mitochondrial turnover and repair. In this scenario, cells with lower mitoTimer red:green ratios may be less susceptible to neomycin exposure because they have more active mitochondrial repair or regeneration.</p><p>We note that our experiments assessing mitoTimer and susceptibility to neomycin exposure are correlative. We find that mitoTimer red:green ratios increase with age and with activity, and correspond to increased susceptibility to damage. However other age-related (or activity-related) factors may play a role in determining the relative vulnerability of hair cells to damage either in addition to mitochondrial changes or independently. Although we observe a decrease the relative red:green ratio of mitoTimer by blocking MET activity, reductions in MET also protect hair cells by blocking uptake of neomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hailey et al., 2017</xref>), preventing independent evaluation of changes in mitoTimer and susceptibility. We do find significant shifts in mitoTimer fluorescence after placing fish on an orbital shaker, allowing a test of whether changes in mitoTimer ratio caused by this procedure alter neomycin susceptibility. We found that a 24-hour incubation on the orbital shaker had no effect on dose dependent hair cell loss after neomycin exposure compared to controls (data not shown). These results demonstrate that mitochondrial changes induced by orbital shaking are not sufficient to alter susceptibility. It may be that the relative mitochondrial changes are just not substantial enough under these conditions to effect changes in neomycin susceptibility, or that induced changes are irrelevant. We do not know whether orbital shaking might also contribute confounding factors such as MET inhibition after long term stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Connections to mammalian hair cell susceptibility</title><p>In the cochlea, differential susceptibility and hair cell loss occurs based on hair cell type and location along the tonotopic axis, where outer hair cells are more vulnerable than inner hair cells, and high frequency hair cells more sensitive than low frequency hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Forge and Schacht, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kopke et al., 1999</xref>). Our findings are consistent with studies that implicate disparities in metabolic and oxidative stress between cochlear hair cells as an underlying factor of differential susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jensen-Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sha et al., 2001</xref>). It is also worth noting that hair cell vulnerability to ROS may also increase with age, as a number of redox-regulating mechanisms display age-related changes. For example, expression of the ROS neutralizing enzyme SOD2 decreases in mammalian hair cells over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2007</xref>). Expression of the mitochondrial Sirtuin enzymes, particularly SIRT3, have also been shown to decrease with increasing age in the mammalian cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Takumida et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, SIRT3 activity has been shown to delay the onset of age-related hearing loss and protect hair cells from both noise and aminoglycoside-induced hair cell damage due to its role in antioxidant defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Someya et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Quan et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that the loss of ROS regulation over time contributes to hair cell susceptibility and hearing loss. This is further supported in work from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Someya et al. (2009)</xref>, where overexpression of mitochondrially-targeted catalase—another antioxidant enzyme—attenuated hair cell loss and improved hearing thresholds in aging mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Someya et al., 2009</xref>). Although it appears that mitochondrial oxidation may increase over time in lateral line hair cells, changes in the expression of redox enzymes through maturation have not been examined. Extending analysis of mitoTimer expression to the mammalian cochlea would provide valuable insight into selective susceptibility of mammalian hair cells and a useful comparison to studies focused on the lateral line.</p><p>The relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and hearing loss is of long standing interest. Mitochondrial impairment has been identified in multiple types of cochlear damage and several mutations in mitochondrial genes, as well as nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, are known to cause both syndromic and non-syndromic deafness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kokotas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luo et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, in some cases the mitochondrial mutations appear to synergize with environmental insults, leading to more extensive cochlear damage. For instance, the A1555G mutation in the MTRNR1 gene encoding 12S rRNA has been shown to dramatically predispose patients to hearing loss after exposure to aminoglycoside antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prezant et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischel-Ghodsian et al., 1997</xref>). This supports the possibility that as hair cells experience cumulative mitochondrial stress due to normal activity, as indicated in our study, the cellular response to bouts of acute damage may become further compromised over time. This has particular relevance for age-related hearing and hair cell loss. While the exact cause remains unknown, mitochondrial stress has been proposed as a possible mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Seidman et al., 2004</xref>). It is also important to consider the complexity of mitochondrial changes that occur over time. In aging and aging-related diseases, mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics are altered, which can in turn influence OXPHOS and ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sebastián et al., 2017</xref>). Given that the life of a lateral line hair cell is about 10 days, studies of mitochondrial activity, dynamics, and mitophagy in lateral line hair cells could provide valuable insight into age-related hair cell loss and hearing impairment in humans, but with a much shorter time frame. A more thorough understanding of the stresses incurred during the normal activity of these high-energy cells will inform therapeutic efforts to protect hair cells and hearing function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Reagent type (species) or resource</td><td>Designation</td><td>Source or reference</td><td>Identifiers</td><td>Additional information</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">mitoTimer</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Tg(myosin6b:mitoTimer)<sup>w208</sup>; Gateway cloing and Tol2-mediated transgenesis.</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">mitoEos</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Tg(myosin6b:mitoEos)<sup>w207</sup>; Gateway cloing and Tol2-mediated transgenesis</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">nlsEos</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Tg(atoh1a:nls-Eos)<sup>w214</sup>; CRISPR Knock-In</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">mitoGCaMP3</td><td>PMID: 25031409</td><td>ZFIN:ZDB-TGCONSTRCT-141008–1</td><td>Tg(myosin6b:mitoGCaMP3)<sup>w119</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">cytoRGECO</td><td>PMID: 25114259</td><td>ZFIN:ZDB-TGCONSTRCT-150114–2</td><td>Tg(myosin6b:R-GECO1)<sup>vo10Tg</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">Cdh23 mutant (<italic>sputnik</italic>)</td><td>PMID: 9491988</td><td>ZFIN:ZDB-GENO-170526–2</td><td valign="bottom">Cdh23<sup>tj264</sup> mutant</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Benzamil</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich:B2417-50MG</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Hoechst 33258</td><td valign="bottom">ThermoFisher</td><td valign="bottom">ThermoFisher:H3569</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GraphPad Prism</td><td>GraphPad Software</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Slidebook</td><td>Intelligent Imaging Innovations (3i)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.intelligent-imaging.com">www.intelligent-imaging.com</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Fiji</td><td>PMID: 22743772</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MATLAB</td><td>MathWorks</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com">www.mathworks.com</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fish</title><p>Experiments were conducted on larval zebrafish, ages 5–7 days post-fertilization (unless otherwise noted), prior to sex determination.

Except where noted, all imaging experiments were conducted with larvae at 5–7 days post-fertilization immersed in embryo media containing 0.2% MESAB (MS-222; ethyl-3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate). Fish were stabilized using a slice anchor harp (Harvard Instruments) so that neuromasts on immobilized animals had access to the surrounding media. Imaging was performed at ambient temperature, typically 25°C. Fish were oriented in two different positions for in vivo imaging studies. For waterjet experiments, fish were placed ventral side up and neuromasts OC1, D1, or D2 were imaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Raible and Kruse, 2000</xref>). For all other imaging studies, fish were positioned on their sides against the cover glass to image neuromasts from the posterior lateral line.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In vivo Waterjet Stimulation and Image Analysis</title><p>Waterjet stimulation was used to stimulate lateral line hair cells via directional displacement of the stereocilia. This consisted of a rectified sinusoidal pressure wave applied at 1 or 10 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Trapani and Nicolson, 2010</xref>). A glass pipette was filled with extracellular solution and placed approximately 100 μm from the hair cells of a given cluster, or neuromast. Pressure output was driven by a pressure clamp (HSPC-1, ALA Scientific) and movement of the kinocilia was used to confirm pressure wave application. GCaMP and RGECO fluorescence values were acquired with a 1 s capture interval using Slidebook software (3i). For waterjet stimulation paired with time-lapse imaging, camera intensification was set to maintain exposure times at approximately 100 ms for GCaMP and RGECO, keeping pixel intensity &lt;25% of saturation. Camera gain was set to three to minimize photobleaching. GCaMP3 fluorescence was acquired with a 488 nm laser and 535/30 emission filter. RGECO fluorescence was acquired with a 561 nm laser and 617/73 emission filter.</p><p>For analyses of waterjet hair cell responses, fluorescence measurements were exported to MATLAB. As described previously, fluorescence intensity values for the duration of the acquisition period were normalized to the baseline value prior to stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sebe et al., 2017</xref>). MATLAB scripts were used to compute the integrated area of the response, peak of response, and time to reach 75% of the peak (rise time to 75%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Esterberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sebe et al., 2017</xref>). The integrated area of the response is the sum of fluorescence intensity values captured during the waterjet stimulus. The 75% rise time is the number of seconds it takes from the start of the stimulus to reach 75% of the peak value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>mitoTimer and JC-1 imaging and analysis</title><p>For static mitoTimer imaging studies, zebrafish were immobilized with a harp and Z-sections were taken at 2 μm through the depth of the neuromast, typically 16 μm. Camera intensification was set at 650 and gain at three in order to keep exposure times less than 500 ms and maximum intensities less than 75% of saturation. Settings were held constant across experiments that were directly compared. Green mitoTimer fluorescence was acquired with a 488 nm laser and 535/30 emission filter, while red fluorescence was acquired with a 561 nm laser and 617/73 emission filter.</p><p>When mitoTimer imaging was conducted in combination with vital dye staining, live swimming zebrafish were incubated in embryo media containing Hoechst 33258 (10 mg/ml, ThermoFisher) diluted at 1:5000 for 30 min and washed 3 times in embryo media. Larvae were then immobilized for imaging as described above, 24 hr after treatment. Hoechst fluorescence was captured with a 405 nm laser and 445/45 emission filter. 2 s exposures were used to capture dim signals that persisted 24 hr after labeling. Due to the dimness of the Hoechst signal and the high auto-fluorescence of larvae in this wavelength, we considered fluorescence intensity greater than 1 SD over background to be label retaining. For experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, mitoTimer and Hoechst fluorescence imaging were conducted using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope and a C-Apochromat 40x/1.2 numerical aperture water objective at a 5x digital zoom. Fluorescence gain levels were kept consistent across samples for each experiment. Z-sections were taken at 2 μm through the depth of the neuromast. Fish were positioned on their sides against the cover glass to image neuromasts from the posterior lateral line.</p><p>For analyses of mitoTimer, Z-stacks of Tg[<italic>myo6b:mitoTimer</italic>]<sup>w208</sup> labeled hair cells were opened in 3i SlideBook or Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Using the maximum projection of each image, mean intensity values were extracted by drawing masks across entire neuromasts that were exported for analysis. Fluorescence intensities were calculated less the mean background signal (based on a 30 μm x 30 μm background mask that excludes hair cells). For dye labeling studies, masks were generated for individual cells within neuromasts. For single cell analyses, the median ratio for mitoTimer red and green fluorescence was calculated for all distinguishable cells within a given neuromast. Then, each cell’s ratio was normalized to the median value of its cluster.</p><p>The same imaging and analysis protocol was followed for static imaging of zebrafish labeled with JC-1 dye (ThermoFisher). To load the dye, free-swimming larvae were incubated in 1.5 μM JC-1 (diluted in embryo media) for 30 min and then washed three times in embryo media.

Free-swimming zebrafish larvae were incubated for 24 hr in 2.5 μM CellROX Green (ThermoFisher) diluted in embryo media. CellROX fluorescence was acquired with a 488 nm laser and 535/30 emission filter. Image acquisition and analysis was conducted as described above for static imaging, but with a notable difference. Because the dye labels both hair cell and support cell nuclei, image analysis was conducted in a single plane. Mean intensity values were extracted by drawing a mask around all cells that were reliably distinguished as hair cells based on nucleus shape and location. Mean intensity was then normalized by the area of the mask to control for differences in the number of distinguishable cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>mitoEos imaging and analysis</title><p>Tg[<italic>myo6b:mitoEos</italic>]<sup>w207</sup> larvae were exposed to UV illumination with a AUKEY LT-SET1 UV flashlight for 10 min with 1 min rest.

Neomycin sulfate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was then added as a 5x concentrated stock to achieve a final concentration of 50 μM. Fluorescence images were captured in 3 min intervals for 75 min. A motorized stage with set x, y, and z coordinates allowed acquisition from multiple neuromasts per fish during time-lapse recordings. For imaging of all indicators, camera gain and intensification were set to minimize photobleaching and to keep baseline pixel intensity less than 25% of saturation. Z-sections were taken at 2 μm intervals through the depth of the neuromast, typically 16 μm. The same imaging strategy was used for all indicators, however, images were collected at 2 min intervals with mitoGCaMP3 and cytoRGECO. Time-lapse images were aligned using 3i SlideBook software. Baseline fluorescence was extracted as noted above for single cells. As described previously, cells were categorized as living or dying based on their fragmentation and clearance from the neuromast following neomycin exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Esterberg et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Orbital stimulation</title><p>4dpf larval zebrafish were placed on a BioExpress S-3200-LS orbital shaker at 60 RPM for 24 or 48 hr.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Dwight E Bergles as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Katie Kindt (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study exploits the unique accessibility of lateral line hair cells in zebrafish to investigate the relationship between hair cell activity, mitochondrial calcium, mitochondrial ROS generation and sensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics. The authors use a variety of fluorescent reporters – some dyes and some genetically encoded – to monitor cytosolic and mitochondrial changes in vivo, a major strength of the analysis. They define the temporal relationship between cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium levels in response to different levels of activity, showing that mitochondrial calcium lags the cytosol changes, as expected, and remains elevated much longer. More activity resulted in higher transients and were largely absent in mutants lacking functional MET channels. To assess the relationship between activity and cumulative mitochondrial ROS production, the authors use a genetically encoded probe, mitoTimer, which changes fluorescence from green to red in an age and ROS dependent manner. Although not a pure ROS sensor, the authors preform some clever experiments to explore this feature, by showing that the transition is age-dependent, requires functional MET channels and is enhanced by activity (Figure 6). Using fluorescently tagged mitochondria, the authors show that mitochondrial turnover is faster in zebrafish without functional MET channels, a somewhat unexpected finding, given the prior evidence of activity dependent ROS production. Finally, they perform what is perhaps the most significant analysis, to determine the relationship between acute and cumulative mitochondrial activity and cell death in response to neomycin, which has previously been shown to cause hair cell toxicity by manipulating mitochondrial ROS. Here they show that the immediate state of the mitochondria (calcium level) is not correlated with sensitivity, but that the cumulative mitochondrial activity is, suggesting that mitochondria accumulate damage through prolonged ROS generation, which renders them more sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics. The studies have been performed with care, the illustrations and text are clear, and the conclusions well supported by the experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The section on mitochondria calcium responses is a bit cumbersome with the two different stimuli. The different response patterns for the two stimuli are confusing to follow and perhaps difficult to interpret. The authors suggest that the 10 Hz stimulus may be stronger than the 1 Hz stimulus (stimulating in two directions to inhibit and excite the hair cells) and that is why the patterns are different. Alternatively, it is possible that due to the delayed rise in mitochondrial calcium signals upon stimulation (subsection “Mitochondria respond to acute hair cell stimulation”), that a stimulatory 0.5 s deflection is not quite enough time to see a rise in signal before a relatively long inhibitory 0.5 s deflection in the other direction is given. The 10 Hz stimulus with its short stim/inhib phases of 50 ms on/off may allow for easier detection of mitochondrial signals because there is no long inhibitory stimulus. This could be tested with a 20 s pulse of 0.5 s or 50 ms stimuli in just one direction. Alternatively, the authors could focus on the data from the 10 Hz stimulus.</p><p>2) The JC-1 dye experiments need additional explanation/clarification. Subsection “Mitochondria respond to acute hair cell stimulation”: How the JC-1 dye works is not explained clearly. It is confusing what &quot;concentrations&quot; mean with regards to the dye, and the mitochondrial membrane potential and relative state of de- or hyper-polarization. Also, JC-1 has been shown to accumulate in energized mitochondria (increase in the red/green ratio). Perhaps stating something along these lines is more straightforward. Mitochondrial polarization is vague. Use hyper- or de-polarization to specify the change in potential. Subsection “Mechanotransduction has long-term effects on mitochondria”: It is unclear how the acute MET dependent increases in mitochondrial calcium (Figure 1) corresponds to the JC-1 dye measurements. Unless the authors can explain how the acute calcium responses would change the JC-1 ratio, these two measurements are quite different and are independent measures of mitochondria activity. The JC-1 measurements are static baseline measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential.</p><p>3) The authors present no evidence that baseline calcium levels in either the mitochondria or cytosol provide an estimate of hair cell activity or reflect something similar to the acute activity in Figure 1. Baseline measurements may not even reflect baseline calcium levels in some of cells. For example, the intensity of non-ratiometric indicators can reflect the expression level of the indicator, which could vary between cells depending on cell age and turnover of the indicator.</p><p>Overall, these type of baseline measurements are not a meaningful way to assess the MET heterogeneity within a population, but rather just before/after comparisons within an individual cell or population. If the authors could link MET activity to baseline calcium levels, this would be more meaningful. Alternatively, the authors could use the JC-1 ratio to link mitochondrial membrane potential to aminoglycoside susceptibility.</p><p>4) It is critical that the authors provide a more definitive link between MET activity, mitochondrial activity, and neomycin susceptibility. The use of Hoechst to compare ages of hair cells is quite nice, but unfortunately was not incorporated in more experiments. Overall the data show a nice correlation between hair cell age and mitochondrial activity, however a similar link between MET activation and mitochondria activity is more tenuous. Increased hair cell turnover in the <italic>sputnik</italic> mutants could be an alternate explanation for several of the results, and the data in Figure 6 suggest that increased activity has a minimal effect on mitoTimer ratios. It would be very helpful to see if additional time in the shaker leads to continued increases in mitoTimer red:green ratios. Finally, the crux of the manuscript is really in Figure 9 which shows increased mitoTimer red:green ratios very nicely correlate with susceptibility to neomycin. But considering some of the other concerns regarding the roles of age versus activity, this experiment really just shows that there is a likely correlation between cell age, mitoTimer red:green ratio and susceptibility. It is difficult to determine whether MET activity really plays any role. A nice experiment that might look more directly at this would be to incorporate the Hoechst aging trace with shaking activity. In that way, one could compare cells of comparable ages in fish that have either been shaken or not. This would allow looking at the correlation between MET activity, mitoTimer red:green ration and neomycin susceptibility. The authors should also consider testing whether animals on the orbital shaker (with more MET and mitochondrial activity and increases mitoTimer ratio) are more susceptible than controls (no shaker).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cumulative mitochondrial activity confers selective susceptibility in zebrafish mechanosensory hair cells&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors suggest that this is due to variability among hair cells, but they have a way of marking their age and degree of stress, so I'm not sure why they didn't subclassify the cells in this experiment. Circumstantially, the effect is predicted – mitoTimer ratio increases in older hair cells with shaking and mitoTimer ratio is correlated with increased susceptibility to neomycin. Thus, it isn't clear why the authors didn't use the age marking strategy in the shaking experiment. It seems like age has the biggest effect, but they continue to imply that age equals more MET activity, but obviously there could be more complications due to age. Also, perplexing is that using photoconversion of Eos they show that mitochondrial/mitochondria protein turnover is enhanced when MET channels are inhibited. I don't think they have adequately addressed how this issue could affect interpretation of the results, though the fifth paragraph of subsection “Mitochondrial metabolism and dynamics during normal cellular activity” highlights some potential confounds. It would be helpful if the authors could discuss how this phenomonon could affect interpretation of the finding that surviving hair cells had apparently lower mitoTimer ratios (lower mitoTimer ratio could indicate less stressed mitochondria or younger/more actively restored mitochondria). Thus, while they have provided some additional clarity, the issue of MET activity, mitochondrial state, and neomycin sensitivity is still somewhat uncertain. The title should be revised to indicate what susceptibility they are referring to.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38062.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The section on mitochondria calcium responses is a bit cumbersome with the two different stimuli.

We agree that the section on cytoplasmic mitochondrial calcium responses to waterjet stimuli was cumbersome. While we are intrigued by the differential mitochondrial calcium responses to 1 vs. 10 Hz stimuli, we believe that these data require a rigorous follow-up in a separate study. Given that the differential responses do not contribute to the main point of the current manuscript, we have removed the 1 Hz data from the figure and the text of the manuscript, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The JC-1 dye experiments need additional explanation/clarification.

Additionally, we agree that measurement of calcium responses and JC-1 ratio are very different and were not meant to be directly related. These data were presented together in differentiating them from mitoTimer, which shifts gradually over time. We have placed discussion of the JC-1 data into a new subsection “Mitochondrial activity in the absence of mechanotransduction”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors present no evidence that baseline calcium levels in either the mitochondria or cytosol provide an estimate of hair cell activity or reflect something similar to the acute activity in Figure 1.

In this case, the JC-1 ratio measurement is a more meaningful indication of mitochondrial activity relative to susceptibility. As such, the calcium measurements have been removed from Figure 8.</p><p>However, baseline fluorescence measurements have been used in other studies to compare living and dying hair cells in response to neomycin treatment (Esterberg et al., 2013) as well as synaptically active and silent hair cells within neuromasts (Zhang et al., 2018). Although they may not explicitly reflect heterogeneity of MET, we believe it is still worth acknowledging that there is no correspondence between baseline calcium indicator fluorescence measurements and hair cell susceptibility. We have removed language explicitly tying these results to calcium levels and MET activity, but we have included the data in a supplemental figure (Figure 8—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is critical that the authors provide a more definitive link between MET activity, mitochondrial activity, and neomycin susceptibility. The use of Hoechst to compare ages of hair cells is quite nice, but unfortunately was not incorporated in more experiments. Overall the data show a nice correlation between hair cell age and mitochondrial activity, however a similar link between MET activation and mitochondria activity is more tenuous. Increased hair cell turnover in the sputnik mutants could be an alternate explanation for several of the results, and the data in Figure 6 suggest that increased activity has a minimal effect on mitoTimer ratios. It would be very helpful to see if additional time in the shaker leads to continued increases in mitoTimer red:green ratios.

The authors should also consider testing whether animals on the orbital shaker (with more MET and mitochondrial activity and increases mitoTimer ratio) are more susceptible than controls (no shaker).</p></disp-quote><p>The possibility of hair cell turnover in the absence of MET – as in the <italic>sputnik</italic> mutants – is certainly an important point. We were unable to track hair cells with the Hoechst nuclear label in this case because we found that the <italic>sputnik</italic> mutants do not take up the Hoechst dye (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1). This is consistent with findings that differential uptake of other dyes is MET dependent. However, we did address this point with a transgenic line expressing nuclear localized Eos and blocking MET with benzamil treatment (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1). By photoconverting and tracking the cells in control or benzamil treated conditions, we observed no differences in hair cell turnover in either group. This suggests that decreases in the mitoTimer ratio likely reflect differences in MET rather than significant differences in hair cell age or turnover.</p><p>Per the thoughtful suggestion of the reviewers, we also conducted an experiment to combine cell age tracing and orbital shaking (Figure 7B). In this experiment, mitoTimer-expressing hair cells were labelled with Hoechst dye prior to 24 hours in control or orbital shaking conditions. Hair cells were categorized as Hoechst positive or negative, and mitoTimer fluorescence was measured. We observed an increase in the mitoTimer fluorescence ratio only for Hoechst positive cells in the orbital shaking condition. As suggested by the reviewers, we also tested whether a longer period of orbital shaking (48hrs total) lead to an increase in mitoTimer ratio and found this to be the case (Figure 7—figure supplement 2). These findings provide additional evidence of a connection between MET activity and mitochondrial activity.</p><p>In considering the reviewers suggestions, we conducted an additional experiment to further examine the correlation between MET activity, mitoTimer ratio, and neomycin susceptibility, taking into account age by using differential Hoechst labeling. For this experiment, mitoTimer-expressing hair cells were labeled with Hoechst at 4dpf. 24 hours later, the fish were treated with 50 or 100 μM neomycin. The surviving hair cells were categorized as Hoechst positive or negative, and mitoTimer fluorescence was measured (Figure 10). We observed that for both older and younger hair cells (Hoechst positive and negative, respectively), the red:green ratio of surviving cells post-neo treatment was significantly lower than cells in the untreated condition. This indicates that cells with a higher mitoTimer ratio in both older and younger populations are more susceptible to damage. Overall, these data are consistent with the idea that historically more active hair cells are more susceptible to damage.</p><p>Finally, we attempted to test whether orbital shaking treatment affected neomycin susceptibility. We placed animals on the orbital shaker for 24 hours, and then tested against increasing doses of neomycin. We found no statistical differences between groups. This finding is perhaps not surprising, given that the changes in mitoTimer we observe with shaking across the whole population are in themselves modest. We report these negative data in the Discussion section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been substantially improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>It seems that one of the main goals of the study – to link MET activity to increased susceptibility to neomycin – has not been demonstrated.

We note that linking MET activity to increased susceptibility was not really a goal of our study. Rather we explored the relationships between MET and mitochondrial activity, age and mitochondrial activity, and mitochondrial activity and neomycin susceptibility. We do not intend to equate hair cell age with more hair cell activity, but rather note that older cells have been MET active for a longer period of time, so that MET could be a component of aging. We understand that we’ve shown relationships from A to B and B to C, but not A to C. However, we think the results are still interesting and important without this explicit connection.
