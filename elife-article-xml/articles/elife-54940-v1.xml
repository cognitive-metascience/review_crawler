role in cellular excitability, amplifying small membrane depolarizations into action potentials. Interactions with auxiliary subunits and other factors modify the intrinsic kinetic mechanism to result in new molecular and cellular functionality. We show here that sodium channels can implement a molecular leaky integrator, where the input signal is the membrane potential and the output is the occupancy of a long-term inactivated state. Through this mechanism, sodium channels effectively measure the frequency of action potentials and convert it into Na<sup>+</sup> current availability. In turn, the Na<sup>+</sup> current can control neuronal firing frequency in a negative feedback loop. Consequently, neurons become less sensitive to changes in excitatory input and maintain a lower firing rate. We present these ideas in the context of rat serotonergic raphe neurons, which fire spontaneously at low frequency and provide critical neuromodulation to many autonomous and cognitive brain functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sodium channels</kwd><kwd>long-term inactivation</kwd><kwd>FHF</kwd><kwd>serotonergic raphe neurons</kwd><kwd>kinetic mechanism</kwd><kwd>dynamic clamp</kwd><kwd>pacemaker</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13SDG16990083</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milescu</surname><given-names>Lorin S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13SDG14570024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milescu</surname><given-names>Mirela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000138</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need Initiative Training Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Navarro</surname><given-names>Marco A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007165</institution-id><institution>University of Missouri</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Life Sciences Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Jenna L</given-names></name><name><surname>Cowan</surname><given-names>Luke M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Kinetic interactions between sodium channels and auxiliary factors create a molecular computational engine that can sense and regulate cellular excitability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Computation in the brain begins at the molecular level, with proteins such as ion channels and receptors that can change their structural and functional state in response to changes in the environment. These molecular building blocks capable of processing information have been adapted by nature into progressively more complex computational structures: ion channels and receptors were incorporated into synapses and neurons, neurons were interconnected into networks and circuits, and circuits were assembled into a brain capable of abstract thinking. Not surprisingly, computation in the engineering world followed the same trend, from transistors and integrated circuits to microprocessors and computers.</p><p>At the molecular level, voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels have long been credited with a critical role in cellular excitability: amplifying a small membrane depolarization, such as created by a tiny postsynaptic excitatory current, into a full blown action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>). Computationally, Nav channels can be regarded as the equivalent of a transistor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sigworth, 2003</xref>), a nonlinear electric circuit element. To generate action potentials of specific shape and firing patterns, spontaneously or in response to synaptic input, a neuron expresses a complement of Nav and other types of ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bean, 2007</xref>) and positions them strategically at subcellular locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kole and Stuart, 2012</xref>). Although we generally understand how ion channels contribute to the mechanics of action potential generation and propagation, the molecular and cellular landscapes are complex and remain incompletely charted. At the most basic level, we do not fully understand how ion channels function as molecular computational machines and how they interact with each other and with other factors to regulate cellular activity.</p><p>We examine here a new computational function of the Nav channel that emerges from a process of long-term inactivation (LTI), which can be caused by interaction with fibroblast growth factor-homologous factors (FHFs), a relatively recently discovered group of auxiliary factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldfarb, 2012</xref>). We are particularly interested in this functionality in the context of pacemaker serotonergic raphe neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jacobs and Azmitia, 1992</xref>), which provide critical neuromodulation to many brain areas involved in autonomous and cognitive functions. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Milescu et al., 2010b</xref>), we examined the Nav channels in <italic>raphe obscurus</italic> (RO) neurons and proposed a kinetic model that explains not only their intrinsic kinetic properties but also their characteristic process of long-term inactivation. Here, we investigate the computational aspects of this mechanism, using a combination of electrophysiology experiments and mathematical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Action potentials in serotonergic raphe neurons and the contribution of Nav channels</title><p>Action potentials vary in their properties in different neuronal types but they generally last from hundreds of microseconds to several milliseconds, rapidly swinging the membrane between hyperpolarized and depolarized states. Serotonergic neurons have a particular electrophysiological profile, characterized by regular and spontaneous spiking at low frequency (3 ‒ 5 Hz), a steady depolarization in the interspike interval, and broad action potentials (3 ‒ 6 ms), as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>.

To perform their duty, Nav channels must cycle through a sequence of functional states, as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>: they are (virtually) closed (C) in the interspike interval, activate and abruptly open (O) and then quickly inactivate (I) during the action potential, and then recover from inactivation in the interspike interval. Interestingly, as it recovers from inactivation, the channel bypasses the open state, instead following the transition pathway indicated by the blue arrow in the figure. The resulting hysteresis (red vs. blue arrows) serves a fundamental role, as it effectively separates the process of inactivation during the action potential, controlled by the O - I transition, from the recovery from inactivation during the interspike interval, separately controlled by the I - C transitions.</p><p>As a result of separating these pathways, inactivation from the open state proceeds very quickly, giving the channel just enough time to flow current and sufficiently depolarize the membrane and activate other voltage-gated ion channels. In contrast, recovery out of inactivation proceeds more slowly from the closed states, at a rate that determines a refractory period compatible with the maximal spiking rate of the neuron. Furthermore, bypassing the open state minimizes the flow of Na<sup>+</sup> ions in the wake of the action potential and thus economizes the energy utilized by cellular ionic pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carter and Bean, 2009</xref>). A conceptual kinetic mechanism that adequately captures all these properties is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kuo and Bean, 1994</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Nav channels have long-term inactivation</title><p>Fast voltage-dependent activation (sub-millisecond) and inactivation (millisecond), as well as relatively fast recovery from inactivation (milliseconds), are kinetic properties common to all Nav channel subtypes, as described since the pioneering work of Hodgkin and Huxley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armstrong and Bezanilla, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Armstrong and Bezanilla, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bezanilla and Armstrong, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldrich et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vandenberg and Bezanilla, 1991a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vandenberg and Bezanilla, 1991b</xref>). However, the Nav kinetic inventory is richer than that, including such behavior as ‘persistence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">French et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crill, 1996</xref>) or ‘resurgence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raman and Bean, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Raman and Bean, 2001</xref>). In raphe and other neurons, Nav channels exhibit yet another interesting property: when subjected to brief, repetitive depolarizations that mimic trains of action potentials, the Na<sup>+</sup> current evoked by each pulse progressively diminishes to levels inversely proportional to the pulse repetition rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Nav channels in serotonergic raphe neurons exhibit a slow kinetic component.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The fraction of Nav channels available to generate current decays exponentially, when tested with trains of brief depolarizing voltage pulses (5 ms at −15 mV, repeated at 5, 10, or 20 Hz). The decay is greater at higher repetition rates.

(<bold>B</bold>) The timing of recovery from inactivation was tested with a two-pulse protocol, where the first pulse (5 ms at −15 mV) inactivates the channels and the second pulse tests availability versus time, at −80 mV. As indicated by the two time constants (τ<sub>fast</sub> and τ<sub>slow</sub>), recovery from inactivation is a bi-exponential process, with the slow component accounting for approximately 20% of the total current.

Following a brief (5 ms) depolarizing pulse that completely inactivates the channels, approximately 80% of the initially available current recovers fast (milliseconds), with a voltage-dependent time constant, whereas the remaining 20% recovers slowly (hundreds of milliseconds to seconds), also with a voltage-dependent time constant. In brain slice recordings from neonatal RO neurons, the fast and slow components have the following time constants τ and relative amplitudes <italic>a</italic> (mean ± SE): at −80 mV, τ<sub>fast</sub> = 3.14 ± 0.126 ms, <italic>a</italic><sub>fast</sub> = 0.786 ± 0.013, τ<sub>slow</sub> = 612 ± 76 ms, and <italic>a</italic><sub>slow</sub> = 0.212 ± 0.007 (<italic>n</italic> = 18 cells); at −100 mV, τ<sub>fast</sub> = 1.45 ± 0.07 ms, <italic>a</italic><sub>fast</sub> = 0.775 ± 0.017, τ<sub>slow</sub> = 209 ± 39 ms, and <italic>a</italic><sub>slow</sub> = 0.199 ± 0.01 (<italic>n</italic> = 6). The two components take similar values in acutely isolated mature dorsal raphe neurons: at −80 mV, τ<sub>fast</sub> = 8.54 ± 0.59 ms, <italic>a</italic><sub>fast</sub> = 0.81 ± 0.022, τ<sub>slow</sub> = 517 ± 126 ms, and <italic>a</italic><sub>slow</sub> = 0.187 ± 0.017 (<italic>n</italic> = 6); at −100 mV, τ<sub>fast</sub> = 5.25 ± 0.69 ms, <italic>a</italic><sub>fast</sub> = 0.74 ± 0.042, τ<sub>slow</sub> = 247 ± 84 ms, and <italic>a</italic><sub>slow</sub> = 0.252 ± 0.033 (n = 5). The presence of the slow component in both intact and acutely dissociated neurons confirms the idea that the observed phenomenology is a genuine manifestation of the Nav kinetic mechanism, and not an artifact, such as caused by action potential back-propagation and poor space-clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Milescu et al., 2010a</xref>).</p><p>Similar Nav properties (i.e., adapting response to pulse trains and partial slow recovery from inactivation) have been observed in other neuronal types, such as hippocampal pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mickus et al., 1999</xref>). Appropriately, this phenomenology has been termed ‘prolonged inactivation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jung et al., 1997</xref>) or ‘long-term inactivation’ (LTI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dover et al., 2010</xref>), to distinguish it from slow inactivation, which is a different process whereby Nav channels slowly (hundreds of milliseconds to seconds, or more) become unavailable when held at depolarizing potentials, and also slowly return to full availability at hyperpolarizing potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ruff et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fleidervish et al., 1996</xref>). In contrast, LTI represents fast entry into a long-lived inactivated state, from which recovery is very slow. Interestingly, the LTI entry and exit time constants differ by three orders of magnitude: entry in milliseconds at depolarizing potentials and recovery in seconds during hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mickus et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Milescu et al., 2010b</xref>). As we discuss next, this fast-slow duality has important functional consequences.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mechanistic consequences of long-term inactivation</title><p>To investigate the role of LTI, we use here a previously developed model that explains well all the observed kinetic properties of Nav channels in RO neurons, including LTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Milescu et al., 2010b</xref>). The Nav state model generated in that study was derived from a comprehensive collection of data that covered steady-state properties (activation and inactivation), as well as transient properties (time course of activation and inactivation, slow inactivation, recovery from inactivation, closed-state inactivation, entry into LTI, cumulative inactivation, etc.), all at multiple voltages and time scales (tens of microseconds to seconds). The rate constants were extracted from data using the optimization and parameter constraining algorithms implemented in the QuB software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Navarro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Salari et al., 2018</xref>). The model was then verified in live RO neurons, using the real-time computation algorithms implemented in QuB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Milescu et al., 2008</xref>), confirming that a model-generated current that replaced the TTX-blocked endogenous <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> was able to generate action potentials of similar shape and frequency. Interestingly, different studies in other neuronal types have arrived at conceptually similar models to explain LTI, although they were not necessarily as comprehensively constrained by experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goldfarb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Menon et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The model that explains LTI in RO neurons is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, where the basic kinetic scheme introduced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> has been augmented with a non-conducting state (S<sub>13</sub>) connected to the open state (O<sub>6</sub>). The rate constants are explained in Materials and methods, and are as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Milescu et al. (2010b)</xref>. S<sub>13</sub> is a long-lived state representing the open channel blocked by the putative auxiliary factor, FHF. The O<sub>6</sub> - S<sub>13</sub> rate constants take values that, in the context of the intrinsic Nav kinetics, result in the observed LTI phenomenology, that is, the complete inactivation induced by a brief depolarization and the fast-slow bi-exponential recovery at hyperpolarizing potentials. The O<sub>6</sub> - S<sub>13</sub> transition competes with the normal inactivation process that corresponds to the O<sub>6</sub> - I<sub>12</sub> transition, with interesting mechanistic consequences. A brief depolarizing pulse from −80 to 0 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) takes the channel rapidly through the sequence of closed states, as voltage sensors activate. Once it reaches the open state, the channel has now two distinct pathways to follow: to inactivate ‘normally’ into the I<sub>12</sub> state, or to long-term inactivate into the S<sub>13</sub> state. According to our experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), ≈ 80% of the channels ‘choose’ the normal inactivation pathway and ≈ 20% take the LTI.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Nav long-term inactivation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Conceptual Nav state model that adds one non-conducting state (S<sub>13</sub>) to the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, to explain the slow kinetic component illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. S<sub>13</sub> is a state of long-term inactivation.

The O - I and O -S transitions are both fast, as illustrated in the bottom left panel, and compete with each other.

As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, those channels residing in the normal inactivated state I<sub>12</sub> cycle relatively fast (5 ‒ 10 ms) back into the non-inactivated closed states (C), without visiting the open state. In contrast, channels residing in the LTI state S<sub>13</sub> recover slowly, in seconds, reaching the non-inactivated states through the open state. Therefore, the sum occupancy probability of all non-inactivated states (C states plus O<sub>6</sub> state; <italic>P</italic><sub>C+O</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) rises from 0 to ≈ 1, on a bi-exponential time course.

Channels that are already inactivated will maintain their state. Because <italic>P</italic><sub>S</sub> is in fact a probability bound by 1, it cannot increase indefinitely. Thus, each action potential can only increase <italic>P</italic><sub>S</sub> by ≈ 20% of the fraction of available channels. At the beginning of a spike train, when all channels are available, this increment is ≈ 0.2 but progressively gets smaller, as fewer channels remain available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The specific value of the increment depends on the relative kinetics of the O<sub>6</sub> - S<sub>13</sub> and O<sub>6</sub> - I<sub>12</sub> transitions. The bi-exponential time course of <italic>P</italic><sub>S</sub>, with a fast component that completes in ≈ 2 ms, coupled with a much slower component, ensures that changing the width of the action potential would not significantly alter the 80%/20% ratio, unless the width were shorter than 2 ms, in which case LTI would be reduced, or if the depolarization were extended to hundreds of milliseconds or seconds, in which case <italic>P</italic><sub>S</sub> would eventually reach an equilibrium value of ≈ 0.7, as represented by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mi>∞</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</p><p>Once the action potential ends and <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> switches to the ‘low’ state, <italic>P</italic><sub>S</sub> starts to ‘leak’, because the input signal is ‘zero’ in the interspike interval and there is nothing to ‘integrate’. Thus, <italic>P</italic><sub>S</sub> decays exponentially, with the same time constant as the slow component of recovery from inactivation (hundreds of milliseconds). Those channels that were long-term inactivated (occupying the S<sub>13</sub> state) at the beginning of the interspike interval will remain unavailable to conduct current for an accordingly long time interval, on the order of seconds. In contrast, those channels that were normally inactivated (occupying the I<sub>12</sub> state) will become available much sooner, after only a few milliseconds. If another action potential were triggered while some channels were still residing in either the long-term inactivated state S<sub>13</sub> or in the inactivated state I<sub>12</sub>, the available (non-inactivated) channels will again divide 80%/20% between normal inactivation and long-term inactivation, and so on.

As it happens, a leaky integrator not only describes many real-world phenomena, such as rain accumulating into a lake that drains into a river, but also has many technical applications. One of the most obvious is to convert the frequency of an input signal into the amplitude of an output signal. For example, in our own electrophysiology backyard, it is customary to pass a nerve signal through a leaky integrator (implemented in hardware or software) to convert noisy and dense spike trains into an amplitude signal that more legibly indicates the frequency of those spikes.</p><p>As a molecular leaky integrator, Nav channels can also ‘measure’ the frequency of action potentials and ‘store’ it in the occupancy of the LTI state S<sub>13</sub>. As demonstrated by the experimental data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the amount of Na<sup>+</sup> current evoked with 5 ms depolarizing pulse trains decays exponentially with each pulse, and decays more at higher repetition rates. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, we calculate and plot <italic>P</italic><sub>S</sub> using the equation <italic>P</italic><sub>S</sub> = 1 − <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub><sup>p</sup> / <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub><sup>0</sup>, where <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub><sup>p</sup> is the peak Na<sup>+</sup> current raised by pulse <italic>p</italic> and <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub><sup>0</sup> is the peak Na<sup>+</sup> current raised by the first pulse in the series. The rationale of using this equation to obtain <italic>P</italic><sub>S</sub> is that the inter-pulse interval (195, 95, and 45 ms in this case) is long enough to allow full recovery from the normal inactivation, whereas recovery from the LTI state will be incomplete, as we know from the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. Thus, having a fraction of channels still trapped in the LTI state will proportionally reduce the maximal <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub>. As seen for this representative data set, <italic>P</italic><sub>S</sub> reaches steady values of ≈ 0.3 at 5 Hz, ≈ 0.4 at 10 Hz, and ≈ 0.5 at 20 Hz, exhibiting a nonlinear dependence on the pulse repetition rate.</p><p>To better understand how Nav channels may interpret action potential frequency, we simulated the response of our Nav model to a train of 5 ms depolarizing pulses from −80 to 0 mV, repeated at different rates, and compared it with the response of a mathematical leaky integrator.

What about firing under excitatory input? Considering these two reciprocal relationships, one can predict that changes in excitatory input will have a reduced effect on firing frequency in neurons that express Nav channels with LTI. The reason is that an increase in excitation will initially determine an increase in frequency, but this elevated frequency will then push more Nav channels into the LTI state, thus reducing the available <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> and returning frequency to lower values.</p><p>We tested this prediction by subjecting neurons to increasing levels of depolarizing bias current (<italic>I</italic><sub>Inj</sub>), with the endogenous Na<sup>+</sup> current TTX-blocked and replaced via dynamic clamp with <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> generated by either the LTI or the non-LTI model.

During a given depolarization episode, the frequency increases when changing the active model from LTI to non-LTI and decreases with the opposite change. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, where we plot the stationary spiking frequency versus the level of depolarization, the neuron generally maintains a lower firing rate when Nav channels have LTI, and the relative difference between LTI and non-LTI models is larger at greater depolarizations.

A control algorithm processes the error and determines the timing and the amount of gas to burn in the furnace (‘control variable’), such as to maintain the actual indoor temperature relatively constant and approximately equal to the desired temperature. The furnace will burn gas when the error is positive, which will increase the temperature and eventually make the error zero or negative, which in turn will instruct the furnace to stop burning gas, until the temperature drops again and the error becomes again positive.

At the same time, Nav channels can drive the neuron to spike, with a frequency that depends on how much Na<sup>+</sup> current is dynamically available, which is modulated by LTI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These two reciprocal relationships between frequency and available current establish a negative feedback control loop that can regulate the frequency of action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). As a result, neurons expressing Nav channels with LTI would be less sensitive to changes in excitatory input and would generally maintain a lower firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Future work must explain why this LTI-based functionality is necessary, in general and specifically in the case of raphe neurons. Thanks in part to LTI, raphe neurons strongly adapt their action potential shape and frequency in response to stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Milescu et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Venkatesan et al., 2014</xref>), but the role of this adaptation remains to be fully explained in the context of a more complete circuit that also includes the target neurons and all inputs, including auto-feedback. Raphe neurons act as a sprinkler-type system that provides serotonergic modulation to most brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daubert and Condron, 2010</xref>), via volume transmission carried by relatively evenly distributed innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Azmitia and Whitaker-Azmitia, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghajanian and Sanders-Bush, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vizi et al., 2010</xref>). We can speculate that a downstream effect of a frequency control mechanism would be to release serotonin at more stable levels. In the long term, these levels could be dialed up and down by acting on multiple regulatory mechanisms, including LTI. In parallel with this increased stability conferred by LTI, raphe neurons would still maintain their capability of responding to short-term changes in stimuli, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. For example, the <italic>raphe obscurus</italic> neurons investigated in this study are known to have mutual interactions with respiratory pacemaker neurons in the pre-Bötzinger Complex and briefly increase their firing rate in phase with respiratory network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ptak et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to note that LTI is not the only way for Nav channels to create feedback within the neuron. The most important is the well-known positive feedback mechanism that makes Nav channels the generator of action potentials. In the case of RO neurons, any depolarization that takes the cell above ≈ −50 mV starts to activate Nav channels, which generate current that further depolarizes the cell, which in turn activates more channels, and so on, until an action potential is fired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Yet another positive feedback may be created by closed-state inactivation. The interspike interval in RO neurons takes the characteristic shape of a steady ramp (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>) that is lengthened or shortened at lower or higher spiking frequencies, respectively. The ramp starts around −70 to −60 mV and ends at ≈ −45 mV, whereas the Nav channel steady-state inactivation begins at ≈ −80 mV and is almost complete at −40 mV. Longer interspike intervals would give Nav channels more time to equilibrate via closed-state inactivation, which would further slow down the ramp, because there would be less Na<sup>+</sup> current to drive the rate of depolarization and perhaps even insufficient current to generate an action potential. To escape this predicament, slow-spiking raphe neurons express Nav channels with a relatively low rate of closed-state inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Milescu et al., 2010b</xref>), and also feature voltage-activated calcium channels that alone can sustain spontaneous spiking with very shallow action potentials and thus can act as a backup (unpublished data). In principle, LTI is a form of open-state block and should not occur from closed states, but the existence of closed-state LTI remains to be further investigated. Although these two forms of positive feedback (voltage-dependent activation and closed-state inactivation) are critical, they are confined to one action potential cycle, whereas LTI is a form of negative feedback that extends over many action potentials and thus can effectively regulate the firing rate.</p><p>Mathematically, LTI can be described as a leaky integrator that summates over time an input signal into an output signal, while the output steadily decays (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>). Studying for an exam is a good analogy: we quickly accumulate knowledge with every page we read, while at the same time we slowly forget whatever we learned. In the field of electrical engineering, a simple leaky integrator can be implemented with an RC circuit. In the molecular world, nature has found a simple and elegant way of converting the Nav channel into a leaky integrator, via LTI, while preserving its basic functionality as a spike generator ‒ and also partial pacemaking driver in RO neurons. LTI is a mechanism that renders a fraction of the total number of Nav channels functionally non-available, in the sense that these channels are trapped in a non-conducting state and thus cannot contribute current to an action potential. This fraction increases and decreases with dynamics dictated by the frequency of action potentials, effectively becoming a measure of neuronal activity. For this mechanism to work, a single action potential must quickly increment the non-available fraction, whereas the subsequent interspike interval must slowly decrement it. In the case of LTI in RO neurons, the time constants of these two processes are separated by three orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>).</p><p>The simplest kinetic mechanism compatible with the observed LTI behavior is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, where an additional non-conducting state is connected to the open state of the basic Nav mechanism shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dover et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Milescu et al., 2010b</xref>). This model predicts the critically important large discrepancy between LTI entry and exit time constants yet realistically assumes only minimal electrical charge for the LTI transition itself. Nevertheless, the LTI mechanism ‒ as well as the intrinsic Nav mechanism itself ‒ may be different and possibly more complex in reality, and needs further investigation. More work is also necessary to identify the specific subtypes of Nav channels and FHFs that are functional in raphe neurons. For example, we assumed here that these neurons express a kinetically uniform Nav channel population and all channels are equally interacting with the FHF. However, the 80% to 20% ratio between normal and long-term inactivation components may also be explained by two (or more) Nav populations (e.g., defined by channel subtype or compartmentalization), each interacting differently (or not at all) with the FHF, in a concentration-dependent manner. Although we are not aware of reports in the literature where the total Na<sup>+</sup> current exhibits significantly more than 20% LTI under physiological conditions, the LTI fraction can be higher in FHF-transfected neurons, where FHF may reach higher concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Laezza et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, the same type of kinetic model with open-state block can account for the resurgent Na<sup>+</sup> current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Raman and Bean, 2001</xref>). However, in that case, the entry and exit time constants have comparable values. That model can also be considered a leaky integrator but the fraction of channels that enter the blocked state during a brief depolarization becomes available immediately upon repolarization and thus augments the subthreshold depolarizing Na<sup>+</sup> current, helping the hosting neuron to spike faster. In contrast, LTI plays the opposite role, by decreasing the amount of Na<sup>+</sup> current (both sub- and suprathreshold) and making it harder for the neuron to spike at high frequency.</p><p>We are not aware of other studies where Nav channels ‒ or other channels ‒ have been specifically identified as molecular leaky integrators, even though the leaky integrator is a powerful concept that has long been associated with neural computation, from individual neurons and circuits to cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knight, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cook and Maunsell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mitani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Portugues et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groschner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bahl and Engert, 2020</xref>). In excitable cells, a molecular leaky integrator can be a tool for monitoring and regulating cellular activity, as we demonstrated here with Nav channels and LTI in serotonergic raphe neurons.

Like Nav channels, potassium channels can also inactivate and recover from inactivation (or activate and deactivate) slowly, on time scales that are longer than the duration of a single action potential and thus can modulate neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schwindt et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Storm, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bond et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khaliq and Bean, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greene and Hoshi, 2017</xref>), and can even implement a form of short-term memory that relies solely on intrinsic neuronal excitability properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Turrigiano et al., 1996</xref>).

Pipette capacitance was compensated 100% in VC and ≈ 75% in CC and DC.

papers have described an interesting new mechanism of inactivation in voltage-activated sodium (Nav) channels whereby short depolarizations of a few ms cause a fraction of sodium channels to enter a state from which recovery from inactivation is very slow. However, the functional significance of this mechanism of long-term inactivation has not been explored extensively. Here, the authors present a nice combination of modeling and experiments (tied together by dynamic clamp experiments) to show long-term inactivation acts as a leaky integrator and that the reduction of sodium channel availability acts as negative feedback element to regulate pacemaking frequency of serotonergic neurons. The authors have done a nice job of addressing the concerns of the reviewers and the manuscript now makes a compelling demonstration that long-term inactivation, by slowing the recovery of Nav channels from inactivation, slows firing rate and places a limit on possible firing rates. The manuscript provides a well-reasoned presentation of the background information motivating the present work and a balanced discussion of how changes in firing may also be influenced by other conductances whose activation may be shaped by long-term inactivation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled “Sodium channels implement a molecular leaky integrator that detects action potentials and regulates neuronal firing” for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bruce P Bean (Reviewer #2); Arpad Mike (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Although the clear analysis and insightful discussion were appreciated by the reviewers, there are not a lot of new experimental results in the manuscript (mainly the data in Figure 5 showing how firing frequency depends on the level of sodium current availability) and many of the ideas have been touched on previously. Also, the reviewers found it odd that while the main point of the paper is proposing that long-term inactivation serves as a negative feedback element for regulating pacemaking frequency, you do not try to quantify this effect, for example by doing the dynamic clamp experiments in Figure 5 using models both with and without long-term-inactivation (i.e., with and without state S13). Although you will see in the reviews that there were diverging opinions, the consensus is that the work needs to be taken further to be appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. If you choose to experimentally show that a feedback mechanism involving LTI has a significant effect to control firing rate in either these cells or another types of neuron, we would be willing to reconsider the work as a new manuscript. <italic>eLife</italic> takes the position that we shouldn't require extensive new experiments for a revision, precisely because we believe the authors should decide what they wish their paper to be. That is why we have a two month revision time, and reject papers that might require extensive new work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper touches on the important question of how modulation of recovery from inactivation of sodium channels by fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) may impact on cell excitability. Although this reader found the manuscript interesting to read, overall the paper seems to be a proof-in-principle that use-dependent changes in Nav availability can impact on cell firing frequency, with little in the way of hard proof that the models used are correct and that the available data are sufficient to adequately constrain any given model of “long-term-inactivation”. Although Figure 5 provides the punch line that spiking frequency is altered by Nav availability, it ends up essentially being a teaser, since the authors do not explicitly test how the presence or absence of LTI in their dynamic clamp models might differentially alter firing. This essentially leaves any reader hanging. Why were tests comparing the consequences of adding or removing LTI in the model not considered? Overall, although a proof-in-principle may have merit, it does not seem adequately developed here, or presented in a form that clearly delineates what the authors want to accomplish with this.</p><p>The authors' strong preference for a variety of metaphors (whether studying for an exam or home furnaces) to explain the phenomenology seems to brush aside the essential and long-understood point that use-dependent changes in conductances (whether reflecting intrinsic properties of channels, or slow modulatory changes in channels) are major contributors to regulation of cell excitability, whether it is M-current, SK current, or, as implied here, Nav inactivation. Why is “leaky integrator” a useful concept either for explaining the phenomenology to readers or for enabling understanding of the physiological role of long-term inactivation? This is not clear to this reader.</p><p>The structure of the paper also seemed a bit problematic. The paper seems to jump back and forth between data and model predictions and at times it seemed confusing whether the authors were discussing data or model behavior. Despite extensive use of a particular model, there is little in the paper to indicate how data constrain different potential models for the two pathways of inactivation, and there is little to address the extent to which the authors' preferred model is really constrained by data. Another issue is that the available data do not seem adequate to really discern the extent to LTI may or may not occur from closed states. This seems particularly problematic when the authors point out in subsection “Nav channels drive spiking frequency” that some of the differences seen in Figure 5 may arise from more closed-state inactivation, which is really poorly defined for both LTI or normal fast inactivation.</p><p>Figure 5. This is potentially the most interesting and exciting aspect of the paper, but as noted above no attempt to really exploit the advantages of manipulations of the Nav model in dynamic clamp were done. Furthermore, in regards to AP firing during a dynamic clamp experiment, changes in Nav density may also change AP duration, or peak amplitude such that there may be activity dependent changes in Cav currents or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent currents, which may also impact on the firing properties. The result in Figure 5 is not sufficient on its own to assert that the changes with current density exclusively reflect Nav current. That may be the case, but other factors may also contribute.</p><p>As the authors mention, there is also the issue of what Nav currents are present in the raphe neurons and what FHFs may be present. In the absence of such information, it seems a bit premature to be building models, although perhaps as an explicit proof-in-principle that use-dependent reduction in Nav availability has certain effects might be appropriate. But in such a case, the explicit tests of adding back Nav currents with and without LTI would have seemed the minimum necessary.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>A number of recent papers have described a molecular basis of the phenomenon of long-term inactivation, a phenomenon by which short depolarizations of a few ms cause a fraction of sodium channels to enter a state from which recovery from inactivation is very slow. However, the functional significance of long-term inactivation has not been explored much. Here, the authors present a nice combination of modeling and experiment (tied together by dynamic clamp experiments) to show long-term inactivation acts as a leaky integrator and that the reduction of sodium channel availability acts as negative feedback element to regulate pacemaking frequency of serotonergic neurons. There are not a lot of new experimental results in the manuscript (mainly the data in Figure 5 showing how firing frequency depends on the level of sodium current availability) and some of the ideas have been touched on previously, but the clear analysis and insightful discussion seemed to me very useful and illuminating.</p><p>The authors propose that long-term inactivation serves as a negative feedback element for regulating pacemaking frequency, but they never try to quantify this effect. This could easily be done by doing the dynamic clamp experiments in Figure 5 using models both with and without long-term-inactivation (i.e., with and without state S13). In fact the point of Figure 5 was to show how pacemaking frequency depends on <italic>G</italic><sub>Na</sub>, so it seemed a little strange that they used the model with S13 in which the feedback element is already present. It would seem more logical to first show the dependence without long-term inactivation and then show the effect of having the negative feedback element from long-term inactivation</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript demonstrates a novel function of sodium channels as cellular computational tools: beyond the well-known spike generator, and less general pacemaking driver functions, it introduces them as leaky integrators, i.e., a sort of a short-term memory device.</p><p>Serotonergic neurons of the raphe keep a memory of their past actions. Recent activity makes neurons less responsive, while recent inactivity makes them more responsive. The manuscript identifies the key element in this mechanism, the peculiar type of inactivation of sodium channels in raphe serotonergic neurons, termed long term inactivation (LTI). Similar to the rapid onset-rapid offset channel block that enables resurgent currents e.g., in cerebellar Purkinje neurons, this form of inactivation depends on certain channel-associated proteins (FHFs); however in this case the onset is fast, but the offset is slower by three orders of magnitude. Fast onset allows the sodium channel population to “remember” each action potential, because at each individual AP ~20% of the available channel population is trapped in LTI state. Slow recovery allows the channel population to “forget” with a time constant of several hundreds of milliseconds, thus ensuring that “memory” is not kept indefinitely.</p><p>The concept described in the manuscript is significant, experimental and computation methods are sound and reliable.</p><p>The manuscript is written in a very clear and concise style, which makes understanding easy. However, a few points should be made more emphatic:</p><p>– An operable mechanism requires a coding (frequency to available fraction) and a decoding (available fraction to frequency) process. At the beginning of the section “Nav channels drive spiking frequency” it should be clearly stated that the coding part is done, and authors start discussing the decoding part.</p><p>– Within the decoding part, there is a positive feedback mechanism that promotes firing: depolarization (over -53 mV) causes activation, activation causes further depolarization, etc., until the whole available population responds. Interestingly, there seems to be another positive feedback mechanism, which however hinders firing: slow depolarization favors closed state inactivation, which depletes available channel population, which slows down depolarization, etc. It would be interesting to discuss the nonlinearity caused by the two competing positive feedback mechanisms.</p><p>– In Figure 6 the controller mechanism of raphe serotonergic neurons is compared to a general controller. As far as I understand, the proportional and integral error correction has its parallel mechanism in the neurons. What about the derivative error correction?</p><p>– When discussing molecular leaky integrators, the recent description of CaMKII as such instrument (Chang et al., 2017) should be reviewed.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Sodium channels implement a molecular leaky integrator that detects action potentials and regulates neuronal firing” for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kenton Swartz (Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor) and the original three reviewers.</p><p>The editor and reviewers think that the manuscript has been improved by the inclusion of new results and revisions to the text. However, the reviewers have identified a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript now makes a more compelling demonstration that LTI, by slowing the recovery of Nav channels from inactivation, slows firing rate and places a limit on possible firing rates. The manuscript provides a well-reasoned presentation of the background information motivating the present work and a balanced discussion of how changes in firing may also be influenced by other conductances whose activation is altered by LTI-dependent changes in AP properties. I have no major concerns about the manuscript, but list several issues upon which the authors may want to provide additional comment.</p><p>1) The general ratio of 80% fast recovery and 20% slow recovery argues that the rate of entry into standard fast recovery states is 4-fold faster than rate of entry into slow pathways, consistent with the rates in source data for Figure 3. Is this fast inactivation/LTI ratio similar to what is observed in other reports of LTI? For example, although the literature on FGFs does not generally use protocols that allow clear determination of fast and slow recovery, there do seem to be cases where the slow component of recovery is much more substantial than described here, implying that the rates of onset of fast inactivation and LTI are more comparable (perhaps Figure 3 in Laezza et al., 2009). Although the present paper does not address it, some cautionary remarks pertinent to factors that might impact on the ratio of tauf vs. tauLTI might be warranted in the Discussion. The present analysis assumes that all Nav channels are identical in these cells, in terms of molecular and functional properties of the underlying LTI process. Although there is no data here (or elsewhere about which this reader is aware) that addresses this, the 80%:20% ratio could arise from other factors, e.g., some channels containing a component necessary for LTI and other channels lacking it. That does not negate the principle point of the paper, which is the consequences of LTI. In fact, the relative importance of LTI would likely be greater in cells for which the fraction of slow recovery is greater.</p><p>2) Figure 5. The impact of including LTI is somewhat disappointingly small. In fact, by the measures shown here, the firing differences between inclusion of LTI or its absence would essentially be impossible to distinguishable by an observer asked to say whether a given firing behavior was consistent with the presence of LTI or not.</p><p>If one compares AP properties, peak, duration, and so on, are there differences between the LTI and non-LTI cases that might suggest that other conductances are also coming into play? In Figure 5B, the errors appear to SEM. Seems a bit surprising that anything less than 0.05 was actually obtained, when comparing the two cases.</p><p>Figure 5 should probably specific in the legend which raphe neurons were being used, and the same in Figure 6.</p><p>3) In Figure 6, shouldn't the plot in D at least up to 20 pA more closely parallel Figure 5B? In Figure 5B, the LTI and non-LTI are converged at 20 pA while in Figure 6 they are moving apart. Any explanations for this? It isn't clear why the differences in protocols would produce this, or is it simply variation among sets of cells?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The addition of the modeling with and without LTI in Figure 5 and 6 fills the obvious gap in the manuscript, and I thought the revised manuscript makes an important contribution by nicely illustrating the functional role of LTI in these neurons.</p><p>I found it very difficult to understand the new paragraph four of the Discussion, particularly the statement “Lowering the firing frequency would extend the time spent by Nav channels above -80 mV, which would enhance closed-state inactivation.” This seems impossible to interpret without knowing why and how firing frequency is lowered. And it seems counter-intuitive as a general statement because in general a slow-firing cell would seem to spend less time not more at depolarized voltages. I guess the authors are specifically thinking of a cell where firing is slower because of a more depolarized spike threshold. At the least, the authors need to make this section easier to understand. Even if it were made clearer, I was not convinced it conveys an idea that is important to the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>All concerns of the reviewers have been adequately addressed.</p><p>In Figure 5, I would include both LTI and non-LTI data in panels A and C as well.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54940.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

As explained in the beginning of this document, we have now added the comparison between LTI and non-LTI models, showing how they differentially alter firing.</p><p>As far as models, we completely agree that a study should offer hard proof that models are well constrained by data. We therefore understand the reviewer's skepticism, but we think it may stem from a misunderstanding: the LTI Nav model used in this study is in fact very much grounded in experimental data, being originally formulated in the Milescu et al., 2010 paper (referenced multiple times throughout the manuscript). There, we derived a Nav state model from a comprehensive collection of data that covered steady-state properties (activation and inactivation), as well as kinetic properties (time course of activation and inactivation, slow inactivation, recovery from inactivation, closed state inactivation, entry into LTI, use-dependence, etc.), all at multiple voltages and time scales (tens of microseconds to seconds). The model was then tested in ventral raphé neurons through a series of dynamic clamp experiments and verified that it is capable of producing spiking with properties very similar to what the endogenous sodium current produces. For modeling, we used the constraining algorithms developed by L.M. and implemented in the QuB software (Navarro et al. and Salari et al., 2018). For dynamic clamp, we also used the algorithms developed in QuB (Milescu et al., 2008). Overall, we think the model is really well constrained and we used it in this study.</p><p>We clarified these points in the manuscript (subsection “Mechanistic consequences of long-term inactivation”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors' strong preference for a variety of metaphors (whether studying for an exam or home furnaces) to explain the phenomenology seems to brush aside the essential and long-understood point that use-dependent changes in conductances (whether reflecting intrinsic properties of channels, or slow modulatory changes in channels) are major contributors to regulation of cell excitability, whether it is M-current, SK current, or, as implied here, Nav inactivation. Why is “leaky integrator” a useful concept either for explaining the phenomenology to readers or for enabling understanding of the physiological role of long-term inactivation? This is not clear to this reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We had no intention of brushing aside what is already known about ion channels as regulators of cellular excitability, which is a vast field, but our study is focused on sodium channels and thus most of our references cover this area. The revised manuscript includes additional references in the Discussion.</p><p>As far as metaphors, we tried to write the manuscript for the broad audience of <italic>eLife</italic>, and we think that metaphors, analogies, and examples help. Indeed, to explain how the controller works, we used the home furnace as something most everyone is familiar with and can immediately grasp. Nevertheless, in addition to metaphors, we also explained – mechanistically – the role of Nav channels as a controller of excitability, making the following points: (i) Nav LTI quantitatively approximates a leaky integrator; (ii) a leaky integrator can convert frequency into amplitude, thus Nav channels can “measure” the firing rate; (iii) the effectively available Nav conductance can directly influence spiking frequency; (iv) through these two reciprocal relationships (ii and iii), Nav channels act as a controller, not alone but in synergy with other cellular mechanisms that altogether appear to maintain a low firing rate against excitatory input. This mechanism has been tested directly, by comparing – in the same cell – the effects of LTI and non-LTI models. We hope these points are now clearer in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We think that “use-dependence” merely describes the observed phenomenology, whereas “leaky integration” actually explains the underlying mechanism in a mathematical and computational sense, and having a mechanism is a prerequisite for making quantitative predictions. We find it fascinating that an ion channel, through this simple interaction with auxiliary factors, implements such a powerful and ubiquitous computational operation, and this is what drives this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The structure of the paper also seemed a bit problematic. The paper seems to jump back and forth between data and model predictions and at times it seemed confusing whether the authors were discussing data or model behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that the revised manuscript addresses this concern. If not, we would be grateful if the reviewer could give us more concrete examples, and we would be happy to make further changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Despite extensive use of a particular model, there is little in the paper to indicate how data constrain different potential models for the two pathways of inactivation, and there is little to address the extent to which the authors' preferred model is really constrained by data.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the above discussion on how well the model is constrained by data. Please also note that the same conceptual model, with one non-conducting state off the open state, has been arrived at by other investigators. As with any aspect of a channel mechanism, it is very likely that the real kinetic scheme is more complex, but our model does a reasonable job at capturing the data, particularly considering the mix of fast and slow time scales that make the acquisition of good data quite difficult. Also, the model aligns reasonably well with biophysical and structural data for Nav channels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue is that the available data do not seem adequate to really discern the extent to LTI may or may not occur from closed states. This seems particularly problematic when the authors point out in subsection “Nav channels drive spiking frequency” that some of the differences seen in Figure 5 may arise from more closed-state inactivation, which is really poorly defined for both LTI or normal fast inactivation.</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous study (Milescu et al., 2010) addresses in extenso the properties of the model, including closed-state inactivation (q.v. Figure 2D). In principle, LTI is open-state block and shouldn't occur from closed states. However, we agree with the reviewer that the existence of closed-state LTI has not been extensively investigated, by us or others. Nevertheless, even if there were some closed-state LTI, the phenomenology described in Figures 1 and 2 in our manuscript remains valid and Nav channels would still be described as a leaky integrator.</p><p>As far as what we wrote, we tried to explain why the peak INa is disproportionately smaller when spiking is slower, which is probably a result of closed-state inactivation (regular, not LTI). In contrast, there is less time for closed state inactivation at higher frequencies, although the voltage envelope slightly increases and drives more channels into inactivation, as predicted by the steady-state inactivation properties (the channel closed-state inactivates above -80 mV).</p><p>We added a new paragraph in Discussion (paragraph four) that elaborates on the positive feedback created by closed-state inactivation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5. This is potentially the most interesting and exciting aspect of the paper, but as noted above no attempt to really exploit the advantages of manipulations of the Nav model in dynamic clamp were done.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your encouraging comment. We understand and have added the requested experiment. The new results are, indeed, exciting</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, in regards to AP firing during a dynamic clamp experiment, changes in Nav density may also change AP duration, or peak amplitude such that there may be activity dependent changes in Cav currents or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent currents, which may also impact on the firing properties. The result in Figure 5 is not sufficient on its own to assert that the changes with current density exclusively reflect Nav current. That may be the case, but other factors may also contribute.</p></disp-quote><p>An excellent observation, and we already wrote in the initial submission that Nav channels may alter the firing not just directly, as a source of depolarizing current in the interspike interval, but also indirectly, by altering the shape of the AP and the ensuing currents that in turn change frequency. Whether the effects are direct or indirect, they are nonetheless caused by manipulating <italic>G</italic><sub>Na</sub>, as shown in Figure 5. Understanding how other currents are involved would, of course, be very interesting but outside the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As the authors mention, there is also the issue of what Nav currents are present in the raphe neurons and what FHFs may be present. In the absence of such information, it seems a bit premature to be building models, although perhaps as an explicit proof-in-principle that use-dependent reduction in Nav availability has certain effects might be appropriate. But in such a case, the explicit tests of adding back Nav currents with and without LTI would have seemed the minimum necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to know the identity of these molecular players in raphé neurons, but to fully understand the functional interactions would be a project in itself. The Venkatesan et al. reference suggested by the 2nd reviewer is a good example in this sense. Moreover, as the reviewer points out, the validity of the model and the proposed mechanism would not change once this information becomes available. Whether we know the type of FHF and the type of Nav, the Nav kinetic model would be obtained in exactly the same way, from the same data. A classical and very relevant example is the resurgent current, which was discovered and modeled (Raman and Bean, 1997) before its molecular identity was understood (Grieco et al., 2005).</p><p>We have now done those tests with LTI and non-LTI models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>The authors propose that long-term inactivation serves as a negative feedback element for regulating pacemaking frequency, but they never try to quantify this effect. This could easily be done by doing the dynamic clamp experiments in Figure 5 using models both with and without long-term-inactivation (i.e., with and without state S13). In fact the point of Figure 5 was to show how pacemaking frequency depends on G<sub>Na</sub>, so it seemed a little strange that they used the model with S13 in which the feedback element is already present. It would seem more logical to first show the dependence without long-term inactivation and then show the effect of having the negative feedback element from long-term inactivation</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. Yes, it may seem strange that we have not done the comparison LTI vs. non-LTI in the first place, but our intention was to present it in a different paper and focus the present manuscript on the leaky integrator concept, for a broader audience.</p><p>We have now done these experiments and the new data are presented in Figures 5 and 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…].</p><p>The manuscript is written in a very clear and concise style, which makes understanding easy. However, a few points should be made more emphatic:</p><p>– An operable mechanism requires a coding (frequency to available fraction) and a decoding (available fraction to frequency) process. At the beginning of the section “Nav channels drive spiking frequency” it should be clearly stated that the coding part is done, and authors start discussing the decoding part.</p></disp-quote><p>We had already mentioned in the text that Nav channels &quot;encode&quot; frequency, but we liked your suggestion about &quot;coding&quot;/&quot;decoding&quot; and incorporated it in Results (subsection “Nav channels drive spiking frequency”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Within the decoding part, there is a positive feedback mechanism that promotes firing: depolarization (over -53 mV) causes activation, activation causes further depolarization, etc., until the whole available population responds. Interestingly, there seems to be another positive feedback mechanism, which however hinders firing: slow depolarization favors closed state inactivation, which depletes available channel population, which slows down depolarization, etc. It would be interesting to discuss the nonlinearity caused by the two competing positive feedback mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good point and we added a paragraph in the Discussion (paragraph four) where we discuss two additional forms of (positive) feedback: voltage-dependent activation and closed state inactivation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 6 the controller mechanism of raphe serotonergic neurons is compared to a general controller. As far as I understand, the proportional and integral error correction has its parallel mechanism in the neurons. What about the derivative error correction?</p></disp-quote><p>It would be quite interesting if there were a correspondence between each of the three components (P, I, D) of the error correction mechanism in the general controller and a certain aspect of the Nav/neuronal controller. However, the Nav/neuronal controller is an extremely simple physical implementation of the general controller principle, and may not support the full functionality. In fact, the three error correction mechanisms are not all necessary for a controller to work – the proportional correction is sufficient. At the moment, we are not sure what types of correction are implemented through the LTI mechanism, but it's certainly something worth investigating.</p><p>We added a note in the revised manuscript (subsection “Nav channels are a molecular controller that regulates neuronal firing rate”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– When discussing molecular leaky integrators, the recent description of CaMKII as such instrument (Chang et al., 2017) should be reviewed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we added the reference.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The editor and reviewers think that the manuscript has been improved by the inclusion of new results and revisions to the text. However, the reviewers have identified a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript now makes a more compelling demonstration that LTI, by slowing the recovery of Nav channels from inactivation, slows firing rate and places a limit on possible firing rates. The manuscript provides a well-reasoned presentation of the background information motivating the present work and a balanced discussion of how changes in firing may also be influenced by other conductances whose activation is altered by LTI-dependent changes in AP properties. I have no major concerns about the manuscript, but list several issues upon which the authors may want to provide additional comment.</p><p>1) The general ratio of 80% fast recovery and 20% slow recovery argues that the rate of entry into standard fast recovery states is 4-fold faster than rate of entry into slow pathways, consistent with the rates in source data for Figure 3. Is this fast inactivation/LTI ratio similar to what is observed in other reports of LTI? For example, although the literature on FGFs does not generally use protocols that allow clear determination of fast and slow recovery, there do seem to be cases where the slow component of recovery is much more substantial than described here, implying that the rates of onset of fast inactivation and LTI are more comparable (perhaps Figure 3 in Laezza et al., 2009). Although the present paper does not address it, some cautionary remarks pertinent to factors that might impact on the ratio of tauf vs. tauLTI might be warranted in the Discussion. The present analysis assumes that all Nav channels are identical in these cells, in terms of molecular and functional properties of the underlying LTI process. Although there is no data here (or elsewhere about which this reader is aware) that addresses this, the 80%:20% ratio could arise from other factors, e.g., some channels containing a component necessary for LTI and other channels lacking it. That does not negate the principle point of the paper, which is the consequences of LTI. In fact, the relative importance of LTI would likely be greater in cells for which the fraction of slow recovery is greater.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that these matters are important and deserve further investigation. Indeed, we assumed here that Nav channels are identical and they all interact with the putative FHF in such a way as to produce the observed 80%:20% ratio between normal and long-term inactivation. However, as the reviewer notes, it could very well be two (or more) Nav populations, each interacting differently (or not at all) with the FHF.</p><p>We are also not aware of reports in the literature where the slow component of the total current is significantly greater than 20%, in wild-type neurons under physiological conditions. In Figure 3 in Laezza et al. the slow component appears to be &lt;= 20% for all datasets except the data obtained from cells transfected with FGF14-1a.</p><p>Regarding the rates, we are not sure that the ratio of 80%:20% between normal and long-term inactivation components should be interpreted as meaning a ratio of 4:1 between the two corresponding entry time constants. It is possible to have a kinetic model with two exponential components that have similar time constants but different amplitudes, as shown in Figure 3B, where we simulated the time course of entry into normal (P<sub>I</sub>) and long-term (P<sub>S</sub>) inactivation states. As the figure indicates, the two entry time constants are very much similar and both components are complete within 2 ms, yet the state occupancies become 0.8 and 0.2, respectively.</p><p>We added a brief discussion of this (paragraph six, Discussion), including the Laezza et al. reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 5. The impact of including LTI is somewhat disappointingly small. In fact, by the measures shown here, the firing differences between inclusion of LTI or its absence would essentially be impossible to distinguishable by an observer asked to say whether a given firing behavior was consistent with the presence of LTI or not.</p><p>If one compares AP properties, peak, duration, and so on, are there differences between the LTI and non-LTI cases that might suggest that other conductances are also coming into play? In Figure 5B, the errors appear to SEM. Seems a bit surprising that anything less than 0.05 was actually obtained, when comparing the two cases.</p><p>Figure 5 should probably specific in the legend which raphe neurons were being used, and the same in Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>We mentioned in the manuscript that there are other regulatory mechanisms besides LTI in raphe neurons, which in the absence of LTI still produce a good amount of adaptation. See, for example, the decay in frequency visible in Figure 6C, in the black traces obtained with the non-LTI model. Thus, the results of swapping LTI and non-LTI Nav models in the same cell are to some extent masked by these other mechanisms. If a cell had no other adaptation mechanism besides Nav LTI, the contrast between LTI and non-LTI models would be greater. Clearly, these neurons are trying hard to resist depolarizing input. Due to these other (Nav-unrelated) mechanisms, one would probably not be able to infer the presence of LTI in a cell from observing the adaptation in frequency alone. However, it has been shown in a previous study (Milescu et al., 2010) that there is a significant difference in how the AP shape changes in response to sustained depolarizations: with the LTI model, the AP broadens on both sides, whereas with the non-LTI model the AP broadens only on the downward side (Figure 7B in that paper).</p><p>We expanded the explanation at the end of subsection “Firing rate is lower in the presence of LTI”.</p><p>The test comparing the two data sets (non-LTI vs LTI) gives P~0.04, which is not too far from 0.05.</p><p>DR neurons were only tested for the presence of LTI. All the other experiments were done in RO neurons. We updated figure legends (where applicable) to include information on neuronal type and preparation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 6, shouldn't the plot in D at least up to 20 pA more closely parallel Figure 5B? In Figure 5B, the LTI and non-LTI are converged at 20 pA while in Figure 6 they are moving apart. Any explanations for this? It isn't clear why the differences in protocols would produce this, or is it simply variation among sets of cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Figures 5B and 6D show different types of data: f vs <italic>G</italic><sub>Na</sub> in Figure 5B, obtained without stimulation (I<sub>Inj</sub> = 0) and approaching convergence at 20 nS/pF (not 20 pA), and f vs I<sub>Inj</sub> in Figure 6D, obtained with stimulation (I<sub>Inj</sub> = 0…40 pA) and with <italic>G</italic><sub>Na</sub> = 10 or 15 nS/pF.</p><p>The only data points that can be compared between the two figures are:</p><p>– in Figure 5B: for G<sub>Na</sub> = 10 nS/pF and I<sub>Inj</sub> = 0, f ~4.7 ± 0.72 for LTI (black symbols) and f ~5.9 ± 0.72 for non-LTI (grey symbols);</p><p>– in Figure 6D: for I<sub>Inj</sub> = 0 and G<sub>Na</sub> = 10 nS/pF, f ~4.5 ± 0.4 for LTI (red symbols) and f ~5.3 ± 0.45 for non-LTI (black symbols).</p><p>The two sets of data presented in Figures 5 and 6 were obtained with different protocols and in different cells, hence the data points mentioned above are statistically comparable but not identical.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The addition of the modeling with and without LTI in Figure 5 and 6 fills the obvious gap in the manuscript, and I thought the revised manuscript makes an important contribution by nicely illustrating the functional role of LTI in these neurons.</p><p>I found it very difficult to understand the new paragraph four of the Discussion, particularly the statement “Lowering the firing frequency would extend the time spent by Nav channels above -80 mV, which would enhance closed-state inactivation.” This seems impossible to interpret without knowing why and how firing frequency is lowered. And it seems counter-intuitive as a general statement because in general a slow-firing cell would seem to spend less time not more at depolarized voltages. I guess the authors are specifically thinking of a cell where firing is slower because of a more depolarized spike threshold. At the least, the authors need to make this section easier to understand. Even if it were made clearer, I was not convinced it conveys an idea that is important to the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The other two reviewers suggested in the first submission that we comment on closed-state inactivation.
