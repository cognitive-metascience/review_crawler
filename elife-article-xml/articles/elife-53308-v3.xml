electro-chemical signals by mechanically activated ion channels. We describe here the presence of mechanically activated currents in melanoma cells that are dependent on TMEM87a, which we have renamed Elkin1. Heterologous expression of this protein in PIEZO1-deficient cells, that exhibit no baseline mechanosensitivity, is sufficient to reconstitute mechanically activated currents. Melanoma cells lacking functional Elkin1 exhibit defective mechanoelectrical transduction, decreased motility and increased dissociation from organotypic spheroids. By analysing cell adhesion properties, we demonstrate that Elkin1 deletion is associated with increased cell-substrate adhesion and decreased homotypic cell-cell adhesion strength. We therefore conclude that Elkin1 supports a PIEZO1-independent mechanoelectrical transduction pathway and modulates cellular adhesions and regulates melanoma cell migration and cell-cell interactions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>When cells receive signals about their surrounding environment, this initiates a chain of signals which generate a response. Some of these signalling pathways allow cells to sense physical and mechanical forces via a process called mechanotransduction. There are different types of mechanotransduction. In one pathway, mechanical forces open up specialized channels on the cell surface which allow charged particles to move across the membrane and create an electrical current.</p><p>Mechanoelectrical transduction plays an important role in the spread of cancer: as cancer cells move away from a tumour they use these signalling pathways to find their way between cells and move into other parts of the body. Understanding these pathways could reveal ways to stop cancer from spreading, making it easier to treat. However, it remains unclear which molecules regulate mechanoelectrical transduction in cancer cells.</p><p>Now, Patkunarajah, Stear et al. have studied whether mechanoelectrical transduction is involved in the migration of skin cancer cells. To study mechanoelectrical transduction, a fine mechanical input was applied to the skin cancer cells whilst measuring the flow of charged molecules moving across the membrane. This experiment revealed that a previously unknown protein named Elkin1 is required to convert mechanical forces into electrical currents. Deleting this newly found protein caused skin cancer cells to move more slowly and dissociate more easily from tumour-like clusters of cells.</p><p>These findings suggest that Elkin1 is part of a newly identified mechanotransduction pathway that allows cells to sense mechanical forces from their surrounding environment. More work is needed to determine what role Elkin1 plays in mechanoelectrical transduction and whether other proteins are also involved. This could lead to new approaches that prevent cancer cells from dissociating from tumours and spreading to other body parts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mechanically activated ion channels</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>melanoma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1138595</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinac</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name><name><surname>Biro</surname><given-names>Maté</given-names></name><name><surname>Poole</surname><given-names>Kate</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB958, A09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lewin</surname><given-names>Gary R</given-names></name><name><surname>Poole</surname><given-names>Kate</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1135974</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinac</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB958, Z03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eravci</surname><given-names>Murat</given-names></name><name><surname>Weise</surname><given-names>Christoph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Humboldt Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moroni</surname><given-names>Mirko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Delbruck Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cecile Vogt Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poole</surname><given-names>Kate</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Education, Australian Government</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RTP scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patkunarajah</surname><given-names>Amrutha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel mechanoelectrical transduction pathway can regulate the interactions of melanoma cells and their surrounding microenvironment, impacting both migration and cell dissociation from organotypic spheroids.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells sense and respond to their physical surroundings by converting mechanical inputs into biochemical signals, a process referred to as mechanotransduction. The most rapid mode of mechanotransduction is mediated by mechanically activated (MA) ion channels that are activated within milliseconds of a stimulus, resulting in a localised flow of ions across the plasma membrane, thus converting physical stimuli into electrical signals. The discovery of the mammalian MA channels, PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coste et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coste et al., 2010</xref>), has highlighted the diverse array of cells and tissues that express such ionotropic force sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albuisson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Florez-Paz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maksimovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyamoto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rocio Servin-Vences et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). The activation of these channels by externally applied mechanical stimuli underpins our senses of touch, proprioception and hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Florez-Paz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maksimovic et al., 2014</xref>), and contributes to the physiological function of mechanoresponsive tissues such as the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2014</xref>), the urothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyamoto et al., 2014</xref>) and the cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rocio Servin-Vences et al., 2017</xref>). Recent evidence has suggested that PIEZO1 is not only activated by exogenously applied forces but can also be activated by cell-generated forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blumenthal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellefsen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nourse and Pathak, 2017</xref>). Thus, MA channels may be involved in inside-out mechanical signalling and contribute to the ability of cells to probe the physical nature of their microenvironment. Because PIEZO channels do not account for all mammalian MA channel activity, identifying additional MA channels and characterising their function represent important outstanding challenges in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Inside-out mechanical signalling has been implicated in the development and metastasis of cancers. The stiffening of the local microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kai et al., 2016</xref>), changes in cell packing and cell-cell adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cichon et al., 2015</xref>) and the tumour topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2016a</xref>) have all been shown to impact tumourigenicity or invasiveness. In the case of melanoma, cancer progression/transformation is directly linked to mechanical changes at a cellular level: cells become more compliant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jonas et al., 2011</xref>), exhibit increased contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paszek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanz-Moreno et al., 2011</xref>) and display altered morphology during transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poole and Müller, 2005</xref>). During the process of metastasis, cells must break away from the primary tumour and navigate microenvironments with diverse physical properties including: confined pores in the ECM, the planar interface of the basement membrane, or tracks and channels formed from ECM fibres or the earlier passage of cancerous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wolf et al., 2009</xref>). Given the mechanical changes during melanoma development and metastasis it is important to characterise mechanotransduction molecules in these cells, including MA ion channels.</p><p>We report the identification of MA ion channel activity at the cell-substrate interface in WM266-4 metastatic melanoma cells, using elastomeric pillar arrays to apply fine mechanical stimuli to cells via their connections to the subjacent matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poole et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sianati et al., 2019</xref>), thus simulating deflections arising from cell-generated forces. Simultaneous recordings using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology allowed us to directly measure the resulting MA currents. We have identified a crucial molecule (TMEM87a) required for this channel activity and have renamed this polypeptide Elkin1, from the Greek word Elko, meaning ‘to pull’. The deletion of <italic>Elkin1</italic> resulted in altered cell migration and increased interaction forces between melanoma cells and laminin 511 (LM511), a functionally important extracellular matrix (ECM) molecule. In addition, <italic>Elkin1</italic> deletion modulated cell-cell interactions, leading to facilitated dissociation of Elkin1-KO cells from organotypic spheroids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Measuring mechanically activated ion currents in melanoma cells</title><p>To establish whether melanoma cells exhibit MA channel activity, metastatic WM266-4 melanoma cells (originally isolated from a secondary tumour) were cultured on uncoated pillar arrays made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Mechanical stimuli were applied directly to cell-substrate contact points by physically deflecting a single pilus subjacent to the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) and the electrical response of the cell was monitored using whole-cell patch-clamp. Deflection-activated currents were measured in all WM266-4 cells (10/10) and the current amplitude increased with increasing stimulus size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Variable inactivation kinetics were measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), as also previously demonstrated for PIEZO1-mediated currents activated by substrate deflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poole et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sianati et al., 2019</xref>). The reversal potential, as determined from a current-voltage relationship for the peak MA current, was +6.6 mV, indicating that the underlying current was passed by a non-selective cation channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Stimulus-response plots were generated by calculating the precise pillar deflection for each applied stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We additionally tested whether MA currents were activated in WM115 melanoma cells (isolated from the primary tumour from the same patient as WM266-4). Larger deflections were required to activate currents in WM115 cells, compared to WM266-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data demonstrate that displacements at the interface between melanoma cells and their substrate evoke MA currents.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Measuring MA currents in WM266-4 melanoma cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of pillar array experiment.

We first confirmed that LM511 promotes increased migration of WM266-4 cells using transwell assays, compared to other LM isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We then repeated the analysis of MA channel activity in WM266-4 cells cultured on pillar arrays coated with LM511 and noted that current kinetics were unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). However, MA currents were more sensitive when evoked in WM266-4 cells attached to LM511 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Under these conditions, current saturation occurred within the stimulus range, allowing us to use a Boltzmann sigmoidal fit to determine the MA current sensitivity. Half-maximal activation of MA currents was seen with approximately 18 nm of substrate deflection (Effective deflection ED50; standard error = 20.5 nm). These data indicate a correlation between migratory properties and the MA current sensitivity to deflections applied at cell-substrate contact points. The robust MA current activation observed in cells cultured on LM511 also provided an excellent system to investigate the molecules required for this mechanoelectrical transduction.</p><p>PIEZO1 is an obvious candidate for mediating this activity, in particular because the biophysical characteristics of the observed deflection-activated currents are consistent with those previously described for this channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poole et al., 2014</xref>). To directly test if PIEZO1 mediates the MA current in WM266-4 cells, we knocked down <italic>PIEZO1</italic> expression and examined whether these currents were still detectable. In <italic>PIEZO1</italic> knock-down cells cultured on LM511-coated pillar arrays, MA currents were activated in response to pillar deflection in 10/10 cells measured and the resulting stimulus-response curves were similar to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, treatment with Ruthenium Red (RR, a channel blocker that inhibits PIEZO1 and TRP channels) did not inhibit these MA currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To examine how Elkin1 mediates the unconfined migration of individual cells on a 2D surface, we plated cells on dishes coated with LM511, and observed their movement using phase-contrast and epi-fluorescent microscopy. A representation of the migration tracks shows that the WT clones migrated further over the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

The sensitivity of MA currents found in melanoma cells grown on LM511 was comparable to those found in the sensitive mechanoreceptors of the dorsal root ganglia required for fine touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poole et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, these molecular-scale pillar movements lie within the range of matrix displacements that arise due to cells pulling on their surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Legant et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Legant et al., 2010</xref>). In WM266-4 melanoma cells these deflection-activated currents were dependent on the Elkin1 protein. Elkin1 contains a LUSTR (Lung Seven Transmembrane) domain, which defines a family of proteins of as yet unknown function found in plants and animals, but not bacteria, archaea or viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Edgar, 2007</xref>). This LUSTR family also includes TMEM87b, a protein that shares 48% homology with <italic>hs</italic>Elkin1-isoform1. There is limited information regarding the physiological function of Elkin1, however the gene is expressed in diverse human tissues including organs where mechanical feedback is important, such as the lungs and the bladder (GTEx portal). Elkin1 was previously suggested to be a Golgi-associated protein that, when overexpressed, partially rescued a VPS54-KO endosome to trans-Golgi network (TGN) retrograde transport phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hirata et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, we found that a fraction of both <italic>hs</italic>Elkin1-iso1 and -iso3 is localised to the plasma membrane, with <italic>hs</italic>Elkin1-iso1 also present within the Golgi. Elkin1 has also been demonstrated to be amongst the fraction of cell surface proteins that undergo N-linked glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2018</xref>), further supporting our data. Given that <italic>Elkin1</italic> knockdown did not inhibit endosome to TGN retrograde signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hirata et al., 2015</xref>), but did ablate MA channel activity (shown here), we propose that Elkin1 is an essential component of a novel mechanoelectrical transduction pathway.</p><p>In support of this model, heterologous expression of Elkin1 was associated with the appearance of MA currents activated by substrate deflections in two cell lines in which <italic>Piezo1</italic> was deleted. The latency between stimulus and response (&lt;2 ms) and the activation time constant (&lt;1 ms) were similar to those reported for PIEZO1-mediated currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poole et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rocio Servin-Vences et al., 2017</xref>) and sufficiently rapid to suggest that the Elkin1-dependent current is directly activated by the mechanical stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christensen and Corey, 2007</xref>). In addition, none of the other MA non-selective cation channels (PIEZO2, TRPV4) were detected in WM266-4 cells, suggesting that Elkin1 either mediates these MA currents or modulates an unidentified MA channel. These data definitively demonstrate that Elkin1 is required for a novel, PIEZO1-independent mechanoelectrical transduction pathway. Mutation of a single residue in a predicted TM helix and of a single residue in a predicted intracellular loop led to a marked reduction in MA channel activity, without a concomitant reduction in surface localisation of the protein. Taken together these data indicate that Elkin1 exhibits several hallmarks of a novel MA channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christensen and Corey, 2007</xref>). However, it is possible that Elkin1 is an accessory molecule that modulates the activation of an, as yet uncharacterised, MA channel or an ion channel that requires additional proteinaceous tethers in order to be activated by mechanical inputs. Future studies with purified protein will be required to definitively test the hypothesis that Elkin1 is an ion channel activated by mechanical inputs.</p><p>In HEK-293T P1KO cells, human Elkin1 isoform1 and 3 were associated with a current activated by substrate deflection. Expression of mouse Elkin1 in the HEK293T P1KO cells was also associated with the <italic>de novo</italic> appearance of deflection activated currents, though these currents were of smaller amplitude. Channel activity could also be evoked by indentation (however, maximal currents were smaller than reported for the PIEZOs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coste et al., 2010</xref>]) but not by membrane stretch applied using HSPC. This mechanical response profile is distinct to other MA ion channels: PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 respond to membrane stretch, cell indentation and substrate deflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poole et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rocio Servin-Vences et al., 2017</xref>) (though PIEZO2 is less sensitive to membrane stretch than PIEZO1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2019</xref>]) and TRPV4 responds only to substrate deflections in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rocio Servin-Vences et al., 2017</xref>). These data suggest that the expression of distinct MA channels allows cells to distinguish between stimuli arising from cell-generated forces at cell-substrate contacts <italic>versus</italic> exogenous stimuli that stretch the membrane or compress the cell. Such differential activation profiles may reflect multiple roles for distinct MA channels during tumour development and metastasis.</p><p>During metastasis, cells first dissociate from the primary tumour and then, as they migrate through the body, the cells encounter environments of differing dimensionality and degree of confinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Helvert et al., 2018</xref>). Disruption of <italic>Elkin1</italic> expression altered the confined and unconfined migration of cells in <italic>quasi-</italic>1D and 2D environments. Our results stand in contrast with the effect of PIEZO1 on melanoma cell migration: PIEZO1 knockdown reduced the speed of cell migration in confined environments, but had no effect on unconfined cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hung et al., 2016</xref>). In other tumours, PIEZO2 knockdown in a breast cancer cell line (BrM2), inhibited the cells’ ability to enter confined spaces, but did not influence the speed of migration of the confined cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pardo-Pastor et al., 2018</xref>). These data suggest that distinct MA channels mediate separate mechanical transduction pathways regulating different aspects of tumour cell migration.</p><p>In addition to the Elkin1-dependent changes in migration, we report that Elkin1-KO cells exhibited increased dissociation from organotypic spheroids embedded in collagen gels. The process of cell dissociation from a spheroid mass is defined by a complex interplay between the strength of cell-cell adhesions, the contractility of the cells at the edge of the spheroid and the physical characteristics of the surrounding matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmadzadeh et al., 2017</xref>). Our data demonstrate that Elkin1 expression regulates cell-substrate and cell-cell binding forces. In addition, the partitioning of cells within the organotypic spheroids was dependent on Elkin1. We therefore propose that Elkin1-dependent expression regulates the balance between cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion; ablation of the protein increases invasion of surrounding matrix (by reducing cell-cell adhesions and facilitating cellular dissociation) and slows migration (by increasing cell-substrate binding). Previous studies of the role of TRPV4 in breast cancer development have demonstrated that overexpression of TRPV4 can lead to a decrease in E-cadherin expression, driving EMT in this cancer type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). This TRPV4-dependent switch in E-cadherin expression may also lead to increased dissociation from the tumour mass. However, in contrast to Elkin1, increased levels of TRPV4 lead to an increase, rather than a decrease in cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). A similar phenomenon (decreased cell-cell binding forces, facilitated dissociation from organotypic spheroids and decreased cell migration) has been reported in melanoma cells overexpressing the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger, NheI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hofschröer et al., 2017</xref>). This exchanger locally modulates the pH of the cellular environment and is not known to be mechanically responsive.</p><p>Given that Elkin1 is required for MA currents that are separable from the PIEZO channels and that Elkin1-dependent currents are activated at the cell-substrate interface, these channels may transduce distinct mechanical inputs. The PIEZOs may be acting to sense confinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pardo-Pastor et al., 2018</xref>) and the overall mechanical status of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rocio Servin-Vences et al., 2017</xref>), while Elkin1-dependent mechanoelectrical transduction may encode information about the mechanical nature of the cells’ microenvironment thus facilitating modulation of cell-cell <italic>versus</italic> cell-substrate binding. Such integration of multiple mechanoelectrical transduction pathways could engender cells with a tuneable and diverse repertoire of mechanical sensing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Please refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>: Key Resources table for details of resources used and created for this study.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>All melanoma cell lines (WM266-4, WM115, and A375) were obtained from the ATCC and cultured in complete Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEME) or High Glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin.

The virus was produced in HEK-293T cells following PEI transfection of the lentiviral backbone together with packaging plasmid (psPAX2) and the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) envelope. To create cell lines with stably-integrated DNA for spheroid rescue experiments, plasmids encoding Elkin1 and GFP were linearised using ScaI. Linearised DNA was transfected into WM266-4 3C6 (Elkin1 KO clone) using Fugene (as above).

All cultures were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for the duration of the experiment. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss 880 equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 NA Oil DIC M27 objective and an Airyscan detector. TIRF imaging was performed using the Zeiss Elyra system fitted with a Plan-Apochromat 100×/1.46 NA Oil objective and an Andor iXon 897 EMCCD camera. In both cases, samples were illuminated using 488 nm, 561 nm or 633 nm lasers, and all data was collected using the Zen software (Zeiss).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>3D dissociated cell migration assay</title><p>To assay individual cells in collagen gels, a cell suspension (1.25 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in complete media) was mixed with 1.5 mg/mL rat tail Collagen I (total volume 100 µL) and gelated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 15 min. Isolated cells in collagen gels were imaged using a Leica SP8 DLS fitted with a 10x/0.4 NA objective every 10 min for 14 hr. All cultures were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Organotypic spheroid assay</title><p>Both WT and Elkin1-KO clones were virally transduced with a construct encoding eGFP to enable visualisation of cells. For spheroid formation, 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells were seeded onto Ultra-low attachment 96-well plates (Corning, USA) in complete MEME media and formed spheroids following 72 hr of incubation. Composite spheroids were created by mixing 5 × 10<sup>2</sup> of each cell-type to give 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells total. Collagen gel mixtures were made from 1.5 mg/mL – 2 mg/mL rat tail Collagen I (Corning, USA) in 10 mM NaOH, 1 × PBS and complete media on ice. A base collagen gel was formed in each well of a glass-bottom 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-one, Austria) by incubating 30 µL of the collagen mixture at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 6 min. The collagen gel mixture containing the spheroid was then applied to the base gel and underwent gelation at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 15 min. Cells in collagen gels were cultured under 200 µL of complete media. Spheroids and invasive cells were imaged at 24, 48, 72 hr using a Leica SP8 DLS fitted with a 10x/0.4 NA objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Analysis of cells in collagen gels</title><p>Imaris 9.1.2 software (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland) was used to segment cells by creating surfaces with a filter of 200 μm<sup>3</sup> to discard cell debris. For organotypic spheroid assay analysis, cell surfaces were filtered by centre of image mass <italic>versus</italic> z depth, where the z value was determined by orientating the 3D image stacks to the plane of view showing the cells on the glass and cells attached to the glass were excluded from analysis. Cells from the 3D dissociated cell migration assay were tracked using autoregressive motion, applying a threshold of 1500s to filter track duration. Intensity, morphological and tracking data were then exported and further analysed using GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Immunoblotting and cell-surface biotinylation</title><p>To detect Elkin1 variants at the plasma membrane, the cell surface fraction was biotinylated and subsequently isolated following established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tarradas et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, HEK-293T P1KO cells attached to PLL-coated culture dishes were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-tagged Elkin1 variants. After 24 hr the cell surface fraction was labelled, on ice, with freshly prepared 2.5 mg/ml EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin (21338, ThermoFisher Scientific) in DPBS containing Ca<sup>++</sup>. After quenching with 100 mM glycine, cells were lysed as above using RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail. A portion of this lysed sample was reserved as the ‘input’ sample. The biotinylated fraction was then isolated using NeutrAvidin Ultralink Resin (53150, ThermoFisher Scientific). After recovery from the NeutrAvidin beads, samples were prepared as for gel electrophoresis by mixing with Bolt LDS sample buffer and Bolt reducing agent (B0007 and B0009 respectively, ThermoFisher Scientific). Samples were separated on a 10% Bolt Bis-Tris Plus gel (NW00102BOX, ThermoFisher Scientific), transferred to a PVDF membrane and subjected to standard antibody detection. GFP-fusion proteins were detected using rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (SAB4301138, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:1000) and HRP-linked anti-rabbit IgG (7074, Cell Signaling Technologies, 1:1000).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>AFM analysis of cell binding forces</title><p>AFM analysis of cell-binding forces was conducted using a JPK Nanowizard, fitted with a CellHesion module (JPK Instruments AG). To measure cell-LM511 interaction forces, cantilevers (MLCT-O10, Bruker) were first activated using oxygen plasma generated using a low-pressure Zepto plasma system (Diener, Germany) and then incubated in a droplet of LM511 (20 µg/ml) for 1 hr. To measure cell-cell interaction forces, cantilevers were coated with wheat germ agglutinin (L4895, Sigma Aldrich). Before collecting data, the sensitivity and spring constant of each cantilever was determined using in-built routines in the JPK software. To measure cell-LM511 binding forces, the following settings were used: speed 2 µm/sec, set point 500 pN, with contact times of 2 s held at constant height. At least five force-distance curves were collected from at least 10 cells per condition (multiple force-distance curves were not collected successively on each cell to minimise adaptive changes). To measure cell-cell binding forces the CellHesion module was used to move the stage through an extended 100 µm pulling range. To attach a cell to the cantilever, cells in suspension were added to a sample dish containing adherent cells, the calibrated cantilever was positioned over an unattached cell and carefully brought into contact. After 10 s attachment time the cantilever was slowly withdrawn from the surface, with a single cell attached. To collect data the cantilever was positioned over an adherent cell and data collected with the following parameters: speed 5 µm/sec, set point 250 pN, contact time 2 s held at a constant height. At least five force-distance curves were collected from at least 10 different cell-cell interaction pairs. Force-distance curves were analysed to determine the maximum unbinding force during cantilever retraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data were analysed using Prism seven or Prism 8 (GraphPad). Normality was determined with D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus normality test. Normally distributed data were analysed using parametric statistical tests. All <italic>t</italic>-tests were two-tailed and when there were significant differences in the variance, Welch’s correction was used. Data from qPCR experiments and migration assays were analysed using a Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons. Stimulus-response plots were generated by binning data by stimulus size and averaging within bins for each cell, then across cells. Ordinary two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons was used to analyse stimulus-response plots. The transwell migration assay data were normalised against the parental clone and analysed using a parametric one-way ANOVA test with Tukey’s multiple comparisons. Data from organotypic spheroid experiments were averaged for each spheroid and then compared with one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Liana Kosizki, Heike Thrainhart and Feyza Colakoglu for technical assistance and Matt Baker and Efrosini Deligianni for advice on Greek terminology.

This study utilizes electrophysiology and cell biology assays to provide compelling evidence that TMEM87a (renamed Elkin1) is a major component of a PIEZO1 independent mechanotransduction pathway.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;TMEM87a/Elkin1-dependent mechanoelectrical transduction modulates melanoma cell adhesion and migration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jerome Jacques Lacroix (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Stear et al. describe the transmembrane protein Elkin1 as necessary and sufficient to confer mechanically activated currents to otherwise mechanically-insensitive cells. Further, they relate cell adhesion and migration properties to the expression of Elkin1. As such Elkin1 is a strong candidate protein for a novel mechanically-activated ion channel and a regulator of cell adhesion/migration. Overall, the manuscript is very well written and the experiments appear to be performed and analyzed at a high standard. The identification of Elkin1 as a necessary and sufficient protein for mechanotransduction pathway is a significant and novel finding.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim that their findings directly show that Elkin1-dependent mechanically activated current modulates cellular adhesions and regulates cell migration and cellular interactions, however this is vastly overstated and is not supported by any data. The experiments presented here demonstrate that the expression of Elkin1, not the Elkin1-dependent mechanical currents, modulates the cellular phenotypes as none of the experiments are designed to test the effect of current on cellular properties. Below I am listing all specific claims that need correction:</p><p>- The current title of the paper &quot;…mechanoelectrical transduction modulates…&quot; makes this causative connection and needs to be changed.</p><p>- Abstract: &quot;We therefore conclude that Elkin1 supports a Piezo1-independent mechanoelectrical transduction pathway that modulates cellular adhesions…&quot;. The authors should replace the word &quot;that&quot;, which incorrectly implicates causation, with &quot;and&quot;.</p><p>- Discussion section: &quot;Elkin-1 dependent MA currents altered the confined and confined migration…&quot;. The experimental design is to alter the expression pattern of Elkin1, not the MA currents, and test for changes in cellular migration. The authors should rephrase.</p><p>- Discussion section: &quot;Our data demonstrate that Elkin1 activity regulates cell-substrate….&quot; Again, the experiment does not allow this conclusion. The word &quot;activity&quot; should be replaced with &quot;expression&quot;.</p><p>- Discussion section: &quot;We therefore propose that Elkin1-dependent mechanotransduction regulates the balance…&quot; The word &quot;mechanotransduction&quot; should be replaced with &quot;expression&quot;.</p><p>- Discussion section: &quot;To our knowledge, this study represents the first direct demonstration of a role for mechanoelectrical transduction in regulating the physical interactions…&quot;. This statement should be removed entirely.</p><p>- Discussion section: The first two sentences of this paragraph should be removed.</p><p>2) The differences between the mouse and human Elkin1 sequences and the related differences in their electrophysiological activity was used to identify two residues key for the ion channel's function. This is a very interesting finding, but it leaves a question unanswered about the role of the mouse Elkin1 given the lack of robust ionic currents. Can the authors comment on this?</p><p>3) Why do WT and Elkin1-knockout cells separate from each other in the spheroid assay? Is the ion channel activity of the protein important for this effect, or is it related to other aspects of its expression? It would be important to do this assay with cells expressing the L210F or the G231N mutant channels to clarify this issue.</p><p>4) The authors seem to suggest that Elkin1 knockout elicits an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. However, as the authors point out, the WT melanoma cells which express Elkin1 already show some mesenchymal characteristics. Moreover, the KO cells show a propensity for dissociating from the spheroid (consistent with an EMT phenotype), but also slower migration (contradictory to cancer cells that have undergone EMT). Given these ambiguities, it is better to eliminate the data on EMT markers (Figure 8A and subsection “Deletion of Elkin1 changes expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers and modulates cell binding forces”) from the present study.</p><p>5) Hoechst labeling of live cell experiments may compromise cell health, especially over long time-lapse imaging. The authors should include details on live-cell imaging (e.g. interval during images and duration of illumination for each time point) and ideally also confirm the results with cells labeled with a different fluorophore that is gentler on cells, e.g. GFP labeled cells.</p><p>6) The authors conclude that knockdown of Elkin1 in WM266-4 cells results in reduction in MA currents, however in Figure 2A the final data point on the graph is nearly identical between WT and cells treated with Elkin1 miRNA. This supports the idea that Elkin1 may be a modulator of a MA channel and knockdown in Elkin1 expression results in a rightward shift in the sensitivity of the MA currents. The authors should address this possibility and state more clearly within the discussion that the role of Elkin1 in this mechanotransduction pathway is still not known.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53308.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim that their findings directly show that Elkin1-dependent mechanically activated current modulates cellular adhesions and regulates cell migration and cellular interactions, however this is vastly overstated and is not supported by any data.

Can the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>We report here a role for the human Elkin1 in melanoma migration and cellular dissociation. It is important to note that melanoma progression is quite distinct in mice versus humans. In particular, the microenvironment in which primary tumours develop is distinct, with human melanoma arising in the epidermis and mouse largely in the dermis (Sun et al., 2019, Nat. Commun.). As such, the process of cell dissociation and migration from the primary tumour will involve interactions with different microenvironments.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the differences between the mouse and human Elkin1 electrophysiological activity are very interesting. We would like to highlight the fact that expression of the mouse variant (and the human with the mouse residues introduced into the sequence) is still associated with the de novo appearance of mechanically activated currents in cells, though the currents have smaller amplitudes. As such, differences in expression levels or the microenvironment may positively impact <italic>mm</italic>Elkin1-dependent channel activity in situ.</p><p>Given the lack of information about this protein in either organism we have refrained from adding additional speculation about a broader set of functions for Elkin1 outside the cells that we have studied here. We feel that this is justified by the fact that in distinct cells and tissues other MA channels have been shown to exhibit quite different current amplitudes and thresholds depending on a number of factors, including the microenvironment (Bavi et al., 2019, ACS Nano.; Chiang et al., 2011) and the co-expression of modulatory protein partners (Poole et al., 2014; Qi et al., 2015, Nat Commun.; Zhang et al,. 2017).</p><p>The characterisation of the impact of Elkin1 in other cells and tissues in the mouse is beyond the scope of this paper but we are currently generating mutant mice in order to specifically study this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why do WT and Elkin1-knockout cells separate from each other in the spheroid assay? Is the ion channel activity of the protein important for this effect, or is it related to other aspects of its expression? It would be important to do this assay with cells expressing the L210F or the G231N mutant channels to clarify this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and have conducted revision experiments to address this point. Given the time that it takes for the cells to form spheroids (days) this experiment required stably transfected cells. As detailed in the revised Materials and methods, we linearised the relevant plasmids (co-expressing GFP with either Elkin1-iso3 or Elkin1-iso3-L210F) in order to track stable integrants. Linearised plasmid was introduced into one of the Elkin1-KO clones. After 1 week in culture we sorted the population of green cells and re-established the cell population. Chimeric spheroids were then formed with the parental Elkin1 KO clone. We found that those cells expressing the WT version of Elkin1 were more likely to be found in the core of the chimeric spheroid, whereas those expression Eklin1-L210F were not. These data have been added as Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors seem to suggest that Elkin1 knockout elicits an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. However, as the authors point out, the WT melanoma cells which express Elkin1 already show some mesenchymal characteristics. Moreover, the KO cells show a propensity for dissociating from the spheroid (consistent with an EMT phenotype), but also slower migration (contradictory to cancer cells that have undergone EMT). Given these ambiguities, it is better to eliminate the data on EMT markers (Figure 8A and subsection “Deletion of Elkin1 changes expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers and modulates cell binding forces”) from the present study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed these details from the manuscript and additionally deleted the corresponding figure supplement with full blots and adjusted the Materials and methods to remove the corresponding experimental details. We thank the reviewers for the suggestion as we agree that these data introduced ambiguities to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Hoechst labeling of live cell experiments may compromise cell health, especially over long time-lapse imaging. The authors should include details on live-cell imaging (e.g. interval during images and duration of illumination for each time point) and ideally also confirm the results with cells labeled with a different fluorophore that is gentler on cells, e.g. GFP labeled cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The original design of this experiment was informed by published data from other groups where Hoechst was used as a marker for live cell studies (e.g. Harris and Nelson, 2010; Wolf et al., 2013). However, in order to address this point from reviewers we have repeated the 2D migration experiments using the virally-transduced clones constitutively expressing cytoplasmic GFP (see Materials and methods section). We found that differences in migration between the WT and KO clones was consistent with the original data set, i.e. the Elkin1-KO clone exhibited a slower track mean speed than the WT clone (as indicated in the figure supplement file that has now been added- see Figure 6—figure supplement 1). The illumination times have now been added to the Materials and methods section, the interval between images was described in the original submission and remains in the Materials and methods section. We would like to thank the reviewers for this suggestion as we did note that the GFP labelled cells exhibited a faster track mean speed than the corresponding cells labelled with Hoechst.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors conclude that knockdown of Elkin1 in WM266-4 cells results in reduction in MA currents, however in Figure 2A the final data point on the graph is nearly identical between WT and cells treated with Elkin1 miRNA. This supports the idea that Elkin1 may be a modulator of a MA channel and knockdown in Elkin1 expression results in a rightward shift in the sensitivity of the MA currents. The authors should address this possibility and state more clearly within the discussion that the role of Elkin1 in this mechanotransduction pathway is still not known.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to first draw the reviewers’ attention to the difference between the knockdown (now Figure 2B, originally Figure 2A) and the knockout (in Figure 5B). When the expression of Elkin1 is completely abrogated by the CRISPR/Cas9 deletion (no mRNA detected) the final data point is significantly smaller in the knockout versus the wild type (Figure 5B). In contrast, as the reviewers note, in the knockdown the final point is similar to the controls (Figure 2B). We contend that this observation is due to an incomplete knockdown of <italic>Elkin1</italic>, as demonstrated by the qPCR experiments that we have now shifted to Figure 2A (previously in Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><p>To address the potential role of Elkin1 in this mechanotransduction pathway we used the following descriptions:</p><p>- In the Results section we interpreted the impact of Elkin1 knockdown as “[suggesting] that Elkin1 <italic>contributes</italic> to MA currents in melanoma cells.”</p><p>- In the section describing the impact of CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion of Elkin1 we wrote: “A residual current at large deflections was still present in some KO cells; we hypothesise that this effect is due to minor compensation from PIEZO1 (Supplementary file 1 and as noted previously (Servin-Vences et al., 2017)) or the activity of an as-yet-unidentified MA channel.”</p><p>- We additionally stated in the Discussion section “Elkin1 either mediates these MA currents or modulates an unidentified MA channel.”</p><p>In response to this concern, however, we have edited the Discussion to reiterate that Elkin1 may be modulating the function of an as yet unidentified MA channel, with the following text: “However, it is possible that Elkin1 is an accessory molecule that modulates the activation of an, as yet uncharacterised, MA channel or an ion channel that requires additional proteinaceous tethers in order to be activated by mechanical inputs. Future studies with purified protein will be required to definitively test the hypothesis that Elkin1 is an ion channel activated by mechanical inputs.”</p><p>We feel that we have clearly indicated, at each relevant point of the manuscript, that while Elkin1 may be an MA ion channel it may also be acting as a channel regulator and hope that this adjustment to the Discussion addresses the reviewers’ concern.</p></body></sub-article></article>
