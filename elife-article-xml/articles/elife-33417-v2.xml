Although the non-cell-autonomous effect of RTT astrocytes on neurons was documented, cell-autonomous phenotypes and mechanisms within RTT astrocytes are not well understood. We report that spontaneous calcium activity is abnormal in RTT astrocytes in vitro, in situ, and in vivo. Such abnormal calcium activity is mediated by calcium overload in the endoplasmic reticulum caused by abnormal store operated calcium entry, which is in part dependent on elevated expression of TRPC4. Furthermore, the abnormal calcium activity leads to excessive activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors (eNMDARs) on neighboring neurons and increased network excitability in <italic>Mecp2</italic> knockout mice. Finally, both the abnormal astrocytic calcium activity and the excessive activation of eNMDARs are caused by <italic>Mecp2</italic> deletion in astrocytes in vivo. Our findings provide evidence that abnormal calcium homeostasis is a key cell-autonomous phenotype in RTT astrocytes, and reveal its mechanism and consequence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Rett syndrome</kwd><kwd>MeCP2</kwd><kwd>astrocytes</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21NS081484</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIAMH002897</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Kuan Hong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54HD090256</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD064743</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R56NS100024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Increased spontaneous calcium activity in Rett syndrome astrocytes is a key cell-autonomous phenotype that affects synaptic function and network activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rett syndrome (RTT) is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hagberg, 1985</xref>) caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (<italic>MECP2</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amir et al., 1999</xref>). RTT is a complex disease, as all key cell types (neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes) in the brain have been shown to contribute to the disease etiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Derecki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fyffe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lioy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luikenhuis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maezawa and Jin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maezawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Samaco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). To fully understand the disease etiology and develop effective treatments, it is essential to define the key phenotypes, link the phenotypes with loss of MeCP2 function, and reveal the consequences of the phenotypes in each brain cell type. Moreover, it is also important to define the connection between phenotypes in different cell types.</p><p>Earlier research to understand the RTT disease etiology mostly focused on neuronal dysfunction in RTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fyffe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luikenhuis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Samaco et al., 2009</xref>), because MeCP2 is expressed at high levels in neurons in a temporal and spatial pattern closely tracking neuronal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akbarian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shahbazian et al., 2002</xref>). Not surprisingly, specific subsets of RTT-like phenotypes were observed in mouse models when <italic>Mecp2</italic> is deleted in specific neuronal subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fyffe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Samaco et al., 2009</xref>). Collectively, these studies confirm the essential role of MeCP2 in maintaining the normal function of neurons, suggesting the loss of function or malfunction of MeCP2 in neurons as the main cause of RTT pathogenesis. Recently, a series of studies have reported that astrocytes express MeCP2, loss of MeCP2 in astrocytes causes neuronal defects in a non-cell autonomous manner, and restoring MeCP2 expression to normal level in astrocytes alone rescues some disease symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lioy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maezawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, cell type specific deletion of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in astrocytes alone is not sufficient to generate most of the RTT-like phenotypes in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lioy et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting the loss of function or malfunction of MeCP2 in astrocytes is not the initial cause of the disease, yet is required to maintain the disease progression. Although a few studies have reported gene expression changes in <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutant mouse astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forbes-Lorman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yasui et al., 2013</xref>), no major cell autonomous phenotype in astrocytes has been characterized in depth. Thus, identification of cell autonomous phenotypes in astrocytes not only is essential for our understanding of astrocyte dysfunction in RTT, but also will help us to determine the mechanism underlying its non-cell autonomous effects on neurons.</p><p>To identify novel cell autonomous phenotypes in RTT astrocytes, we examined intracellular calcium dynamics in astrocytes differentiated from congenic pairs of wild type and mutant RTT iPSC lines. We have used the term ‘isogenic’ to describe these RTT iPSC lines in our previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ananiev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). However, given that the difference between wild type and mutant iPSC lines generated from the same RTT patients is the entire X chromosome, congenic is a more accurate term to define these lines. We observed abnormal spontaneous and pharmacologically evoked cytosolic calcium activities in cultured mutant RTT astrocytes, when compared to their congenic wild type controls. Similar phenotypes can be observed in <italic>Mecp2</italic> knockout mouse astrocytes in vitro, in situ, and in vivo. In addition, re-expression of wild type MeCP2 is sufficient to rescue the abnormal calcium activities in both the mouse and human RTT astrocytes, further confirming that these phenotypes are caused by the loss of MeCP2 function. Moreover, we report that these abnormal calcium activities are mediated by calcium overload in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is caused by abnormal TRPC4-dependent store operated calcium entry (SOCE). Although we provide no direct evidence that TRPC4 is the actual SOCE channel, both loss- and gain-of-function manipulations from our study suggest TRPC4 is upstream of the SOCE and subsequent calcium phenotypes in RTT astrocytes. Finally, we show that these abnormal calcium activities in astrocytes lead to excessive activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors (eNMDARs) on neighboring neurons and increased network excitability; and both the abnormal astrocytic calcium activity and the excessive activation of eNMDARs are caused by the loss of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in astrocytes (but not neurons) in vivo. Our findings provide the first evidence that suggests abnormal calcium homeostasis as a cell autonomous phenotype in RTT astrocytes, and begin to reveal the mechanism and consequence of such a phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Abnormal calcium activities in RTT astrocytes</title><p>Congenic pairs of wild type and mutant RTT iPSC lines carrying the common R294X mutation were differentiated into glial fibrillary acidic protein positive (GFAP+) astrocytes as described in our previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). On average, more than 90% of the cells were GFAP +in cultures used in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Using the green-colored calcium-sensitive dye Fluo-4, we monitored spontaneous cytosolic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) dynamics in live mutant (R294X-MT) and congenic wild type control (R294X-WT) astrocytes (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Ionophore A23187 was used as a loading control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A significantly higher percentage of mutant astrocytes (30 ± 3% in MT vs. 18 ± 2% in WT, n = 26 randomly selected fields in each genotype, p=0.001) showed spontaneous oscillation in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In each astrocyte showing spontaneous oscillation, we further separated and quantified the calcium transients in the soma from those in the processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the soma, the mutant cells had a significantly higher frequency (0.74 ± 0.02/min in MT vs. 0.41 ± 0.01/min in WT, n = 408 cells in MT and n = 280 cells in WT, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and slightly higher amplitude (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) than their congenic wild type controls. Similar changes were observed in the processes of those astrocytes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, the R294X mutant astrocytes had significantly higher peak amplitude (4.60 ± 0.07 in MT vs. 4.04 ± 0.07 in WT, n = 567 cells in MT and n = 811 cells in WT, p&lt;0.001) of ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise than the congenic wild type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). The increase in ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise in human RTT mutant astrocytes was unlikely to be mediated by the P2 receptors, because no difference was detected in the expression level of any P2X or P2Y receptor family members between the wild type and mutant RTT astrocytes by RNA-seq and microarray analysis (data not shown). Similar observations of altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities were made in human astrocytes carrying the rare RTT-causing V247fs mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, both spontaneous and pharmacologically evoked cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity appeared abnormal in mutant human RTT astrocytes differentiated from patient-specific iPSCs and grown in the absence of neurons.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-33417-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33417.002</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Spontaneous calcium activities in wild type human astrocytes</title></caption></media><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-33417-video2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33417.003</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Spontaneous calcium activities in mutant human astrocytes</title></caption></media><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33417.004</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Quantification of the percentage of GFAP+ cell in five differentiations from human iPSCs</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"><bold>stereology #</bold></th><th valign="top"/><th valign="bottom"><bold>1</bold></th><th valign="bottom"><bold>2</bold></th><th valign="bottom"><bold>3</bold></th><th valign="bottom"><bold>4</bold></th><th valign="bottom"><bold>5</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom"> WT</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="bottom">90%</td><td valign="bottom">94%</td><td valign="bottom">92%</td><td valign="bottom">89%</td><td valign="bottom">91%</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> MT</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="bottom">90%</td><td valign="bottom">92%</td><td valign="bottom">94%</td><td valign="bottom">89%</td><td valign="bottom">92%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33417.005</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Amplitudes of spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in different experiments</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"><bold>Cell type</bold></th><th valign="bottom"><bold>Wild-type</bold></th><th valign="bottom"><bold>Mutant</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom"> R294X astrocytes</td><td valign="bottom">1.660 ± 0.01624 N = 1091</td><td valign="bottom">1.808 ± 0.01882 N = 2962</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> R294X astrocytes (processes)</td><td valign="bottom">1.467 ± 0.01601 N = 2228</td><td valign="bottom">1.722 ± 0.01994 N = 2743</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> V247fs astrocytes</td><td valign="bottom">1.686 ± 0.02453 N = 902</td><td valign="bottom">1.816 ± 0.02128 N = 1760</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> V247fs astrocytes (processes)</td><td valign="bottom">1.560 ± 0.02224 N = 1825</td><td valign="bottom">1.640 ± 0.02447 N = 2312</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> Mouse primary astrocytes</td><td valign="bottom">1.787 ± 0.007193 N = 5694</td><td valign="bottom">1.822 ± 0.006209 N = 8389</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> Astrocytes in situ</td><td valign="bottom">2.010 ± 0.02998 N = 1367</td><td valign="bottom">2.151 ± 0.03079 N = 1997</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> Astrocytes in vivo</td><td valign="bottom">3.463 ± 0.1410 N = 285</td><td valign="bottom">3.045 ± 0.05410 N = 1346</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> Astrocytes in vivo (processes)</td><td valign="bottom">3.283 ± 0.03640 N = 2040</td><td valign="bottom">3.007 ± 0.01546 N = 8796</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33417.006</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities in mutant human RTT astrocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pseudocolored Fluo4 fluorescence images from wild type (WT, left) and MeCP2 mutant (MT, right) astrocytes differentiated from human iPSCs.

Moreover, when the kinetics of this Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise was analyzed, the leakage of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER in the mutant astrocytes was much faster (time constant 54 ± 1 s in MT vs. 59 ± 1 s in WT, n = 156 cells in MT and n = 178 cells in WT, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33417.026</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>RTT astrocytes display abnormal calcium load in the ER, calcium leak from the ER, baseline cytosolic calcium level, and TRPC4-dependent SOCE.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, average traces of Fluo4 fluorescence changes in wild type and mutant astrocytes treated with 1 μM TG to release ER calcium.

The GFP transgene is on the same X chromosome as the wild type <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene. Due to random X chromosome inactivation, a mixture of GFP+ and GFP- astrocytes will be present in these cultures, with the GFP+ cells expressing the wild type MeCP2 and the GFP- cells expressing no MeCP2. When the red-colored calcium-sensitive dye Rhod-2 was used to image baseline cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level in the <italic>Mecp2</italic> null (GFP-) and wild type (GFP+) astrocytes in the same culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), significantly higher level of Rhod-2 fluorescence was detected in the <italic>Mecp2</italic> null cells (154 ± 7% in GFP- vs. 100 ± 5% in GFP+, n = 30 in each group, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

These results reveal Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload in the ER, the faster Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak rate, and the elevated baseline cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level as significant contributors to the abnormal spontaneous and pharmacologically evoked cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities in the mutant RTT astrocytes.</p><p>To further define the cellular events upstream of the abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, we measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the store operated calcium entry (SOCE) pathway, which is the primary pathway for reloading Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the ER in astrocytes. After depleting Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER by treating astrocytes with TG in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> plus 2 mM EGTA), we switched bath solution to that containing 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Comparing to that in the congenic control, the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was significantly higher in the mutant human RTT astrocytes (2.93 ± 0.07 in MT vs. 2.41 ± 0.06 in WT, n = 156 cells in MT and n = 178 cells in WT, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), suggesting an abnormal increase of SOCE in the mutant cells.</p><p>In search of the molecular mechanism underlying the increased SOCE in mutant astrocyte, we performed RNA-seq and microarray experiments to compare gene transcription profiles in the mutant astrocytes and their congenic controls. Highly relevant to the observed SOCE phenotype, the expression of the transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member 4 (<italic>TRPC4</italic>), which has been previously shown to regulate SOCE in lung vascular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tiruppathi et al., 2002</xref>), was found to be significantly higher in the mutant human RTT astrocytes (~27 fold increase by RNA-seq,~14 fold increase by microarray). Western blot analysis using protein lysates from mutant human RTT astrocytes and their congenic controls also confirmed the increased expression of TRPC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–I</xref>). Immunostaining with TrpC4 antibody also detected significantly higher immunoreactivity in GFAP positive astrocytes in hippocampal sections from the <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mouse brains as compared with that in wild type mouse brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed significant MeCP2 occupancy at the promoter of <italic>Trpc4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting direct regulation of <italic>Trpc4</italic> transcription by MeCP2. To corroborate the expression level changes at the RNA and protein level for TRPC4, we performed whole cell patch clamp recording on the astrocytes to directly assess the current mediated by TRPC4 using a TRPC4-selective antagonist, ML204 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miller et al., 2011</xref>). Significantly higher density of ML204 sensitive inward current (at −70 mV) was detected in the R294X mutant human RTT astrocytes (−0.93 ± 0.01 pA/pF in MT vs. −0.62 ± 0.08 pA/pF in WT, n = 14 cells in MT and n = 15 cells in WT, p=0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J–K</xref>).

Finally, the phenotypes of increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload in the ER, faster Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak from the ER, increased SOCE, and increased level of TrpC4 were also observed in primary astrocytes isolated from <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>To determine the contribution of increased TRPC4 expression to the series of Ca<sup>2+</sup> related phenotypes in the <italic>Mecp2</italic> null astrocytes, we treated these cells with ML204 for 24 hr, and then measured SOCE-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> load in the ER, and recorded spontaneous cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities.

Such a hypothesis is highly relevant to RTT, because 80–90% of RTT patients have seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jian et al., 2007</xref>), and spontaneous seizures have also been reported in RTT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Cruz et al., 2010</xref>). As the first step to explore a role for abnormal astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in leading to seizure in RTT, we adopted a widely used slice model of seizure (or epileptiform activity or network hyper-excitability) by adding the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist biccucullin and increasing bath Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borck and Jefferys, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McLeod et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ratté et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tian et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In this model, whole cell patch clamp recording in CA1 pyramidal neurons readily detected epileptiform activity in slices from 5 to 8 week-old wild type and <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Comparing with wild type, epileptiform activity in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> neurons had shorter latency (4.5 ± 0.4 min in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> vs. 6.5 ± 0.6 min in wild type, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>), higher frequency (5.6 ± 0.4 Hz in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> vs. 3.5 ± 0.5 Hz in wild type, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>), longer duration (755 ± 30 ms in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> vs. 621 ± 39 ms in wild type, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>), and higher amplitude (364 ± 15 pA in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> vs. 279 ± 28 pA in wild type. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). More importantly, intracellular infusion of membrane impermeable BAPTA into a single astrocyte significantly reduced epileptiform activity in neighboring neurons (latency: 4.5 ± 0.4 min in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> vs. 5.7 ± 0.4 min in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> with BAPTA infusion; frequency: 5.6 ± 0.4 Hz in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> vs. 3.8 ± 0.5 Hz in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> with BAPTA infusion; duration: 755 ± 30 ms in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> vs. 633 ± 31 ms in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> with BAPTA infusion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). 7–10 neurons from 3 to 4 mice were analyzed from each genotype/treatment in this series of experiments.

Together, these data reveal a potential link between increased astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and increased network excitability. Since such increased network excitability may underlie seizure-a specific RTT symptom, these data further highlight the functional significance of abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in RTT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Since the initial report that astrocytes express MeCP2 and that <italic>Mecp2</italic> null astrocytes have non-cell autonomous influence on wild type neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballas et al., 2009</xref>), many gene expression changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maezawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Okabe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yasui et al., 2013</xref>) and a few cellular phenotypes have been identified in <italic>Mecp2</italic> null astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maezawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nectoux et al., 2012</xref>). However, it is not clear how these alterations contribute to RTT pathogenesis either by directly changing astrocyte functions or by indirectly changing neuronal functions. In addition, no major cell autonomous phenotype in astrocytes has been clearly defined, with its underlying mechanism and downstream consequences examined in detail.</p><p>A cell autonomous phenotype in astrocytes is inherently difficult to define in vivo, because astrocytes normally develop in the presence of neurons and intimately interact with neurons in the intact brain. To circumvent this issue, we first turned to human iPSC-differentiated astrocytes because they are differentiated and maintained in the absence of neurons. Using astrocytes differentiated from congenic pairs of human RTT patient specific iPSCs, we discovered that both the spontaneous and the pharmacologically evoked cytosolic calcium activities are abnormal in mutant RTT astrocytes. We then confirmed that similar phenotypes could be found in <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mouse astrocytes in vitro, in situ, and in vivo. While significant difference exists across the astrocyte populations included in our study (species [human and mouse], developmental stage [embryonic and postnatal], and system [in vitro, in situ, and in vivo]), the core phenotype of abnormal astrocytic calcium activity remains consistent. As for the underlying mechanism, we provide evidence that the abnormal calcium activity is mediated by calcium overload in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) caused by TRPC4-dependent abnormal store operated calcium entry (SOCE). Although our findings don’t directly reveal whether TRPC4 is a component of the SOCE channel, they do suggest elevated TRPC4 expression in mutant RTT astrocytes is upstream of the SOCE, ER, and cytosolic calcium phenotypes. As for the downstream consequences, we demonstrate that these abnormal calcium activities lead to excessive activation of the eNMDARs on neighboring neurons and increased network excitability. Together, our results not only identify a novel cell autonomous phenotype and its underlying mechanism in RTT astrocytes, but also reveal a functional link between the astrocyte phenotype and a novel neuronal phenotype in RTT models and network hyper-excitability that may underlie a significant RTT symptom. For future studies, we hypothesize a linear model in the following order: first, loss of MeCP2 expression in astrocytes leads to increased expression of TRPC4 in astrocytes; second, increased expression of TRPC4 in astrocytes leads to calcium overload in the ER of astrocytes; third, calcium overload in the ER of astrocytes leads to increased cytosolic calcium activity in the astrocytes; fourth, increased cytosolic calcium activity in astrocytes leads to excessive activation of eNMDARs in neighboring neurons and increased network excitability (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33417.041</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A schematic summary of the findings in our study.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33417-fig9-v2"/></fig><p>The abnormal calcium homeostasis in mutant RTT astrocytes manifests in multiple interconnected cellular events, including elevated SOCE, Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload in the ER, elevated baseline cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, and abnormal spontaneous and evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities. Both molecular and pharmacological inhibition of the TRPC4 channel in mutant RTT astrocytes rescue the phenotypes of increased SOCE, ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and abnormal cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities. Conversely, overexpression of TRPC4 in wild type astrocytes can cause the mutant phenotypes. Together, these results strongly suggest that increased TRPC4 expression is upstream of the altered SOCE, and the subsequent ER and cytosol Ca<sup>2+</sup> phenotypes. As most of our TRPC4-related data came from in vitro experiments, future in vivo studies are needed to ascertain the functional significance of increased TRPC4 expression in RTT disease progression. In addition, it is worth noting that other TRP channels such as TRPA1, TRPC, TRPV4 have been implicated in modulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Molnár et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shibasaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shigetomi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shigetomi et al., 2011</xref>). Yet, their expression remained unchanged in mutant human RTT astrocytes (data not shown). Of course, other deregulated genes and pathways due to the loss of MeCP2 function may also contribute to these phenotypes, providing interesting topics for future studies to further illustrate the central role of abnormal calcium homeostasis in astrocyte dysfunction in RTT. Furthermore, it is worth noting that abnormal calcium activities in astrocytes have been implicated in other neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuchibhotla et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting abnormal calcium homeostasis in astrocytes may be a common pathological event in neurological diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the abnormal calcium activities may be different in different diseases. While the P2Y1 receptor is shown to mediate the astrocytic hyperactivity in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delekate et al., 2014</xref>), we have identified TRPC4 as a major contributor to the abnormal calcium homeostasis in RTT astrocytes. Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a pleiotropic signal for a diverse range of cellular functions, abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis can lead to additional functional consequences in mutant RTT astrocytes. Future studies are therefore needed to define the full spectrum of cellular deficits in RTT astrocytes that are downstream of the altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p><p>Up to now, a major challenge in understanding the contribution of astrocytes to RTT pathogenesis has been the missing link between astrocyte dysfunction and neuronal dysfunction and RTT symptoms. We showed that intracellular infusion of a membrane-impermeable calcium chelator, which abolishes calcium activities in astrocytes only, reduced the excessive activation of eNMDARs on neighboring neurons and rescued network hyper-excitability. Moreover, we provided genetic evidence that the loss of MeCP2 in astrocytes is both necessary and sufficient to cause the abnormal calcium activity in astrocytes and the excessive activation of eNMDARs in neighboring neurons. These results strongly suggest that this novel neuronal phenotype is dependent on a cell autonomous phenotype in the astrocytes. Thus, our findings provide a direct functional link between astrocyte dysfunction and neuronal dysfunction in RTT.</p><p>Although it remains debatable whether excessive activation of eNMDARs leads to increased neuronal synchrony and seizure in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angulo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fellin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tian et al., 2005</xref>), increased synchronous neuronal firing has recently been observed in the hippocampus of both male <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> and female <italic>Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the relationship between the abnormal astrocytic calcium activity, the excessive activation of eNMDARs, and increased neuronal synchrony is worth further studying in the context of RTT. While 80% of RTT patients have seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jian et al., 2007</xref>), the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this symptom are not well understood. Even if the excessive activation of eNMDARs and/or the increased neuronal synchrony may not be directly linked to the seizure phenotype in RTT, our data linking the abnormal calcium activities in RTT astrocytes to increased network excitability still provide a new avenue for investigating this often difficult-to-manage symptom in RTT. At this moment, the exact molecular events linking abnormal calcium activities in astrocytes and altered neuronal and network properties remain elusive. One obvious candidate is glutamate, because previous studies have detected elevated glutamate level in primary cultures of astrocytes and microglia prepared from RTT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maezawa and Jin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Okabe et al., 2012</xref>). Beyond glutamate, astrocytic calcium is known to modulate inhibitory synaptic efficacy by controlling GABA level through astrocytic GAT-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shigetomi et al., 2011</xref>), and to modulate basal synaptic transmission through the release of purines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Panatier et al., 2011</xref>). Both mechanisms may help explain how abnormal calcium activities in RTT astrocytes cause increased network excitability. Therefore, more systematic approaches are needed in future studies to fully characterize the changes in factors present in RTT astrocyte conditioned medium (due to alteration in either release or uptake by astrocytes) and reveal how those changes underlie the non-cell autonomous influence on neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>This study used congenic pairs of wild type and mutant Rett syndrome patient specific induced pluripotent stem cell lines carrying the R294X and the V247fs mutations.

Human identity testing was performed using Short Tandem Repeat (STR) testing. This test method is capable of providing a unique genetic fingerprint that is traceable back to a single human donor. In addition, STR is capable of detecting other contaminating cell types, either other human cell lines or other species, at a very low level. Isoenzyme analysis could also be performed to verify species of origin for cell lines. Testing was also routinely performed to test for microbial and fungal contamination using test methods that are typically used for testing clinical-grade cell lines.

Mouse primary astrocytes from GCaMP6s mice were treated with 4-OH tamoxifen (0.5 μM, Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) for 24 hr to induce the expression of GCaMP6s. Cells were imaged using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope at room temperature. All image data were taken in the frame-scanning mode at 1 frame every 2 s (in the experiments using GCaMP6s as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, 1 frame every 1 s). Fluo-4 or GCaMP6s was excited at 488 nm. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data was analyzed using custom-written programs in Python. The metadata and the image data of the raw images were read with python-bioformats. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were presented as relative fluorescence changes (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) from specified regions of interest (ROIs). ROIs were selected using an automated segmentation algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2016</xref>), while somata and processes were manually identified on the basis of morphology. For the traces with baseline drift, baseline correction was performed using a ‘rolling-ball’ algorithm. The peaks were detected using the algorithm developed by Matlab (findpeaks function). The frequency, amplitude and the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) were calculated and measured. Images with obvious motion were excluded for analysis. In experiments that examined spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> level was reported as F/F<sub>0</sub> = F<sub>t</sub>/F<sub>0</sub>. Calcium elevation events were detected with thresholds of 3 times of standard deviation of the baseline. The source code for Ca<sup>2+</sup> events detection and automated segmentation is available in the supplementary files. Rhod-2 was used in the experiments involving viral expression of exogenous wild type MECP2, TRPC4, or shRNA against TRPC4. For the spontaneous astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity imaging, aCSF containing (in mM): 120 NaCl, 3 KCl, 15 HEPES, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 Glucose (pH7.4) was used. For TG-induced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, aCSF with 0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 2 mM EGTA was used, and TG was perfused to induce the astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations. For SOCE, 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> containing aCSF was perfused after TG induced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion. The spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations from the soma and process of astrocytes were analyzed separately. For the analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data in acute mouse brain slices, only Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in soma and major process of astrocytes were included.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging</title><p>GCaMP6s mice (Ai96, 024106) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory.

The authors provide evidence that cell autonomous changes in astrocyte calcium signaling affect neurons in Rett model mice. However, there were several shared issues raised by reviewers that diminish enthusiasm for this paper. Specifically, more direct evidence that calcium signaling is altered in mecp2- null astrocytes in vivo is needed to strengthen their conclusions. In addition, the in vitro calcium imaging data require further controls and analyses to strengthen their conclusions. The use of Rett patient-derived IPSCs to study astrocyte dysfunction and the demonstration that similar effects are observed in mouse null astrocytes are strength; however more characterization of astrocytes and clarification of the protocols used to generate human astrocytes are needed. Reviewers raised additional concerns regarding the quality and consistency of the data that need to be addressed.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The paper makes a compelling argument that cell autonomous changes in astrocyte calcium signaling affects neurons in RETT model mice.

The data with hGFAP-Cre AAVs are not convincing as a way to target astrocytes selectively, especially in the hippocampus. My suggestion is to drop these data and use the space that is gained to report the RNAseq data in full. I don' think the hGFAP-Cre data add anything useful to the paper, because the logic for why this should be astrocyte specific is not clear.</p><p>Overall, a potentially valuable paper that needs another round of hard work to tighten up some aspects.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors of this manuscript attempt to prove that MeCP2 mutant astrocytes from both iPSC and mouse models display altered calcium homeostasis by a mechanism of high internal calcium store concentration and increased expression of TRPC4 channels. This leads to increased spontaneous calcium activity, increased amplitude to pharmacologically induced calcium transients, and a proposed aberrant activation of NMDA receptors. While this manuscript presents an interesting first attempt at probing calcium homeostasis in MeCP2 mutant astrocytes, there are significant and fundamental errors in both experiments and the approaches used that undermine the interpretation of results.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Throughout the paper, the authors claim to show in vivo evidence that supports their conclusions. There is not a single in vivo experiment in this entire data set. They consistently refer to their acute slice experiments as in vivo work: this is incorrect. Acute slice work is generally referred to as in situ, as it does not wholly replicate the in vivo environment. This is critically important when it comes to astrocytes, which are extremely sensitive to osmotic and ion changes that can occur during the process of slicing and can alter astrocyte activity.</p><p>2) There is no characterization of the iPSC cultures to determine if they are in fact astrocytes. A reference is given to a previous paper, but no characterization of the cultures used in the experiments conducted in this manuscript is provided. It is critical to include experiments where the cultures used for calcium imaging are fixed and stained for astrocyte markers.</p><p>3) Calcium imaging data: Overall, the calcium imaging data from both iPSCs, primary cultures and in situ slice experiments is not convincing. Fluo-4 is a single wavelength dye, and while normalizing to baseline can reduce issues concerning concentrations of indicator, this indicator can only be used for relative measures of calcium amplitudes and requires careful loading controls that do not appear to be presented. Use of a ratiometric dye for experiments would have been more convincing for the changes that are described. Additionally, in the entire manuscript the data presented is from somatic recordings of astrocyte transients. While for the iPSCs work this may be understandable, for the primary culture and slice work there should have been an effort to examine calcium transients in the enlarged cell body or processes of astrocytes, as the somatic activity of an astrocyte is incredibly low compared to the activity in processes (see Di Castro et al., 2011) and represent a small fraction of the total calcium activity. As the authors used a genetically encoded calcium indicator in some experiments, why not in all experiments? This would have been more convincing.</p><p>4) The frame rate for calcium imaging is too slow for an accurate recording of the spontaneous activity and is likely underestimating the frequency of spontaneous events.</p><p>5) In general, in the majority of the experiments, the n's presented for results are low for what this reviewer would expect from culture experiments where the dish contains many thousands of cells.</p><p>6) The choice of representative images, such as the immunostaining in Figure 5A, is inconsistent with the data presented. The authors use a lentivirus to reintroduce Mecp2 into their null cell populations, along with GFP. The MeCp2-null cells depicted by the GFP images seem to be more numerous and have different morphology. Furthermore, there seem to be some red signal indicating some expression of MeCP2 in these cells. This calls into question the potential health and fidelity of the cells, or the choice of images. A similar issue is found in Figure 5H: a representative staining has several cells from MeCP2-null neonates selected that express GFP and Rhod-2. However, a close examination of these areas does not show any Rhod-2, which could explain why the authors do not report any Ca transients in these regions. Again, the choice of representative images is called into question, since the representative traces depict absolutely no traces during a ~10 min period, yet their data show the frequency in this population to be 1.33 / 0.1 min-1. In general, throughout the paper the representative data seems inconsistent with the reported quantification.</p><p>7) The authors of the paper make an assumption concerning astrocyte calcium signaling that there have been no changes to the signaling pathways contributing to the generation of spontaneous signaling aside from TRPC4. This is highly unlikely given the nature of MeCP2. The major release pathway from the ER involves activation of IP3 receptors. While TRPC4 does appear altered, it may also be the case that other components of the ER release pathway may be altered as well and be the root cause of the increased spontaneous signals. A closer examination of other components of ER associated calcium signaling should be conducted. Additionally, staining for TRPC4 to show it is even expressed by astrocytes in vivo is needed to validate the model.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Qiping Dong et al., provides in vitro and ex vivo data that astrocytes from Rett Syndrome patients and mouse models of the human disorder have cell-autonomous increases in cytosolic calcium oscillations. Furthermore, data suggest that increased astrocytic calcium responses results in increased activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors on neighboring neurons. The authors identify that increased cytosolic calcium in astrocytes is primarily derived from the endoplasmic reticulum through increased store operated calcium entry (SOCE). They also identify a potential mechanism for increased SOCE in mutant and null astroctyes via increased levels ofTRPC4. The authors postulate that this increased astrocytic calcium leads to seizures in Rett patients via increased activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors.</p><p>Identifying how astrocytes play a role in Rett Syndrome is interesting, timely, and therapeutically relevant. The use of Rett patient-derived IPSCs to study astrocyte dysfunction is innovative and impactful and the demonstration that similar effects are observed in mouse null astrocytes is rigorous. However, there are some major concerns regarding the quality and consistency of the data as well as the relevance for effects in vivo. See points below.</p><p>1) All data are in vitro (cultured cells) or ex vivo (slice) with no in vivo evidence that astrocytic calcium dynamics and subsequent extrasynaptic NMDA transmission are dysregulated in Rett Syndrome. While it is appreciated that not everyone is capable of imaging calcium oscillations in vivo, one relatively straight forward experiment that would start to address this point is to assess seizure susceptibility in vivo (vs. ex vivo) following astrocyte-specific knockdown or ablation of Mecp2.</p><p>2) There are multiple inconsistencies in the data reporting changes in calcium in mutant or null astrocytes versus wild-type. Often calcium dynamics are very different across figures for the same genetic or pharmacological manipulation. For example, the calcium dynamics reported in Figure 12C,D show different levels of mutant calcium oscillation and frequency than is reported in Figure 2B,C. These discrepancies need to be addressed.</p><p>3) The authors fail to clearly define their N numbers in their figures or results. It is not clear from reading the manuscript whether the N's provided refer to number of cells, number of experiments, etc. Given that the N's are relatively high, one would assume this represents cells. However, it is unclear how many independent experiments these N's represent. Data should be assessed from at least three independent experiments and the authors should sample similar numbers of cells across experiments. This information should be clearly outlined. Furthermore, while the authors list N's in the text, the authors should list this in each figure legend for clarity. The authors also need to list the stats and p-values for each experiment in the figure legend. This is inconsistent across the manuscript.</p><p>4) The authors conclude that evoked calcium activities are disrupted following either ATP or glutamate stimulation. The mutant or null astrocytes already have higher amplitude responses spontaneously (e.g. Figure 1E). If you compare the amplitudes of spontaneous responses to evoked responses, it appears that the actual magnitude of increase following stimulation is not different between wild-type and null or mutants astrocytes (e.g. Figure 1-amplitude increases from about 2 (spontaneous) to about 3.5 (+ATP) for WT and from about 3 (spontaneous) to about 4.5 (evoked) in MT). Therefore, the conclusion that evoked responses are different is not accurate and should be clarified.</p><p>5) The figures are generally very difficult to follow and could use some reorganization. For example, the authors often go back and forth between human and mouse within the same figure without clearly identifying this within the figure. In addition, a number of figures could be either combined or included as supplemental material. For example, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10 and Figure 11 could all be represented along with data from Figure 7 or included as a supplemental file.</p><p>6) The images presented throughout the manuscript often lack many general cell markers that would benefit interpretation of the data. In some cases, the figure lacks any images of cultures (Figure 2). Most images do not include DAPI to label all cells and no images show staining for astrocyte-specific markers. Higher magnification images should also be added to the current low magnification images. In addition, the authors list quantification in the text but these data should be included in the figure to increase clarity.</p><p>7) The authors need to validate sufficient knockdown of genes and reduced protein in astrocytes following shRNAs. These data can be included as supplemental.</p><p>8) In Figure 13 and Figure 14, there is only quantification of mCherry labeling not loss of Mecp2 expression. The authors must quantify presence or absence of Mecp2 protein in mCherry positive and negative astrocytes and neurons. This is particularly important given that detecting Mecp2 in vivo in non-neuronal cells is notoriously difficult and typically requires amplification (Ballas et al., 2011). From the images, it is not clear that the antibody recognizes Mecp2 in uninfected astrocytes, which is important to show in order to validate loss of Mecp2 in infected astrocytes. This figure could also benefit from higher magnification images. Lastly, the authors suggest that they are creating cell-specific knockout mice. This is exaggerated as only about 27% of cells are infected.</p><p>9) The manuscript emphasizes that their heightened extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation has never before been reported in any RTT models. This is inaccurate. There is at least one recent paper reporting increased activation of eNMDARs in RTT (Lo et al., 2016). While it is appreciated that this effect has never been attributed to astrocytes, the text should be modified to include these published findings.</p><p>10) The model provided in Figure 15 is not detailed enough to add any meaningful contribution to the manuscript as a whole and could be excluded.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mechanism and Consequence of Abnormal Calcium Homeostasis in Rett Syndrome Astrocytes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have made significant improvements to their manuscript from the original submission. The authors have addressed several of the key concerns raised in the first submission. The revised manuscript is better organized, clear in its presentation of the data and the model systems used and draws well-grounded conclusions from the data. However, there are a number of additional revisions and comments that will need to be addressed before publications as summarized below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Most data supporting the TRPC4 mechanism are in vitro. The only data showing some evidence of increased TRPC4 function in Mecp2 null mice are immunostaining in Figure S10. More data demonstrating TRPC4 expression changes and function in vivo/ex vivo would strengthen the study. For example, western blots for TRPC4 from acutely isolated astrocytes (mouse model) in addition cultured astrocytes would be helpful.</p><p>At minimum, please include in brief discussion emphasizing the need for future studies on the topic. This would help the reader and thoughtfully point out the limitations of the current work.</p><p>2) The authors' explanation to reviewers regarding the large variability in N's is not sufficient. In many cases the N's vary by 100s of cells. For example, Figure 1C the N=526 cells for mutant cultures and N=811 for wild-type cultures. As one reviewer previously pointed out, this could greatly affect the statistical analyses. Further, it is unclear how the authors chose a particular N prior to doing statistics and it remains unclear in the manuscript how many independent experiments each data set represents.</p><p>3) While the authors make more attempt to validate their cell-specific genetic manipulations of Mecp2, these data are still not quantified sufficiently. The data in Supplementary file 3 and Figure 8—figure supplement 2 only shows quantification of% cells with mCherry, GFAP, and NeuN expression. The% of NeuN+ and GFAP+ cells +/- MECP2 immunoreactivity after AAV injection should also be included here. Given that the goal is to achieve cell-type specific manipulation, these data are important.</p><p>4) Many immunofluorescence images are still generally low quality. For example, in Figure 6—figure supplement 2, the background staining of TRPC4 is quite a bit higher in MECP2 null animals vs. WT. The non-specific background staining should be the same in these images to ensure a more accurate comparison. This and other figures would also benefit from some higher magnification zoom-ins in addition to the low magnification images. There is also immunostaining that is very difficult to visualize in several figures. One clear example is Figure 8—figure supplement 2 (MECP2 and NeuN immunoreactivity).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33417.049</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The paper makes a compelling argument that cell autonomous changes in astrocyte calcium signaling affects neurons in RETT model mice.

Since the whole RNA-seq data set is not the main focus of our study, we have decided to describe its role as the discovery approach leading our attention to TRPC4. In order to bolster the validity of our conclusion of increased TRPC4 expression, we added data from multiple independent experimental approaches, including microarray, qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunostaining on brain sections. Results from all of those experiments consistently showed elevated TRPC4 expression in MeCP2 mutant astrocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) What is the molecular basis of the ML204-insensitive current in astrocytes? Please discuss or explain with experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Depleting ER calcium leads to the activation of store operated calcium entry. In astrocytes, this calcium entry may be mediated by TRP channels and calcium release activated calcium channels (Oral1). ML204 is a newly discovered inhibitor that only blocks TRPC4 containing channels but not Oral1 channels mediated currents. Thus, we used the ML204-sensitive current as an indirect measurement of TRPC4 mediated current. An increase of ML204-sensitive current (i.e. TRPC4 current) is consistent with our findings of increased TRPC4 expression in MT astrocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The data with hGFAP-Cre AAVs are not convincing as a way to target astrocytes selectively, especially in the hippocampus.

In the first set, our analysis of phenotypes (both eNMDAR activation and calcium dynamics) was performed in acute hippocampal slices prepared from 2-3-week-old mice (Figure 8). Even if neural stem cells in the hippocampus infected with AAV express hGFAP-cre, there won't be enough time (2 weeks after injection of the AAV into postnatal day 0 pups) for those neural stem cells to differentiate into neurons and complicate our experimental results. Indeed, when we further sectioned and stained those slice, 100% of the mCherry positive cells in those sections were GFAP positive astrocytes (Figure 8 and Table 3).</p><p>The second set is our imaging of spontaneous calcium activity in live mice. Although the lapse of time after AAV administration was longer, our analysis was limited to the superficial layer (layer 1) of the frontal cortex, in which region our immunological analysis again confirmed the specificity of the AAV-cre mediated MeCP2 deletion was limited to astrocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, a potentially valuable paper that needs another round of hard work to tighten up some aspects.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Throughout the paper, the authors claim to show in vivo evidence that supports their conclusions. There is not a single in vivo experiment in this entire data set. They consistently refer to their acute slice experiments as in vivo work: this is incorrect. Acute slice work is generally referred to as in situ, as it does not wholly replicate the in vivo environment. This is critically important when it comes to astrocytes, which are extremely sensitive to osmotic and ion changes that can occur during the process of slicing and can alter astrocyte activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised our description of the slice results by using the phrase “in situ” instead. In addition, we have collaborated with the Wang laboratory at NIMH, an expert in live imaging, to perform calcium imaging experiment in live mice, which replicate the in vivo environment. Consistent with our findings in cultured human and mouse astrocytes and mouse brain slices, we observed increased frequency of spontaneous calcium activity in astrocytes in live mice whose <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene was predominantly deleted in cortical astrocytes. These new data are included in our revised manuscript (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is no characterization of the iPSC cultures to determine if they are in fact astrocytes. A reference is given to a previous paper, but no characterization of the cultures used in the experiments conducted in this manuscript is provided. It is critical to include experiments where the cultures used for calcium imaging are fixed and stained for astrocyte markers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed detailed characterization of astrocytes differentiated from congenic pairs of Rett syndrome iPSC lines in our previous publication (Williams et al., 2014), and again in our current study. We didn’t include those data in our original submission but have included them in our revised manuscript (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Calcium imaging data: Overall, the calcium imaging data from both iPSCs, primary cultures and in situ slice experiments is not convincing. Fluo-4 is a single wavelength dye, and while normalizing to baseline can reduce issues concerning concentrations of indicator, this indicator can only be used for relative measures of calcium amplitudes and requires careful loading controls that do not appear to be presented. Use of a ratiometric dye for experiments would have been more convincing for the changes that are described. Additionally, in the entire manuscript the data presented is from somatic recordings of astrocyte transients. While for the iPSCs work this may be understandable, for the primary culture and slice work there should have been an effort to examine calcium transients in the enlarged cell body or processes of astrocytes, as the somatic activity of an astrocyte is incredibly low compared to the activity in processes (see Di Castro et al., 2011) and represent a small fraction of the total calcium activity. As the authors used a genetically encoded calcium indicator in some experiments, why not in all experiments? This would have been more convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>In our experiments, we focus more on the relative changes of intracellular calcium concentration rather than the absolute concentration. In addition, our focus was on the comparison between the MT and WT genotypes. Finally, the frequency results should not be affected by the loading conditions.</p><p>That being said, we took the reviewer’s suggestion, and performed additional experiments while including calcium ionophore A23187 as a loading control (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) in calcium imaging experiments involving human astrocytes. More importantly, we used the GCaMP6 reporter mice in calcium imaging experiments in primary mouse astrocytes (Figure 3) and live mice (Figure 5), both of which yielded results consistent with calcium dye-based results from cultured human astrocytes (Figure 1) and acute mouse brain slices (Figure 4). Finally, we took the reviewer’s suggestion to re-analyze the calcium activity of astrocytic processes and presented them separately (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The frame rate for calcium imaging is too slow for an accurate recording of the spontaneous activity and is likely underestimating the frequency of spontaneous events.</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid potential phototoxicity, we did calcium imaging at the rate of one image per every 2 seconds. The kinetics of astrocytic calcium activity is far slower than this frame rate. We did the kinetics analysis and the FWHM (full width at half maximum) is ~40 Sec for soma and ~30 sec for processes. Also, there are many papers in which the authors used similar sampling rate. For GCaMP6s imaging, we used faster frame rates (mouse primary astrocytes (Figure 3): 1 frame per second; live mice (Figure 5): 1.83 frame per second).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In general, in the majority of the experiments, the n's presented for results are low for what this reviewer would expect from culture experiments where the dish contains many thousands of cells.</p></disp-quote><p>During the short imaging period (10 minutes) for each imaging field, only a percentage of the astrocytes in culture exhibited spontaneous calcium elevations. Only these cells were included in the statistical analysis. Further, being mindful that long duration of such imaging experiment may affect the health of cells and the data consistency, we limited the total amount of imaging time for each dish, thereby obtaining only a few images from a single dish. We hope the consistency in results between species and across the in vitro, in situ, and in vivo platforms will alleviate the reviewer’s concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The choice of representative images, such as the immunostaining in Figure 5A, is inconsistent with the data presented. The authors use a lentivirus to reintroduce Mecp2 into their null cell populations, along with GFP. The MeCp2-null cells depicted by the GFP images seem to be more numerous and have different morphology. Furthermore, there seem to be some red signal indicating some expression of MeCP2 in these cells. This calls into question the potential health and fidelity of the cells, or the choice of images. A similar issue is found in Figure 5H: a representative staining has several cells from MeCP2-null neonates selected that express GFP and Rhod-2. However, a close examination of these areas does not show any Rhod-2, which could explain why the authors do not report any Ca transients in these regions. Again, the choice of representative images is called into question, since the representative traces depict absolutely no traces during a ~10 min period, yet their data show the frequency in this population to be 1.33 / 0.1 min-1. In general, throughout the paper the representative data seems inconsistent with the reported quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the poor quality of the representative images, which was due to image processing during the submission of the manuscript. We have corrected that issue. In new images included in the revised manuscript, Figure 2A shows no difference in cell morphology between mutant and wild type. Finally, in the mouse astrocytes rescue experiments presented in Figure 5 of our original submission, the average of frequency was calculated using cells showing calcium transient. In another word, although all cells (cell 1-8) were used to calculate percentage of cells with calcium activity, only cells with calcium activity (cell 1, 5, 6, 7, 8) were used to calculate frequency and amplitude. Given the data are largely redundant with those from the human cells, we removed them from our revised manuscript as part of our effort to streamline the organization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors of the paper make an assumption concerning astrocyte calcium signaling that there have been no changes to the signaling pathways contributing to the generation of spontaneous signaling aside from TRPC4. This is highly unlikely given the nature of MeCP2. The major release pathway from the ER involves activation of IP3 receptors. While TRPC4 does appear altered, it may also be the case that other components of the ER release pathway may be altered as well and be the root cause of the increased spontaneous signals. A closer examination of other components of ER associated calcium signaling should be conducted. Additionally, staining for TRPC4 to show it is even expressed by astrocytes in vivo is needed to validate the model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that additional components of the calcium homeostasis regulation may be affected, and plan to further investigate in the future. As suggested by the reviewer, we performed immunostaining of Trpc4 on brain sections from wild type and <italic>Mecp2</italic> knockout mice and observed increased intensity of Trpc4 immunoreactivity in astrocytes in brain sections from the <italic>Mecp2</italic> knockout mice. These new results are consistent with our observation of increased TRPC4/Trpc4 expression in cultured human and mouse astrocytes, and are included in the revised manuscript (Figure 6—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) All data are in vitro (cultured cells) or ex vivo (slice) with no in vivo evidence that astrocytic calcium dynamics and subsequent extrasynaptic NMDA transmission are dysregulated in Rett Syndrome. While it is appreciated that not everyone is capable of imaging calcium oscillations in vivo, one relatively straight forward experiment that would start to address this point is to assess seizure susceptibility in vivo (vs. ex vivo) following astrocyte-specific knockdown or ablation of Mecp2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have collaborated with the Wang laboratory at NIMH to perform calcium imaging experiment in live mice, which replicate the in vivo environment. Consistent with our findings in cultured human and mouse astrocytes and mouse brain slices, we observed increased frequency and amplitude of spontaneous calcium activity in astrocytes in astrocyte-specific <italic>Mecp2</italic> knockout mice. These new data are included in our revised manuscript (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There are multiple inconsistencies in the data reporting changes in calcium in mutant or null astrocytes versus wild-type. Often calcium dynamics are very different across figures for the same genetic or pharmacological manipulation. For example, the calcium dynamics reported in Figure 12C,D show different levels of mutant calcium oscillation and frequency than is reported in Figure 2B,C. These discrepancies need to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>The apparent inconsistency is mostly due to poor selection of sample traces. We have included more representative sample traces in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors fail to clearly define their N numbers in their figures or results. It is not clear from reading the manuscript whether the N's provided refer to number of cells, number of experiments, etc. Given that the N's are relatively high, one would assume this represents cells. However, it is unclear how many independent experiments these N's represent. Data should be assessed from at least three independent experiments and the authors should sample similar numbers of cells across experiments. This information should be clearly outlined. Furthermore, while the authors list N's in the text, the authors should list this in each figure legend for clarity. The authors also need to list the stats and p-values for each experiment in the figure legend. This is inconsistent across the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We will include the requested information in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors conclude that evoked calcium activities are disrupted following either ATP or glutamate stimulation. The mutant or null astrocytes already have higher amplitude responses spontaneously (e.g. Figure 1E). If you compare the amplitudes of spontaneous responses to evoked responses, it appears that the actual magnitude of increase following stimulation is not different between wild-type and null or mutants astrocytes (e.g. Figure 1-amplitude increases from about 2 (spontaneous) to about 3.5 (+ATP) for WT and from about 3 (spontaneous) to about 4.5 (evoked) in MT). Therefore, the conclusion that evoked responses are different is not accurate and should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>If the increase in spontaneous and evoked calcium elevations share the same mechanism, it is rational that the scale in difference between WT and MT in spontaneous and evoked calcium activity is similar. We respectfully disagree with the reviewer that we should compare the amplitude of pharmacologically evoked calcium transients with spontaneous ones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The figures are generally very difficult to follow and could use some reorganization. For example, the authors often go back and forth between human and mouse within the same figure without clearly identifying this within the figure. In addition, a number of figures could be either combined or included as supplemental material. For example, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10 and Figure 11 could all be represented along with data from Figure 7 or included as a supplemental file.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rearranged the figures in our revised manuscript to make it easier to follow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The images presented throughout the manuscript often lack many general cell markers that would benefit interpretation of the data. In some cases, the figure lacks any images of cultures (Figure 2). Most images do not include DAPI to label all cells and no images show staining for astrocyte-specific markers. Higher magnification images should also be added to the current low magnification images. In addition, the authors list quantification in the text but these data should be included in the figure to increase clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the requested information in figures in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors need to validate sufficient knockdown of genes and reduced protein in astrocytes following shRNAs. These data can be included as supplemental.</p></disp-quote><p>We did western blot to validate shRNA knockdown efficiency and included the data in our revised manuscript (Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 13 and Figure 14, there is only quantification of mCherry labeling not loss of Mecp2 expression. The authors must quantify presence or absence of Mecp2 protein in mCherry positive and negative astrocytes and neurons. This is particularly important given that detecting Mecp2 in vivo in non-neuronal cells is notoriously difficult and typically requires amplification (Ballas et al., 2011). From the images, it is not clear that the antibody recognizes Mecp2 in uninfected astrocytes, which is important to show in order to validate loss of Mecp2 in infected astrocytes. This figure could also benefit from higher magnification images. Lastly, the authors suggest that they are creating cell-specific knockout mice. This is exaggerated as only about 27% of cells are infected.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carried out the quantification as suggested by the reviewer and included the data in our revised manuscript (Figure 8 —figure supplement 2). As for the low infection rate, it offers strong indication of the connection between loss of MeCP2 in astrocytes and the excessive activation of eNMDARs, because the phenotype of eNMDAR activation is detectable when ~1/4 of astrocytes lost MeCP2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The manuscript emphasizes that their heightened extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation has never before been reported in any RTT models. This is inaccurate. There is at least one recent paper reporting increased activation of eNMDARs in RTT (Lo et al., 2016). While it is appreciated that this effect has never been attributed to astrocytes, the text should be modified to include these published findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have cited the recent publication in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The model provided in Figure 15 is not detailed enough to add any meaningful contribution to the manuscript as a whole and could be excluded.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe Figure 15 in our original submission (Figure 9 in our revised manuscript) is a good summary of our results, and can help orient readers, and prefer to keep it unless advised otherwise by the editors.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Most data supporting the TRPC4 mechanism are in vitro. The only data showing some evidence of increased TRPC4 function in Mecp2 null mice are immunostaining in Figure S10. More data demonstrating TRPC4 expression changes and function in vivo/ex vivo would strengthen the study. For example, western blots for TRPC4 from acutely isolated astrocytes (mouse model) in addition cultured astrocytes would be helpful.</p><p>At minimum, please include in brief discussion emphasizing the need for future studies on the topic. This would help the reader and thoughtfully point out the limitations of the current work.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that most of our data on TRPC4 are in vitro. However, current methods for isolating mouse primary astrocytes involve culturing the cells for extended period (~4 weeks), so that other cell types are removed during the process. In that sense, Western blot analysis from those cells is still in vitro. In order to assess the functional relevance of <italic>Trpc4</italic> in Rett syndrome disease progression, we have generated conditional <italic>Trpc4</italic> knockout mice, and are breeding them with the <italic>Mecp2</italic> knockout mice. We plan to use astrocyte-specific Cre driver to delete <italic>Trpc4</italic> in the <italic>Mecp2</italic> knockout mice and hope to report our findings in a future paper. As suggested by the reviewers, we have included a brief discussion emphasizing the need for future studies on the topic in the Discussion section. The exact language used is “As most of our TRPC4-related data came from in vitro experiments, future in vivo studies are needed to ascertain the functional significance of increased TRPC4 expression in RTT disease progression.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors' explanation to reviewers regarding the large variability in N's is not sufficient. In many cases the N's vary by 100s of cells. For example, Figure 1C the N=526 cells for mutant cultures and N=811 for wild-type cultures. As one reviewer previously pointed out, this could greatly affect the statistical analyses. Further, it is unclear how the authors chose a particular N prior to doing statistics and it remains unclear in the manuscript how many independent experiments each data set represents.</p></disp-quote><p>We didn’t choose a particular N prior to doing statistics. We analyzed all cells with calcium activity in our experiments. The big difference in N between genotypes is caused by the biological difference between the genotypes. For the spontaneous calcium activity, because MECP2 mutant (MT) or knockout (KO) group usually have more cells showing calcium activity and have more frequent calcium events, resulting a bigger sample size N than that of the WT. Take Figure 1A-C as an example. 26 fields were randomly selected from each genotype group. Since the MT and WT cells were plated at the same density, the total number of cells imaged were about the same between the two genotypes. However, significantly more MT cells were observed to have spontaneous calcium activity than the WT cells (30% vs. 18%). When the subsequent analysis included only the cells with spontaneous calcium activity, the N for MT ended up being significantly bigger than the N for WT (408 vs. 280). This is the reason for the difference in N in all of our figures, except for those acute brain slice experiments. For the acute brain slice experiments, because the person performing the calcium imaging experiments was blind to the genotype of mice, it was impossible to make the N similar between the two genotype groups (especially when we typically used all mice in each litter, and those litters happened to have more WT mice than KO mice).</p><p>Moreover, we performed additional statistical analysis of all of existing data by randomly removing some values in the groups with bigger N to make the sample sizes the same between groups and included the results at the end of our response in a section named “Secondary Statistical Analysis”. For each of the figures with big difference in N, we performed such test three times (Random removal trials 1-3). All conclusions remained the same as before random removal of data (All data), suggesting the difference in N had no effect on our original conclusions. While it is not necessary to include such secondary analysis in our manuscript, we include it here to satisfy the reviewers.</p><p>Finally, more than three independent experiments/biological replicates (for human astrocyte data set, each independent experiment was defined as one independent differentiation; for mouse astrocyte in vitro data set, each independent experiment was defined as one isolation culture from one mouse; for mouse in situ and in vivo data set, both number of cells and number of mice were described) were included in each data set. Since many different types of data sets are presented, we chose to report the number of cells in most cases to make it easier to read, compare and interpret. The above language has been added to the Materials and methods section under the subheading of Statistics analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While the authors make more attempt to validate their cell-specific genetic manipulations of Mecp2, these data are still not quantified sufficiently. The data in Supplementary file 3 and Figure 8—figure supplement 2 only shows quantification of% cells with mCherry, GFAP, and NeuN expression. The% of NeuN+ and GFAP+ cells +/- MECP2 immunoreactivity after AAV injection should also be included here. Given that the goal is to achieve cell-type specific manipulation, these data are important.</p></disp-quote><p>We originally focused on the mCherry signal in our quantification, because it was the fluorescence marker used for targeted recording. We thank the reviewers for making this good suggestion. Table 3 and Figure 8—figure supplement 2 using a new cohort of mice. In this experiment, we quantified the percentage of MeCP2 positive/negative cells in NeuN+ and GFAP+ cells, and reported the new results in Table 4. The top row of Table 4 confirmed our expectation that almost all the mCherry positive cells are negative for MeCP2 (i.e. virus-infected cells expressed the Cre recombinase and lacked MeCP2 expression). Nonetheless, there is negligible number (2%) of NeuN+ cells that are negative for MeCP2 in the hippocampus of AAV-GFAP-mCherry-Cre injected mice, and a small number (7%) of GFAP+ cells that are negative for MeCP2 in the hippocampus of AAV-hSyn-mCherry-Cre injected mice. These results have been added to the main text of the Result section. Furthermore, for more appropriate interpretation of our results, we have changed our conclusion of those experiments from “astrocyte-specific” and “neuron-specific” to “predominantly astrocyte-specific” and “predominantly neuron-specific”. The exact language used in our revised Result section is “Further double staining with either anti-GFAP and anti-MeCP2 antibodies or anti-NeuN and anti-MeCP2 antibodies on those brain sections revealed that, while almost all mCherry-positive cells were indeed negative for MeCP2 in mice receiving either AAV virus, there was a negligible number (2%) of NeuN-positive cells that were negative for MeCP2 in the hippocampus of the AAV-GFAP-mCherry-Cre injected mice, and a small number (7%) of GFAP-positive cells that were negative for MeCP2 in the hippocampus of the AAV-hSyn-mCherry-Cre injected mice. Thus, mice with predominantly astrocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Mecp2</italic> and predominantly neuron-specific deletion of <italic>Mecp2</italic> were generated.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Many immunofluorescence images are still generally low quality. For example, in Figure 6—figure supplement 2, the background staining of TRPC4 is quite a bit higher in MECP2 null animals vs. WT. The non-specific background staining should be the same in these images to ensure a more accurate comparison. This and other figures would also benefit from some higher magnification zoom-ins in addition to the low magnification images. There is also immunostaining that is very difficult to visualize in several figures. One clear example is Figure 8—figure supplement 2 (MECP2 and NeuN immunoreactivity).</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the images in question with better quality and more representative ones (Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and Figure 8—figure supplement 2), and added higher magnification zoom-ins.</p></body></sub-article></article>
