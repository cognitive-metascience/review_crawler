melanocyte lineage. To understand how MITF regulates transcription, we used tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry to define a comprehensive MITF interactome identifying novel cofactors involved in transcription, DNA replication and repair, and chromatin organisation. We show that MITF interacts with a PBAF chromatin remodelling complex comprising BRG1 and CHD7. BRG1 is essential for melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and for normal melanocyte development in vivo. MITF and SOX10 actively recruit BRG1 to a set of MITF-associated regulatory elements (MAREs) at active enhancers. Combinations of MITF, SOX10, TFAP2A, and YY1 bind between two BRG1-occupied nucleosomes thus defining both a signature of transcription factors essential for the melanocyte lineage and a specific chromatin organisation of the regulatory elements they occupy. BRG1 also regulates the dynamics of MITF genomic occupancy. MITF-BRG1 interplay thus plays an essential role in transcription regulation in melanoma.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06857.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06857.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06857.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Melanocytes are pigment-producing cells found primarily in the skin. Many of the genes that help these cells to develop are also thought to affect the development of melanomas: an aggressive form of skin cancer that originates in these cells. One such gene encodes a protein called MITF. This protein binds to DNA and regulates genes that control the development, survival, and spread of melanocytes; it is also linked to the invasive properties of melanomas.</p><p>The MITF protein works together with partner proteins to control numerous genes, activating some while inhibiting others, by binding to nearby stretches of DNA that act as regulatory elements. Its interactions are therefore widespread and complex. Now, Laurette, Strub et al. have used techniques called tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry to identify the proteins that interact with MITF. This investigation found many new protein partners for MITF, including proteins involved in DNA damage, repair, and replication. MITF also associates with two proteins—one of which is called BRG1—that are involved in modifying how tightly DNA is packaged inside cells. DNA wrapped around proteins is known as chromatin, and if chromatin is tightly packed, the genes in that stretch of DNA cannot be easily accessed or activated.</p><p>Removing BRG1 from melanocytes and melanoma cells caused the cells to die or stop growing. When BRG1 was removed from developing mouse embryos, melanocytes failed to form. Further investigation revealed that MITF, together with another protein, localize BRG1 to sites in the melanocyte's DNA to open up the chromatin and regulate nearby genes. Furthermore, Laurette, Strub et al. report that BRG1 binds to many such elements in a characteristic manner, in which two BRG1 proteins flank the stretch of DNA bound by MITF and several other key DNA-binding proteins that together regulate many aspects of melanocyte and melanoma cell physiology.</p><p>Laurette, Strub et al. have therefore revealed many details about the molecules that activate genes in melanomas and melanocyte cells, as well as the interactions between these molecules. The results could also help researchers to understand how the BRG1 protein organises chromatin packing in other cell types.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06857.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06857.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>chromatin remodelling</kwd><kwd>SOX10</kwd><kwd>CHD7</kwd><kwd>YY1</kwd><kwd>TFAP2A</kwd><kwd>enhancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>équipe labellisée</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Irwin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (National Center for Scientific Research)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Irwin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale (National Institute of Health and Medical Research)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Irwin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC Foundation for Cancer Research)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Irwin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Institut National du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Irwin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche (L' Agence Nationale de la Recherche)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-0030-INRT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Irwin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR062547</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cornell</surname><given-names>Robert A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The PBAF chromatin-remodelling complex is essential for the proliferation of melanocytes and melanoma cells and is recruited to critical regulatory elements by physical and functional interactions with MITF, a transcription factor and master regulator of melanoma.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) factor, regulates specification, survival, and proliferation of normal melanocytes, and controls proliferation, migration and invasion of melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goding, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Widlund and Fisher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Steingrimsson et al., 2004</xref>).

We also identified novel potential MITF partners. The BPTF, SMARCA1 (SNF2L), SMARCA5 (SNF2H), and RBBP4 components of the NURF chromatin-remodelling complex associated with MITF specifically in the chromatin fraction. Components of the DNA damage response machinery including XRCC5 and XRCC6 (Ku80 and Ku70), DNA-dependent protein kinase (PRKDC), BRCA2 as well as MSH2 and MSH6 were identified along with the HECT domain-containing E3-ligase HERC2, previously implicated in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bekker-Jensen et al., 2010</xref>), and UBR5 a second HECT domain-containing E3-ligase with functions in both DNA repair and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cojocaru et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gudjonsson et al., 2012</xref>). NEURL4, a known HERC2-interacting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hakim et al., 2012</xref>), was also found along with the de-ubiquitinase enzymes USP7 and USP11 that were preferentially represented in the SNE. In contrast, USP13 shown to regulate MITF stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>) was not detected in our experiments. Several interactions were verified by immunoblot as HERC2, BRG1, USP7, USP11, XRCC5, and XRCC6 were detected in the F-H-MITF immunoprecipitations from the soluble nuclear fraction, but not in the untagged controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), with enrichment of USP7 and USP11 in the SNE compared to the CAE and the selective presence of HERC2 in the SNE.</p><p>We identified several other complexes interacting with MITF. Four subunits of TFIIIC, a RNA polymerase III cofactor were detected along with the SMCA1, SMC3, STAG2, and PDS5 cohesin subunits. TRIM28 (TIF1β, KAP1), a co-repressor belonging to a sub-family of TRIM proteins comprising TRIM24 (TIF1α) and TRIM33 (TIF1γ) was found as were the HDAC1 and HDAC2 and the HP1 proteins known to associate with TRIM-co-repressor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herquel et al., 2011</xref>). We identified TRRAP, RUVBL1, RUVBL2, and BAF53A. These proteins are already known to form a cofactor for MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murr et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, a mutation in TRRAP has recently been associated with human melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wei et al., 2011</xref>) that together with its interaction with MITF suggests a role in melanomagenesis.</p><p>In addition to transcription complexes, the RFC1, RFC2, RFC4, and RFC5 subunits of DNA replication factor C associate with MITF along with the MCM3, MCM5, and MCM7 subunits of the MCM complex that forms at DNA-replication origins. AKAP8 and AKAP8L were also identified and AKAP8 has been shown to interact with the MCM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eide et al., 2003</xref>), although these protein kinase A anchoring proteins have additional functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collas et al., 1999</xref>). The kinase PLK1 was found in the chromatin-associated fraction suggesting that it may phosphorylate MITF on chromatin. Finally, we detected multiple subunits of the nuclear pore complex. This may reflect control of MITF sub-cellular localization or a coupling of MITF-driven transcription and RNA-export. Together, these data describe a comprehensive set of MITF-interacting proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MITF interacts with a BRG1-CHD7-containing PBAF complex</title><p>While BRG1 was reported to interact with MITF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Serna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keenen et al., 2010</xref>), the composition of the complex had not been determined. We identified BRG1 (SMARCA4) as well as the PBRM1 (BAF180), SMARCC2 (BAF170), SMARCD2 (BAF60B), and ACTL6A (BAF53A) subunits along with CHD7 reported to associate with BRG1 in human neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajpai et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The MITF interacting complex most closely resembles the PBAF variant with the presence of PBRM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trotter and Archer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reisman et al., 2009</xref>). To investigate BRG1 complex composition in 501Mel cells, extracts were precipitated with an anti-BRG1 antibody showing co-precipitation of BRG1 with BAF200, BAF155, BAF53A, BAF180, and BAF170, whereas BAF60B and BAF250B were not co-precipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Peptides for BAF60B were detected in the MITF interactome, but this subunit did not associate with BRG1 in 501Mel cells, while BAF60A co-precipitated with BRG1, suggesting that MITF interacts with BAF60B independently from the BRG1 complex. The MITF-interacting complex also comprises CHD7 as seen by the reciprocal co-precipitation of BRG1 and CHD7 and their co-precipitation with MITF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>).

ShMITF knockdown resulted in cell cycle arrest and morphological changes associated with senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) accompanied by the down-regulation of around 600 genes and up-regulation of 747 genes. 60% of genes down-regulated by shMITF showed similar loss of expression upon shBRG1 consistent with the fact that MITF was strongly repressed in the shBRG1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>Commonly down-regulated genes were enriched in ontology terms associated with signalling, cell cycle, and mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Common up-regulated genes were enriched in terms associated with angiogenesis, adhesion, and migration consistent with the dramatic changes in cell morphology. MITF silencing has been shown to induce a SASP comprising <italic>CCL2</italic>, <italic>CTGF</italic> and <italic>SERPINE1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Strub et al., 2011</xref>). RNA-seq identified a putative SASP in shMITF cells comprising around 20 secreted factors and of these 15 were also induced in the shBRG1 cells, although several key factors such as <italic>IL8</italic> and <italic>CCL2</italic> were not induced upon BRG1 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Loss of either BRG1 or MITF therefore induced senescence of 501Mel cells.</p><p>SOX10, TCF/LEF/CTNNB1 and CREB have been reported to activate MITF expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goding, 2000</xref>). We noted that SOX10 expression is strongly repressed in BRG1 knockdown cells, but not in MITF-knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). SiSOX10 silencing repressed endogenous MITF expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). In 501Mel-Cl8 cells constitutively expressing 3HA-tagged MITF from the CMV promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Strub et al., 2011</xref>), siSOX10 repressed endogenous, but not ectopic MITF. In contrast, siCREB silencing had no effect on MITF expression. SOX10 is therefore a major regulator of MITF expression in 501Mel cells and its diminished expression upon BRG1 knockdown partly explains the concomitant MITF loss. These observations are also consistent with previous reports showing that SOX10 promotes melanoma cell proliferation and that its loss leads to senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cronin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the shared phenotypes of BRG1 and MITF knockdown cells resulted from the concomitant loss of MITF upon BRG1 silencing or whether BRG1 acts also as an MITF co-factor, we performed shBRG1 silencing in the 501Mel-Cl8 cells. BRG1 knockdown in these cells repressed endogenous MITF expression, but not ectopic 3HA-MITF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Nevertheless, BRG1 silencing elicited a phenotype similar to 501Mel cells characterised by arrested proliferation, and morphological changes. Many MITF target genes were similarly repressed by BRG1 silencing in both 501Mel and Cl8 cells, while SASP components were induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Together, these data show that BRG1 is essential for MITF expression and that it acts as a cofactor for MITF since ectopic MITF in the Cl8 cells does not activate target genes expression in its absence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>BRG1 and MITF regulate gene expression in human melanocytes</title><p>We also investigated BRG1 function in untransformed Hermes 3A melanocytes. In contrast to 501Mel cells, shBRG1 silencing had little effect on MITF expression in Hermes 3A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), but induced changes in cell morphology with up to 80% of cells showing staining for senescence-associated β-galactosidase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Within 8 days, the BRG1 silenced cells detached from the plate. ShMITF silencing in Hermes 3A cells also led to growth arrest and a marked changes in morphology, with flattening, enlargement of the cell body and reduced neurite projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Despite these changes indicative of senescence, &lt;50% of shMITF-silenced cells showed staining for senescence-associated β-galactosidase. As with shBRG1, MITF silencing led to cells detaching from the plate within 7 days. Thus, both BRG1 and MITF are essential for melanocyte growth, and in their absence cells undergo growth arrest, senescence, and death.</p><p>RNA-seq showed that BRG1 silencing in Hermes 3A cells down-regulated 587 genes, and up-regulated 971 genes, many fewer than in 501Mel cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Down-regulated genes were involved in pigmentation, cholesterol metabolism as well as intracellular signalling cascades and general cell morphology. Up-regulated genes were involved in cell–cell signalling and adhesion as well as angiogenesis. MITF silencing down-regulated 757 genes and up-regulated 664 genes. Comparisons showed that 38% of genes down-regulated upon BRG1 silencing were diminished by MITF silencing, while 25% of the BRG1 up-regulated genes were also increased upon MITF silencing.</p><p>Together these results show that BRG1 is critical for Hermes 3A proliferation despite the fact that it regulated a much reduced gene expression programme in these cells. As with the 501Mel cells however, MITF and BRG1 cooperate to regulate a subset of genes involved in several essential cellular processes associated with resistance to apoptosis, cell morphology, and signalling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>BRG1 is essential for generation of melanocytes in vivo</title><p>As BRG1 is essential for proliferation of both melanocytes and melanoma cells in vitro, we asked if BRG1 is also essential for melanocytes in vivo in mice.

We performed BRG1 ChIP-seq on native Mnase-digested chromatin along with a GFP-control ChIP-seq and identified &gt;42,400 BRG1-occupied sites located in inter and intragenic regions, but with relative enrichment at the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Re-analysis of cluster E revealed BRG1 localized at varying distances between −370 and +440 bp with respect to the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, clusters A–F), although it was present only on the downstream nucleosome in cluster G. BRG1 therefore appears to bind to the last (−1) nucleosome before the nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) at the TSS and the first downstream (+1) nucleosome although the distance between these nucleosomes is variable as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fenouil et al., 2012</xref>).

Integration of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) ChIP-seq data from 501Mel cells showed the peak of promoter paused Pol II located immediately upstream of the BRG1-bound +1 nucleosome.

BRG1 peaks were either positioned almost symmetrically with respect to MITF or displayed shoulders of density either upstream or downstream presumably corresponding to additional, but less well-positioned BRG1-occupied nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Genes associated with co-occupied sites are involved in previously defined critical functions of MITF such as lysosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ploper et al., 2015</xref>), pigmentation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

In addition, we also identified a set of 1065 TSS, where BRG1 occupies the nucleosomes flanking the TSS and MITF binds the NDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Almost 6000 SOX10-occupied sites were detected, but unlike MITF they were mainly located at distal regulatory elements with only around 80 sites at the proximal promoter. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). SOX10 recognition motifs were strongly enriched at SOX10 bound sites some of which were organised as degenerate palindromes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Recognition motifs for TCF/LEF, MITF, and TFAP2A were also enriched at these sites. Genes associated with these sites were enriched in several ontology terms associated with cell motion/adhesion, cell morphogenesis and organisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We integrated the SOX10 data with that of MITF, BRG1, and H3K27ac. SOX10 and MITF co-occupied 3674 sites where MITF was located either 3′ or 5′ to SOX10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

The above data define a specific organisation of MITF-associated regulatory elements (MAREs) where MITF alone or with SOX10 bind between two BRG1-bound nucleosomes.

At the <italic>TYR</italic> locus, siMITF silencing led to the specific loss of BRG1 at a promoter proximal site (* in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), whereas at the upstream site where MITF co-localized with SOX10 little change was observed (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In contrast, siSOX10 and consequent loss of both SOX10 and MITF (see above), diminished BRG1 at all sites. Interestingly, BRG1 occupancy was observed throughout the region between these sites. siSOX10 silencing led to BRG1 loss across the entire region suggesting that it is recruited to the SOX10/MITF sites and then may spread across the locus. A similar situation was observed at the <italic>CIT</italic> locus encoding a MITF-regulated gene essential for cell cycle progression, with two downstream regulatory elements comprising MITF and SOX10 sites (* and arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

Expression of SERPINE1 and IL24, two SASP components, was strongly up-regulated in senescent siMITF cells (see above). At both loci, BRG1 and MITF were present at either the promoter and/or distal regulatory regions and were lost upon siMITF coinciding with activation of their expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). These observations suggest that BRG1 recruitment by MITF at these genes acts to silence their expression.

In particular, we observed that nuclear receptor half sites were enriched at loci associated with both classes. The finding of nuclear receptor half sites associated with MITF is unexpected as little is known about nuclear receptor function in melanoma although a therapeutic role of LXRb agonists has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pencheva et al., 2014</xref>). Nuclear receptors can therefore be added to the list of factors that may interact functionally with MITF.</p><p>We next investigated whether on the other hand MITF occupancy is affected by BRG1 silencing using Cl8 cells where BRG1 loss did not affect expression of ectopic 3HA-tagged MITF (see above). Anti-HA ChIP-qPCR at MITF sites not associated with BRG1 co-occupancy showed only a mild reduction in MITF occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, group A).

Mouse genetic studies have not revealed functions for the TFE factors in development of the melanocyte lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Steingrimsson et al., 2002</xref>), however their role in melanoma has not been fully evaluated.</p><p>A striking finding of our study is the interaction of MITF with multiple proteins involved in DNA damage and repair, suggesting that MITF may influence these processes. Nevertheless, we so far found no recruitment of MITF to DNA damage sites (unpublished observations), the significance of these interactions therefore remains to be determined. Similarly, MITF associates with TFIIIC suggesting that it may regulate Pol III transcription. Alternatively, the presence of cohesin subunits in the interactome suggests that MITF may associate with TFIIIC at ‘Extra TFIIIC’ sites that organise chromatin structure in association with the cohesin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirkland et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>MITF also interacts with complexes involved in DNA replication.

Nevertheless, while the impact of BRG1 silencing is less extensive than in 501Mel cells the changes in gene expression lead to senescence and eventual cell death. As BRM is expressed in Hermes-3A cells, there is a potential for redundancy between BRG1 and BRM that could account for the less extensive effect, although it is important to note that this is not the case in 501Mel cells. BRG1 knockout in developing mouse melanocytes in vivo leads to complete loss of pigmentation and immunostaining failed to reveal the presence of Sox10 or Dct expressing cells in the hair follicle of the mutant animals. The absence of expression of these important markers indicates that there are no identifiable melanocytes in the <italic>Smarca4</italic><sup>mel−/−</sup> hair follicles. This together with the arrested proliferation and cell death seen in melanoma cells and melanocytes in vitro, indicate that loss of pigmentation most likely results from an absence of melanocytes in these animals. Together our data identify BRG1 as an essential MITF cofactor in melanoma and melanocyte/melanoblast cells in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>BRG1-YY1-SOX10-TFAP2A-MITF co-localization defines sets of MAREs with a specific chromatin organisation</title><p>BRG1 binds extensively over the melanoma cell genome often at active H3K27ac-marked enhancers consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, we describe here a novel profile where BRG1 often binds as two peaks separated by 250–800 base pairs. These BRG1 sites define two classes of elements. The first is a subset of TSS, where BRG1 occupies the nucleosomes flanking the NDR with the Pol II pause site located immediately 5′ of the +1 nucleosome. This specific positioning of BRG1 at the TSS was not noted in several previous ChIP-seq studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Euskirchen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morris et al., 2014</xref>), however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tolstorukov et al. (2013)</xref> reported that BRG1 occupies the nucleosomes flanking the TSS. Tolstorukov et al. also reported that inactivation of BRG1 does not affect the positioning of these two nucleosomes, but rather elicits a strong reduction in their occupancy. Nevertheless, the overall meta-profiles presented by Tolstorukov et al., analogous to that reported here, overlooked two important features: (1) that many promoters show BRG1 occupancy of only the −1 or +1 nucleosome, and (2) that −1 or +1 nucleosome location is variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fenouil et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The second class corresponds to TF binding sites in promoter and enhancer elements. The observed variability in distances separating the BRG1-bound nucleosomes likely reflects the number of TFs bound in the intervening regions. For example, combinations of MITF, SOX10, YY1, TFAP2A as well as other TFs such as ETS1 bind between two BRG1-bound nucleosomes. At many of these sites the BRG1-bound nucleosomes are also marked by H3K27ac, thus defining MAREs active in regulating melanocyte lineage gene expression. As SOX10, YY1, TFAP2A, and ETS1 all have important roles in melanocytes and/or melanoma, the MAREs identified here define a combinatorial signature of TFs critical for gene regulation in this lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This is further underlined by the recent finding that a combination of MITF, SOX10, and PAX3 can reprogram fibroblasts into functional melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Ondrusova et al. reported an MITF-independent pro-survival role for BRG1 in melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ondrušová et al., 2013</xref>). This observation is in agreement with our findings that BRG1 silencing affects expression of many more genes than MITF and that the binding motifs for a variety of factors other than MITF are enriched at BRG1-occupied sites. BRG1 is likely therefore to act as a cofactor for many other TFs accounting for its MITF-independent functions.</p><p>Our data are consistent with the idea that MITF and other combinations of TFs bind the DNA between two BRG1-occupied and H3K27ac-marked nucleosomes. Such an organisation has been previously proposed based on extensive ChIP-seq profiling by the Encode consortium showing that TF binding sites are often combinatorial and correspond to GC-rich, DNaseI hypersensitive NDRs flanked by two positioned nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Our data support this idea through the identification of combinatorial MAREs and they extend it by showing that the nucleosomes flanking the TF binding sites are often bound by BRG1 and marked with H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). These regulatory elements show an analogous organisation to that of the TSS that also comprise a NDR encompassing variable numbers of TF binding sites and the PIC, flanked by BRG1-bound nucleosomes. Although examples of association between BRG1 and TFs have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trotter and Archer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reisman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Euskirchen et al., 2011</xref>), this specific configuration of BRG1 binding to nucleosomes flanking the TF binding sites has not been generally recognised. In yeast, it has however been reported that TF binding sites are rather flanked by nucleosomes bound by ISWI and CHD remodellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zentner et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>While there have been many examples of co-localization between BRG1 and TFs, this is the first description of active genome-wide BRG1 recruitment. siRNA-mediated MITF or SOX10 silencing identified sites to which BRG1 was recruited either individually or cooperatively by these TFs. Moreover, we show that MITF associates with PBAF in the soluble nuclear fraction suggesting that they form a complex in the nucleoplasm and are recruited simultaneously to the chromatin to create the NDRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).</p><p>Chromatin remodelling has been shown to facilitate TF binding, a good example being that of TAL1 where BRG1 repositions nucleosomes flanking its binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, we observed that MITF occupancy of many co-occupied sites either shows little change or is increased following siBRG1 silencing suggesting that BRG1 regulates the dynamics of MITF binding. TF binding to chromatin is often extremely dynamic with ChIP capturing only a snapshot of their occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Voss and Hager, 2014</xref>). The increased MITF occupancy seen in ChIP upon BRG1 silencing suggests an increase in its time of residence at occupied sites.</p><p>Several mechanisms may explain the increased MITF binding upon BRG1 loss. The human genome comprises many more consensus E-box elements than are occupied by MITF. The excess of consensus as well as degenerate E-boxes could potentially act as a sink thus limiting the pool of MITF for binding to functional sites. One function of BRG1-driven dynamics may therefore be to limit MITF sequestration at non-functional sites and ensure a pool of MITF for binding to functional sites. Alternatively, BRG1 may be required to establish the NDRs for MITF binding, for example after mitosis, or at specific stages of the cell cycle. As siBRG1 cells are post-mitotic and senescent, the increased MITF occupancy may reflect a new steady state where MITF remains more stably bound to the NDRs established while BRG1 was still present compared to cycling cells where the NDRs are established and erased in a more dynamic manner. Irrespective of the underlying causes, our results indicate that BRG1 regulates dynamic MITF interactions with chromatin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of 501Mel cells stably expressing F-H-MITF</title><p>501Mel cells cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) were transfected with a CMV-based vector expressing Flag-HA-tagged MITF and a vector encoding puromycin resistance.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor), Michael Green (Reviewing editor), and two expert reviewers (Collin Goding and Narendra Wajapeyee).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper from Laurette et al. presents the first comprehensive Mass Spec analysis of MITF-interacting factors, and then goes on focus on the role of BRG1 containing-chromatin-remodelling complex in melanocytes and melanoma. They undertake genome-wide ChIP-seq analsysis of BRG1, and tie this to RNA-seq following BRG1 knock-down. This is then intersected with previously published MITF ChIP-seq and RNA seq-data sets, as well a new SOX10 ChIP seq analysis. Further intersection is performed using a previously published YY1 data set as well as ENCODE H3K27 ChIP-seq. A melanocyte-specific BRG1 knockout mouse is also presented for the first time.</p><p>Some results are not new and the novel insights into the biology of melanocytes and melanoma are limited. As readily acknowledged by the authors of this manuscript, previous work from the de la Serna lab has established that the SWI/SNF complex is a co-factor for MITF, while the Vachtenheim lab has shown that the SWI/SNF complex is required in cell lines for MITF expression. As such, it is not surprising that either knockout of BRG1 in melanocytes gives pigmentation phenotype, or that many MITF targets are also BRG1 targets.</p><p>That said, the data presented here, by adopting a genome-wide approach go much further than previous work, and while some of the genome-wide analysis could be classified as somewhat descriptive (as is the nature of most genome-wide ChIP-/RNA-seq analyses), the results presented will provide an invaluable resource for the melanocyte-/melanoma field.</p><p>For example, previous work could not distinguish between a requirement of the SWI/SNF complex in regulating MITF target genes because it is also needed for MITF expression or because it acts as a co-factor for MITF at those targets. In this paper the genome-wide approaches do nicely distinguish between those possibilities, and moreover, go on to show SOX10 genome-wide occupancy and co-occupancy with the SWI/SNF complex. The genome-wide analyses are very nicely done and provide key insights into the regulatory landscape of melanocytes and melanoma.</p><p>The Mass Spec analysis that identifies a wide range of MITF interacting factors is also novel and will again provide an excellent resource for the field.</p><p>Because of this, the positive aspects of the work presented greatly outweigh the lack of novelty in a few areas.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) In the subsection headed “BRG1 regulates an extensive gene expression programme essential for proliferation of 156 melanoma cells in vitro”, the authors state that 'MITF and BRG1 cooperate to activate these critical pathways', yet at this stage of the paper the authors cannot state whether the effects arise because of BRG1-mediated regulation of MITF or via BRG1 acting as an MITF co-factor. The word 'cooperate' to my mind tends to indicate the latter, rather than the former. While this issue is resolved later, at this stage it is not clear which of the two possibilities is more important.</p><p>2) In the subsection headed “BRG1 and MITF regulate gene expression in human melanocytes”, the authors mention that in Hermes cells BRG1 silencing affected fewer genes than in melanoma cells. Is this because fewer genes are expressed or highly expressed? Is BRG1 protein level greatly reduced? Some comment to discuss why there is this difference would be useful.</p><p>3) The melanocyte-specific BRG1 knock out mice clearly show a pigmentation phenotype. Almost certainly this arises because of the requirement for BRG1 in MITF expression and a loss of melanoblasts during development. However, formally the authors have not distinguished between a shut-down of pigmentation genes vs. loss of melanoblasts in development.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, a higher magnification image of the senescent cells, perhaps as an additional panel, would be useful.</p><p>5) Some parts of the Results section of the manuscript read like discussion and are speculative. For example, the first subsection of the Results discusses the possible role of the MITF interacting protein without providing any experimental evidence. This should therefore either be moved to the Discussion section or completely removed.</p><p>6) The effect of BRG1 knockdown on MITF expression is interesting. In particular because authors see downregulation of MITF due to BRG1 knockdown in melanoma cells but not in melanocytes. What is the reason behind this differential effect of BRG1 knockdown on MITF expression and what are its implications for regulation of MITF mediated transcription regulation by BRG1?</p><p>7) BRG1 has limited impact on the gene transcription in melanocytes.

As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>, the distribution of gene expression is very similar in both cell types. Thus, there are not fewer highly expressed genes in Hermes cells than in 501Mel cells.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06857.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06857.026">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06857.026</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06857-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Also, the immunoblot analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows that Brg1 protein levels are comparably repressed in Hermes 3A and 501Mel cells and importantly that the knockdown in Hermes cells is sufficient to induce senescence and eventual cell death. Thus the difference in the number of affected genes is unlikely to be explained by inefficient BRG1 silencing in Hermes cells. Our results rather suggest that the function of PBAF with BRG1 while critical is less ubiquitous in these cells than in 501Mel. Perhaps other variants of the SWI/SNF complexes with the related BRM subunit also play an important role in gene regulation in these cells. Our RNA-seq data shows that BRM is expressed in Hermes cells and its expression (as well as the genes encoding all other SWI/SNF subunits) is not affected by BRG1 silencing. There is therefore a potential for redundancy in these cells between BRG1 and BRM, although it is important to note that this is not the case in 501Mel cells where BRM is also expressed. Several of the additional comments below are related to this point. In the future it will be important to address this issue, but it is beyond the scope of the present study. We have modified the Discussion to take this issue into account.</p><p><italic>3) The melanocyte-specific BRG1 knock out mice clearly show a pigmentation phenotype. Almost certainly this arises because of the requirement for BRG1 in MITF expression and a loss of melanoblasts during development. However, formally the authors have not distinguished between a shut-down of pigmentation genes vs. loss of melanoblasts in development</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the referees on this point and this is why we came back to this point in the Discussion to say that ‘while it is formally possible that melanoblasts develop in these mice, but do not produce melanin/melanosomes for pigmentation, the arrested proliferation and cell death seen in melanoma cells and melanocytes in vitro, rather indicate that loss of pigmentation resulted from absence of melanocytes in these animals<italic>’</italic>. Nevertheless, we have added new data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> showing immunostaining of hair shafts from <italic>Smarca4</italic><sup>lox/+</sup> or <italic>Smarca4</italic><sup>mel-/-</sup> animals with antibodies against Dct and Sox10.

In Hermes melanocytes in vitro<italic>, DCT</italic> expression is strongly repressed by shBRG1 thus one could argue that in vivo the absence of Dct staining does not exclude the possible presence of immature or partially differentiated melanocytes that do not express this marker. However <italic>SOX10</italic> expression is not affected by BRG1 silencing in Hermes melanocytes in vitro, and is a marker for immature transient amplifying cells, yet there is no Sox10 expression in the mutant hair shafts in vivo.

In particular because authors see downregulation of MITF due to BRG1 knockdown in melanoma cells but not in melanocytes. What is the reason behind this differential effect of BRG1 knockdown on MITF expression and what are its implications for regulation of MITF mediated transcription regulation by BRG1</italic>?</p><p>In 501Mel cells, our results suggest two important contributions of BRG1 to MITF expression. The first is via SOX10. We showed the BRG1 silencing strongly down-regulates SOX10 expression and that SOX10 is required to activate MITF expression. The second pathway by which BRG1 may act to regulate MITF expression is through MITF auto-regulation. This is suggested by the colocalisation of MITF and BRG1 at H3K27ac marked elements of the MITF locus suggesting that these may be enhancer elements via which MITF may regulate its own expression. Clearly the situation is very different in melanocytes. In melanocytes, SOX10 expression is not reduced by BRG1 silencing and thus may contribute to maintenance of MITF expression. A role for SOX10 in modulating MITF expression in Hermes 3A cells has previously been described by the Ronai lab (Shah et al., 2010). In melanocytes in which BRG1 is silenced, MITF remains expressed, but 30% of the genes regulated by MITF are down-regulated. These data show that part of the MITF-directed gene expression program in melanocytes is co-regulated by BRG1.</p><p><italic>7) BRG1 has limited impact on the gene transcription in melanocytes. Therefore, it is possible that the observed effect of BRG1 on melanocytes may be due to transcription regulation independent function of BRG1. It will be important to rule out this possibility</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the referees that there may be transcription independent functions of BRG1 such as in DNA and repair and recombination as already documented by other studies. Nevertheless, there is an effect of BRG1 silencing on transcription in melanocytes and while it is less extensive than in 501Mel cells, it is sufficient to induce their senescence. It is not because the number of genes that are BRG1 dependent is reduced that BRG1 has no role in transcription in these cells.</p><p><italic>8) A previous study shows that BRG1 can function as a pro-survival gene independent of MITF (Ondrusova et al., PloS One, 2013). How do the authors reconcile their results in light of these studies</italic>?</p><p>Our data show that BRG1 is recruited to regulatory elements not only by MITF, but also by SOX10. Moreover, the binding motifs for a variety of factors are enriched at BRG1-occupied sites suggesting that it can be recruited to the genome of melanoma cells by many other transcription factors. This is also in accordance with the fact that BRG1 silencing affects expression of many more genes than MITF. BRG1 is likely therefore to act as a cofactor for many other transcription factors and thus explaining how it can act independently of MITF. A sentence on this has been added to the Discussion.</p><p>Also Dr. Peter Rodgers, the Features editor, suggested that we modify the title to read: ‘Combinatorial binding of the transcription factor MITF and the transcription activator BRG1 define specific chromatin configurations of melanoma cell regulatory elements’. We have chosen: ‘Transcription factor MITF and the remodeller BRG1 define chromatin organisation at regulatory elements in melanoma cells’.</p></body></sub-article></article>
