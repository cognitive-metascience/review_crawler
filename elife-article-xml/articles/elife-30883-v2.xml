Few studies to date have directly addressed the relevance of T cell-intrinsic MyD88 signaling pathways for the establishment of in vivo cognate Th1 responses in the context of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frazer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">LaRosa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Raetz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). Although these studies reported that the absence of T-cell intrinsic MyD88 signaling severely impact the immune response, the Toll/IL-1R homologous region (TIR) domain-containing receptor upstream of MyD88 acting on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was either not investigated or not identified and, therefore, remains speculative. Thus, presently, no consensus exists about the relative contribution of different receptors upstream MyD88 necessary for sustaining a robust Th1 response and contributing to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell memory formation in a model of infection.</p><p>Cytokines of the IL-1 family contribute for the reinforcement and/or stabilization of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell lineage commitment into each of the main Th phenotypes: Th17, Th1 and Th2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acosta-Rodriguez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2009</xref>). While the essential contribution of direct IL-1R signaling for the differentiation of Th17 cells has been documented in the EAE mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2009</xref>), the direct effect of IL-1 or IL-33 on the expansion of Th1 cells remains a more controversial issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Sasson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schenten et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Villarreal and Weiner, 2014</xref>). IL-18 was initially shown to synergize with IL-12 for IFN-γ production by Th1 cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Robinson et al., 1997</xref>), but its essential role in promoting Th1 responses to infection was not always confirmed in the context of <italic>in vivo</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haring and Harty, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Monteforte et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, although in other circumstances <italic>Il18<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice show a diminished Th1 response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takeda et al., 1998</xref>), this phenotype cannot be uniquely ascribed to the lack of response of T cells to IL-18, as IL-18 also potentiates the secretion of IFN-γ by other cells, like NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takeda et al., 1998</xref>), which could in turn impact on Th1 response. In fact, NK-derived IFN-γ has a profound influence on Th1 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scharton and Scott, 1993</xref>). Therefore, the full significance of T-cell intrinsic IL-1R and IL-18R signaling for Th1 responses to infection <italic>in vivo</italic> is still an important issue that needs further clarification.</p><p>To investigate the role of T-cell intrinsic MyD88 signaling on Th1 differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>, here we have infected mixed bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice with the intracellular protozoan <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, the etiologic agent of Chagas’ disease (<italic>American trypanosomiasis</italic>), a neglected emerging disease, which is endemic in Latin America. Several TLRs are involved in the protection against <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice are highly susceptible to infection, displaying low levels of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bafica et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caetano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oliveira et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rodrigues et al., 2012</xref>). Although the absence of TLR signaling in APCs of <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice may lead to their deficient activation and may explain a limited Th1 polarization response, these former results do not exclude the possibility that the absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-intrinsic MyD88 signaling through IL-1R family members could also be an important factor for the deficient levels of Th1 cells in <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. Here, we tested this hypothesis by comparing WT and <italic>Myd88-</italic>, <italic>Il1r1-</italic> or <italic>Il18r1</italic>-deficient T cells in infected mixed BM chimeras. Besides comparing T cell numbers, BrdU incorporation and the expression of IFN-γ, CCR5 and CD44 by flow cytometry, we also analyzed the transcriptional profile of WT and <italic>Myd88</italic>-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, sorted from infected mixed BM chimeric mice. Our results revealed, for the first time, the critical role of T cell-intrinsic IL-18R/MyD88 signaling for mounting a robust Th1 cognate response, as a consequence of proliferation, protection from apoptosis and expression of activation/memory genes during infection with an intracellular pathogen. Furthermore, we demonstrated the high susceptibility of <italic>Il18r1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice to infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, which could be rescued by the adoptive transfer of WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. In summary, the present study unambiguously demonstrates the crucial role of T cell-intrinsic IL-18R/MyD88 signaling for a robust Th1 cognate response against an important human pathogen and discloses the mechanistic framework underlying it.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Myd88<sup>−/− </sup></italic>Th1 cells attain lower frequencies in infected mixed BM chimeras</title><p>We first generated BM chimeras in which WT mice were irradiated and reconstituted with either WT or <italic>Myd88<sup>−/− </sup></italic>BM cells. Infected <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic>→WT mice die earlier than WT→WT chimeras, displaying mortality kinetics similar to non-chimeric <italic>Myd88<sup>−/− </sup></italic>and WT mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). This result shows that chimeric mice lacking MyD88 expression exclusively in cells of hematopoietic origin present a higher level of susceptibility to infection, similar to <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. Next, we generated mixed BM chimeras. For this, irradiated WT B6 x B6.SJL F1 (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>CD45.2<sup>+</sup>) mice were reconstituted with a 1:1 mix of WT (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>) and <italic>Myd88<sup>−/− </sup></italic>(CD45.2<sup>+</sup>) BM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Six to 8 weeks after reconstitution, non-infected mixed chimeric mice show equivalent frequencies of WT and <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic>CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). Including residual WT recipient cells (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>CD45.2<sup>+</sup>), the mixed BM chimeras have more than 50% of WT DC in their spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) able to be fully activated by TLR pathways during infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. At day 14 pi, we observed a preferential expansion of WT CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells at the expense of <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic>CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells and, to a lower extent, of WT CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, at the expense of <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic>CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). This scenario was even more dramatic when the frequencies of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> cells among WT and <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were analyzed. In order to determine the frequency of Ag-specific IFN-γ-producing CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, total splenocytes from infected mixed BM chimeras were cultured in the presence of the K<sup>b</sup>-restricted TSKB20 peptide, an immunodominant CD8 epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>). Infected APCs, present in the spleen of infected mice, are able to induce Ag-specific stimulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <italic>in vitro,</italic> without the need of adding extra <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-derived Ag into the cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>, the frequency of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of <italic>Myd88<sup>−/− </sup></italic>origin was severely diminished compared to the frequency of WT IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The levels of <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic>IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were also diminished compared to WT IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but to a lower extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and H</xref>). In mixed BM chimeras, similar to what was found in WT B6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>), CD4<sup>+</sup>IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> T cells are first detected around day 10 pi, their numbers attain a maximum around day 14 pi and then begin to decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, kinetic differences cannot explain the observed disparity in the percentages of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> cells between WT and <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30883.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lower expansion of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> <italic>Myd88<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>cells in infected mixed BM chimeras.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Survival curves of mice infected ip with 2 × 10<sup>3</sup> blood trypomastigotes of the Y strain.

First, we performed a kinetic study of the presence of IL-1β and IL-18 in the serum of infected B6 mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, a higher level of IL-1β was detected on day 13 pi, although an early peak of this cytokine was also detected at 12 hr after infection. On the other hand, we could only detect IL-18 at a later time point of infection, at day 13 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Note that peaks of IL-1β and IL-18 at day 13 pi were paralleled by increased percentages of Th1 cells in the spleen of infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We then analyzed the expression of IL-1R1 and IL-18R1 receptors on splenic T cells from infected B6 mice (at day 14 pi) and from non-infected controls. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, at this time point of infection, around 50% of CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells express the master gene of Th1 cells, T-bet, and the majority of T-bet<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expresses IL-18R1 but not IL-1R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

To further dissect this issue, we stained splenic T cells from infected B6 mice with anti-CD44 and anti-CD62L.

Note that no difference on the percentage of IL-1R1<sup>+</sup> cells among CM CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was found between infected and non-infected control mice.

Although previous studies, in different models of infection, have shown the importance of MyD88 signaling intrinsic to T cells, none of those works has identified the receptor upstream the MyD88 adaptor molecule playing a determinant role for the Th1 response <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frazer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">LaRosa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Raetz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). IL-18 has been reported as a relevant factor in protective immunity against several intracellular pathogens and its functions <italic>in vivo</italic> are multiple, being produced by and acting on different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nakanishi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garlanda et al., 2013</xref>). The role of IL-18 in Th1 differentiation has been however neglected, maybe because it has been shown dispensable for Th1 development under certain circumstances, as for example when IL-12 is present in high levels, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haring and Harty, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Monteforte et al., 2000</xref>). IL-18 synergizes with IL-12 in promoting IFN-γ secretion and Th1 differentiation, but it is not capable of promoting Th1 polarization <italic>per se</italic> and it is thus considered a reinforcing or stabilizing factor for Th1 commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Robinson et al., 1997</xref>) and reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berenson et al., 2004</xref>). Early in the process of Th1 differentiation, IFN-γ is required to induce nuclear factors as T-bet and IRF1 and it is necessary for the expression of the IL-12 receptor β1 subunit (IL-12Rβ1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kano et al., 2008</xref>). Then, IL-12 signaling drives the up-regulation of IL-18Rα expression, which can next be maximized by IL-18 itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smeltz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berenson et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>GSEA analysis of our microarray data revealed that sets of genes involved in proliferation and protection from apoptosis were upregulated in WT in comparison to their expression in <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

Therefore, together, these results indicate that the lack of intrinsic IL-18R signaling in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells phenocopied the absence of MyD88 signaling, resulting in lower Th1 cell numbers <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>It is worth noting that the majority of our analyses were performed at the peak of detection of the Th1 response in our system, day 14 pi, when the parasite is still present in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>). In this aspect, our present study differs from a recent report where the importance of IL-18R/MyD88 signaling for a noncognate Th1 response was put in evidence at later time points of infection with <italic>Salmonella,</italic> by the injection of LPS, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">O'Donnell et al., 2014</xref>), apparently in a TCR-independent way, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Robinson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berenson et al., 2004</xref>). The hypothesis that other MyD88-dependent T-cell intrinsic signaling, as TLR-pathways, might also be relevant for the Th1 response in the present system is, in our opinion, unlikely. We and others have previously shown that <italic>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> as well as <italic>Tlr2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice infected with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> display normal levels of CD4<sup>+</sup>IFNγ<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bafica et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>). The possibility that TLR7 or TLR9, would play an intrinsic role in T cells would most likely require the phagocytosis of the parasite by T cells, in order to allow parasite-derived RNA and DNA to reach endosomal TLRs, a non-reported fact in T cells. The hypothesis that other MyD88-mediated signaling pathways, as IFN-γ-induced IRF1<styled-content style="background-color: #ffffff;"> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Negishi et al., 2006</xref>)</styled-content>, might be also contributing for Th1 response was not formally disproven here. However, we believe that our data, showing an insufficient expansion of IL-18R-defective Th1 cells, of the same magnitude as observed for MyD88-defective Th1 lymphocytes, even in an environment where WT APCs are abundant, argue in favor of a model where the lack of a strong Th1 response observed in <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice is mostly due to the absence of IL-18R signaling in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>A recent report also detected the importance of T-cell intrinsic MyD88 signaling for the induction of functionally competent Th1 and memory CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells, using <italic>Myd88<sup>FL/FL</sup>Cd4-cre</italic> mice immunized with antigen plus adjuvant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schenten et al., 2014</xref>). This is in agreement with our GSEA analysis, showing that sets of genes related to central and effector memory were up-regulated in WT, but not in <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. In the cited study, however, the responsible pathway upstream MyD88 was attributed to IL-1R, which was shown to render naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells refractory to Treg cell-mediated suppression. Although we have not studied the memory response in the infection model here, we also found a significant lower percentage of cells expressing high levels of the CD44 activation/memory marker among CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells lacking IL-1R expression, as well as among <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Il18r1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Concerning the Th1 response, however, we could not detect any defect in IL-1R-deficient cells. Moreover, we found that contrary to IL-18R, IL-1R is not expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. This apparent discrepancy between the cited study and ours may be due to differences in the inflammatory response and cytokine milieu between an infection model and the Ag plus adjuvant system employed by Schenten and collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schenten et al., 2014</xref>). It is possible that diverse, higher and/or more prolonged cytokine levels are attained in the infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> compared to Ag plus adjuvant immunization. Possibly, during infection, another cytokine, such as IL-6, might be replacing the missing IL-1R signaling in T conventional cells to overcome Treg-mediated suppression, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nish et al., 2014</xref>). It is also worthwhile to note that employing the system of mixed BM chimeras allowed us to compare WT and gene-deficient T cells competing with each other and being submitted to the same inflammatory milieu. Mixed BM chimera strategy also circumvents compensatory mechanisms observed in some knockout mouse strains.</p><p>We have also studied here the susceptibility of <italic>Il18r1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice to infection with <italic>T. cruzi.</italic> This strain exhibited parasitemia as high as <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice and survival and parasite load in the myocardium at intermediary levels, between <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and WT mice. Both <italic>Il18r1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice have diminished levels of Th1 cells, but CD8<sup>+</sup> T responses were not affected, as predicted by our previous work showing intact in vivo Ag-specific cytotoxicity in <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>). Although <italic>Il18<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were shown to be resistant to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Graefe et al., 2003</xref>), discrepancy between the outcomes in <italic>Il18r1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> versus <italic>Il18<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice was also previously documented for infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and in autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutcher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneider et al., 2010</xref>). The reason for this fact is not clear so far, but a reported compensatory mechanism increasing IL-12 production in <italic>Il18<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice may explain the observed higher resistance of this strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Monteforte et al., 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, we clearly demonstrated here that <italic>Il18r1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice display low levels of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and are highly susceptible to infection. These results are consistent with our findings demonstrating the essential role of T cell-intrinsic IL-18R/MyD88 signaling for cognate Th1 response to this parasite. Furthermore, the adoptive transfer of WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was able to reduce parasitemia to WT levels in both <italic>Il18r1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> infected mice, in an IFN-γ-dependent way, and to improve survival in both strain. However, mortality was brought to WT rate only in the adoptively transferred <italic>Il18r1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> strain. These results are in accordance with the fact that mortality due to infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> is not always a simple and direct correlation to parasitemia. Instead, in some cases, mortality is due to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hölscher et al., 2000</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that other MyD88-independent innate mechanisms, as the TLR4/TRIF pathway, might be responsible for this putative pro-inflammatory effect in <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, tissue-tolerance mechanisms, possibly involving MyD88-dependent feedback control responses, might protect the host from immune- or pathogen-inflicted damage and would be impaired in <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. This hypothesis is presently being investigated in our laboratory.</p><p>In conclusion, our work unequivocally demonstrates that the absence of IL-18R exclusively in T cells during infection leads to a deficient cognate Th1 response. By excluding other cell types, as NK cells and the IL-1R receptor-signaling pathway in this process, our work brings a conceptual advance to the field. Adding to the established paradigm of TLR/MyD88-dependent activation of APCs for IL-12 production and the resulting initiation of Th1 response, our data demonstrated the critical role of T cell-intrinsic IL-18R/MyD88 signaling for the reinforcement of Th1 response in vivo, placing MyD88-dependent signaling pathways on the control of multiple phases of Th1 response: co-stimulation, differentiation, expansion and memory establishment. Altogether, the results presented here disclose and extend a mechanistic framework for understanding CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, whose optimization may provide new therapeutic and vaccination strategies to combat intracellular pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and ethics statement</title><p>C57BL/6, B6.SJL and (B6 x B6.SJL) F1 mice were obtained from the Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF, Niterói, Brazil). <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were generated by Dr. S.

You, however, have embarked on a study of a somewhat contradictory aspect of MyD88 signaling by investigating the contribution of cytokine receptors, namely IL-1R and IL-18R, which together with MyD88 may be necessary to maintain Th1 responses to prevent infections.

However, on the basis of strength of the evidence that you present here, the conclusions in regard to the predominant role of IL-18R signaling in T cells following <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection are not fully supported. Although your experimental approaches utilizing various bone marrow mixed chimeras combined with the various knockout mice are quite impressive, the experiments also lack robustness.</p><p>Unedited reviews from all three reviewers are included.

These authors are guided by several contradictory observations concerning the contribution of cytokine receptors, namely IL-1R and IL-18R, which together with MyD88 may be necessary to maintain Th1 responses necessary to prevent infections. They have embarked on a set of rather ambitious experiments, utilizing bone marrow mixed chimeras and <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup>, IL1R<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>IL18R<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice to test the hypothesis that the absence of MyD88 signaling involving IL-1R family in CD4 T cells might be important factor contributing to deficient Th1 cells in <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. According to the evidence that they present, it is IL-18R/MyD88 signaling in CD4 T cells that is needed for a proper Th1 (IFN-γ) response, activation of memory genes, and protection from apoptosis in Trypanosoma cruzi infected mice. The observation that signaling by MyD88 and IL-18R in CD4 T cells from mice infected with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> might indeed by novel.</p><p>However, I find this rather ambitious and extensive study to be lacking rigorous experimental approach. The <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> results are quite important in support of their hypothesis, yet they are relegated to the supplemental section. Moreover, gating strategies need to be shown for the cells isolated from the Rag<sup>-/-</sup> recipients. Apart from expressing the results as% , the authors need to include cell numbers. This is true for all other results where the authors have chosen to express cellular responses as percentages. This is simply insufficient. In relation to the cell numbers, what proportion of CD4 T cells are specific for <italic>T. cruzi</italic> following infection? Is it possible just to sort all of the CD45.1 and then CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and assume that all of them are Tc specific?</p><p>Another serious concern is the number of mice used per experiment or the number of times a given experiment was performed. In general I find it difficult to trust statistics performed on responses from 3 or 4 mice. Also, what do the authors mean that a given experiment was performed either 3 or 4 times?</p><p>What are the percentages of CD45.2 vs. CD45.1 in the plot 1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>?</p><p>It also appears that results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, plot A are the same as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. Is that true? The authors state in subsection “Lack of T cell-intrinsic IL-18R or MyD88 signaling leads to lower frequencies of Th1 cells but does not affect CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs” these results were from a different set of chimeras.</p><p>Is it possible that a transfer of a higher numbers of sorted CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) would have been more effective in <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> recipients?</p><p>In addition, the writing itself is missing many details that detracts from my general enthusiasm about this body of work. I found the paper very difficult to read as I had to constantly move from the Results section to the Figure legends to find some necessary bit of information, which often was either contradictory or missing (Legends for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The results concerning CD11c DC appear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) out of nowhere and one is not clear if these data are derived from LN or spleens and at which time point after infection. The same is true for using the Kb-restricted TSKB20 peptide. I would think that a preface for including CCR5 in the analysis is missing hence one is not clear as to why it was even measured.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this study, Oliveira, Gomes-Neto and colleague demonstrate that IL18R signaling has a T cell-intrinsic role in inducing Th1 responses against <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. I think this is an important and significant study for two reasons</p><p>a) It solves a controversial issue, ie. The role of MyD88, TLR and IL-1 in the induction of Th1 responses in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection.</p><p>b) It advances our understanding of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in pathogenic infections.</p><p>The paper is novel, well organized and performed, clearly written</p><p>I have few questions that the authors may address:</p><p>1) Why is IL18 crucial for expansion of T cells but not IFN-γ production on a per cell basis? The authors do not discuss this interesting observation.</p><p>2) How much IL18 and how much IL1 are produced during <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection. Can the authors measure serum levels of IL18 and IL1 at different timepoints?</p><p>3) What are the major sources of IL18 in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection? Antigen presenting cells or stromal cells?</p><p>4) What are the stimuli that induce I18 production? Which stimuli induce IL18 during <italic>T. cruzi</italic>?</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Overall, this work seems to lack significant conceptual advance to be of interest to the broader readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the presented data completely support the conclusions the authors have drawn in regard to the predominant role of IL-18R signaling in T cells following <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection. Specifically:</p><p>1) Staining for IL-18R and IL-1R on T cells from infected mice should be performed, potentially with an assessment of IL1-R family receptor expression on parasite antigen-specific T cells.</p><p>2) The authors suggest a crucial role for IL-18R, however, the presented data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of T cell phenotypes suggest an additional role for IL-1R on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>3) Although a statistically significant contribution of IL-1R to the frequency of CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells is seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), IFN-γ expression seems unaffected in the absence of IL-1R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). It is unclear why WT cells in the WT:IL1-R mixed BM chimeras in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> are not making as much IFN-γ as the WT cells within the other mixed chimeras (WT:Myd88; WT:IL-18R) – this may suggest a greater, unexplored role for non-T cells. These additional signals may be absent when half of the non-T cells also lack expression of MyD88 or IL-18R.</p><p>4) The in vivo survival data suggest that IL-18R does not account for all of the MyD88-dependent responses, reflecting previous studies that TLR signaling and other IL-1R family members may play a role in T cell expansion, survival, activation, and/or IFN-γ production.</p><p>5) Parasite clearance seem to be largely unaffected in the absence of IL-18R signaling, both by time course parasitemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and parasite load in the myocardium at day 14 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These data would suggest that, following pathogen clearance, other MyD88-dependent mechanisms are accounting for the observed survival differences. It would be important to know if T cells are mediating these effects since the authors also suggest MyD88-dependent signaling in the tissue may be largely responsible for parasite control.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30883.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] The Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> results are quite important in support of their hypothesis, yet they are relegated to the supplemental section.</p></disp-quote><p>Mixed bone-marrow chimeras have been classically employed in order to test the in vivorole of molecules intrinsic to cells of hematopoietic origin. In these studies, as in ours, a 1:1 mixture of wild type and knockout/mutant derived BM reconstitute irradiate recipients. Alternatively, when the cell type being investigated is a T lymphocyte, <italic>Rag<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice can be reconstituted with a mixture of total spleen, or purified mature T cells, derived from different donors, without the need of host irradiation. However, in this case, the B cell compartment is not fully reconstituted and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) of donor origin are minimally present (if at all) in the <italic>Rag<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>host. In our manuscript, the focus of study is the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population in a model of infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. Survival to infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> also depends on the presence of a B cell response (Cardillo et al., 2007). Consequently, due to the lack of B cells, the T-cell reconstituted <italic>Rag<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>mice are quite susceptible to the infection, even when reconstituted with 100% WT T cells, dying early after infection. Therefore, we concluded that, for this infection model, mixed-BM chimeric mice were more appropriate to test the role of T-cell intrinsic expression of the IL-1R/MyD88 and IL-18R/MyD88 signaling pathways for Th1 differentiation and expansion. Nevertheless, we did control experiments using 1:1 WT:<italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> reconstituted <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice to rule out effects of body irradiation and to compare WT and <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in a system where APCs are basically 100% WT, since the possibility (although remote) existed that T cell activation might be affected in irradiated BM-reconstituted hosts, in which part of the APCs lack expression of MyD88. As already shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> in the first version of the manuscript, the data obtained in reconstituted <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice confirmed the results obtained in the irradiated mixed BM chimeras. Since the results we’ve obtained in the two models were essentially the same, we originally thought it was better to show one representative experiment with reconstituted <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. But following reviewer #1 request, we have moved these results to novel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, now including gating strategies and the percentage and absolute numbers of WT and <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IFN-γ in <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. We have also created <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> to display gating strategies and the percentage and absolute numbers of WT and <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IFN-γ in reconstituted <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Please note that, in order to increase the levels of B cells, <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice reconstituted 6 week earlier with a 1:1 mixture of WT and <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> splenocytes, received a second injection of 1:1 mixture of WT and <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> splenocytes 6 hrs before being infected, as now described in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, gating strategies need to be shown for the cells isolated from the Rag<sup>-/-</sup> recipients.</p></disp-quote><p>Gating strategies for cells from the reconstituted <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2— figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Apart from expressing the results as% , the authors need to include cell numbers.

Is it possible just to sort all of the CD45.1 and then CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and assume that all of them are Tc specific?</p></disp-quote><p>We have some difficulty in understanding which is exactly the point raised by the reviewer here, as we do not claim at any moment in the manuscript that the totality of sorted CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-specific. In the past, massive T cell responses to <italic>T. cruzi,</italic> as well as to other pathogens, such as certain viruses, were interpreted as mostly polyclonal and nonspecific. However, with the advent of MHC-tetramer technology and other pieces of evidence, it was shown that a higher percentage of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells activated during acute viral infection was in fact virus-specific, than had previously been estimated. In fact, up to 50% of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells responding during the peak of viral infection can be specific for a single epitope (Murali-Krishna et al., 1998). Immunodominant <italic>T. cruzi</italic> CD8 epitopes, as well as a large number of specific subdominant CD8 epitopes, have also been described. These studies have revealed that selected members of the <italic>trans</italic>-sialidase gene family were natural targets for <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection-induced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which can represent &gt;30% of the entire CD8 compartment at the peak of the response in mice (reviewed in Tarleton 2015). As trypanosomatids have an extensively larger genome than viruses, one may expect that a larger number of pathogen-derived epitopes is presented to T cells. However, to the present, the exact proportion or numbers of specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells against <italic>T. cruzi</italic> have not been fully evaluated. Moreover, defined immunodominant I-Ab-restricted CD4 epitopes derived from the Y-strain have not been described yet. Nevertheless, different studies have demonstrated that a significant proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells produces IFN-γ in response to parasite Ags in infected humans and mice and that these responses are not a generalized non-specific activation of cells during infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (Martin &amp; Tarleton 2005). In our present manuscript, as well as in previous works of our group and from others (Oliveira et al., 2010), 4 to 12% of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the spleen of B6 infected mice secreted IFN-γ in an Ag-dependent way. Moreover, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, we found that the percentage of cells expressing high levels of the activation/memory marker CD44, among CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes in infected chimeras at day 14 pi, varies from 55% (among <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup>) to 85% (among WT CD4<sup>+</sup>). Absolute numbers of CD44high CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>, also indicating a huge increase in the number of activated/memory cells. Moreover, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> now shows that, in infected mice, most CD44hiCD4<sup>+</sup> T cells do not express CD62L, which is the phenotype of effector and effector memory (TEM) cells. On the other hand, around 10% of total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells display the CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup> TCM (central memory) phenotype at day 14 pi. Previous works have also demonstrated that high numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> TEM cells are generated in response to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (Martin &amp; Tarleton 2005). Therefore, activated effector and both TEM and TCM memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are highly represented in our sorting experiment, mainly among WT cells, and the results obtained in the microarray essay of sorted CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells simply reflect this fact.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another serious concern is the number of mice used per experiment or the number of times a given experiment was performed.

Student´s t-test was used for comparing cytokine and markers expression between WT and KO T cells within each group of chimeric mice. The small sample size, n=3, only allows statistical detection at p&lt;0,05 if the effect is large and exhibit low variance, thus supporting our interpretation of the results. Moreover, group size n=3 is routinely used when comparing cytokine intracellular staining in lymphocytes by cytometry (examples are: Yang et al., 2016; Brennan et al., 2016, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; Ho et al., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and, thus, our study procedure does not differ from the one adopted in papers published in renowned journals. However, in order to convince reviewer #1 of the consistency of our data and further strengthen the statistics, we have now combined data from two independent experiments, and a total of 6 to 8 mice per group are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> to 5. (Only in WT:WT control chimeras, the group size is n=3).</p><p>The meaning of a given experiment having been performed 3 to 4 times is the following: different parameters were tested repeatedly in independent experiments: for example, BrdU incorporation was performed in 3 independent experiments, while intracellular IFN-γ staining was performed in 4 independent experiments. In each independent experiment, new chimeric mice were obtained by irradiating WT recipients that were then divided into 4 groups, each one being reconstituted with one of the different 1:1 mixtures of WT and KO BM and were infected 6 to 8 weeks later. In some experiments, only WT:<italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> chimeras were constructed. In each independent experiment, 3 controls and 3 to 4 infected mice of each set of chimeras had the expression of several markers analyzed by flow cytometry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What are the percentages of CD45.2 vs. CD45.1 in the plot 1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>?</p></disp-quote><p>Percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD45.2<sup>+</sup> and of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD45.1 in the plot 1 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) are 36.53% and 38.35%, respectively.

In the specific case concerning the dot plot showing the frequencies of CD45.1<sup>+</sup> (WT) and CD45.2<sup>+</sup> (<italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we referred to it in the main text (subsection “<italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> Th1 cells attain lower frequencies in infected mixed BM chimeras.”) as follows: “Including residual recipient cells (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>CD45.2<sup>+</sup>), the mixed BM chimeras have more than 50% of WT DC in their LNs and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which can be fully activated by TLR pathways during infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic>.” Therefore, this result did not “appear out of nowhere”, but instead it is referred to in the main text and it constitutes an important control about the frequency of WT DCs in the mixed BM chimeras. Moreover, in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, we state that “(B) Representative frequencies of CD45.1<sup>+</sup> (B6.SJL, WT) and CD45.2<sup>+</sup> (<italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) cells gated on CD11c<sup>hi</sup> spleen cells of non-infected mixed BM chimeric mice.” Therefore, it seems to us that the only missing information is the specification that equal results obtained in LNs were not shown. We have now removed the mention to LNs and apologize for this little forgetfulness. In the present version of the manuscript, we have also added that residual recipient (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>CD45.2<sup>+</sup>) cells are of WT origin, although this was already said in the description of mixed BM chimeras, few lines above: “irradiated WT B6 x B6.SJL F1 (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>CD45.2<sup>+</sup>), mice were reconstituted […]” (subsection “<italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> Th1 cells attain lower frequencies in infected mixed BM chimeras.”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The same is true for using the Kb-restricted TSKB20 peptide.</p></disp-quote><p>It is well known that effector T cells need to be further stimulated in vitro in the presence of monensin or brefeldin for cytokine intracellular staining (ICS) to succeed. In the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> model, while the pathogen-derived Ags present in the infected total spleen culture are sufficient for stimulating IFN-γ production by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the addition of specific antigenic peptides to the cultures is needed for the detection of IFN-γ in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by ICS. In fact, when purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from infected mice were stimulated in vitro with non-infected APC, in the absence of any <italic>T. cruzi</italic> antigen, no IFN-γ is detected, as previously shown (Bafica et al., 2006 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). On the other hand, when total splenocytes from infected mice on day 14 pi are plated, infected macrophages and DCs are present in the cultures and are sufficient for the Ag-specific stimulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. In a previous study, we have shown that adding <italic>T. cruzi</italic> amastigote protein extract to the cultures only marginally increases the release of IFN-γ by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in total splenocyte cultures (Oliveira et al., 2010). As immunodominant CD4 epitopes of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> have not been reported, we have chosen to stimulate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in cultures using infected total splenocytes. For CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, on the other hand, immunodominant epitopes are well characterized, therefore, we added the immunodominant TSKB20 peptide to the cultures in order to further increase the specific antigenic response of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. To explain this, the following phrases were present in the first version of the manuscript (subsection “<italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> Th1 cells attain lower frequencies in infected mixed BM chimeras.”): “In order to determine the frequency of Ag-specific IFN-γ-producing T cells in the different T cell subpopulations, total splenocytes from infected mixed BM chimeras were cultured in the presence of the Kb-restricted TSKB20 peptide, an immunodominant CD8 epitope (Oliveira et al., 2010). Infected APCs present in the spleen of infected mice are able to induce Ag-specific stimulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro without the need of adding extra <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-derived Ag in the in vitro cultures (Oliveira et al., 2010)”.</p><p>We believe this is sufficiently clear, but we will be glad to further clarify this point whether the reviewer believes it is still necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would think that a preface for including CCR5 in the analysis is missing hence one is not clear as to why it was even measured.</p></disp-quote><p>It is known that although chemokine receptor expression and differentiated Th phenotype are not strictly coordinate, some receptors, such as CXCR3 and CCR5, show a striking preferential expression on Th1 cells (Zhu &amp; Paul, 2008; Bonecchi et al., 1998). We first referred to CCR5 in subsection “WT and <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of infected mixed BM chimeras display different gene-expression programs.”, when introducing RNA microarray results: “Several Th1 related genes as IFN-γ, Ccr5 Ccl5, Ccl4 and Ccl3 were upregulated in WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells”. Therefore, we have next analyzed, by flow cytometry, the expression of CCR5, the receptor for RANTES, macrophage-inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α) and MIP-1β on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from mixed BM chimeras. We confirmed that a higher percentage and absolute number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expresses CCR5+ among WT, than among <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> or <italic>IL18R<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) and referred to this result as: “Th1- associated chemokine receptor CCR5 among WT, <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>Il1r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> or <italic>Il18r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes […]”(subsection “Lack of T cell-intrinsic IL-18R or MyD88 signaling leads to lower frequencies of Th1 cells but does not affect CD8+ CTLs”).</p><p>This result is in accordance with our microarray data and, together with the other results of the manuscript, led us to the conclusion that a higher expansion of Th1 cells occurs among CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing the IL-18/Myd88 signaling pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) Why is IL18 crucial for expansion of T cells but not IFN-γ production on a per cell basis?

Can the authors measure serum levels of IL18 and IL1 at different timepoints?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a kinetic study of the presence of IL-1β and IL-18 in the sera of infected B6 mice. These data are now included in the manuscript in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. As shown, a higher level of IL-1β was detected on day 13 pi, although an early peak of this cytokine was also detected at 12 h after infection. On the other hand, we could only detect IL-18 at later time points of infection (day 13 pi). This result is in accordance with the kinetics of IL-18 detection in the supernatants of spleen cultures of infected C3H mouse strain, previously published (Antunez et al., 2001). Detection of IL-18 in the serum at 13 dpi was also paralleled by IL-18 mRNA detection in the spleen, previously reported by others (Muller et al., 2001). Peaks of IL-1β and IL-18 at day 13 pi were followed by increased percentages of Th1 cells in the spleen of infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is important to note, however, that the biology of IL-1-family cytokines is rather complex: soluble receptors, as well as IL-binding protein, such as IL-1R2 and IL-18BP, might be present in the sera and inhibit IL-1 and IL-18 function, respectively, as well as their detection (Arend et al., 1994; Nakanishi et al., 2001). Moreover, IL-1β signaling can be outcompeted by the IL-1Ra soluble molecule, which is an antagonist that binds IL-1R1 with an affinity higher than that of IL-1β but fails to recruit the signaling IL-1RAcP chain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What are the major sources of IL18 in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection? Antigen presenting cells or stromal cells?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. IL-18 mRNA is expressed in a wide range of cells including Kupffer cells, macrophages, T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, osteoblasts, keratinocytes, astrocytes, and microglias (reviewed in Nakanishi et al., 2001). As <italic>T. cruzi</italic> is able to infect different organs as liver and brain, among others, it is possible that different cell types, at different locations, are producing IL-18 following infection. However, few studies have fully investigated this point at the present, to our knowledge. IL-18 transcripts were detected in total spleen cells from infected B6 mice, increasing until day 14 post-infection (Muller et al., 2001). Also, IL-18 was detected in the supernatants of splenocyte cultures from infected mice (Antunez &amp; Cardoni, 2001). Moreover, it has been shown, by in situ hybridization, that the number of cells expressing IL-18 mRNA in the spleen increases during infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and most of the positive cells were found in the white pulp, especially in the PALS (Meyer Zum Buschenfelde et al., 1997). Our preliminary data have shown that IL-18 could also be detected in the supernatant (SN) of myocardium cultures obtained from infected mice, although at lower levels than in SN of spleen cultures (data not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) What are the stimuli that induce I18 production? Which stimuli induce IL18 during <italic>T cruzii</italic>?</p></disp-quote><p>IL-18 gene expression may be upregulated by direct stimulation with microbe products such as LPS, or by cytokines such as type I and type II IFNs (reviewed in Nakanishi et al., 2001). Moreover, pro‐IL‐18 needs processing by caspase 1 to turn into functional IL-18. Thus, IL-18 production also requires inflammasome activation, or an alternative processing pathway (reviewed in Garlanda et al., 2013). Both TLR signaling pathways and the NALP3 inflammasome activation have been shown during infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (Rodrigues et al., 2012; Silva et al., 2013). Specifically, glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors of mucin-like glycoproteins (GPI-mucins), expressed in the surface of the trypomastigote stage of the parasite, have been shown to activate the TLR2 signaling pathway and to induce IL-18 transcripts (Ferreira et al., 2002; Campos et al., 2001). Moreover, one may expect that other described <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-derived PAMPs (as GIPL or CpG) together with danger signals released by tissue damage caused by the parasite and/or the inflammatory response against it, would also contribute to IL-18 production during infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Overall, this work seems to lack significant conceptual advance to be of interest to the broader readership of eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>The results described in our manuscript bring important advances for understanding the role of T cell-intrinsic IL-18/MyD88 signaling on the development of a robust Th1 response to infection. IL-18 has been known for a long time to synergize with IL-12 for Th1 cell differentiation in vitro, but its requirement for Th1 response in vivois controversial, possibly because of compensatory mechanisms present in <italic>Il18</italic> gene-deficient mice, as elevated IL-12 production. Also, during infection, IL-18 can play an indirect role on Th1 cells, due to its effect of inducing IFN-γ in NK cells, which in turn also play a key role in Th1 differentiation. On the other hand, some studies have shown that T-cell intrinsic MyD88-mediated signaling severely impact the immune response. However, the TIR domain-containing receptor upstream of MyD88 acting on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was either not investigated or not identified and, therefore, this topic remains speculative and needs further clarification. By excluding other cell types, as NK cells and the IL-1R receptor-signaling pathway in this process, our work delimitates a mechanistic framework and brings a conceptual advance to the field. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to formally and unequivocally demonstrate the crucial role of T-cell intrinsic IL-18R/MyD88 pathway for sustaining the Th1 response in a model of in vivoinfection, showing that IL-18R is a crucial MyD88-dependent receptor intrinsic to T cells necessary for Th1 expansion in vivo. Therefore, our manuscript answers a controversial open question of broad interest and, in our opinion, is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, it is unclear whether the presented data completely support the conclusions the authors have drawn in regard to the predominant role of IL-18R signaling in T cells following <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection.

As mentioned above (in answer to reviewer #1), there is no <italic>T. cruzi</italic> Y strain-specific immunodominant I-Ab-restricted peptide described in the literature. Therefore, it was not possible do perform tetramer-Ag staining. To circumvent this, we stained spleen cells with anti-CD4, anti-CD44, anti-CD62L and anti-T-bet (in addition to anti-IL18R and anti-IL-1R mAbs), which allow us to distinguish effector Th1 and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our results show that while IL-18R is expressed by the majority of CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup> (TCM) and CD44<sup>h</sup>iCD62L<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> (Teff and TEM) T cells, mainly among T-bet+ cells, IL-1R is expressed marginally only by CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (TCM). Importantly, no increase on the expression of IL-1R could be detected on any subpopulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the spleen of infected mice compared to non-infected controls.

Therefore, we did not exclude a minor role for IL-1R and this was mentioned in our Discussion section. However, our data clearly excluded a role for IL-1R in the Th1 response. The new results now included in the revised manuscript on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, also show that IL-1R can only be detected on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with central memory (TCM) CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup> phenotype, both in non-infected and infected mice, while the expression of IL-18R increases in both effector and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, following infection. These results add to the data presented in the first version of the manuscript, favouring a scenario where IL18R, but not IL-1R, plays a major role in the MyD88-mediated signaling, which leads to a robust Th1 response against infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Although a statistically significant contribution of IL-1R to the frequency of CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells is seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), IFN-γ expression seems unaffected in the absence of IL-1R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). It is unclear why WT cells in the WT:IL1-R mixed BM chimeras in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> are not making as much IFN-γ as the WT cells within the other mixed chimeras (WT:Myd88; WT:IL-18R) – this may suggest a greater, unexplored role for non-T cells. These additional signals may be absent when half of the non-T cells also lack expression of MyD88 or IL-18R.</p></disp-quote><p>We think there is some misunderstanding here: we found no statistical difference for BrdU incorporation between WT and IL-1R<sup>-/-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from WT: IL-1R<sup>-/-</sup> mixed BM chimeras. Significant difference between WT and IL-1R<sup>-/-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was found only regarding the percentage of CD44<sup>hi</sup> cells, as answered in the previous question. Concerning the possibility “that additional signals may be absent when half of the non-T cells also lack expression of MyD88 or IL-18R”, we believe that the results obtained with the non-irradiated <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> reconstituted model showed on new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) discard this hypothesis, since in this case the vast majority, if not the totality, of APCs is WT concerning Myd88 and Il18r genes. The results on IFN-γ production obtained in experiments illustrated on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) can be explained as follows: please note that, in the case of WT:WT chimera, both CD45.1<sup>+</sup> and CD45.2<sup>+</sup> T cells are able to produce IFN-γ and the sum of the frequencies of both IFN-γ -producing WT populations (≈ 6.3%) is equivalent to the total percentage of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> cells resulting from the sum of WT CD45.1+IFN-γ+ cells plus <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CD45.2<sup>+</sup>IFN- γ<sup>+</sup> in WT:<italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> chimeras (≈7.4%). The same is true for the sum of total IFN-γ-producing cell frequency in WT:<italic>IL18R<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (≈ 6.8%) or WT:<italic>IL1R<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (≈ 6.0%) mixed chimeras. The same applies for absolute cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This indicates that there might be a control of the total number of CD4<sup>+</sup> IFN-γ-producing cells in infected mice. Therefore, in the case of WT:WT and WT:<italic>IL1R<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mixed chimeras, the total number of CD4<sup>+</sup>IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>cells is equally distributed between the two populations, while in WT:<italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT:<italic>IL18R<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mixed BM chimeras, the maximum number of IFN-γ-producing cells is attained mainly within the CD45.1<sup>+</sup> WT population, since the KO CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells do not expand in these chimeras. Absolute numbers of cells in these experiments are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, further supporting our conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The in vivo survival data suggest that IL-18R does not account for all of the MyD88-dependent responses, reflecting previous studies that TLR signaling and other IL-1R family members may play a role in T cell expansion, survival, activation, and/or IFN-γ production.</p></disp-quote><p>Our present work demonstrates that IL-18R does give a crucial contribution to the MyD88-dependent responses intrinsic to CD4 T cells, which are necessary for a robust Th1 response. We did not claim, at any time, that the lack of IL-18R signaling accounts for the lack of all the MyD88-dependent responses in <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, which include signaling by different receptors as TLRs and other IL-1R family members, in many different cell types besides T cells, such as monocytes, DCs, B cells, cardiomyocytes and others. However, the major focus of this work was exactly to study the role of IL-18R/MyD88 signaling intrinsic to T cells, during infection. Interestingly, we have also shown here, for the first time, that <italic>IL18R<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are also very susceptible to infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and can be rescued from death by receiving the adaptive transference of WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This is in accordance with the results obtained in mixed BM chimeras on the importance of IL-18R signaling in Th1 cells and on the protective role of this cell subset against infection. We have discussed this issue in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Parasite clearance seem to be largely unaffected in the absence of IL-18R signaling, both by time course parasitemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and parasite load in the myocardium at day 14 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These data would suggest that, following pathogen clearance, other MyD88-dependent mechanisms are accounting for the observed survival differences. It would be important to know if T cells are mediating these effects since the authors also suggest MyD88-dependent signaling in the tissue may be largely responsible for parasite control.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an important point. The role of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in mediating parasite control is a fundamental question, and we have tested this point in the experiments illustrated on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> of the first version of the manuscript (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, we believe there is some misunderstanding here, since two statements in the above comment by the reviewer do not apply. Firstly, results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> undoubtedly demonstrate that: at day 9 pi, when the peak of parasites in the blood is attained, no statistical difference in parasitemia levels was found between Il18r1-/- and <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, as stated in subsection “<italic>Il18r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are highly susceptible to infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> “, while both strains of KO mice display significant higher parasitemia than WT mice (subsection “Lack of T cell-intrinsic IL-18R or MyD88 signaling leads to lower frequencies and numbers of Th1 cells but does not affect CD8<sup>+</sup>CTLs.”). This means that <italic>Il18r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> are equally susceptible in terms of parasitemia, while WT mice are more resistant.</p><p>Second, parasite load in the myocardium is also significantly higher in <italic>Il18r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> when compared to WT mice, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Therefore, it is wrong to affirm that: “Parasite clearance seem to be largely unaffected in the absence of IL-18R signaling”, (both in the blood and in the myocardium), as stated by the reviewer. However, it is true that parasites are cleared from the blood of <italic>Il18r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with essentially the same kinetics observed in WT mice. Also, <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice displayed higher levels of parasite in the tissue than <italic>Il18r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Since: (i) we have found the same ratios and absolute numbers of Th1 cells in the spleen of <italic>Il18r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) and (ii) we have previously shown that CD8-mediated specific cytotoxicity is totally preserved in <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (Oliveira et al., 2010), we have raised the hypothesis on the putative importance of innate signaling through TLRs in the tissue for parasite control, which could explain the higher parasite levels observed in the myocardium of <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, compared to Il18r1-/- mice (subsection “Il18r1-/- mice are highly susceptible to infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic>”). In fact, it is known that TLR4 signaling and IFN-γ synergize for the induction of microbicidal activity in macrophages. Therefore, even though equivalent levels Th1-derived IFN- γ might be present in the infected tissues of Il18r1-/- and <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, most TLR signaling is defective in <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells. As a consequence of this fact, higher parasite loads in <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells would result.</p><p>Thirdly, contrary to what is affirmed above by the reviewer, the pathogen is never cleared in <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, which all die before day 15-18 pi, a time point when parasite load is still very high in the tissues. Therefore, it is not following parasite clearance that other MyD88-dependent mechanisms are accounting for the observed survival differences, as stated by reviewer #3, although it is possible that other MyD88-dependent mechanisms, not necessarily involved in parasite killing, may be responsible for survival. We hope these points are now clarified.</p><p>Concerning the role of T cells: in order to test the role of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in parasitemia control and survival, we have performed the adoptive-transference experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>): while transferred WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can rescued <italic>Il18r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice from death, this treatment is not equally efficient in <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> infected mice, which mortality is significantly delayed, but not stopped. Parasitemia, on the other hand, is brought to WT levels in both <italic>Il18r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice receiving transferred WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We also demonstrated that the capacity of lowering parasitemia depends on IFN-γ secretion by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). We interpreted these results as follows: since mortality following infection with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> is in some cases due to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine release (Holscher et al., 2000), it is possible that other MyD88-independent innate mechanisms, as the TLR4/TRIF pathway, active in <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, might be responsible for this putative pro-inflammatory effect in this strain and responsible for death. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, tissue-tolerance mechanisms, possibly involving MyD88-dependent feedback control responses, might protect the host from immune- or pathogen-inflicted damage and would be impaired in <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (Discussion section). Therefore, we believe the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) answer the question of reviewer #3 about the role of T cells in parasite control, although further work is necessary to fully uncover the reason for the failure of transferred WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to completely rescue <italic>MyD88<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice from death. However, this last point would require further extensive investigation and goes beyond the scope of the present manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
