humans. This expansion is thought to primarily reflect differences in proliferation <italic>versus</italic> differentiation of neural progenitors during cortical development. Here, we have searched for such differences by analysing cerebral organoids from human and chimpanzees using immunohistofluorescence, live imaging, and single-cell transcriptomics. We find that the cytoarchitecture, cell type composition, and neurogenic gene expression programs of humans and chimpanzees are remarkably similar. Notably, however, live imaging of apical progenitor mitosis uncovered a lengthening of prometaphase-metaphase in humans compared to chimpanzees that is specific to proliferating progenitors and not observed in non-neural cells. Consistent with this, the small set of genes more highly expressed in human apical progenitors points to increased proliferative capacity, and the proportion of neurogenic basal progenitors is lower in humans. These subtle differences in cortical progenitors between humans and chimpanzees may have consequences for human neocortex evolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18683.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18683.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18683.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human brain is about three times as big as the brain of our closest living relative, the chimpanzee. Moreover, a part of the brain called the cerebral cortex – which plays a key role in memory, attention, awareness and thought – contains twice as many cells in humans as the same region in chimpanzees. Networks of brain cells in the cerebral cortex also behave differently in the two species.</p><p>How these species differences arise is not clear, but it likely occurs in the earliest phases of development when brain stem and progenitor cells divide and give rise to cerebral cortex cells in the growing brain. To study the earliest stages of brain development, researchers often use human brain cells grown in the laboratory. Under the right conditions, cells collected from adult humans and other animals can be reprogrammed to behave like brain stem cells. Recently, researchers have been able to use these reprogrammed cells to make tissue that resembles the brain in petri dishes, known as brain organoids.</p><p>Mora-Bermúdez, Badsha, Kanton, Camp et al. have now analysed brain organoids grown from reprogrammed human, chimpanzee and orangutan cells. The experiments showed that the human and chimpanzee brain organoids were remarkably similar in many ways including in the mix of cell types and in how these cells were arranged.</p><p>Mora-Bermúdez et al. then used live microscopy to show that progenitor cells that form the human cerebral cortex spend around 50% more time in a stage of the cell division process called metaphase compared to the same cells from chimpanzees or orangutans. Metaphase is the part of the division process when the cell makes sure that structures called chromosomes, which carry the cell’s DNA, can be separated and distributed equally between the two daughter cells. Mora-Bermúdez et al. also found that progenitor cells more likely to become neurons sooner had a shorter metaphase than progenitor cells more likely to remain proliferating as stem cells for longer. This suggests that a longer metaphase may be a feature of brain stem cells.</p><p>Further studies are now needed to find out how the length of time these progenitor cells spend in metaphase affects how chimpanzee and human brains develop; and whether this can help explain why the human brain is so much larger.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18683.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18683.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cortical development</kwd><kwd>cerebral organoids</kwd><kwd>chimpanzee</kwd><kwd>neural stem and progenitor cells</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>cell division</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanton</surname><given-names>Sabina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000952</institution-id><institution>Paul G.

Neocortex expansion in humans relative to chimpanzees involves an increase in the number of cortical neurons generated during fetal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borrell and Reillo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herculano-Houzel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lui et al., 2011</xref>). This reflects primarily a greater and prolonged proliferative capacity of human neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) within the germinal zones of the developing neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lewitus et al., 2013</xref>). Unravelling differences between human and chimpanzee NSPC behaviour is therefore a key issue, yet very little is known about such differences.</p><p>The neocortex develops from two principal germinal zones, the ventricular zone (VZ) and the subventricular zone (SVZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Angevine et al., 1970</xref>). In primates developing a folded (gyrencephalic) neocortex, and notably in humans, an inner SVZ (iSVZ) and an outer (oSVZ) can be distinguished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dehay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smart et al., 2002</xref>). Correspondingly, the VZ and SVZ harbour the cell bodies of two principal classes of NSPCs, called apical progenitors (APs) and basal progenitors (BPs), respectively, each of which comprise several distinct NSPC types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borrell and Reillo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Götz and Huttner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taverna et al., 2014</xref>). APs (neuroepithelial cells, apical radial glia, and apical intermediate progenitors) divide at the ventricular surface, keep ventricular contact and exhibit apical cell polarity, whereas BPs (basal (or outer) radial glia and basal intermediate progenitors) lack this contact and type of cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taverna et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Studies dissecting the switch between NSPC proliferation and differentiation have demonstrated that a central aspect of the cell division process, the orientation of the mitotic spindle, has a pivotal role, particularly in the case of APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mora-Bermudez and Huttner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mora-Bermudez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shitamukai and Matsuzaki, 2012</xref>). The orientation of the spindle relative to the apical-basal axis of cell polarity in mitotic apical radial glia, the major cortical neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Götz and Huttner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009</xref>), can determine whether their division is symmetric or asymmetric, and whether it is proliferative or neurogenic, with regard to their progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mora-Bermudez and Huttner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mora-Bermudez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shitamukai and Matsuzaki, 2012</xref>). Comparing spindle orientation in mitotic APs may therefore provide insight into the cell biological basis underlying the differences between humans and chimpanzees in NSPC proliferation <italic>versus</italic> differentiation during neocortex development.</p><p>Protocols to generate structured cerebral tissue (cerebral organoids) from pluripotent stem cells in vitro constitute a major advance for studying neocortex development, in particular with regard to humans and non-human primates where fetal brain tissue is hard or impossible to obtain and manipulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kadoshima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mariani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qian et al., 2016</xref>). Human cerebral organoids form a variety of tissues that resemble specific brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, ventral forebrain, midbrain-hindbrain boundary, hippocampus, and retina. Moreover, their cerebral cortex-like regions exhibit distinct germinal zones, that is, a VZ containing APs and an SVZ containing BPs, as well as basal-most neuronal layers. Cerebral organoid APs include apical radial glia-like NSPCs that contact a ventricle-like lumen, express radial glia marker genes, undergo interkinetic nuclear migration, and divide at the apical surface, similar to their in vivo counterparts, and cerebral organoid BPs comprise both basal radial glia-like and basal intermediate progenitor-like NSPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, we have previously shown by single-cell RNA sequencing that the gene expression programs controlling neocortex development in human cerebral organoids are remarkably similar to those in the developing fetal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Camp et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that cerebral organoids constitute a valid system to explore potential differences in NSPC proliferation <italic>versus</italic> differentiation between humans and chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Otani et al., 2016</xref>), in particular with regard to spindle orientation in mitotic APs.</p><p>Here, we have generated cerebral organoids from chimpanzee-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and used single-cell transcriptomics, immunohistofluorescence and live imaging to compare relevant features of chimpanzee NSPCs to human NSPCs in cerebral organoids and fetal neocortex. While most NSPC characteristics are found to be similar, we show that the prometaphase-metaphase in mitotic APs is longer in humans than in chimpanzees, indicating that a fundamental difference exists in the regulation of mitosis during neocortex development between the two species. Our data also provide a resource for further studies on human and chimpanzee differences in cortical development, and demonstrate the usability of cerebral organoids as a means to be able to perform such studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chimpanzee cerebral organoids recapitulate cortex development</title><p>We generated cerebral organoids from iPSCs derived from chimpanzee fibroblasts and lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> left, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These chimpanzee cerebral organoids formed complex tissue structures that resembled the developing primate brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> right), as reported previously for human cerebral organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>). Similar to human iPSC-derived cerebral organoids ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Camp et al., 2015</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref> right), within the chimpanzee organoids grown for 52 days (D52), we observed cortex-like regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> right) with PAX6-positive APs (such as radial glia) residing predominantly in the apical-most zone facing a ventricular lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> left), similar to the ventricular zone (VZ) of developing primate neocortex at an early-mid stage of neurogenesis. Consistent with this, cells immunoreactive for the deep-layer neuron marker CTIP2 were observed in the basal region of the developing cortical wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> left), corresponding to an early cortical plate. TBR2 (also known as EOMES) positive BPs (presumably mostly basal intermediate progenitors) were concentrated in a zone between the PAX6+ progenitors and the CTIP2+ neurons, corresponding to the subventricular zone (SVZ). In the context of the time-lapse live imaging of apical mitoses described below, we observed apically directed nuclear migration prior to, and basally directed nuclear migration after, mitosis, consistent with the existence of interkinetic nuclear migration. Our results suggest that chimpanzee cerebral organoids recapitulate important aspects of fetal chimpanzee brain development and allow comparisons with cerebral cortex development in human cerebral organoids and fetal neocortex.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18683.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Chimpanzee cerebral organoids recapitulate cortex development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bright-field image showing a representative chimpanzee organoid (Sandra A, left) and a cryosection from a chimpanzee organoid (PR818-5) immunostained for PAX6 (magenta) and Ctip2 (green) combined with DAPI staining (blue) (right) at day 52.

Generally, APs, BPs, and neurons from human and chimpanzee intermixed, confirming that cells in the chimpanzee organoid cortices have a zonal organization consistent with what is observed histologically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). In conclusion, the major proportion of the variation in these data is not between in vitro and in vivo tissues or between species, but among cell states during neurogenesis, confirming that the major features of the genetic programs regulating the NSPC-to-neuron lineage are conserved between human and chimpanzees, and are recapitulated in cerebral organoids.</p><p>To identify genes differentially expressed between chimpanzee and human cortex-like cells, we remapped all single-cell transcriptome reads to a consensus human-chimpanzee genome and used human annotations to identify 1-to-1 orthologous genes. We then used a Bayesian approach to identify differentially expressed genes by comparing cerebral organoid APs and neurons between species (ignoring BPs due to the low number of BPs identified). We identified 297 and 279 genes that were more highly expressed in human APs and neurons, respectively, and 283 and 314 genes that were more highly expressed in chimpanzee APs and neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). In addition to the between-species comparisons, we identified genes differentially expressed between human or chimpanzee APs and neurons to identify cell-type specific genes (for human: 1328 AP-specific, 1132 neuron-specific; for chimpanzee: 1501 AP-specific, 1166 neuron-specific). The vast majority (94%) of genes that are AP-specific and neuron-specific in humans are not differential between human and chimpanzee (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of the differentially expressed genes between species, we identified 93 genes that are strongly upregulated in human organoid APs and 72 genes upregulated in human organoid neurons. Gene ontology enrichments suggest that the proteins encoded by some of these genes are integral to cell membranes and involved in intercellular signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>), for example integrin beta 8 (ITGB8) in APs and insulin receptor (INSR) in human neurons.

Notably, a similar proportion of AP- and neuron-specific genes were gained on the chimpanzee and human branch subsequent to their separation, suggesting that our analysis did not have a strong human bias.

We compared spindle orientation dynamics between human and chimpanzee APs in cerebral organoids. However, our data revealed no clear differences in spindle orientation, either during metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–G</xref>) or shortly after anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F, I–J</xref>). As deduced from the orientation of the chromosome plates, most APs in both human and chimpanzee divided with a cleavage orientation largely perpendicular to the apical, ventricular surface, showing deviations of fewer than 30° from a perfect orthogonal cleavage. Oblique and near-horizontal orientations were also observed, but at a much lower abundance and at similar frequencies in chimpanzee and human organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–J</xref>).

Specifically, measurement of the length of the various phases of mitosis (for details, see Materials and methods) revealed that APs in 11–13 wpc fetal human neocortex and D30 cerebral organoids remained approximately 5 min longer in prometaphase-metaphase than APs in chimpanzee organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). By comparison, prometaphase-metaphase of APs in slice culture of mouse neocortex, a well-characterized model system for neurogenesis, lasted for only approximately half the amount of time than human APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>To trace the specific phase of mitosis when this difference arises, we used chromosome morphology and dynamics to determine the time chromosomes spent congressing toward the equatorial plane of the cell (defined here as 'prometaphase') and the time they spent tightly aligned as a metaphase plate (defined here as 'metaphase'). Remarkably, the longer prometaphase-metaphase of human than chimpanzee APs was specifically due to a ∼40-60% lengthening of metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C,G</xref>), whereas prometaphase was not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). By contrast, in mouse APs, both prometaphase and metaphase were found to be significantly shorter than the respective mitotic phases in human and chimpanzee APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>None of the other mitotic phases (prophase, anaphase, telophase) differed in length between APs in human fetal neocortex and human cerebral organoids vs. chimpanzee organoids. However, anaphase of mouse APs was found to be significantly shorter than that of human and chimpanzee APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). These differences between species in the individual mitotic phases were reflected in the cumulative length of total mitosis, which was significantly shorter in mouse APs than human and chimpanzee APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To search for potential functional implications of these observations, we next quantified and compared the length of prometaphase-metaphase in human and chimpanzee APs of day 52 (D52) cerebral organoids, and compared the results with those of D30 organoids. Prometaphase-metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and metaphase alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>) were shorter in D52 than in D30 human APs, and not anymore statistically significantly different in length from D52 chimpanzee APs. The longer metaphase of human than chimpanzee organoid APs may therefore characterise early phases of cortical development, when proliferative AP divisions are predominant.</p><p>We also generated cerebral organoids from an orangutan iPSC line and determined the length of AP prometaphase-metaphase. This revealed that the length of prometaphase-metaphase in orangutan D30 organoid APs was similar to that of chimpanzee APs and significantly shorter than that of human organoid APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). As was the case for the human-chimpanzee AP comparison, the shorter prometaphase-metaphase of orangutan than human APs was due to a shorter metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A,D</xref>) rather than prometaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

The length of prometaphase-metaphase in B cells, as well as prometaphase and metaphase measured individually, were similar to that in iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 C–G</xref>), and hence significantly shorter than in human or chimpanzee APs.

Therefore, the expression level of these genes is unlikely to contribute to the specificity of mitotic control of human APs in G2-M. However, we identified many genes that were highly expressed throughout the human AP cell cycle and were specific to APs. Genes with the highest specificity score encoded canonical cerebral cortex patterning transcription factors such as PAX6, ID4, and GLI3, as well as proteins involved in cell adhesion and ECM signalling (CDH4, EFNB1/2, COL4A2).

This extends a very recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Otani et al., 2016</xref>) and establishes cerebral organoids as a valid system to compare human and chimpanzee NSPC behaviour. Using this system, we have shown that human and chimpanzee APs differ in that prometaphase-metaphase is longer in humans than in chimpanzees. This difference was also observed between human and orangutan and reflects a greater extent of prometaphase-metaphase lengthening that occurs as human APs are generated during cerebral organoid development from IPSCs. There are two intriguing implications as to the biological significance of this prometaphase-metaphase lengthening in human APs.</p><p>One is related to the fate of the progeny arising from AP division. Mouse <italic>Tis21</italic>::GFP-negative APs, which are known to undergo proliferative divisions to generate more APs, have a longer prometaphase-metaphase than <italic>Tis21</italic>::GFP-positive APs, which are known to undergo neurogenic divisions to generate BPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haubensak et al., 2004</xref>). The longer prometaphase-metaphase in human than chimpanzee APs would therefore be consistent with a greater tendency for proliferative than neurogenic divisions. In this respect, other changes in progeny fate have also been recently observed in a different context, upon an experimentally induced and considerable prolongation of AP mitosis in embryonic mouse neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pilaz et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Another set of observations are consistent with the notion that the longer prometaphase-metaphase in human than chimpanzee APs may indicate a greater tendency for proliferative than differentiative divisions. The human vs. chimpanzee prometaphase-metaphase difference decreased in the course of organoid cortical development from D30 to D52, when one would expect proliferative AP divisions to decrease and differentiative AP divisions to increase.</p><p>Further support for this notion was obtained by analysis of the interphase of the cell cycle, specifically S-phase. Mouse <italic>Tis21</italic>::GFP-negative (proliferative) APs have previously been shown to have a longer S-phase than <italic>Tis21</italic>::GFP-positive (differentiative) APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arai et al., 2011</xref>). The substantially longer S-phase of human than chimpanzee APs observed here is therefore also in line with human APs having a greater tendency for proliferative divisions.</p><p>Finally, the changes in the abundance of NSPC types in the course of cerebral organoid development yielded data supporting a greater AP proliferation in human than chimpanzee. Specifically, the proportion of PAX6+TBR2– NSPCs, located in the VZ and thus constituting proliferating APs, decreased in both human and chimpanzee cerebral organoids, but the value reached in human organoids was slightly higher than that in chimpanzee organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Conversely, the proportion of PAX6+TBR2+ NSPCs, located in the basal VZ and SVZ and constituting BPs with neurogenic potential, showed a greater increase in chimpanzee than human cerebral organoids. In sum, two independent lines of evidence, the detailed analysis of AP mitosis phase lengths and the determination of the proportions of the various NSPC types, support the concept that a longer neurogenic period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewitus et al., 2014</xref>), which in turn implies a longer phase of NSPC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Otani et al., 2016</xref>), contributes to the greater expansion of the neocortex in humans than the great apes.</p><p>The second implication as to the biological significance of the longer prometaphase-metaphase in human than chimpanzee APs concerns the fact that these are the phases of mitosis when chromosomes prepare for segregation, to ensure that only one copy of each chromosome is distributed to each nascent daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). The longer duration of prometaphase-metaphase in human than chimpanzee APs, in particular of the metaphase plate stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), may therefore reflect some difference between the two species with regard to the preparation for chromosome segregation.</p><p>If the longer prometaphase-metaphase in human than chimpanzee APs reflects a greater tendency for proliferative than neurogenic divisions in the human NSPCs, why did we not detect significant differences between human and chimpanzee APs in spindle orientation, a parameter previously shown to affect the mode of AP division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mora-Bermudez and Huttner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mora-Bermudez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shitamukai and Matsuzaki, 2012</xref>)? This may be due to spindle orientation variability between individual APs being greater than potential inter-species differences. This suggests that, in the cell types and stages analysed, spindle orientation may not play a key role in human vs. chimpanzee neurogenesis. Alternatively, this may reflect the fact that differences in proliferative <italic>versus</italic> neurogenic AP divisions can occur without a change in spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Konno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kosodo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mora-Bermudez and Huttner, 2015</xref>). In this context, differences between human and chimpanzee NSPCs of relevance for neocortex expansion are likely to be small. Consistent with this view, our single-cell transcriptome analyses revealed only few differences between human and chimpanzee, and the differences in the proportions of organoid NSPC populations were in the range of a few percentage points. Furthermore, the ~5 min longer prometaphase-metaphase in human than chimpanzee APs constituted only a fraction of the total duration of their mitosis. These small differences nevertheless provide a set of clues as to which NSPC features may underlie the differential extent of neocortex expansion in humans versus apes, and are consistent with a scenario in which the accumulation of such small differences during evolution may have resulted in the distinct chimpanzee and human neocortices.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Neocortex tissue</title><p>Human fetal brain tissue (11–13 weeks post conception (wpc)) was obtained with informed written maternal consent followed by elective pregnancy termination, and neocortex was dissected at room temperature, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Florio et al., 2015</xref>).

The consensus genome was generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">He et al., 2014</xref>). In brief, the consensus genome was constructed based on the chained and netted pairwise alignment of human (hg38) and chimpanzee (panTro4) obtained from UCSC. Discordant sites and indels including 6 bp upstream and downsteam of the indel position were masked (replacing the base with N). STAR v2.5.1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) was used to map all sequences to the consensus genome requiring a minimal fraction of 85% of mapped bases per read. For quantification, HTSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2015</xref>) v0.6.1.p1 was used applying the human GENCODE v.24 annotation. Resulting count files were combined into one master table containing all cells and genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-7"><title>Differential gene expression analysis</title><p>To identify differentially expressed genes between human and chimpanzee, cells were first annotated as AP, BP or neuron based on the fetal cortex cell type with which each cell maximally correlated. After cell type assignment, SCDE (Single Cell Differential Expression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kharchenko et al., 2014</xref>), a Bayesian approach for finding differentially expressed genes accounting for noise inherent to single-cell data, was used to compare the orthologous cell type between human and chimpanzee. AP or neuronal specificity was defined as one standard deviation from the mean of z-scores from SCDE of APs and Neurons (Z.x). A more stringent threshold of twice the standard deviation of the z-score was used to define differential expression between human and chimpanzee (Z.y). For the differential gene expression analysis during mitotic phases, we aimed to identify relatively homogeneous clusters of human organoid APs, chimpanzee organoid APs, endothelial cells (ECs), or iPSCs in G2M or G1 phases. We hierarchically clustered cells (Pearson correlation) using expression of genes that correlated with PC1 from PCA on human fetal cortex progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Camp et al., 2015</xref>) and which are able to distinguish between cells in G2M and G1 phases. We selected the clusters with high or no expression and assigned them as G2/M or G1, respectively, and ignored the intermediate cells for SCDE. For the organoid APs, this assignment was consistent with an independent assignment using the method published by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scialdone et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunohistofluorescence</title><p>Cerebral organoids were fixed with 1% PFA in 120 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 for 20 min at room temperature and subjected to cryosectioning (14 µm) and immunofluorescence as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Camp et al., 2015</xref>). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-PAX6 (PRB-278P; Covance), sheep anti-TBR2 (AF6166; R+D systems), rat anti-CTIP2 (ab18465; Abcam), rabbit anti-KI67 (ab15580; Abcam). The secondary antibodies, used in combination with DAPI staining, were all donkey-derived and conjugated with Alexa 488, 555 or 647 (Life Technologies). Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 880 Airy inverted microscope, using 10X (0.45 NA) and 20X (0.8 NA) Plan-Apochromat objectives, and analysed using Fiji. Quantifications were carried out in cortical regions of D28 and D52-54 cerebral organoids by counting, from the ventricular to the pial surface, either all PAX6 and TBR2 positive and negative nuclei stained by DAPI in 50 μm and 100 μm wide fields, respectively, or all KI67-positive cells in 100 μm wide fields. An average of 350 cells per sample were counted. Statistical significance was calculated using the Mann–Whitney U-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cumulative EdU labeling</title><p>EdU was added to 52 day old cerebral organoids at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml (added from a 1 mg/ml EdU stock in PBS). The organoids were supplied with fresh medium containing EdU every six hours for up to 48 hr. Organoids were then collected in triplicates at the indicated time points (1, 2, 6, 24, 30/36, 48 hr) and processed as described above. For EdU detection, the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Imaging Kit (Invitrogen C10340) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell cycle parameters were determined using linear regression based on a model described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nowakowski et al., 1989</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Live imaging</title><p>Live tissue imaging was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mora-Bermudez et al., 2014</xref>). In short, cerebral organoids or freshly dissected developing neocortex tissue were embedded in agarose (Sigma, Germany), sectioned with a vibratome (~200 µm, Leica, Germany), embedded in type Ia collagen (Cellmatrix, Japan), mounted in glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek, Germany), and incubated with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) as vital DNA dye. Tissue slices in the dish were further cultured for observation in a microscope stage incubation chamber (Pecon, Germany) kept at 37°C. iPSCs and B cells were likewise mounted in glass bottom microwell dishes previously coated for 1h with matrigel (BD Biosciecne) and poly-D-lysine (Sigma, Germany) respectively, and imaged under their respective standard culturing conditions (see above). Potential phototoxicity was stringently controlled as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mora-Bermudez and Ellenberg, 2007</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Images were viewed and prepared with ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). Brightness and contrast of images were recorded and adjusted linearly. Spindle orientation analysis was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mora-Bermudez et al., 2014</xref>). In short, the degree values given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are deviations from a perfect orthogonality with the local apical surface plane, as seen from a coronal perspective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–F</xref>). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, the maximal range of orientations per every mitotic AP was calculated from the formation of a metaphase plate to anaphase onset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Mitotic phase length determination</title><p>To measure the duration of mitotic phases, the start of each different phase was defined as follows, based on morphology, dynamics and condensation of chromosomes as reported by vital DNA staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Prophase: the beginning of mitotic chromosome condensation; prometaphase + metaphase: the beginning of chromosome congression and alignment; anaphase: the beginning of chromosome segregation toward the mitotic poles of the dividing cell; telophase: the beginning of chromosome decondensation after maximal chromosome condensation in late anaphase and until a level indistinguishable from interphase was achieved. The total duration of mitosis was the sum of these phases. We note that our measurements of mitotic phases are limited by the use of chromosomes as markers. Nevertheless, the use of a single fluorescence channel allowed a very high time resolution (~1.1 min) for close monitoring of key chromosomal dynamics to delimit mitotic phases. Towards distinguishing between prometaphase and metaphase, we subdivided prometaphase + metaphase into 'prometaphase', defined here as the time in which chromosomes are congressing and aligning toward the formation of a metaphase plate, and 'metaphase', defined here as the time after every chromosome has been incorporated into a tight metaphase plate at the equatorial plane of the cell, and until anaphase onset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were tabulated with Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and analysed with GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, CA). Statistical tests: for two groups of observations, the Mann–Whitney U-test was used. For three or more groups, the Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA in conjunction with Dunn's Multiple Comparison test for pair-wise comparisons was used. Results were interpreted as statistically significant when p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Services and Facilities of the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics for outstanding support, notably Jussi Helppi and his team of the Animal Facility, and Jan Peychl and his team of the Light Microscopy Facility.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Victor Borrell (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Mora-Bermúdez and colleagues address the fundamental question of what distinguishes human and chimpanzee brain stem progenitor cells leading to the dramatic difference in brain size between these species. To address this technologically very challenging question, the authors use state of the art approaches including brain organoid cultures and single cell RNAseq. In a very remarkable methodological tour-de-force, the authors develop brain organoids from human, chimpanzee and orangutan iPSCs, and go on to perform high resolution live imaging of individual progenitor cells. The authors find that same classes of neural stem progenitor cells in humans and chimps are nearly identical at the transcriptome level, and also in their behavior in the cell cycle. A consistent difference identified by the authors is a lengthening of 5 min of metaphase during cell division. The study is timely and addresses a very important question. The reviewers, however, identified a number of technical and conceptual issues that will require the authors' attention.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer 1's main criticism is conceptual. The reviewer argues that an important part of the regulation of cell cycle progression is post-translational. As the cell cycle differences were detected in the VZ (in AP) which is not the major proliferative region in the human and in chimpanzee cortex this finding may not necessarily provide sufficient explanation to the difference between the human and chimpanzee brains. If this is the main goal of this manuscript, it may be more informative to put more emphasis on the human and chimpanzee PAX6 TBR2 NSPCs / PAX6 TBR2- NSPCs, which were not analyzed due to their low numbers. Alternatively, it may be advisable to analyze the changes at the level of protein expression in the AP during metaphase. In case such a study is beyond the scope of the current paper, the manuscript may be modified emphasizing the validity of the organoid system to study the conservation and diversification of cortical development in different species, the technical advances conducted and how they can assist in approaching such a complex and difficult study.</p><p>Reviewer 2 writes that the authors begin by saying: &quot;Notably, whereas no significant differences were observed at D28, at D52-D54, the proportion of PAX6 TBR2 NSPCs in the chimpanzee organoids was nearly twice that in the human organoids, and the proportion of PAX6 TBR2- NSPCs was correspondingly lower, whereas no significant difference between human and chimpanzee was observed for PAX6- TBR2+ NSPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).&quot; The reviewer wonders:</p><p>A) How many organoids were used to make the comparison?</p><p>B) More details are needed to understand the variation within each specie.</p><p>C) The developmental time period for human and chimpanzee is different in vivo. How could the authors account for this age difference in vitro in organoids? Should the time in culture be normalized for gestation length?</p><p>D) What is the evidence that the organoid developmental clock parallels the in vivo clock and how reliably does that clock operate from culture to culture?</p><p>E) The error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> should not be drawn in a manner that obscures the lower SD boundary-error extends in both directions.</p><p>F) Although the authors build their story based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> there is not much difference in the number of Pax6 Tbr2- cells (considered as APs) at Day 52-54 between chimpanzee and human. Does this include cells from all the layers of cortex or just VZ/SVZ or is it not possible to distinguish these layers in the organoids? How many cells are counted per sample? In the figure legend, n=5 at day 28 whereas n=17 at D52-54, Does 'n' represent different organoid sections or different sections from same organoid? The difference in the number of Pax6 Tbr2 cells between chimpanzee and human is not evident in the immunostaining images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The author should provide a better view of the image marking some cells with co-localization of Tbr2 and Pax6. Also, they should comment on what kind of cells are Pax6 Tbr2 cells or comment that the cell type cannot be identified due to the unclear lamination of their organoids.</p><p>Reviewer 2 has the following additional major concerns:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>: Why are different cell populations age biased? Almost all cells from 45d are clustered as mesenchyme cells and all cells from 62d are clustered as hindbrain cells.</p><p>2) Please define clearly APs for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>-6. Are those Pax6 Tbr2- cells? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, no markers have been used to assign those cells as AP. Markers such as Pax6 and Tbr2 with reporter plasmids could be used to trace the cells. This kind of experiment would support the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the authors have tried to address this question but they have used developing mouse neocortex to distinguish proliferative and neurogenic APs. The dynamics of prometaphase-metaphase is very different in mouse as compared to human or chimpanzee, therefore, it is difficult to relate that the lengthening of prometaphase-metaphase characterizes proliferating NPSCs in humans.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, there seems to be considerable difference in prophase between mouse (24.5 min) and human or chimpanzee (~40 min). However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5——figure supplement 1</xref>, no significant difference is shown. Moreover, the bar value for prophase and anaphase does not correlate with the values shown in the live images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Please clarify this difference in figures.</p><p>Furthermore, they found lengthening of the metaphase in human apical progenitors compared to chimp and no difference was observed in other phases during cell mitosis, but they didn't show whether the length of cell cycle for this kind of progenitors is different, which is also important for cell fate determination.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: The method to cluster single cells into G1 and G2/M is neither described nor cited. Moreover, the authors didn't include cells in S phase of cell cycle. If the authors used the same set of genes as described in Camp, Badsha et al. 2015, they divided AP cells into S/G2/M and G1 clusters and not G1 and G2/M.

Whereas one agrees on the concept of transcriptomic continuity across cell types in development, how does this concept fit with the canonical criterion of classifying cell types in the cerebral cortex in discrete groups, as is also done in this study? Although this is clearly not the main focus of the study, this type of classification analysis is quite used throughout the manuscript, and so the authors would do well in discussing this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18683.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary:</italic></p><p><italic>Mora-Bermúdez and colleagues address the fundamental question of what distinguishes human and chimpanzee brain stem progenitor cells leading to the dramatic difference in brain size between these species. To address this technologically very challenging question, the authors use state of the art approaches including brain organoid cultures and single cell RNAseq. In a very remarkable methodological tour-de-force, the authors develop brain organoids from human, chimpanzee and orangutan iPSCs, and go on to perform high resolution live imaging of individual progenitor cells. The authors find that same classes of neural stem progenitor cells in humans and chimps are nearly identical at the transcriptome level, and also in their behavior in the cell cycle. A consistent difference identified by the authors is a lengthening of 5 min of metaphase during cell division. The study is timely and addresses a very important question. The reviewers, however, identified a number of technical and conceptual issues that will require the authors' attention.</italic> </p><p>We sincerely thank all three reviewers for their constructive criticism and overall positive feedback, which has helped us a lot to improve our manuscript. We also would like to thank the Reviewing Editor for kindly preparing the summary and essence of the reviewers' comments.</p><p>In revising the manuscript, we have added two new sets of data.</p><p>First, quantification of the length of prometaphase-metaphase in human and chimpanzee apical progenitors (APs) of day 52 (D52) cerebral organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, comparison with the day 30 (D30) cerebral organoid data that were already included in the original version of our manuscripts reveals that human AP metaphase is shorter at D52 than D30 and not any more different in length from D52 chimpanzee APs. As the proportion of proliferative divisions of human APs would be expected to decrease, and the proportion of differentiative divisions to increase, from D30 to D52, these data are consistent with the concept that a longer metaphase reflects a greater tendency for proliferative than differentiative AP divisions.</p><p>Second, determination of AP cell cycle parameters by cumulative EdU labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). This reveals an only small difference in total cell cycle length between human and chimpanzee APs (≈6% shorter in chimp). Interestingly, however, S-phase in human APs is ≈ 5 hr longer than in chimpanzee APs. As a long S-phase has previously been shown to be a hallmark of proliferative (as opposed to neurogenic) AP divisions (Arai et al. 2011), these data again are consistent with the concept that human APs exhibit a greater tendency for proliferative than differentiative divisions than chimpanzee APs.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer 1's main criticism is conceptual. The reviewer argues that an important part of the regulation of cell cycle progression is post-translational. As the cell cycle differences were detected in the VZ (in AP) which is not the major proliferative region in the human and in chimpanzee cortex this finding may not necessarily provide sufficient explanation to the difference between the human and chimpanzee brains. If this is the main goal of this manuscript, it may be more informative to put more emphasis on the human and chimpanzee PAX6 TBR2 NSPCs / PAX6 TBR2- NSPCs, which were not analyzed due to their low numbers. Alternatively, it may be advisable to analyze the changes at the level of protein expression in the AP during metaphase. In case such a study is beyond the scope of the current paper, the manuscript may be modified emphasizing the validity of the organoid system to study the conservation and diversification of cortical development in different species, the technical advances conducted and how they can assist in approaching such a complex and difficult study.</italic> </p><p>We agree with reviewer 1 that the VZ is not the major proliferative region in the human and chimpanzee cortex, which is the SVZ, in particular the OSVZ as first shown by Dehay, Kennedy and colleagues. Yet, differences in cell cycle parameters between human and chimpanzee apical progenitors (APs), especially at the relatively early stages of cortical development examined in the present study, could impact the extent of basal progenitor (BP) generation and hence SVZ formation. As shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>, we have now determined cell cycle parameters for human and chimpanzee PAX6 TBR2– APs using cumulative EdU labeling, and find a ≈3 hr difference in total cell cycle length between human and chimpanzee D52-54 organoid APs (human 46.5 h, chimpanzee 43.8 h). Interestingly, this difference is essentially accounted for by a longer S-phase of human APs (17.5 hr vs. 12.8 h), which has previously been shown to be a hallmark of proliferative (as opposed to neurogenic) AP divisions (Arai et al. 2011). The difference between human and chimpanzee APs with regard to the progression of mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is in line with the longer S-phase finding, as the longer metaphase plate stage may similarly impact the mode of AP division and thus the fate of the AP progeny. These differences in cell cycle and mitosis parameters between human and chimpanzee APs are consistent with the anticipated differences in cortical development between the two species, as is now discussed in greater detail in the revised manuscript (Discussion, last paragraph).</p><p>We agree with reviewer 1 that it is worth emphasizing the validity of the organoid system to study cortical development in different primates, as well as the technical advancement, and have done so in the Introduction (last paragraph).</p><p>As to the issue of dissecting mitotic phases of TBR2 basal progenitors by live high-resolution time-lapse imaging: we could not analyze these cell divisions in numbers sufficient for quantification due to their lower abundance as compared to APs, as also pointed out by the reviewer. These cell populations were therefore only analyzed by tissue immunofluorescence and RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).</p><p>We agree that a proteomics analysis of mitotic APs would be very interesting, but – as implied by the reviewer – is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p>Reviewer 2 writes that the authors begin by saying: &quot;Notably, whereas no significant differences were observed at D28, at D52-D54, the proportion of PAX6 TBR2 NSPCs in the chimpanzee organoids was nearly twice that in the human organoids, and the proportion of PAX6 TBR2- NSPCs was correspondingly lower, whereas no significant difference between human and chimpanzee was observed for PAX6- TBR2 NSPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).&quot; The reviewer wonders:</p><p><italic>A) How many organoids were used to make the comparison?</italic> </p><p>As mentioned in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> organoids per species were used at day 28 and 17 organoids per species were used at days 52-54.</p><p><italic>B) More details are needed to understand the variation within each specie.</italic> </p><p>For sample numbers, please see response above. For further details, please see revised Methods.</p><p><italic>C) The developmental time period for human and chimpanzee is different</italic> in vivo<italic>. How could the authors account for this age difference</italic> in vitro <italic>in organoids? Should the time in culture be normalized for gestation length?</italic> </p><p>Yes, the developmental time period in vivo is about 15% shorter for the chimpanzee as compared to humans. In line with this, we have preliminary data suggesting that cortical development in chimpanzee cerebral organoids proceeds slightly faster than in human cerebral organoids (unpublished data). However, these differences emerge only at later stages of organoid development and not at the stages included in the present study. Thus, the cortical regions compared between the two species were all positive for the deep-layer neuron marker Ctip2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) and negative for the upper-layer neuron marker Satb2 at D52-D54, and they were all Ctip2-negative at D28, indicating that the human and chimpanzee cerebral organoids were at a comparable stage in their development at these two time points. We therefore think that it would not be appropriate to normalize the time in culture for gestation length, at least not with regard to the relatively early stages of cortical development investigated in the present study.</p><p><italic>D) What is the evidence that the organoid developmental clock parallels the</italic> in vivo <italic>clock and how reliably does that clock operate from culture to culture?</italic> </p><p>It is difficult to precisely determine whether the organoid developmental clock parallels the in vivo clock. Qualitatively, we and others (Lancaster et al. Nature 2013; Qian et al. Cell 2016; Pasca et al. Nature Methods 2015) have observed a general time-dependent progression of neurogenesis and transition to gliogenesis in human cerebral organoids prepared by various recently published protocols.</p><p>As to the issue how reliably that clock operates from culture to culture: We have analyzed human cerebral organoids from two independent iPSC lines and chimp cerebral organoids from two independent iPSC lines, and find that cortical development proceeds reproducibly from culture to culture.</p><p>E) The error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> should not be drawn in a manner that obscures the lower SD boundary-error extends in both directions.</p><p>The figure has been revised such that the error bars now appear in both directions.</p><p>F) Although the authors build their story based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> there is not much difference in the number of Pax6 Tbr2- cells (considered as APs) at Day 52-54 between chimpanzee and human. Does this include cells from all the layers of cortex or just VZ/SVZ or is it not possible to distinguish these layers in the organoids? How many cells are counted per sample? In the figure legend, n=5 at day 28 whereas n=17 at D52-54, Does 'n' represent different organoid sections or different sections from same organoid? The difference in the number of Pax6 Tbr2 cells between chimpanzee and human is not evident in the immunostaining images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The author should provide a better view of the image marking some cells with co-localization of Tbr2 and Pax6. Also, they should comment on what kind of cells are Pax6 Tbr2 cells or comment that the cell type cannot be identified due to the unclear lamination of their organoids.</p><p>The quantification of the Pax6 Tbr2– cells at day 52-54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which yields a significantly lower value for chimpanzee than human, was performed across the entire cortical wall, i.e. from the ventricular to the pial surface, using 100-µm wide fields, as stated in the Methods section. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the vast majority of these cells resided in the VZ (distinguishable as a germinal zone in the DAPI-stained images), consistent with them being APs.</p><p>An average of 350 cells per sample were counted. This information has now been added to the Methods section.</p><p>The ‘n’ represents different organoid sections.</p><p>As requested by the reviewer, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> has been revised and now includes representative insets indicating Pax6 Tbr2 cells at higher magnification, which illustrate the greater proportion of Pax6 Tbr2 cells in chimpanzee than human.</p><p>Based on their location in the SVZ and their marker expression, the Pax6 Tbr2 cells are likely to be basal progenitors committed to neuron production and endowed with self-renewal capacity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2 has the following additional major concerns:</italic> </p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>: Why are different cell populations age biased? Almost all cells from 45d are clustered as mesenchyme cells and all cells from 62d are clustered as hindbrain cells.</p><p>We are aware that these two experiments (45d and 62d) appear as outlier populations. Based on our previous single cell transcriptome analysis of human organoids (Camp, Badsha et al. 2014 and unpublished observations), we do not think that this clustering pattern of chimpanzee cerebral organoid cells is related to the age of the respective organoid. Instead it likely reflects the relative composition of cells and patterned regions of those particular organoids, and our limited sampling of cells per organoid. The organoid protocol that we used (Lancaster et al. 2014) generates heterogeneous batches of organoids, where each organoid might have different brain regions. All organoids analyzed in this study contained one or more stratified cortical-like regions surrounding a ventricle. These cortical-like regions are often patterned as dorsal telencephalon (FOXG1 and OTX2-), however we have observed cortical regions that express ventral telencephalon or hindbrain markers (Camp, Badsha et al. 2015). For the 62d organoid, we observed one relatively large cortical-like region, which we microdissected and used for the scRNA-seq analysis. Based on the clustering pattern and marker gene expression, we concluded that cells from this 62d organoid were from a hindbrain-like region. In contrast, a different 61d organoid from the same batch contained many cerebral cortex cells, arguing against a developmental time-point phenomenon for the 62d organoid.</p><p>We have also observed an abundance of mesenchymal cells in some organoids, and have shown that these mesenchymal cells surround the periphery of cortical regions. In the case of the 45d organoid, we captured many of these mesenchymal cells and, unfortunately, no cerebral cortex cells.</p><p>It will be interesting to understand how the transcriptomes and genetic networks change as a function of age in human and chimpanzee cerebral organoids. However, we would need many more cells and time points to address this challenging question. Higher throughput scRNA-seq technologies, reporter lines marking correctly patterned cerebral cortex-like regions, and/or improved cerebral organoid protocols will help make this feasible in the future.</p><p>2) Please define clearly APs for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4–6</xref>. Are those Pax6 Tbr2- cells? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, no markers have been used to assign those cells as AP. Markers such as Pax6 and Tbr2 with reporter plasmids could be used to trace the cells. This kind of experiment would support the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the authors have tried to address this question but they have used developing mouse neocortex to distinguish proliferative and neurogenic APs. The dynamics of prometaphase-metaphase is very different in mouse as compared to human or chimpanzee, therefore, it is difficult to relate that the lengthening of prometaphase-metaphase characterizes proliferating NPSCs in humans.</p><p>The APs studied in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> are indeed Pax6 Tbr2– cells, because in line with the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, virtually all mitotic figures at the ventricular surface are Pax6 Tbr2–. It is therefore not necessary to use Pax6 and Tbr2 reporter plasmids. Moreover, mitosis at the apical, ventricular surface, as is the case for the dividing cells analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, is the defining criterion of an AP. We have now clarified this issue in the revised text (Introduction, second paragraph and subsection “Spindle orientation dynamics are similar in human and chimpanzee NSPCs”).</p><p>Although the absolute length of prometaphase-metaphase of mouse APs is shorter than that of hominid APs, the chromosome dynamics (e.g. their movements during congression, the building of the metaphase plate) are actually quite similar. Also, other mitotic phases (prophase, telophase, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) are essentially the same for mouse and hominid APs. Therefore, we believe that it is legitimate to relate the longer prometaphase-metaphase of proliferating than neurogenic mouse APs to the longer prometaphase-metaphase of human than chimpanzee APs. Moreover, the shortening of metaphase of human APs with the progression of organoid cortical development from D30 to D52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), when proliferative AP divisions would be expected to decrease, is also consistent with the concept, derived from the dissection of mouse AP mitosis, that a longer metaphase reflects a greater tendency for proliferative than differentiative AP divisions. We have now further clarified this in the revised text (Results).</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, there seems to be considerable difference in prophase between mouse (24.5 min) and human or chimpanzee (~40 min). However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, no significant difference is shown. Moreover, the bar value for prophase and anaphase does not correlate with the values shown in the live images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Please clarify this difference in figures.</p><p>There appears to be a misunderstanding. The time indicated on each image gives the time point relative to anaphase onset (0 min) when that image was taken, not the total time that the cell spent in that phase. Hence, the fact that the mouse prophase image was taken 24.5 min prior to anaphase onset whereas the hominid prophase images were taken 38-39 min prior to anaphase onset simply reflects the finding that prometaphase-metaphase is shorter in mouse APs than hominid APs. The length of prophase is essentially the same for mouse and hominid APs, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. To prevent such misunderstanding, we have now made this more clear in the figure legends.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, they found lengthening of the metaphase in human apical progenitors compared to chimp and no difference was observed in other phases during cell mitosis, but they didn't show whether the length of cell cycle for this kind of progenitors is different, which is also important for cell fate determination.</italic> </p><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have now determined the length of the cell cycle for human and chimpanzee PAX6 TBR2– APs using cumulative EdU labeling, and find a ~2.7 hr difference between human and chimpanzee D52-54 organoid APs (human 46.5 h, chimpanzee 43.8 hr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>. While the reviewer is entirely correct in stating that the length of the cell cycle is, in principle, an important parameter for cell fate determination, we do not believe that in this particular case, the ~6% difference in total cell cycle length between human and chimpanzee APs will differentially impact cell fate. Rather, the longer S-phase of human APs (17.5 hr vs. 12.8 hr for the chimpanzee) is likely to be relevant, as this has previously been shown to be a hallmark of proliferative (as opposed to neurogenic) AP divisions (Arai et al. 2011).</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: The method to cluster single cells into G1 and G2/M is neither described nor cited. Moreover, the authors didn't include cells in S phase of cell cycle. If the authors used the same set of genes as described in Camp, Badsha et al. 2015, they divided AP cells into S/G2/M and G1 clusters and not G1 and G2/M. Please explain the method and also explain why S phase is not included in this analysis.</p><p>We used the same set of genes as described in Camp, Badsha et al. 2015 that divided AP cells into S/G2/M and G1 phases. Specifically we used the top 100 genes that correlated with PC1 from PCA on fetal cortex progenitor cells. We used these genes to hierarchically cluster human organoid APs, chimpanzee organoid APs, endothelial cells, or iPSCs. This generally gave two clear groups of cells that either expressed the genes highly or had low expression of these genes. There were additional sub-clusters of cells that partially expressed the genes. We selected the clusters with high or no/low expression and assigned them as G2/M or G1, respectively, and ignored the intermediate cells. This assignment was consistent with an unbiased assignment using the method published by (Scialdone et al. 2015). The cells that we see as intermediate or transiting cells were distributed between G2/M, S, and G1-phase, whereas the clusters we used in our analysis showed a clear assignment as G2/M or G1. For our differential expression analysis, we wanted to compare two groups of transcriptionally relatively homogeneous cells in G2/M and G1. We therefore excluded ambiguous cells and S-phase cells, which did not have a clear transcriptional signature in our experiment. We have included this information into the Methods section under the heading “Differential gene expression analysis” and added an additional supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, authors show many genes (~80 genes) that are highly expressed throughout the human AP cell cycle and were specific to APs. What is the difference in the list of genes highly expressed in AP cells in humans obtained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>? According to the data, it would mean that the prometaphase-metaphase duration could be prolonged by expressing any of these genes in chimpanzee organoid.</p><p>There are 10 genes that overlap between the genes highlighted in yellow in the top left quadrant of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and the genes highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>. These genes are APOLD1, BICC1, EFNB1, GSTM1, IFI44L, ITGB8, SDK2, SEMA5A, SLC35F1, ZNF516. The analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> was performed to identify genes that are specifically expressed in G2/M APs independent of human-chimpanzee differential expression. Though we did not identify genes that are specific to G2/M APs, we did identify genes that are expressed throughout the cell cycle and generally enriched in APs compared to iPSCs and endothelial cells. The most differentially expressed genes between human and chimpanzee APs, which are also specific to APs, are listed above. It is possible that prometaphase-metaphase duration could be prolonged by over-expressing these genes in chimpanzee organoid. However, as the reviewers point out, the lengthening could also be regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms and/or be affected by amino acids that have diverged between human and chimpanzee. Note that we have now specified these 10 genes in the text (Results, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>6) They have shown the time of mitosis difference for apical progenitors between human and chimp, but what about the basal progenitors as they also contribute substantially to neuron output.</italic> </p><p>It would be very interesting indeed to compare the various mitotic phases of human and chimpanzee basal progenitors by live high-resolution time-lapse imaging. However, as also pointed out by reviewer 1, the abundance of basal progenitors in the cerebral organoids is much lower than that of APs, and the numbers of basal progenitors in mitosis were not sufficient for a reliable quantitative comparison.</p><p><italic>7) Debra L. Silver has reported that prolonged mitosis of progenitors could lead to apoptosis or differentiation (2016, Neuron). Based on this finding one would draw the opposite conclusion.</italic> </p><p>Our results, linking the longer prometaphase-metaphase of human than chimpanzee APs to proliferative AP divisions, may at first sight appear to be opposite to those of Pilaz et al. 2016. However, we would like to emphasize that the experimental system employed by Pilaz et al. and that of the present study are very different from one another. The prometaphase-metaphase lengthening that we observed is a natural difference among three hominids and one rodent species, whereas Pilaz et al. generate a prolongation within one rodent species using drugs and genetic perturbations. The perturbations by Pilaz et al. cause very long prolongations of mitosis that may also be interpreted as mitotic arrest, which could also help explain the abundant cell death seen by Pilaz et al., as cell death is a hallmark of cells undergoing mitotic arrest. We have now clarified this issue in the revised text (Discussion).</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3's criticism is also mainly conceptual. The reviewer argues that 5 min lengthening of metaphase is unlikely to be the only difference between human and chimp, as this would hardly explain differences in brain growth during embryonic development between these species. Is it possible that the influence attributed to the orientation of cleavage plane on the fate of mammalian cortex progenitor cells is overestimated, as recently proposed by Martínez-Martínez et al. (Nat Comm 2016) and others? Are human organoids larger (more cells) than chimpanzee after a similar period in culture? This simple piece of information may help understand if these organoids are indeed helpful to unravel differences between chimp and human cortex development, and if so where to look. Do human aRGs undergo more rounds of cell division than chimp? Is there any evidence in the transcriptomic analyses of differences in genes controlling cell cycle re-entry?</italic> </p><p>We agree with reviewer 3 that the 5-min lengthening of metaphase is unlikely to explain all of the difference between human and chimp in cerebral cortex growth during fetal development. The issue raised by the reviewer in this context, i.e. that a lack of a change in cleavage plane orientation does not preclude a change in daughter cell fate, is an excellent point. This possibility is indeed underscored by the recent work of Martínez-Martínez et al. (Nat Comm 2016) and also by work from the Matsuzaki lab that has shown that a perfectly vertical AP cleavage plane can give rise to either AP or BP daughter cells. Therefore, the reviewer is entirely correct in suggesting that factors other than cleavage plane orientation also influence AP daughter cell fate. In fact, in line with the reviewer's suggestion, our observation that there are no significant differences in spindle orientation between human and chimp made us analyze other aspects of AP division, which led to the finding of the metaphase lengthening. We have now discussed this issue in greater detail in the revised text (Discussion, last paragraph) and have added the Martínez-Martínez et al. 2016 reference.</p><p>As to the issue of human vs. chimpanzee cerebral organoid size:</p><p>The embryoid bodies formed after the iPS cell dissociation and plating may vary in size due to the initial differential clumping of cells. However, thereafter, there is no overt difference between the two species in the size of the organoids formed after a similar period in culture. In this context, we would like to point out that the lack of an overt difference in human vs. chimpanzee cerebral organoid size during the relatively early stages of organoid cortical development studied here does not necessarily imply that this system cannot be used to unravel differences between chimp and human cortex development, as these differences may only become apparent at later stages of organoid development.</p><p>As to the issue of human vs. chimpanzee organoid aRG rounds of cell division and cell cycle re-entry:</p><p>The ≈6% shorter total cell cycle length of chimpanzee APs as compared to human APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>) does not support the possibility that human aRGs undergo more rounds of cell division than chimp. Also, there is no significantly greater abundance of cycling cells (Ki67 cells) in human as compared to chimpanzee cerebral organoid cortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>), consistent with no major difference in NPC cell cycle re-entry between the two species.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3 also asks: Are the differences observed in length of cell cycle phases (and those not observed) due to human-chimp differences in brain development? Or rather they may be due to the transition between iPSC and organoid? The authors nicely compare metaphase in blood B cells from chimp and human and don't find differences. But then, will they find similar differences between human and chimp when comparing organoids from other tissues (i.e. gut organoids)?</italic> </p><p>Our data reveal that both types of differences are present. Compared to iPSCs, the length of prometaphase-metaphase is extended for both human and chimpanzee cerebral organoid APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This shows that a general lengthening of prometaphase-metaphase is caused by the transition from iPSCs to cerebral organoids. However, the total length of prometaphase-metaphase is longer in human than in chimpanzee APs, indicating a species-specific difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, when prometaphase and metaphase were analyzed individually, our data show that, while both human and chimpanzee APs show a lengthening of prometaphase as compared to iPSCs, only the human APs showed also a lengthening of metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This constitutes a species-specific difference. Taken together these results show that the longer prometaphase-metaphase in human APs is due to a lengthening not only of prometaphase, as seen in the chimpanzee, but also of metaphase. We have now made this more clear in the revised text (subsection “Gene expression in human and chimpanzee mitotic Aps”).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that comparing organoids from other tissues would be interesting. However, this would require establishing other types of organoid systems in our lab to perform these complex and demanding experiments, and we think this would be out of the scope of the present study.</p><p><italic>Finally, the reviewer argues: The authors state that &quot;each chimpanzee cell represents a cell state on a continuum from NPSCs to neurons based on gene expression signatures&quot;. Whereas one agrees on the concept of transcriptomic continuity across cell types in development, how does this concept fit with the canonical criterion of classifying cell types in the cerebral cortex in discrete groups, as is also done in this study? Although this is clearly not the main focus of the study, this type of classification analysis is quite used throughout the manuscript, and so the authors would do well in discussing this point.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is a very important point, and an interesting and challenging aspect of scRNA-seq data analysis, interpretation, and presentation. Traditionally, it has been convenient to classify cells into discrete types based on behavior, morphology and/or a small combination of marker genes in order to describe observations and make comparisons. To perform differential gene expression analysis using the Bayesian approach developed by Karchenko et al., which accounts for many of the assumptions inherent to single-cell transcriptome data, cell type classification is required. Therefore, we attempt to connect single cell transcriptome data with traditionally described cell types. In general, we do observe a continuum of transcriptome states across all cells, however we also find accumulations of cells that are similar with respect to the expression of groups of genes and steep transitions from such group of cells to other cells. These cells likely represent a cellular state that is relatively more stable than the apparent intermediates. The genes similarly expressed within such a cell group generally correlate well with previously described cell type marker genes and we therefore think we have the resolution to discretely classify APs, BPs, and neurons. Within each of these more stable cell states (=”cell types”), the continuity is less steep and we don’t have the resolution to determine if there is additional heterogeneity other than that related to cell cycle. There are of course some cells that are in between the previous and next state on the continuum. These intermediate cells are relatively less abundant but we force them into a discrete cell type. For example, if ~51% of a cell’s transcriptome resembles that of other BPs, and 49% of its transcriptome appears to be neuronal, then we assign this cell BP. Since these cells are relatively rare and present in both human and chimpanzee, we do not think that we introduce a bias into the differential gene expression analysis by including these cells.</p><p>We added the following statement to make this point more clear:</p><p>“Though this classification is convenient to describe the cell types present in the chimpanzee organoid, we note that many of the cells can be described as intermediates between APs, BPs, and different stages of neuron maturation.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
