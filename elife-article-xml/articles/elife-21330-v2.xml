glutamine catabolism. Although Otto Warburg first described aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells &gt;90 years ago, the primary purpose of this metabolic switch remains controversial. The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway requires glucose and glutamine for de novo synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, a sugar-nucleotide that inhibits receptor endocytosis and signaling by promoting N-acetylglucosamine branching of Asn (N)-linked glycans. Here, we report that aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis co-operatively reduce UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis and N-glycan branching in mouse T cell blasts by starving the hexosamine pathway of glucose and glutamine. This drives growth and pro-inflammatory T<sub>H</sub>17 over anti-inflammatory-induced T regulatory (iTreg) differentiation, the latter by promoting endocytic loss of IL-2 receptor-α (CD25). Thus, a primary function of aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis is to co-operatively limit metabolite supply to N-glycan biosynthesis, an activity with widespread implications for autoimmunity and cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21330.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21330.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>N-glycosylation</kwd><kwd>Warburg effect</kwd><kwd>glycolysis</kwd><kwd>glutaminolysis</kwd><kwd>T cell</kwd><kwd>N-acetylglucosamine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI053331</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Demetriou</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008460</institution-id><institution>National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AT007452</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Demetriou</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI108917</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Demetriou</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metabolic switches between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis plus glutaminolysis direct T cell function by altering the flux of glucose and glutamine to N-glycosylation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Under anaerobic conditions oxidative phosphorylation is blocked, forcing cells to generate ATP by converting glucose to lactate via glycolysis. This is a highly inefficient use of glucose, generating only 2 ATP per glucose instead of 36–38 ATP per glucose with complete oxidation. Yet under aerobic conditions, rapidly dividing cells such as T cells paradoxically switch their metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis, where glucose is fermented to lactate despite the presence of oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Warburg et al., 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Warburg et al., 1924</xref>) and primary carbon flux into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) is switched from glucose to glutamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DeBerardinis et al., 2007</xref>). The function of this metabolic switch has remained obscure since Otto Warburg first reported that cancer cells ferment glucose to lactate despite the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis) over 90 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Warburg et al., 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Warburg et al., 1924</xref>). Glucose metabolites generated by glycolysis are precursors for nucleotide, amino acid and lipid biosynthetic pathways, leading some to suggest that increased glucose uptake may serve to promote the biomass required for rapid cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>). However, these biosynthetic pathways account for &lt;10% of the increase in glucose uptake induced by the Warburg effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DeBerardinis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hume et al., 1978</xref>), implying other critical functions. Alternatively, constraining oxidative phosphorylation in rapidly dividing cells may serve to limit cellular damage from reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Le et al., 2010</xref>). This hypothesis is questioned by the observation that genetically blocking lactate production in lung cancer does not activate oxidative phosphorylation in vivo yet still induces disease regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xie et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to cancer, T cells provide an excellent physiologic model to investigate the normal function of aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis. Indeed, aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis have recently been suggested to promote pro-inflammatory IFNγ synthesis and T<sub>H</sub>1 differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gubser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klysz et al., 2015</xref>), respectively. Aerobic glycolysis also promotes anti-tumor T cell activity and differentiation into pro-inflammatory T helper 17 (T<sub>H</sub>17) over anti-inflammatory T regulatory (Treg) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Michalek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shi et al., 2011</xref>). Several of these studies implicated specific pathway enzymes or metabolites, such as GAPDH, α-ketoglutarate and phosphoenolpyruvate, for control of IFNγ translation, T<sub>H</sub>1 differentiation and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux, respectively. However, these mechanisms are not easily generalizable to other cell types and/or do not consider the global consequences of metabolite shifts or the combined effects of aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis.</p><p>Asn (N)-linked protein glycosylation utilizes both glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>) and glutamine, yet surprisingly, this pathway has not been investigated as a target of aerobic glycolysis and/or glutaminolysis. Branched N-glycans bind galectins at the cell surface to simultaneously inhibit the endocytosis and signaling of multiple surface receptors and transporters, thereby controlling cell growth, differentiation and disease states such as autoimmunity, cancer and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Demetriou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dennis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Granovsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mkhikian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ohtsubo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Partridge et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). In T cells, N-glycan branching regulates development, growth, differentiation and autoimmunity by altering T cell receptor clustering/signaling, surface retention/localization of CD4, CD8, CD45 and CTLA-4, and the differentiation into pro-inflammatory T<sub>H</sub>1 over anti-inflammatory T<sub>H</sub>2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Demetriou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morgan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Branching in N-glycans depends on UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis via the hexosamine pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dennis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grigorian et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mkhikian et al., 2016</xref>). De novo synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, the sugar-nucleotide donor substrate required by the N-glycan branching Golgi enzymes Mgat1, 2, 4 and 5, begins with the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to glucosamine-6-phosphate by the rate-limiting enzyme glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (GFPT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Fructose-6-phosphate is derived from glucose by the action of hexokinase/glucokinase (HK) followed by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) and is the critical entry step into glycolysis via the key regulatory enzyme phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). GFPT also requires glutamine as an amine donor to generate glucosamine-6-phosphate from fructose-6-phosphate. Thus, the hexosamine pathway may be in direct competition with glycolysis and glutaminolysis for fructose-6-phosphate and glutamine, respectively. Here, we test the hypothesis that aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis cooperatively starve the hexosamine pathway of both glucose and glutamine, thereby reducing de novo UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis and N-glycan branching, the latter altering cell function.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21330.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>N-glycan branching controls T<sub>H</sub>17 versus iTreg cell fate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fructose 6-phosphate and glutamine may be metabolized by glycolysis and glutaminolysis, respectively, or enter the hexosamine pathway to supply UDP-GlcNAc to the Golgi branching enzymes Mgat1, 2, 4 and 5.

Induction of T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation strongly induces aerobic glycolysis, but when glycolysis is inhibited, cell fate is switched from pro-inflammatory T<sub>H</sub>17 to anti-inflammatory iTreg cells by an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shi et al., 2011</xref>). If aerobic glycolysis starves the hexosamine pathway of fructose-6-phosphate, T<sub>H</sub>17 cytokines are expected to decrease branching via reduced biosynthesis of UDP-GlcNAc. To evaluate this possibility, we performed flow cytometry with L-PHA (<italic>Phaseolus vulgaris, leukoagglutinin</italic>), a plant lectin that binds specifically to β1,6 GlcNAc-branched N-glycans made by the Mgat5 enzyme and serves as a gauge of overall branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cummings and Kornfeld, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Demetriou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Strikingly, T<sub>H</sub>17 inducing cytokines (TGFβ+IL-6+IL-23) acted synergistically to markedly reduce L-PHA binding in activated T cells by ~3–4 fold, despite each cytokine individually having minimal effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with reduced branching T<sub>H</sub>17 inducing cytokines also significantly reduced binding of E-PHA (<italic>Phaseolus vulgaris, erthroagglutinin</italic>) while increasing the binding of ConA (Concanavalin A), plant lectins that bind bisecting and high-mannose N-glycans, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Reduced branching should also decrease galectin binding and indeed, T<sub>H</sub>17 inducing cytokines markedly reduced the binding of galectin-3 to activated T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As only a ~20% change in branching is sufficient to alter T cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mkhikian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), the reduction induced by T<sub>H</sub>17 inducing cytokines is highly significant. Although branching was reduced, mRNA expression of the Golgi branching genes <italic>Mgat1</italic> and <italic>Mgat5</italic> were unchanged or increased, consistent with reduced UDP-GlcNAc supply being primarily responsible for lowering branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Indeed, while T cell activation markedly increases protein expression of GFPT1 as well as the critical glycolytic enzymes HK1, GPI and PFK1 isoenzymes (liver, platelet and muscle), GFPT1 is uniquely and specifically down-regulated by T<sub>H</sub>17 cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). GFPT2 is an isoenzyme of GFPT1 but is not detectable by Western blot in T cells (data not shown). As GFPT1 and the three PFK1 isoenzymes all utilize fructose-6-phosphate, the reduction in GFPT1 induced by T<sub>H</sub>17 cytokines should favor glucose flux into glycolysis over the hexosamine pathway. Indeed, UDP-GlcNAc production is reduced by T<sub>H</sub>17 cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that T<sub>H</sub>17 cytokines reduce UDP-GlcNAc production, branching and GFPT1 expression, the rate-limiting enzyme for entry of fructose-6-phosphate into the hexosamine pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>N-glycan branching induces a cell fate switch from T<sub>H</sub>17 to iTreg</title><p>Next, we examined whether TGFβ+IL-6+IL-23 induced reductions in UDP-GlcNAc and branching was required for T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we bypassed the effects of GFPT1 competition for fructose-6-phosphate by exploiting the hexosamine salvage pathway, where N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is used to generate UDP-GlcNAc directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grigorian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lau et al., 2007</xref>). GlcNAc is metabolically inert within cells and does not enter glycolysis, the TCA cycle or the pentose phosphate pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wellen et al., 2010</xref>). Supplementing T cells with GlcNAc reversed the reduction in branching induced by T<sub>H</sub>17 cytokines and markedly inhibited T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Remarkably, GlcNAc supplementation not only blocked T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation but also induced a cell fate switch to iTreg cells, despite the presence of T<sub>H</sub>17-inducing cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The mannosidase I inhibitor kifunensine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) blocks branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and reversed the effects of GlcNAc supplementation, confirming that raising UDP-GlcNAc levels with GlcNAc supplementation blocked T<sub>H</sub>17 and promoted iTreg differentiation by restoring branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Oral delivery of GlcNAc to mice with Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis, a model of multiple sclerosis, blocked disease progression, raised branching in T cells and suppressed T<sub>H</sub>17 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grigorian et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To confirm this result genetically, we utilized the tet-on system to generate a mouse with inducible expression of the Golgi branching enzyme Mgat5 (ROSA<sup>rtTA</sup><italic>Mgat5</italic><sup>tet</sup>).

The magnitude of this change was less than that of GlcNAc supplementation, consistent with reduced de novo synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc by aerobic glycolysis primarily limiting branching.

Branching promotes surface retention of glucose transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ohtsubo et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with this, glucose uptake under T<sub>H</sub>17-inducing conditions was enhanced by GlcNAc and inhibited by kifunensine, as measured by intracellular staining for the glucose analog 2-NBDG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This suggests that GlcNAc supplementation does not directly inhibit aerobic glycolysis. Indeed, under T<sub>H</sub>17 inducing conditions, GlcNAc supplementation did not significantly alter the glycolytic state of the cells prior to differentiation, as measured by the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) at day 2 of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggests that catabolism of fructose-6-phosphate to lactate is not necessary to drive T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation. To confirm this, we directly limited glucose flux into glycolysis by forcing oxidative phosphorylation using either the glycolytic inhibitor rapamycin or media supplemented with galactose instead of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). Rapamycin inhibits mTOR (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) signaling via binding to mTOR complex 1, thereby reducing HIF-1α expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Land and Tee, 2007</xref>), a transcription factor that up-regulates glycolysis enzymes including HK, PGM and PFK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Semenza et al., 1994</xref>). Galactose is much more slowly converted to pyruvate than glucose, forcing cells to up-regulate oxidative phosphorylation at the expense of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). Rapamycin and galactose both lowered aerobic glycolysis, enhanced branching and drove iTreg over T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–G</xref>). Importantly, the latter was reversed with <italic>Mgat1</italic> deficiency or kifunensine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), demonstrating that the increase in branching induced by blocking glycolysis was necessary to switch cell fate from T<sub>H</sub>17 to iTreg. Rapamycin had little effect on GFPT1 levels, while galactose marginally increased GFPT1, consistent with glycolysis largely acting by metabolically limiting flux of fructose-6-phosphate to the hexosamine/branching pathway rather than altering enzyme expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Importantly, kifunensine did not reverse the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis induced by rapamycin and galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>), establishing that T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation does not require aerobic glycolysis beyond its effects on branching. 2-Deoxy-D-glucose is another commonly used inhibitor of glycolysis; however, this molecule is also 2-deoxy-D-mannose and inhibits N-glycan biosynthesis via incorporation of 2-deoxy-D-mannose into the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, 2-deoxy-D-glucose/2-deoxy-D-mannose reduced branching and promoted T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>), consistent with branching being dominant over aerobic glycolysis in controlling T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a primary function of aerobic glycolysis during T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation is to lower branching by starving the hexosamine pathway of fructose-6-phosphate substrate availability.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21330.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Glycolysis promotes T<sub>H</sub>17 over iTreg cell fate by inhibiting N-glycan branching.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Ratio of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) to the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of purified splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at rest or activated with anti-CD3+anti-CD28 for 2 days with T<sub>H</sub>17 cytokines (TGFβ+IL-6+IL-23) or as indicated.

Based on our model that glycolysis and the hexosamine pathway compete for fructose-6-phosphate, lipid oxidation should favor flux of fructose-6-phosphate into the hexosamine pathway over glycolysis and thereby increase UDP-GlcNAc, branching and iTreg differentiation via IL-2/CD25/STAT5 signaling.

In the absence of polarizing cytokines, TCR stimulation also increases glucose uptake and induces aerobic glycolysis. However, in contrast to T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, GFPT1 is markedly up-regulated in neutral T cell blasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

GFPT1 absolutely requires glutamine as an amine donor to convert fructose-6-phosphate to glucosamine-6-phosphate, the first step of the de novo hexosamine pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This suggests that glutaminolysis may reduce availability of glutamine to the hexosamine pathway, thereby lowering branching to drive T<sub>H</sub>17 over iTreg differentiation. To examine this possibility, we investigated whether excess exogenous glutamine can reverse the reduction in branching induced by T<sub>H</sub>17 cytokines and thereby drive iTreg over T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation. Indeed, under T<sub>H</sub>17 conditions excess glutamine raised branching, markedly inhibited T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation and induced a cell fate switch to iTreg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These phenotypes were reversed by blocking branching with kifunensine, confirming that excess glutamine acted by raising branching.

Blocking glutaminase activity with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) or azaserine should increase glutamine supply to GFPT1. Indeed, both glutaminase inhibitors enhanced branching and induced a cell fate switch from T<sub>H</sub>17 to iTreg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–J</xref>). Klysz et al. reported that glutamine deprivation drives iTreg over T<sub>H</sub>1 differentiation by reducing glutamine catabolism to α-ketoglutarate, a conclusion suggested by the ability of the α-ketoglutarate analog dimethyl-2-oxoglutarate (DMK) to restore T<sub>H</sub>1 over iTreg differentiation in the presence of glutamine deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klysz et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, we observed that DMK did not reverse the effects of glutaminase inhibition by DON on branching or T<sub>H</sub>17 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,G</xref>). However, DMK did induce a partial rescue of iTreg generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Moreover, blocking branching with kifunensine only partially reversed the effects of DON and Azaserine on T<sub>H</sub>17 versus iTreg generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–J</xref>). Together, these data indicate that glutamine availability regulates branching to affect T<sub>H</sub>17 versus iTreg differentiation, but other factors such as catabolism of glutamine to α-ketoglutarate likely also play a role.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21330.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Glutaminolysis promotes T<sub>H</sub>17 over iTreg cell fate by inhibiting N-glycan branching.</title><p>(<bold>A–J</bold>) Flow cytometry of purified splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells activated with anti-CD3+anti-CD28 under T<sub>H</sub>17-inducing conditions (TGFβ+IL-6+IL-23) (<bold>A,B,E–J</bold>) or in the presence of TGFβ (<bold>C,D</bold>).

Rapidly proliferating mammalian cells paradoxically stop the complete oxidation of glucose and instead ferment glucose to lactate while using glutamine rather than glucose to supply the TCA cycle. This extracts 18-fold less energy per glucose molecule while markedly increasing catabolism of glutamine, changes that should limit glucose and glutamine flux into other pathways. Indeed, our data support a model where a primary function of aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis is to co-operatively limit the flux of glucose and glutamine into the hexosamine pathway, thereby inhibiting N-glycan branching and associated down-stream phenotypes.</p><p>In T cells, reduced branching induced by aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis promotes pro-inflammatory T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation over anti-inflammatory iTreg differentiation. Restoring branching and UDP-GlcNAc levels via salvage of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) into the hexosamine pathway does not alter the glycolytic state of the cell, yet switches cell fate from T<sub>H</sub>17 to iTreg cells by blocking endocytic loss of IL-2 receptor-α (CD25). Forcing oxidative phosphorylation raises branching to drive iTreg over T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation. Blocking the increase in branching reverses the latter phenotypes, demonstrating that aerobic glycolysis is not essential for T cell growth/differentiation control beyond regulation of branching. We conclude that metabolic switches between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis plus glutaminolysis primarily target hexosamine/N-glycosylation via altered glucose and glutamine flux and as a consequence, influence T cell differentiation and growth.</p><p>GlcNAc has recently been reported to promote glucose, glutamine, and fatty acid uptake in liver and/or adipose tissue via branching induced increases in surface retention of metabolite transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ryczko et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, we observed that modifying branching in T cells with GlcNAc or kifunensine altered glucose uptake. However, GlcNAc or kifunensine did not acutely alter the metabolic state of the T cell, as measured by the oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate. Consistent with this, we have previously shown that lowering branching does not alter UDP-GlcNAc levels in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mkhikian et al., 2016</xref>). GlcNAc does raise UDP-GlcNAc levels, which may impact other glycan pathways such as O-glycans, O-GlcNAc or CMP-sialic scid, in addition to N-glycan branching. However, the effects of GlcNAc on T cell differentiation were reversed by directly blocking Golgi branching activity, confirming that the effects of raised UDP-GlcNAc were predominantly through branching rather than other pathways. Moreover, blocking the effects of the metabolic modulators rapamycin, galactose or etoximer on branching reversed their effects on T cell differentiation despite not reversing effects on metabolism. In this manner, T cell differentiation can be decoupled from the metabolic state of the cell by manipulating branching. However, our data does not exclude metabolically driven changes in other pathways and indeed, the effects of glutaminolysis on branching appear to only partially explain the phenotype.</p><p>The competition between PFK1 and GFPT for fructose-6-phosphate is essential for determining the extent of glucose flux into the hexosamine/branching pathways. During T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation, GFPT1 is down-regulated and PFK1 dominates, restricting glucose flux into the hexosamine pathway and lowering branching relative to neutral T cell blasts. In contrast, GFPT1 is up-regulated in neutral T cell blasts, allowing increases in glucose uptake to raise de novo UDP-GlcNAc production and branching relative to resting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lau et al., 2007</xref>); however, aerobic glycolysis still functions to limit the extent of glucose flux into the hexosamine pathway and thereby functions to promote growth.</p><p>The Warburg effect was first described in cancer cells, where branching and Mgat5 are pathologically over-expressed and serve as essential drivers of growth, motility and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Granovsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Partridge et al., 2004</xref>). N-glycan branching and the hexosamine pathway promote epithelial to mesenchymal transition and tumor growth by regulating surface expression of receptor tyrosine kinases and TGFβ receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Demetriou et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Partridge et al., 2004</xref>). While oncogenes such as Kras have been reported to turn on hexosamine and N-glycan pathway genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ying et al., 2012</xref>), the functional connection between aerobic glycolysis and hexosamine/branching in cancer has not been established. GFPT expression is elevated in a number of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Itkonen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ying et al., 2012</xref>) (R. Zhou and M. Demetriou, unpublished data), where it is expected to promote flux of glucose into the hexosamine pathway and branching. Our data in T cells suggest that although increased GFPT and MGAT5 expression in cancer drive UDP-GlcNAc and branching, aerobic glycolysis is expected to do the opposite and limit UDP-GlcNAc expression and branching. The latter would inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, but this phenotype may be masked by up-regulation of GFPT and/or MGAT5. This would parallel our results in neutral T cell blasts, where aerobic glycolysis limits branching yet elevated GFPT and MGAT5 act downstream to increase branching. The functional consequences of aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis on branching in cancer merit further investigation.</p><p>The ability of GlcNAc to promote iTreg while blocking T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation further validates its potential as a therapeutic for autoimmune disorders. We have previously shown that GlcNAc limits T cell activation/growth and when provided orally to mice, inhibits experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), as well as autoimmune diabetes in the Non Obese Diabetic mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grigorian et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2007</xref>). GlcNAc has also been given orally (3–6 g/day) to children with refractory inflammatory bowel disease for ~2 years, with 8 of 12 showing clinical improvement without reported toxicities and/or side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Salvatore et al., 2000</xref>). We have recently observed that serum levels of endogenous GlcNAc are markedly reduced in patients with the progressive form of MS and correlate with clinical disability and imaging measures of neurodegeneration (Alexander Brandt and Michael Demetriou, unpublished data). A pilot study of low-dose oral GlcNAc in MS (3 g/day) increased serum GlcNAc levels and branching in T cells (Barbara Newton and Michael Demetriou, unpublished data). As GlcNAc is a dietary supplement that is for sale ‘over the counter’ in the US, these data suggest that GlcNAc may serve as a safe and inexpensive therapeutic for MS patients and potentially other autoimmune diseases.</p><p>In summary, our data brings new clarity to the function of aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis and has widespread implications for the role of metabolism in disease states as diverse as autoimmunity and cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Mgat5-</italic>deficient and doxycycline-inducible <italic>Mgat1-</italic>deficient mice (<italic>Mgat1<sup>f/f</sup></italic>tetO-Cre<sup>+</sup>ROSA<sup>rtTA</sup>) were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Demetriou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Glycolysis and glutaminolysis cooperatively control T cell function by limiting metabolite supply to N-glycosylation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michel Nussenzweig (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom served as Guest Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>This interesting report shows that pro-inflammatory cytokines induce a metabolic switch in T cells to aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis that starves the hexosamine pathway, reduces UDP-GlcNAc levels, and as a consequence reduces branching of N-linked glycans that coincides with the differentiation to pro-inflammatory T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and suppression of iTregs. While the data provide significant insights into the relationship between induction of aerobic catalysis and changes in glycosylation, the reviewers felt that the report implies a causal relationship between branching of N-linked glycans and differentiation of T cells to iTregs that is not fully supported by the data.</p><p>Major conclusions:</p><p>– T<sub>H</sub>17 cytokines induces a metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis, differentiation of pro-inflammatory T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, and suppression of differentiation to iTreg cells.</p><p>– Aerobic glycolysis and reduced glutaminolysis consumes precursors of GlcNAc and UDP-GlcNAc, resulting in reduced branching of N-linked cytokines.</p><p>– Bypassing the suppression of N-linked glycan branching in the presence of T<sub>H</sub>17 cytokines by administering GlcNAc or, to a lesser extent, by increasing the expression of the branching enzyme, Mgat5, restores branching of N-linked glycans and reverses suppression of differentiation to iTregs.</p><p>– Causal relationships between N-linked glycan branching and function of surface receptors (e.g. IL2 receptor, CD25) suggest that N-linked glycan branching may play a direct role in driving T<sub>H</sub>17/ iTreg differentiation.</p><p>Required revisions:</p><p>The reviewers expressed major concerns about narrowly focusing interpretation of the results, with a bias that N-linked glycan branching controlled T cell differentiation. This was to the exclusion of the potential for branching to be coincidental to factors that induced differentiation or even other aspects of glycosylation that could be playing a principle role (e.g. O-GlcNAc glycosylation). A related concern was the lack of data confirming that changes in N-linked branching was taking place. Changes were only measured with the lectin PHA-L. There was no effort to assess how quantitative the changes in branching were. Addressing these concerns should be a priority in a revised manuscript.</p><p>There are several places in the manuscript that suggest the metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis targets the hexosamine/N-glycosylation pathway to control T cell differentiation. Rather what has been shown is that the downstream effects are a consequence of the switch to aerobic glycolysis. The implication that this metabolic switch occurs to control these events goes beyond what is shown. It is a subtle difference but an important one.</p><p>Abstract, bottom line: “and N-glycan branching to control cell function” should be “N-glycan branching that controls cell function”.</p><p>Discussion, first paragraph: “aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis act in concert to control cell growth and differentiation”.</p><p>Discussion, second paragraph, last sentence: “We conclude that metabolic switches… target hexosamine/N-glycosylation… to control T cell differentiation and growth”.</p><p>The authors ignore a recent article (PMID 26972830) reporting that providing GlcNAc to mice &quot;increased N-glycan branching&quot; and showed altered glucose homeostasis (increased uptake), hepatic glycogen, lipid metabolism, and response to fasting. In cultured cells they reported &quot;enhanced uptake of glucose, glutamine, and fatty acids&quot; and &quot;enhanced lipid synthesis&quot;. These results show that GlcNAc supplementation does not only impact N-glycan branching. It would change N- and O-linked glycan structures (not measured here). GlcNAc can be also epimerized to ManNAc and fuel the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway (not measured here). GlcNAc supplementation and the concomitant increase in glucose uptake would significantly impact O-GlcNAc levels, which alters many cell biological processes, including those of T cell differentiation (not explored here). In other parts of the article they supplement with galactose, but this is known to increase sialylation (PMID 25931375), and supplementation with glucose (also performed in this study) drives O-GlcNAcylation.</p><p>The authors have chosen to look at only one type of structure (N-glycan branching, as measured by PHA-L,) and never performed complete glycan composition from the cell surface, an overall measure of O-GlcNAc levels in cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, or any detailed glycomic analysis.</p><p>Mgat5 is claimed to be responsible for the synthesis of glycan branch recognized by PHA-L by the authors. The deletion of Mgat5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> has only a modest change in the induction of Tregs, yet these cells should be completely PHA-L negative. Compare this to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>. The small change in PHA-L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) is not convincingly associated with the large reported change in T cell phenotype in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, especially given the magnitudes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> where PHA-L staining should be gone. This suggests that something not measurable with PHA-L is at play and that PHA-L is a poor measure of outcome.</p><p>mTOR is O-GlcNAcylated (PMID 20410138). Altering the balance of UDP-GlcNAc through various means in a cell, including the use of kifunensine, could easily alter the function of mTOR. The authors do not explore this possibility.</p><p>Several comments about changes in receptor function resulting from N-linked glycan branching should be addressed:</p><p>IL-2 is required for Treg survival, thus the conclusion reached by the authors that IL-2 &quot;is required for branching to promote iTreg over T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>)&quot; is not directly supported by the data. Without IL-2, Tregs die, with or without highly branched glycans.</p><p>The authors conclude that branching drives CD25 surface retention, but they only measure CD25 surface concentration. There is no direct data showing anything about surface retention. It is possible that the expression is merely lower.

This was to the exclusion of the potential for branching to be coincidental to factors that induced differentiation or even other aspects of glycosylation that could be playing a principle role (e.g. O-GlcNAc glycosylation).</italic> </p><p>The reviewers raise the major issue that our data only supports the conclusion that alterations in branching induced by metabolic changes are coincidental rather than causal for T cell differentiation. We fully agree that by itself, our data demonstrating that GlcNAc raised UDP-GlcNAc/branching and affected T cell differentiation may be coincidental to other factors altered by metabolism, including other glycans (e.g. O-GlcNAc) that we did not assess. However, we feel our data goes well beyond this correlation to provide strong evidence of a causal relationship:</p><p>First, we show that directly altering branching enzyme activity in the Golgi with either a small molecule (kifunensine) or three different genetic approaches (inducible knockout of Mgat1, knockout of Mgat5 and inducible transgenic over-expression of Mgat5) all directly alter T<sub>H</sub>17 and iTreg differentiation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B, C</xref>).</p><p>Second, we have previously published in <italic>eLife</italic> that inhibition of branching with small molecules (kifunensine, swainsonine) or genetically (Mgat2 deficiency) does not alter UDP-GlcNAc levels in T cells (Mkhikian et al. (2016) <italic>eLife</italic> 5 e14814). Therefore, altering branching should have no secondary effects on other UDP-GlcNAc dependent pathways, such as O-GlcNAc.</p><p>Third, we show that the effects of GlcNAc on T cell differentiation are reversed by directly blocking Golgi branching activity with kifunensine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). If other pathways were essential (e.g. O-GlcNAc), then blocking branching would not have reversed the effects of GlcNAc.</p><p>Fourth, we show that GlcNAc and kifunensine do not significantly alter the metabolic state of the T cell (as measured by the Oxygen Consumption Rate versus the Extracellular Acidification Rate – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>), yet result in profound changes in T cell differentiation. Thus, manipulating branching does not acutely induce significant metabolic changes in the T cell, consistent with our published data that reducing branching does not alter UDP-GlcNAc levels in T cells (Mkhikian et al. (2016) <italic>eLife</italic> 5 e14814). Note that we do show that altering branching with GlcNAc and kifunensine induces a mild change in glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but this is insufficient to significantly alter aerobic glycolysis/oxidative phosphorylation or UDP-GlcNAc levels in T cells.</p><p>Fifth, we demonstrate that T<sub>H</sub>17 versus iTreg differentiation can be de-coupled from the metabolic state of the cell by manipulating branching. Specifically, we show that inhibiting aerobic glycolysis with rapamycin or galactose as well as oxidative phosphorylation with Etoxomir not only alters branching as predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>), but that reversing the changes in branching (using GlcNAc, kifunensine and/or inducible Mgat1 KO) blocks the effects of the metabolic inhibitors on T cell differentiation/proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>). Most importantly, blocking branching with kifunensine did not reverse the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis induced by rapamycin or galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>), yet reversed their effects on T<sub>H</sub>17 versus iTreg differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). This demonstrates that the change in branching induced by altering metabolism is not simply co-incidental but required for altering T<sub>H</sub>17 versus iTreg differentiation.</p><p>Thus, while we fully agree with the reviewers that metabolic changes in the cell and GlcNAc likely alter other pathways, our data provide strong evidence that metabolically driven changes in branching are <italic>causal</italic> in controlling T<sub>H</sub>17 versus iTreg differentiation. However, we agree that this does not exclude a role for other pathways. Indeed, we observed that the effects of glutaminolysis on branching only partially explain the effects on T cell differentiation. This was based on our observation that 1) while the α-ketoglutarate analog DMK did not reverse the effects of glutaminase inhibition by DON on branching or T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, G</xref>), it did partially rescue effects on iTreg differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) and 2) blocking branching with kifunensine only partially reversed the effects of glutaminase inhibition by DON and Azaserine on T<sub>H</sub>17 versus iTreg generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G-J</xref>). These data are discussed in the last few sentences of the Results section, where we state “Together, these data indicate that glutamine availability regulates branching to affect T<sub>H</sub>17 versus iTreg differentiation, but other factors such as catabolism of glutamine to α-ketoglutarate likely also play a role.” We have also added a paragraph to the Discussion to further emphasize these points.</p><p><italic>A related concern was the lack of data confirming that changes in N-linked branching was taking place. Changes were only measured with the lectin PHA-L. There was no effort to assess how quantitative the changes in branching were. Addressing these concerns should be a priority in a revised manuscript.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. To confirm reduction in N-glycan branching, we have added new flow cytometry data with additional lectins demonstrating that T<sub>H</sub>17 cytokines 1) reduced LacNAc content (i.e. reduced Galectin-3 binding), 2) reduced bisecting branched N-glycans (i.e. reduced E-PHA binding) and 3) increased high-mannose N-glycans (i.e. increased ConA binding) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). All of these changes will lead to reduced galectin binding to N-glycans, thereby weakening the galectin-glycoprotein lattice and drive downstream phenotypes.</p><p>In terms of quantitation, measuring ‘mean fluorescence intensity’ by flow cytometry is the primary method to <italic>quantitatively</italic> assess levels of molecules at the cell surface. Others and we have previously validated flow cytometry with L-PHA as a highly sensitive, specific and quantitative measure of branching at the cell surface (via comparison to MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and HPEAC – see Lau et al. (2007) Cell, Grigorian et al. (2007, 2011) JBC and Mkhikian et al. (2016) <italic>eLife</italic>). As the enzymes in the N-glycan branching pathway act linearly and with declining efficiency, production of β1,6 GlcNAc branched tri- and tetra-antennary N-glycans (the ligand for L-PHA) not only depends on Mgat5 activity but also on the activity of upstream enzymes (e.g. Mgat1, Mgat2, mannosidase I, mannosidase II). For example, titrations of inhibitors for mannosidase I (kifunensine) or mannosidase II (swainsonine) show a direct relationship to changes in L-PHA binding as measured by flow cytometry. Thus, L-PHA flow cytometry is a quantitative measure of the overall output of the branching pathway, rather than simply a measure of Mgat5 activity.</p><p>Point by point responses to other issues are presented below.</p><p><italic>There are several places in the manuscript that suggest the metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis targets the hexosamine/N-glycosylation pathway to control T cell differentiation. Rather what has been shown is that the downstream effects are a consequence of the switch to aerobic glycolysis. The implication that this metabolic switch occurs to control these events goes beyond what is shown. It is a subtle difference but an important one.</italic></p><p><italic>Abstract, bottom line: “and N-glycan branching to control cell function” should be “N-glycan branching that controls cell function”.</italic></p><p>The suggested change has been made (last sentence of Introduction).</p><p><italic>Discussion, first paragraph: “aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis act in concert to control cell growth and differentiation”.</italic> </p><p>The sentence has been deleted.</p><p><italic>Discussion, second paragraph, last sentence: “We conclude that metabolic switches… target hexosamine/N-glycosylation… to control T cell differentiation and growth”.</italic> </p><p>This has been changed to “We conclude that metabolic switches between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis plus glutaminolysis primarily target hexosamine/N-glycosylation via altered glucose and glutamine flux, and as a consequence influence T cell differentiation and growth.”</p><p><italic>The authors ignore a recent article (PMID 26972830) reporting that providing GlcNAc to mice &quot;increased N-glycan branching&quot; and showed altered glucose homeostasis (increased uptake), hepatic glycogen, lipid metabolism, and response to fasting. In cultured cells they reported &quot;enhanced uptake of glucose, glutamine, and fatty acids&quot; and &quot;enhanced lipid synthesis&quot;. These results show that GlcNAc supplementation does not only impact N-glycan branching. It would change N- and O-linked glycan structures (not measured here). GlcNAc can be also epimerized to ManNAc and fuel the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway (not measured here). GlcNAc supplementation and the concomitant increase in glucose uptake would significantly impact O-GlcNAc levels, which alters many cell biological processes, including those of T cell differentiation (not explored here). In other parts of the article they supplement with galactose, but this is known to increase sialylation (PMID 25931375), and supplementation with glucose (also performed in this study) drives O-GlcNAcylation.</italic> </p><p>PMID 26972830 and our work differ in that PMID 26972830 is assessing the downstream effects of GlcNAc/branching on metabolism while we do the opposite, examining the downstream effects of metabolism on branching. Specifically, PMID 26972830 argues that GlcNAc is promoting branching, which in turn affects metabolite uptake in the liver and adipose tissue via branching enhancing surface retention of metabolite transporters. In contrast, we are assessing the effects of aerobic glycolysis/oxidative phosphorylation on branching and associated downstream phenotypes in T cells. We use GlcNAc salvage into the hexosamine pathway as a mechanism to by-pass metabolic effects of aerobic glycolysis on the de novo hexosamine pathway. Importantly, and in contrast to PMID 26972830, we show that neither GlcNAc or kifunensine acutely altered the metabolic state of the T cell (as measured by the oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). This was despite altering glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), as observed in PMID 26972830. Moreover, we have previously shown that lowering branching does not alter UDP-GlcNAc levels in T cells (Mkhikian et al. (2016) <italic>eLife</italic> 5 e14814) and therefore our experiments inhibiting Golgi branching activity should have no effect on O-GlcNAc or CMP-Sialic Acid production. Thus, our observation that T cell differentiation is changed by directly altering branching activity in the Golgi (e.g. kifunensine, Mgat1 KO, Mgat5 KO and inducible Mgat5 over-expression) demonstrates causality of branching on T<sub>H</sub>17 versus iTreg differentiation.</p><p>GlcNAc does raise UDP-GlcNAc levels, which in theory may impact O-GlcNAc or CMP-Sialic Acid in addition to branching. However, we show that the effects of GlcNAc on T cell differentiation are reversed by directly blocking Golgi branching activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), confirming that the effects of raised UDP-GlcNAc were predominantly through branching rather than other pathways. Most importantly, we show that blocking the effects of the metabolic modulators rapamycin, galactose or etoximer on branching reversed their effects on T cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>) despite not reversing effects on metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). In this manner, we fully decoupled T cell differentiation from the metabolic state of the cell by manipulating branching. Combined, this data demonstrates that metabolism induced changes in N-glycan branching are causal in regulating T cell differentiation. However, we acknowledge that this does not exclude metabolically driven changes in other pathways and indeed we state that the effects of glutaminolysis on branching only partially explain the phenotype (see last few sentences of Results section). A summary of the above arguments has been added to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>The authors have chosen to look at only one type of structure (N-glycan branching, as measured by PHA-L,) and never performed complete glycan composition from the cell surface, an overall measure of O-GlcNAc levels in cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, or any detailed glycomic analysis.</italic> </p><p>As noted above, we confirmed T<sub>H</sub>17 cytokine induced changes in N-glycan branching using flow cytometry with 3 additional lectins. Also, note that we have previously utilized mass spec and HPEAC to validate changes in N-glycans observed with lectins.</p><p>Our first fundamental observation was that T<sub>H</sub>17 cytokines markedly reduced branching in T cells. We then demonstrated that directly altering Golgi branching enzyme activity markedly affected T<sub>H</sub>17 versus iTeg differentiation. Thus, the next logical step was to evaluate what the mechanism for altered branching during T cell differentiation. As T<sub>H</sub>17 cells are highly glycolytic while iTreg cells utilize lipid oxidation, we pursued the hypothesis that the changes in branching were metabolically driven. Our goal was not to broadly assess downstream effects of metabolism. As we go on to demonstrate a causal link between aerobic glycolysis/oxidative phosphorylation, branching and T cell differentiation (see discussion above), assessing other pathways is beyond the scope of this investigation.</p><p><italic>Mgat5 is claimed to be responsible for the synthesis of glycan branch recognized by PHA-L by the authors. The deletion of Mgat5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> has only a modest change in the induction of Tregs, yet these cells should be completely PHA-L negative. Compare this to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>. The small change in PHA-L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) is not convincingly associated with the large reported change in T cell phenotype in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, especially given the magnitudes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> where PHA-L staining should be gone. This suggests that something not measurable with PHA-L is at play and that PHA-L is a poor measure of outcome.</italic> </p><p>As the enzymes in the N-glycan branching pathway act linearly and with declining efficiency, production of β1,6 GlcNAc branched tri- and tetra-antennary N-glycans that L-PHA binds not only depends on Mgat5 activity but also on the activity of upstream enzymes (e.g. Mgat1, Mgat2, mannosidase I, mannosidase II). In this manner, L-PHA flow cytometry of wildtype cells is a quantitative measure of the overall output of the branching pathway, rather than simply a measure of Mgat5 activity. Thus, the small increase in L-PHA binding in 6A reflects not only increased β1,6 GlcNAc branching by Mgat5, but also increased branching by Mgat1 and Mgat2. Importantly, the relationship between L-PHA binding and overall branching is not true when examining genetically targeted cells deleted for branching enzymes. For example, L-PHA does not bind Mgat5<sup>-/-</sup> or Mgat1<sup>-/-</sup> T cells, yet the former only reduces galectin-3 binding ~50% while the latter eliminates all LacNAc ligands for galectins (Mkhikian et al. (2016) <italic>eLife</italic> 5 e14814 and Zhou et al. (2014) Nature Immunology). Thus, Mgat1 deletion is a much more severe disruption of the galectin – glycoprotein lattice than Mgat5 deletion even though both lack L-PHA binding. This explains why phenotypic changes are more severe in the Mgat1 versus Mgat5 KO cells (e.g. compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> to 4B).</p><p>Also, note that we state that the effects of glutaminolysis on branching only partially explain the phenotypic effects of glutaminolysis (see last few sentences of Results section).</p><p> <italic>mTOR is O-GlcNAcylated (PMID 20410138). Altering the balance of UDP-GlcNAc through various means in a cell, including the use of kifunensine, could easily alter the function of mTOR. The authors do not explore this possibility.</italic> </p><p>As noted above, total cellular UDP-GlcNAc levels are not altered by kifunensine or deletion of branching enzymes in T cells (Mkhikian et al. (2016) <italic>eLife</italic> 5 e14814). Moreover, mTOR drives glycolysis (via HIF1) yet neither kifunensine or GlcNAc significantly altered the glycolytic state of the T cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Thus, there is little reason to expect that the manipulations of branching will affect O-GlcNAcylation of mTOR. In contrast, we do show that mTOR has profound effects on branching, as rapamycin markedly enhanced L-PHA binding in T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p><italic>Several comments about changes in receptor function resulting from N-linked glycan branching should be addressed:</italic> </p><p><italic>IL-2 is required for Treg survival, thus the conclusion reached by the authors that IL-2 &quot;is required for branching to promote iTreg over T<sub>H</sub>17 differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>)&quot; is not directly supported by the data. Without IL-2, Tregs die, with or without highly branched glycans.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this point. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> only showed a ratio of T<sub>H</sub>17 to iTreg, where the results could have been explained by only a change in Treg death from blockade of IL-2. We have now separated the data to demonstrate that anti-IL-2 antibody enhanced production of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells while also reducing the number of iTreg’s despite treatment with GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Moreover, we showed that addition of exogenous IL-2 enhanced iTreg and inhibited T<sub>H</sub>17 in the presence but not absence of branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>), consistent with branching regulating a change in cell fate rather than simply death of iTreg via IL-2 signaling.</p><p><italic>The authors conclude that branching drives CD25 surface retention, but they only measure CD25 surface concentration. There is no direct data showing anything about surface retention. It is possible that the expression is merely lower.

It is possible that it never even reaches the cell surface.</italic></p><p>Using an “acid wash” endocytosis assay that we have used previously, we have added new data indicating that CD25 surface retention is reduced by loss of branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p><italic>For readers not familiar with the Warburg effect and aerobic glycolysis, it would be helpful to mention that glycolysis is the conditional norm of anaerobic metabolism, and that the discovery by Warburg was that cancer cells constitutively use glycolysis even in aerobic conditions (e.g. aerobic glycolysis).</italic> </p><p>We have added this point to the Introduction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
