autoimmune disease relies on tolerization of thymocytes to self-antigens whose expression and presentation by thymic medullary epithelial cells (mTECs) is controlled predominantly by Aire at the transcriptional level and possibly regulated at other unrecognized levels. Aire-sensitive gene expression is influenced by several molecular factors, some of which belong to the 3’end processing complex, suggesting they might impact transcript stability and levels through an effect on 3’UTR shortening. We discovered that Aire-sensitive genes display a pronounced preference for short-3’UTR transcript isoforms in mTECs, a feature preceding Aire’s expression and correlated with the preferential selection of proximal polyA sites by the 3’end processing complex. Through an RNAi screen and generation of a lentigenic mouse, we found that one factor, Clp1, promotes 3’UTR shortening associated with higher transcript stability and expression of Aire-sensitive genes, revealing a post-transcriptional level of control of Aire-activated expression in mTECs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>self-antigens</kwd><kwd>immunological tolerance</kwd><kwd>Aire</kwd><kwd>3'UTR shortening</kwd><kwd>mTEC</kwd><kwd>thymus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research grant 2011-CHEX-001-R12004KK</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giraud</surname><given-names>Matthieu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Integration Grant PCIG9-GA-2011-294212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giraud</surname><given-names>Matthieu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investissements d'Avenir ANR-10-INBS-09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coulpier</surname><given-names>Fanny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investissements d'Avenir ANR-11-INBS-0013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blanchet</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship FDT20150532551</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guyon</surname><given-names>Clotilde</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bioinformatics engineer grant ING20121226316</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yen-Chin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Aire-dependent genes show a preference for short 3’UTR transcript isoforms resulting in the escape from the post-transcriptional repression mediated by miRNAs in medullary thymic epithelial cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Immunological tolerance is a key feature of the immune system that protects against autoimmune disease by preventing immune reactions against self-constituents. Central tolerance is shaped in the thymus and relies on a unique property of a subset of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). This subset is composed of mTEChi that express high levels of MHC class II molecules and a huge diversity of self-antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Danan-Gotthold et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyewski and Klein, 2006</xref>). Thus, developing T lymphocytes in the thymus are exposed to a broad spectrum of self-antigens displayed by mTEChi. Those lymphocytes that recognize their cognate antigens undergo either negative selection, thereby preventing the escape of potentially harmful autoreactive lymphocytes out of the thymus, or differentiate into thymic regulatory T cells beneficial for limiting autoreactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cowan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodnow et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2014</xref>). Self-antigens expressed by mTEChi include a large number of tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs), so-named because they are normally restricted to one or a few peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Derbinski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sansom et al., 2014</xref>). A large fraction of these TRAs in mTEChi are induced by a single transcriptional activator that is expressed almost exclusively in these cells - the autoimmune regulator Aire. Mice deficient for the <italic>Aire</italic> gene exhibit impaired TRA expression in mTEChi, whereas TRA expression remains normal in peripheral tissues of these mice. Consistent with inadequate development of central tolerance, <italic>Aire</italic> knockout (KO) mice develop autoantibodies directed at some of these TRAs, resulting in immune infiltrates in multiple tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>). Correspondingly, loss-of-function mutations in the human <italic>AIRE</italic> gene result in a multi-organ autoimmune disorder known as autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nagamine et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peterson et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>How the expression of thousands of Aire-sensitive self-antigen genes is controlled in mTEChi has been a subject of extensive investigation. Significant progress has been made, notably through the identification of a number of molecular factors that further activate the expression of prototypic Aire-sensitive genes in a model employing cell lines that express Aire ectopically by transfection with a constitutive <italic>Aire</italic> expression vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abramson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giraud et al., 2014</xref>). These studies revealed a role for relaxation of chromatin in front of the elongating RNA polymerase (RNAP) II by the PRKDC-PARP1-SUPT16H complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abramson et al., 2010</xref>) and for an HNRNPL-associated release of the stalled RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giraud et al., 2014</xref>). However, the effect of most of the identified factors on the full set of Aire-sensitive genes in mTEChi is unknown. It remains also uncertain whether these factors partake in a molecular mechanism directly orchestrated by Aire or in a basal transcriptional machinery that would control the expression of Aire-sensitive genes even before Aire is expressed in mTEChi. Lack of knowledge of the precise modus operandi of the identified factors potentially leaves major aspects of promiscuous mTEChi gene expression unknown.</p><p>Among the identified factors, seven of them, namely CLP1, DDX5, DDX17, PABPC1, PRKDC, SUPT16H and PARP1, have been reported to belong to the large multi-subunit 3’ end processing complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vries et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shi et al., 2009</xref>) which controls pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation at polyA sites (pAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colgan and Manley, 1997</xref>). Hence, we asked whether any of these identified factors could influence Aire-sensitive gene expression partially or entirely by the way of an effect on pre-mRNA 3’ end maturation. Deep sequencing approaches have revealed that the vast majority of protein-coding genes in mammal genomes (70–79%) have multiple pAs mostly located in 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoque et al., 2013</xref>). These genes are subject to differential pA usage through alternative cleavage and polyadenylation directed by the 3’ end processing complex and are transcribed as isoforms with longer or shorter 3’UTRs depending on the pA usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tian and Manley, 2013</xref>). The 3’ end processing complex is composed of a core effector sub-complex comprising CLP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vries et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mandel et al., 2008</xref>) and a number of accessory proteins that include DDX5, DDX17, PABPC1, PRKDC, SUPT16H and PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shi et al., 2009</xref>). Although the individual roles of accessory proteins on differential pA usage remain largely unknown, the core protein Clp1 has been reported to favor proximal pA selection in yeast based on depletion experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holbein et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, increasing levels of Clp1 bound to the 3’ end processing complex was also shown to favor proximal pA selection and shorter 3’UTR isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, a preference for distal pA selection was reported for higher Clp1 levels in a mouse myoblast cell line based on siRNA Clp1 loss-of-function experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Given the observations from prior work that many of the genes, other than Aire itself, that modulate the expression of Aire-induced genes, are members of the 3’ end processing complex, and that one such member of this complex, Clp1, has been reported to affect pA selection, we speculated that 3’UTR length and regulation might be involved in expression of TRAs in mTEChi. We therefore set out to investigate relationships between Aire sensitivity, 3’ end processing, and pA selection in mTEChi.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Aire-sensitive genes show a preference for short-3’UTR transcript isoforms in mTEChi</title><p>To assess the proportion of long and short-3’UTR transcript isoforms in mTEChi, we selected the genes that harbor potential proximal alternative pAs in their annotated 3’UTRs according to the PolyA_DB 2 database which reports pAs identified from comparisons of cDNAs and ESTs from a very large panel of peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). For each gene, the relative expression of the long 3’UTR isoform versus all isoforms could be defined as the distal 3’UTR (d3’UTR) ratio, that is the expression of the region downstream of the proximal pA (d3’UTR) normalized to the upstream region in the last exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine whether the Aire-sensitive genes exhibit a biased proportion of long and short-3’UTR isoforms in mTEChi, we first performed RNA deep-sequencing (RNA-seq) of mTEChi sorted from WT and <italic>Aire</italic>-KO mice in order to identify the Aire-sensitive genes, that is those upregulated by Aire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). We then compared the distribution of d3’UTR ratios in Aire-sensitive versus Aire-neutral genes in WT mTEChi. We found a significant shift towards smaller ratios, revealing a preference of Aire-sensitive genes for short-3’UTR isoforms in mTEChi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata4">4</xref>). The Aire-sensitive genes are expressed at much lower levels than the Aire-neutral genes. Hence, we sought to distinguish whether the observed smaller d3’UTR ratios were specifically associated with Aire-sensitive genes or not simply a co-correlate of low expression. We examined the d3’UTR ratios across expression levels of both Aire-sensitive and neutral genes. While the d3’UTR ratios vary dramatically across genes, at all expression levels, the loess-fitted curve of the Aire-sensitive genes is significantly lower than the one of the Aire-neutral genes, therefore revealing a preference of Aire-sensitive genes for smaller d3’UTR ratios in mTEChi that is independent of the levels of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Since a much larger proportion of Aire-sensitive genes than Aire-neutral genes are known to be TRA genes, we further asked whether the preference of genes for short-3’UTRs was more aligned with Aire-sensitivity or being a TRA gene. To this end, we compared the d3’UTR ratios between the TRA and non-TRA genes as defined in reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sansom et al., 2014</xref>) in the subsets of Aire-sensitive and neutral genes. In these mTEChi, the short-3’UTR isoform preference was observed preferentially in Aire-sensitive genes regardless of whether or not they were TRA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Preference of Aire-sensitive genes for short-3’UTR transcript isoforms in mTEChi.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of pA usage and 3’UTR isoform expression. 3’ ends of RNA isoforms of a hypothetical gene are shown.

We note that by definition these genes are all expressed at lower levels in the absence of Aire but that most are still expressed at levels sufficient to determine 3’UTR isoform ratios. We observed a preference for the smaller ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata4">4</xref>) in Aire-sensitive versus neutral genes in the <italic>Aire</italic>-KO cells. For these KO mTEChi, we once again examined the d3’UTR ratios across all expression levels of both Aire-sensitive and neutral genes and again, like in WT mTEChi, found that the preference of Aire-sensitive genes for smaller d3’UTR ratios was independent of the levels of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We further noted that the majority (~90%) of Aire-sensitive genes that exhibited small d3’UTR ratios (&lt;0.25) in WT mTEChi were also characterized by small d3’UTR ratios in <italic>Aire</italic>-KO mTEChi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), Together, these observations showed that the short-3’UTR isoform preference of Aire-sensitive genes in mTEChi was specific to those genes responsive to Aire, whether or not Aire was actually present.</p><p>To determine whether the genes sensitive to Aire exhibit shorter 3’UTR isoforms in mTEChi than in their normal tissue of expression, we set out to identify the Aire-sensitive genes showing tissue-specific or selective expression and to calculate the d3’UTR ratios of the identified Aire-sensitive TRA genes in their tissue(s) of expression. To this end, we collected RNA-seq datasets corresponding to a variety of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van den Berghe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Warren et al., 2013</xref>) and selected in each tissue the set of Aire-sensitive genes for which we identified a restricted expression in comparison to the other tissues by applying the SPM (Specificity Measurement) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). We then calculated the d3’UTR ratios of these genes in each peripheral tissue and found variable d3’UTR ratios across tissues with the mTEChi result falling in the low end of this range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Taking the Aire-sensitive TRA genes individually, we compared their d3’UTR ratios in mTEChi versus their respective tissue of expression and found a dramatic bias towards higher ratios in peripheral tissues, confirming the preference of Aire-sensitive TRA genes for short-3’UTR transcript isoforms in mTEChi, as compared to the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In addition, we confirmed that small d3'UTR ratios of Aire-sensitive genes in mTEChi were not correlated with the sequencing depth of the mTEChi RNA-seq libraries nor with the length of the generated reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These findings show that the Aire-sensitive TRA genes exhibit an increased proportion of short-3’UTR transcript isoforms in mTEChi versus a majority of peripheral tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The 3’ end processing complex is preferentially located at proximal pAs of Aire-sensitive genes in AIRE-negative HEK293 cells</title><p>We sought to determine whether the preference for short-3’UTR isoforms of Aire-sensitive genes observed in <italic>Aire</italic>-KO mTEChi and conserved upon upregulation by Aire, is associated with a preferred proximal pA usage driven by the 3’ end processing complex. Current techniques dedicated to localize RNA-binding proteins on pre-mRNAs, for example ultraviolet crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP)-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">König et al., 2012</xref>), need several millions of cells, precluding their use with primary <italic>Aire</italic>-KO or WT mTEChi for which only ~30,000 cells can be isolated per mouse. To circumvent this issue, we used the HEK293 cell line for these experiments. HEK293 cells are (i) negative for AIRE expression, (ii) responsive to the transactivation activity of transfected Aire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abramson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giraud et al., 2012</xref>), and (iii) have been profiled for the RNA binding of the 3’ end processing components by Martin et al. by PAR-CLIP experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly to what we found in WT and <italic>Aire</italic>-KO mTEChi, we observed in <italic>Aire</italic>-transfected and Ctr-transfected HEK293 cells significant lower d3’UTR ratios for genes identified by <italic>Aire</italic> transfection to be Aire-sensitive versus Aire-neutral genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). It should be noted that many Aire-neutral genes featured moderately lower d3’UTR ratios in <italic>Aire</italic>-transfected HEK293 cells than Ctr-transfected cells, as a possible effect of Aire itself on an overall 3’UTR shortening in these cells, but this did not produce the large proportion of very small d3’UTR ratios (&lt;0.2) that were exhibited by the Aire-sensitive genes in <italic>Aire</italic> or Ctr-transfected HEK293 cells. Within HEK293 cells, localization of the 3’end processing complex at proximal or distal pAs was performed by analyzing the binding pattern of CSTF2, the member of the core 3’ end processing complex that has been reported to exhibit the highest binding affinity for the maturing transcripts at their cleavage sites close to pAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin et al., 2012</xref>). We first validated for Aire-neutral genes that lower d3’UTR ratios correlated with the preferential location of the 3’ end processing complex at proximal pAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Then we compared the location of the complex between the Aire-sensitive and neutral genes, and found a dramatic preference for proximal pAs versus distal pAs at Aire-sensitive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), showing that the 3’ end processing complex was already in place at proximal pAs of Aire-sensitive genes before Aire expression was enforced in HEK293 cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Increased binding of the 3’end processing complex at proximal pAs of Aire-sensitive genes in HEK293 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Densities in Ctr-transfected HEK293 cells (AIRE-) (<italic>Top</italic>) and <italic>Aire</italic>-transfected HEK293 cells (<italic>Bottom</italic>) of d3’UTR ratios from RNA-seq data of Aire-sensitive and neutral genes identified after <italic>Aire</italic> transfection; equal numbers of neutral genes included (n = 227 and n = 388, respectively), asinh scale.

Among the members of the core and accessory subunits of the 3’ end processing complex, the cleavage factor CLP1 (core) and also DDX5, DDX17, PABPC1, PRKDC, SUPT16H and PARP1 (accessory) have been reported to control Aire-sensitive gene expression in an Aire-positive context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giraud et al., 2014</xref>) with the possibility that the effect of some of these factors could result from their action on the basal expression of Aire-sensitive genes and therefore be observed in the absence of Aire. In addition to these candidate factors, we also tested the effect of HNRNPL, which although not part of the 3’ end processing complex, has been shown to regulate 3’ end processing of some human pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Millevoi and Vagner, 2010</xref>) and control Aire transactivation function in mTEChi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giraud et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>First, to determine whether any of the candidate factors could be involved in 3’UTR shortening per se, we carried out short hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated interference in AIRE-negative HEK293 cells and generated expression profiles using Affymetrix HuGene ST1.0 microarrays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). These arrays typically include one or two short probes per exon, and for approximatively 35% of all genes with potential proximal pAs they also include at least two short probes in the d3’UTR region. In spite of the limited d3’UTR coverage and lower accuracy of hybridization measurements based on two short probes only, we found these arrays adequate to detect 3’UTR length variation at the genome-scale level. For each gene with a microarray-detectable d3'UTR region, the d3’UTR isoform ratio was calculated by dividing the measured d3’UTR expression by the whole-transcript expression based on all short probes mapping to the transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">2</xref>). Comparison of the percentages of genes exhibiting a significant increase or decrease of the d3’UTR ratios upon knockdown of a candidate gene versus the control LacZ gene, was used to evaluate the specific impact of the candidate on 3’UTR isoform expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). For each candidate gene, we measured the knockdown efficiency of, typically, five different shRNAs and selected the three most effective (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). With a threshold of at least two shRNAs per gene producing a significant excess of genes with increased d3’UTR ratios, we found that CLP1, DDX5, DDX17, PARP1 and HNRNPL contributed to 3’UTR shortening in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The absence of effect of PRKDC, SUPT16H and PABPC1 could indicate that these factors do not contribute to the activity of 3' end processing sub-complexes or that other factors, perhaps with redundant function, can compensate for their loss. As a control, we also performed knockdown of CPSF6, a core member of the 3’ end processing complex, that has been consistently reported to promote general 3’UTR lengthening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin et al., 2012</xref>).

The effect of <italic>CLP1</italic> knockdown on Aire-sensitive genes lacking annotated proximal pAs was much less than for the genes with proximal pAs, but a smaller effect on the annotated single-pA genes was observed for one of two CLP1 shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This might simply be because some genes tagged as “proximal pA-“ in the incomplete PolyA_DB 2 database possessed undiscovered proximal pAs in mTEChi and were therefore responsive to the action of CLP1. Our findings regarding the differential response of pA+ and pA- genes to CLP1 loss-of-function suggested that the effect of CLP1 on Aire-sensitive gene expression in HEK293 cells was dependent on the potential of Aire-sensitive genes to switch from using a distal to a proximal pA site.</p><p>To assess the effect of CLP1 on 3’UTR shortening at Aire-sensitive genes, we performed RNA-seq experiments in Ctr and <italic>CLP1</italic> knockdown HEK293 cells.

The d3’UTR ratios of Aire-sensitive genes after <italic>CLP1</italic> knockdown did not reach those of Aire-neutral genes which could simply be due to remaining <italic>CLP1</italic> in these cells following knockdown (measured knockdown as 75% and 72% for shRNA 2 and 3, respectively) or could indicate that additional non-CLP1-dependent factors also contribute to the difference in d3’UTR ratios of Aire-sensitive versus Aire-neutral genes. In contrast to Aire-sensitive genes, only small, statistically insignificant increases of d3’UTR ratios of Aire-neutral genes could be detected in <italic>CLP1</italic> knockdown HEK293 cells, indicating that the effect of CLP1 on 3’UTR shortening preferentially affects the Aire-sensitive genes in mTEChi. The preferential 3’UTR shortening effect of CLP1 at Aire-sensitive genes was further supported by the observation of an enhanced proportion of genes subject to CLP1-mediated 3'UTR shortening among the Aire-sensitive versus neutral genes in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The link between Clp1-mediated 3'UTR shortening and increased expression at Aire-sensitive genes is strengthened by the observation that the Aire-sensitive genes that undergo a higher than 2-fold d3’UTR ratio decrease in Ctr versus <italic>Clp1</italic> knockdown lentigenic mTEChi, exhibit higher expression values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

We also found that the expression of the genes without proximal pAs was globally reduced in comparison to the genes with proximal pAs, supporting a linked mechanism between proximal pA usage and increased gene expression in mTEChi. Altogether these results showed that Clp1 promotes 3’UTR shortening of the transcripts upregulated by Aire in mTEChi and strongly suggested that it enhances their level of expression through proximal pA usage.</p><p>A role for Clp1 in mTEChi was further supported by its higher expression in mTEChi in comparison to a wide variety of tissues for which we collected RNA-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van den Berghe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Warren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). As a comparison, none of the other candidate factors, Hnrnpl, Ddx5, Ddx17 and Paprp1 that contributed to 3’UTR shortening in HEK293 cells, were over-represented in mTEChi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Importantly, we also validated higher expression of Clp1 at the protein level in mTEChi versus their precursor cells, mTEClo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gäbler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamazaki et al., 2007</xref>), cells from the whole thymus, and also the predominant thymus CD45+ leukocyte fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). In addition, a role for Clp1 independent of Aire’s action on genes expression was supported by the observed similar levels of <italic>Clp1</italic> expression in WT and <italic>Aire</italic>-KO mTEChi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6A</xref>) and the lack of evidence for Aire and CLP1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6B</xref>). Finally, we found a significant correlation between higher <italic>Clp1</italic> expression and lower d3’UTR ratios across peripheral tissues for the Aire-sensitive TRA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <italic>Top</italic>). In contrast, no such significant correlation was observed for Aire-neutral genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <italic>Bottom</italic>).

We used Actinomycin D (ActD) to inhibit new transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sobell, 1985</xref>) and assessed the differences in transcript profiles between treated and untreated mTEChi. We harvested the cells at several timepoints for expression profiling by RNA-seq. Each RNA-seq dataset was normalized to total read counts and we calculated the expression fold-change of each gene in treated versus control samples, therefore reflecting differences in transcript levels in the absence of ongoing transcription. We selected among the Aire-sensitive genes two subsets: (i) those that underwent a higher than 2-fold d3’UTR ratio decrease in Ctr versus <italic>Clp1</italic> knockdown lentigenic mTEChi and, (ii) genes with steady d3’UTR ratios (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

We assessed the level of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional repression in mTEChi versus mTEClo precursor cells by assessing the differences in expression of sets of genes identified as potentially targeted by miRNAs, in mTEChi versus mTEClo. To this end, we performed a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) between the two mTEC populations for each set of genes potentially targeted by a specific miRNA or miRNA family (as defined by the TargetScan database, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

In sharp contrast, we did not detect any of the miRNA-specific target gene sets that had reduced expression in mTEClo versus mTEChi. This suggests that miRNAs are an important contributor to transcript destabilization in mTEChi and that this effect is similar or less for the same miRNA target sets in mTEClo cells. To determine whether the Clp1-promoted 3'UTR shortening at Aire-sensitive genes can lead to escape from post-transcriptional repression mediated by the miRNAs associated with these 346 target-gene sets, we calculated, among the Aire-sensitive genes subject to Clp1-promoted shortening, the proportion of those that are potentially targeted by one of these miRNAs at a conserved site in the d3’UTR of their longer-transcript isoforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). We found a large proportion of these cases (46%) had one or more such conserved miRNA target sites, providing a specific miRNA de-repression mechanism due to 3’UTR shortening for a large fraction of the Aire-sensitive genes. This analysis is only able to identify miRNAs that are highly conserved and that have disproportionate effect in mTEChi versus mTEClo, so it is expected to miss many of the cases of potential miRNA regulation that may be relieved by 3’UTR shortening in mTEChi.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Aire-sensitive genes upregulated by Aire in mTEChi have been shown to be controlled also by a number of Aire’s allies or partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abramson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giraud et al., 2014</xref>).

We found that this 3’UTR shortening was driven by Clp1 in mTEChi but also in Aire-non-expressing HEK293 cells, in which the level of Aire-sensitive gene expression is weak but still detectable by RNA-seq, thus showing that the effect of Clp1 on Aire-sensitive genes was not restricted to mTEChi nor dependent on Aire’s action. Although Clp1 is a main contributor to this described process, additional factors might also be involved.</p><p>Clp1 is a ubiquitous protein showing higher expression in mTEChi than in mTEClo, CD45<sup>+</sup> thymic cells or thymic cells taken as a whole, but also showing higher gene expression in comparison with a large range of peripheral tissue cells.

Notably, we showed that higher levels of <italic>Clp1</italic> expression were correlated with higher proportions of short-3’UTR transcript isoforms of tissue-restricted Aire-sensitive genes across peripheral tissues, suggesting the existence of a Clp1-promoted 3’UTR shortening mechanism occurring in a variety of cell types and, among those cell types we surveyed, most pronounced in mTEChi.</p><p>The observation that the levels of <italic>Clp1</italic> expression and the distributions of the short-3’UTR transcript isoforms of Aire-sensitive genes were similar between <italic>Aire</italic>-KO and WT mTEChi, strongly suggests that the Clp1-driven 3’UTR shortening mechanism is already in place in mTEChi before Aire is activated. The independence of Aire’s action on gene expression and the effect of Clp1 on 3’UTR shortening is also consistent with the lack of direct interaction found between Aire and Clp1. Although these effects of Aire and Clp1 appear decoupled, it is also apparent as noted that sensitivity to these Aire and Clp1 effects have a higher-rate of co-occurrence in the same set of genes. Although we could detect and characterize the effect of Clp1 on the Aire-sensitive genes in mTEChi using annotated pAs from the PolyA_DB 2 database which mainly contains pAs identified from comparisons across peripheral tissues, the precise proportion of Aire-sensitive genes that are subject to differential pA usage and Clp1-driven shortening in mTEChi remains to be precisely defined. Current methods to capture mTEChi-specific pAs using next generation sequencing methods require very large numbers of cells relative to the number of mTEChi (~30,000) that can be isolated per mouse but emerging methods for accurate pA identification with lower input requirements could make this feasible from such low material quantity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Clp1 is a member of the core 3’ end processing complex that we showed to be preferentially located at proximal pAs of Aire-sensitive genes in HEK293 cells, indicating that the effect of Clp1 on 3’UTR shortening could result from enhanced recruitment of the 3’ end processing complex to proximal pAs. Similar modes of action, involving members of the core 3’ end processing complex and resulting in transcripts with either shorter or longer 3’UTRs have been described for Clp1 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>) and Cpsf6 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gruber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin et al., 2012</xref>), respectively. However, the basis for the preferential effect of Clp1 on the Aire-sensitive genes remains unknown, but note that it does appear to be conserved across cell types. One possibility is that the regulatory elements and associated basal transcriptional machinery at Aire-sensitive genes share conserved features that favor recruitment of Clp1.</p><p>3’UTRs have been described as potent sensors of the post-transcriptional repression mediated by miRNAs, resulting in mRNA destabilization and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2015</xref>). In addition to miRNAs, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) also contribute the regulation of transcript stability depending on the type of cis regulatory elements that they recognize on 3’UTRs, triggering either repression or activation signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spies et al., 2013</xref>). In mTEChi, we found increased stability of the Aire-sensitive transcripts that were subject to Clp1-promoted 3’UTR shortening. Thus, our findings supported an escape from the post-transcriptional repression of short-3’UTR transcripts in mTEChi, leading to enhanced stability and accumulation of these transcripts. Similar observations, resulting in increased transcript levels and higher protein translation, have notably been documented for genes subject to 3’UTR shortening whose long-3’UTR transcript isoforms were targeted by particular miRNAs or classes of RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Shyu, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Masamha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mayr and Bartel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vlasova et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The finding that the transcripts controlled by Aire and subjected to Clp1-promoted 3’UTR shortening in mTEChi escape the miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional repression that proves to be stronger in mTEChi than in mTEClo, is consistent with recent reports showing that maturation-dependent expression of miRNAs correlates with the expression of Aire in mTEChi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ucar et al., 2013</xref>) and that Aire is able to control the expression of miRNAs in a murine mTEC line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Macedo et al., 2015</xref>) or in mTEChi in vivo through the comparison of WT and Aire null mutant thymi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ucar et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, it has also been reported that, in contrast to Aire-independent TRA transcripts, some classical Aire-dependent TRAs exhibit profound refractoriness in reconstructed networking interactions with miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Macedo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oliveira et al., 2016</xref>). An alteration in 3’UTRs of Aire-dependent TRA transcripts has been proposed to explain this observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Passos et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this proposal, our study provides evidence that Aire-sensitive genes undergo 3’UTR shortening resulting in the escape of the generated shortened transcripts from the miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional repression in mTEChi.</p><p>In addition to impacting transcript stability through the escape of the post-transcriptional repression, short 3’UTRs have also been shown to shift the surface localization of membrane proteins and the functional cell compartment of other types of proteins, in favor of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berkovits and Mayr, 2015</xref>). Thus, one interesting hypothesis for future study is that Clp1-driven 3’UTR shortening at Aire-sensitive genes in mTEChi might not only impact the expression of Aire-dependent self-antigens but also favor their routing to the ER, from where they will be processed and presented, potentially enhancing their presentation to self-reactive T lymphocytes and, subsequently, central tolerance and protection against autoimmune manifestations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus-musculus</italic>)</td><td>B6.129S2-Aire<sup>tm1.1Doi</sup>/J</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2002</xref></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:004743?nodirect=true">IMSR_JAX:004743</ext-link></td><td>Provided by D.

The raw read sequences were obtained from the GEO database: GSE36026 for bone marrow, bone marrow derived macrophage (BMDM), brown adipocytes tissue (BAT), cerebellum, cortex, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, olfactory, placenta, spleen, testes, mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF), mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), E14.5 brain, E14.5 heart, E14.5 limb and E14.5 liver; GSM871703 for E14.5 telencephalon; GSM879225 for ventral tegmental area VTA. Reads of the VTA dataset, over 50 bp in length, were trimmed for homogeneous comparison with our RNA-seq data. We processed each collected dataset for gene expression profiling and d3’UTR ratio computing as above. To avoid center-to-center biases, we removed from the sequence assemblies the duplicate reads that could arise from PCR amplification errors during library construction. For multi-sample comparison analysis, our mTEChi datasets were also subjected to removal of duplicate reads.</p><p>Next, the tissue-specificity (one tissue of restricted expression) or selectivity (two-to-four tissues of restricted expression) of the Aire-sensitive genes was characterized by using the specificity measurement (SPM) and the contribution measurement (CTM) methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). For each gene, the SPM and the CTM values were dependent on its level of expression in each tissue. If no read was detected in a tissue, the latter was excluded from the comparison. For tissues of similar type, only the one showing the highest level of gene expression was included in the comparison. Cerebellum, cortex, E14.5 brain, E14.5 telencephalon and VTA referred to a group, as well as did E14.5 heart and heart, or E14.5 liver and liver. If the SPM value of a gene for a tissue is &gt;0.9, then the gene is considered tissue-specific for this particular tissue. Otherwise, if the SPM values of a gene for two to four tissues were &gt;0.3 and its CTM value for the corresponding tissues was &gt;0.9, then the gene was considered tissue-selective for these tissues. If these conditions were not met, the gene was left unassigned.</p><p>Finally, for the analysis of 3’UTR length variation of Aire-sensitive PTA genes between mTEChi and their tissues of expression, peripheral d3’UTR ratios of tissue-specific genes were selected in their unique identified tissues of expression. For tissue-selective genes, the d3’UTR ratios for peripheral tissues were selected randomly among their tagged tissues of expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>CLIP-seq analysis</title><p>The location of the 3’ end processing complex on the transcripts of Aire target genes was tracked by measuring the density of reads that map to these transcripts in PAR-CLIP sequencing data of RNAs bound to the endogenous CSTF2 from the GEO database (GSM917676). We processed these assemblies of RNA-mapped reads (as wig files) using the sitepro program (CEAS distribution) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shin et al., 2009</xref>) to infer the read density at the vicinity of proximal and distal pAs of transcripts of Aire target genes in HEK293 cells. The genomic location of these proximal and distal pAs extracted from the PolyA_DB 2 database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) was loaded into sitepro as bed files of Aire-sensitive and neutral genes identified from RNA-seq differential expression of <italic>Aire</italic> versus control-transfected HEK293 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Microarray gene expression profiling</title><p>Total RNA was prepared from harvested HEK293 cells knockdown for <italic>CLP1</italic>, <italic>HNRNPL</italic>, <italic>DDX5</italic>, <italic>DDX17</italic>, <italic>PARP1</italic>, <italic>PRKDC, SUPT16H</italic>, <italic>PABPC1</italic>, <italic>CPSF6</italic> and the control LacZ gene using TRIzol (ThermoFisher). Single-stranded DNA in the sense orientation was synthesized from total RNA with random priming using the GeneChip WT Amplification kit (Affymetrix). The DNA was subsequently purified, fragmented, and terminally labeled using the GeneChip WT Terminal Labeling kit (Affymetrix) incorporating biotinylated ribonucleotides into the DNA. The labeled DNA was then hybridized to Human Gene ST1.0 microarrays (Affymetrix), washed, stained, and scanned. Raw probe-level data (.CEL files deposited in the GEO database as GSE141118) was normalized by the robust multiarray average (RMA) algorithm and summarized using the R-package aroma.affymetrix (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aroma-project.org/">www.aroma-project.org/</ext-link>) to obtain probeset expression values corresponding to the genes on the array, as described in (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Individual probe-level microarray analyses</title><p>For each HEK293 sample of a microarray comparison, an expression file of individual probes of each gene on the array was generated using aroma.affymetrix, as described in (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Probes with expression values over the background in each sample, had their hg19 genomic location retrieved from the Affymetrix individual probe dataset (NetAffx Web site), and were mapped to the d3’UTR annotation file generated as described in the ‘RNA-seq and d3’UTR ratios’ section. The d3’UTRs ratios were then computed for the genes having at least two individual probes in their d3’UTR regions by dividing the specific d3’UTR expression by the whole-transcript expression. We performed the individual probe d3’UTR mapping and d3’UTR ratio calculation using an adaptation of our R-implementation of PLATA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giraud et al., 2012</xref>), as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>. We then tested between two HEK293 samples the proportion of genes with a significant increase or decrease of d3’UTR ratios to the proportion of those whose variation is not significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>miRNA potential target gene identification</title><p>We used the TargetScan 6.2 database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.targetscan.org/vert_61/">http://www.targetscan.org/vert_61/</ext-link>) to generate a list of miRNAs or miRNA families and their potential target genes harboring miRNA conserved sites in 3'UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>). We further selected from these potential target genes those for which the miRNA conserved sites are specifically located within the cleavable d3’UTRs.

The overlap between the transcripts impacted by Aire in HEK293 cells and those impacted by the knockdown of <italic>CLP1</italic>, <italic>HNRNPL</italic>, <italic>DDX5</italic>, <italic>DDX17</italic>, <italic>PARP1</italic> was tested by the GSEA software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) (Broad Institute). The Aire-sensitive genes were identified from RNA-seq data of control and <italic>Aire</italic>-transfected HEK293 cells. For this analysis, the top 30% of genes the most sensitive to Aire were considered.</p><p>GSEA was also used to test the potential involvement of miRNAs or miRNA families in the regulation of sets of genes in mTEChi versus mTEClo. To this end, we performed RNA-seq profiling of mTEChi and mTEClo that were isolated from the same pool of 4 thymi of B6 mice. We ran GSEA on the DESeq-normalized read counts of the mTEChi versus mTEClo comparison using the list of miRNAs and of their potential target genes harboring miRNA conserved sites in 3'UTRs as generated through parsing the TargetScan 6.2 database (above). A ‘classic’ scoring scheme was used for the GSEA analysis. Gene sets of 15 to 5000 genes were considered for the analysis. Null read count values were removed. To determine the genes that contribute the most to the observed miRNA-specific gene set reduction in mTEChi, we performed a leading edge analysis in including all miRNA-specific gene sets with FDR q-values &lt;0.05 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). We found that these leading edge genes were potentially targeted by a number of different miRNAs, whose median was 4. We selected for representation the leading edge genes targeted by more than four different miRNAs (&gt;=5).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Determination of the statistical significance differences between two experimental groups was done by the non-parametric Wilcoxon test, unless specified. Since P-values are sensitive to sample size and tend to decrease as n increases, for each comparison, we matched the size of the control sample (when larger than the test sample) to the one of the test sample. For instance, for the Aire-sensitive versus neutral gene comparisons, we selected a number of Aire-neutral genes with the closest-to-1 expression foldchange, that matches the size of the tested Aire-sensitive sample.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr Sheena Pinto for her useful comments and suggestions, that have helped improve this paper.

medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) express a wide range of otherwise tissue restricted genes. This process is required to ensure that only a self-tolerant T cell repertoire leaves the thymus to populate the peripheral immune system, and is largely regulated by the Autoimmune Regulator, AIRE. The authors find that AIRE-sensitive genes preferentially exhibit short-3'UTR transcript isoforms in mTECs. They then demonstrate that CLP1, part of the large multi-subunit 3' end processing complex, promotes 3'UTR shortening associated with higher transcript stability and expression of AIRE-sensitive genes, revealing a previously uncovered post-transcriptional level of control of AIRE activated expression in mTECs.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Aire-dependent genes undergo Clp1-mediated 3'UTR shortening associated with higher transcript stability in the thymus&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers found this manuscript interesting and felt that it has potential to be a significant contribution to the field. However, they identified a number of substantive points that must be satisfactorily addressed before the manuscript can be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In particular, the reviewers felt that the current evidence presented is not yet strong enough to support the author's proposed mechanism. Concerns were raised that the evidence is quite descriptive that these 3'UTR shortening events are associated with transcript stability. Additionally, concerns were raised about bioinformatics methods throughout the manuscript. Finally, some parts of the manuscript need rewriting to make the discussion of existing literature more comprehensive.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Taken together, the major points raised by the reviewers can be broken into three areas – required further biological insight; clarification/improvement of bioinformatics analyses; and textual changes, as follows:</p><p>Biological insight: A number of points were raised relating to the need for further evidence to support the authors' main conclusions.</p><p>Two reviewers raised issues relating to whether or not Clp1 3'UTR shortening is a mechanism related to Aire's function or may likewise affect Aire independent genes (See title of the paper). This important point should be fully addressed in a revised manuscript, including via answers to the specific points raised below:</p><p>– To support the claim that 3'UTR shortening is due to Clp1, the authors are asked to address in more detail whether the Aire-sensitive genes influenced by Aire-KO and Clp1-KD are mostly shared or with the similar pattern around pA sites. If not, why?</p><p>– The data presented all point towards use of proximal pA sites through the action of Clp1 being an independent layer of control of TRA expression (in the sense of being 'upstream' of Aire's function rather than being a consequence of Aire's action). mTECs are thought to express 'many' TRAs in an Aire independent manner (or do the authors feel otherwise?). Are these also affected by knockdown of Clp1? In sum, the question arises whether 'Aire dependent genes undergo Clp1-mediated 3'UTR shortening….' (as the title insinuates) or whether 'Weakly expressed genes undergo Clp1-mediated 3'UTR shortening…'</p><p>Two reviewers also asked for further data related to the role of Clp1 in mTECs. Again, these points should be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>– Please provide additional data on how Clp1-driven 3'UTR shortening can lead to high transcript stability. Are any specific microRNAs or RNA-binding proteins involved during this process?</p><p>– Unfortunately, the authors only address the effect of Clp1 knockdown in the absence of Aire in HEK293 cells or in the presence of Aire in mTECs. It would be extremely interesting to relate this to the effect-size of Aire in HEK293 cells and in mTECs (e.g. how would Figure 3D, right, look like for Aire-expressing HEK293 cells in which Clp1 has been knocked-down). Alternatively (but certainly asking too much), it would have been very informative to see how Figure 4B, right, would look like for <italic>Aire</italic>-KO mTECs).</p><p>Bioinformatics: The reviewers raised a number of concerns and questions regarding bioinformatics methods and analyses, which should be fully addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>1) Please provide more detail on how the d3'UTR ratio, used to measure 3'UTR usage, was calculated. Did the method used consider non-uniform read bias? Whether d3'UTR ratio is based on transcript or genes? Also, please explain why d3'UTR ratio has a maximum value of 2 based on Figure 1C, E, Figure 2A etc?</p><p>2) Equal number Aire-neutral datasets were used as the control throughout the manuscript. The authors are asked to address why this small arbitrarily selected dataset can represent the global pattern of Aire-neutral genes. They should describe how the Aire-neutral genes were selected, and whether these are equally low in their basal expression levels (see below).</p><p>3) Aire-sensitive genes are generally expressed at very low levels as compared to most other genes (= Aire-insensitive/neutral genes) (see also Figure 1B). Please comment on whether or not in the case of 'low abundance' mRNAs, there might be a general technical bias towards detection of more 5' reads even among reads that are all upstream of the proximal pA site (which would result in an artificially low d3'UTR ratio). In this context, are the selected Aire neutral genes on average expressed at a similarly low level (see for instance Figure 4B, right: here, the median expression (RPKM) of Aire-neutral genes is substantially higher than that of Aire-sensitive genes; see also Figure 3D)?</p><p>4) Related to Figure 3A, the authors are asked to explain why some known APA factors did not change d3'UTR ratio.</p><p>5) For the multi-tissues analysis from various sources, did the authors consider batch effect and other technical bias? Specifically, related to Figure 1G, an important question is whether a gene that shows a short 3'UTR preference in mTECs also does so in the peripheral tissue. Is that what Figure 1G is supposed to address? It is very difficult to understand. Would it be feasible to plot for all the individual 574 Aire-sensitive TRAs from Figure 1D their d3'UTR ratio in mTEChi vs. their d3'UTR ratio in the respective peripheral tissue to ask in how far the distribution of datapoints deviates from a diagonal? Possibly, this might be a more intuitive way of showing whether or not the usage of a proximal 3' UTR differs between mTEChi and a respective peripheral tissue.</p><p>6) Please ensure that all of the bioinformatics methods and tools used are appropriately referenced, as this is currently not the case.</p><p>Textual changes:</p><p>Concerns were raised that the existing literature is only incompletely discussed, particularly in the Introduction. Please include further discussion of the current literature around post-transcriptional control mechanisms in mTECs involving changes in the mRNA 3´UTRs, and fully cite relevant previous references.</p><p>Also, subsection “Aire-sensitive genes show a preference for short-3’UTR transcript isoforms in mTEChi and in some peripheral tissues”, last paragraph, first sentence: This somewhat contrived sentence may deserve attention.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52985.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Taken together, the major points raised by the reviewers can be broken into three areas – required further biological insight; clarification/improvement of bioinformatics analyses; and textual changes, as follows:</p><p>Biological insight: A number of points were raised relating to the need for further evidence to support the authors' main conclusions.</p><p>Two reviewers raised issues relating to whether or not Clp1 3'UTR shortening is a mechanism related to Aire's function or may likewise affect Aire independent genes (See title of the paper).

If not, why?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting this important question about the relationship between the Aire-sensitive genes and the pA effects of <italic>Clp1</italic> KD.</p><p>* First, we would like to reiterate that in our paper, we conclude that Clp1 promotes/ contributes to 3'UTR shortening at Aire-sensitive genes but do not rule out contributions by other factors. Figure 3D Left and Figure 4B show that the levels of d3'UTR ratios of Aire-sensitive genes in <italic>Clp1</italic> KD samples do not reach those of Aire-neutral genes in the Ctr samples. We noted in the text that the data suggested that Clp1 can account for most, but perhaps not all, of the 3’UTR shortening effect, such that other additional factors may also contribute to the increased proportion of short-3'UTRs of Aire-sensitive genes (Results sections “CLP1 promotes 3’UTR shortening and higher expression at Aire-sensitive genes in HEK293 cells” and “Clp1 promotes 3’UTR shortening and higher levels of Aire-upregulated transcripts in mTEChi”).</p><p>* Regarding the specificity of the pA effect of Clp1 at Aire-sensitive genes, we assessed the magnitude of the difference in 3’UTR shortening for the Aire-sensitive versus Aire-neutral genes upon <italic>Clp1</italic> KD. We determined the proportion of genes that exceeded a high threshold of short-3’UTR transcript isoform enrichment upon <italic>Clp1</italic> KD, namely d3’UTR ratios of &lt; 0.5 in Ctr vs. <italic>Clp1</italic> KD mTEChi. For the Aire-sensitive genes, 181 out of 528 genes (34%) exhibited this large shift to the shorter 3’UTR, whereas for the Air-neutral genes, a significant smaller proportion, 1206 out of 6076 genes (20%) exhibited this degree of shift to the shorter 3’UTR form (Chisq test: P=9.0*10<sup>-15</sup>). Please see new Figure 4—figure supplement 2 and Results section “Clp1 promotes 3’UTR shortening and higher levels of Aire-upregulated transcripts in mTEChi”.</p><p>We also observed an enhanced proportion of genes subject to CLP1-mediated 3'UTR shortening among Aire-sensitive versus Aire-neutral genes in HEK293 cells (for CLP1-sh2: 33% in Aire-sensitive genes versus 9% in Aire-neutral genes, Chisq test: P=9.7*10<sup>-23</sup>; for CLP1-sh3: 28% versus 10%, Chisq test: P=5.7*10<sup>-13</sup>). Please see new Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and Results section “Clp1 promotes 3’UTR shortening and higher levels of Aire-upregulated transcripts in mTEChi”.</p><p>Thus, these results strongly support a highly preferential, but not necessarily exclusive 3'UTR shortening effect of Clp1 at Aire-sensitive genes versus other genes. We therefore modified in the Discussion the sentences that may have implied that the effect of Clp1 was strictly specific to Aire-sensitive genes.</p><p>* We also now highlight a correlation between Clp1-mediated 3'UTR shortening and increased expression at Aire-sensitive genes. Namely, in WT mTEChi the Aire-sensitive genes responsive to the 3'UTR shortening effect of Clp1 exhibited higher levels of expression than the Aire-sensitive genes neutral to Clp1’s effect. Please see new Figure 4—figure supplement 3 and Results section “Clp1 promotes 3’UTR shortening and higher levels of Aire-upregulated transcripts in mTEChi”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The data presented all point towards use of proximal pA sites through the action of Clp1 being an independent layer of control of TRA expression (in the sense of being 'upstream' of Aire's function rather than being a consequence of Aire's action). mTECs are thought to express 'many' TRAs in an Aire independent manner (or do the authors feel otherwise?). Are these also affected by knockdown of Clp1? In sum, the question arises whether 'Aire dependent genes undergo Clp1-mediated 3'UTR shortening….' (as the title insinuates) or whether 'Weakly expressed genes undergo Clp1-mediated 3'UTR shortening…'</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for calling our attention to this point. Indeed, since Aire-sensitive genes are mainly composed of TRA genes that exhibit similar low levels of expression than Aire-independent TRA genes, we acknowledge that it is important to determine whether the Clp1-mediated 3’UTR shortening was preferentially affecting the Aire-sensitive genes or the TRA genes.</p><p>To address this point, we selected, within the whole set of Aire-neutral genes, the genes that have been unambiguously identified as either TRA genes and non-TRA genes (Sansom et al., 2014) and investigated the effect of <italic>Clp1</italic> KD on the d3'UTR ratios of these two gene sets. We found only small statistically insignificant increases of d3'UTR ratios for either the TRA or non-TRA Aire-neutral genes following <italic>Clp1</italic> KD, indicating that the preference of genes for Clp1’s effect is more aligned with Aire-sensitivity than whether the gene is a TRA gene. Please see revised Figure 4B and Results section “Clp1 promotes 3’UTR shortening and higher levels of Aire-upregulated transcripts in mTEChi”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Two reviewers also asked for further data related to the role of Clp1 in mTECs. Again, these points should be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>– Please provide additional data on how Clp1-driven 3'UTR shortening can lead to high transcript stability. Are any specific microRNAs or RNA-binding proteins involved during this process?</p></disp-quote><p>Short-3’UTR transcripts, in comparison to their longer counterparts, lack miRNA-binding sites and AU-rich elements, which are specifically targeted by miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) respectively. While miRNA targeting is known to destabilize transcripts and decrease their translation, RBP targeting can either trigger repression or activation signals depending on the type of cis elements that they recognize. Hence, transcript stability is controlled by the net effects of miRNAs and RBPs. In our study, we observe a clear association of Clp1-driven 3'UTR shortening with higher transcript stability in mTEChi, strongly suggesting that the 3'UTR-shortened transcripts escape the post-transcriptional repression mediated by potent miRNAs and/or destabilizing RBPs in mTEChi.</p><p>mTEChi correspond to a stage of TEC development that directly arises from immature mTEClo. Taking mTEClo as a comparator, we assessed the level of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional repression in mTEChi versus mTEClo precursor cells by assessing the differences in expression of sets of genes identified as potentially targeted by miRNAs, in mTEChi versus mTEClo. To this end, we performed a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) between the two mTEC populations for each set of genes potentially targeted by a specific miRNA or miRNA family (as defined by the TargetScan database, new Figure 5—source data 1). We found 346 miRNA-specific target gene sets that had significantly reduced expression in mTEChi versus mTEClo. In sharp contrast, we did not detect any of the miRNA-specific target gene sets that had reduced expression in mTEClo versus mTEChi. This suggests that miRNAs are an important contributor to transcript destabilization in mTEChi and that this effect is similar or less for the same miRNA target sets in mTEClo cells. A GSEA leading edge analysis of the 346 miRNA-specific gene sets revealed 11259 target genes that accounted for the gene-set reduction in mTEChi, including 5532 genes targeted by a least 5 different miRNAs. Please see new Figure 5—figure supplement 1, new Figure 5—source data 1, Results section “Clp1-driven 3’UTR shortening of Aire-upregulated transcripts is associated with higher stability in mTEChi” and Materials and methods sections “miRNA potential target gene identification” and “Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)”. We updated our GEO depository GSE140815 with RNA-seq data of mTEChi and mTEClo isolated from the same pool of thymi (Materials and methods section “RNA-seq and d3’UTR ratios”).</p><p>To determine whether the Clp1-promoted 3'UTR shortening at Aire-sensitive genes can lead to escape from post-transcriptional repression mediated by the miRNAs associated with these 346 target-gene sets, we calculated, among the Aire-sensitive genes subject to Clp1-promoted shortening, the proportion of those that are potentially targeted by one of these miRNAs at a conserved site in the d3’UTR of their longer-transcript isoforms (new Figure 5—source data 1). We found a large proportion of these cases (46%) had one or more such conserved miRNA target sites, providing a specific miRNA de-repression mechanism due to 3’UTR shortening for a large fraction of the Aire-sensitive genes. This analysis is only able to identify miRNAs that are highly conserved and that have disproportionate effect in mTEChi versus mTEClo, so it is expected to miss many of the cases of potential miRNA regulation that may be relieved by 3’UTR shortening in mTEChi. Please see new Figure 5—source data 1 and Results section “Clp1-driven 3’UTR shortening of Aire-upregulated transcripts is associated with higher stability in mTEChi”.</p><p>These results strongly suggest that the Aire-induced transcripts that undergo Clp1-driven 3’UTR shortening in mTEChi escape the post-transcriptional repression mediated by a variety of miRNA species, resulting in higher stability of these transcripts in comparison to the longer 3’UTR transcripts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Unfortunately, the authors only address the effect of Clp1 knockdown in the absence of Aire in HEK293 cells or in the presence of Aire in mTECs.

Alternatively (but certainly asking too much), it would have been very informative to see how Figure 4B, right, would look like for Aire-KO mTECs).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting this question. To address it, we generated new RNA-seq data, as described below, that we deposited in the GEO database as an update of our depository GSE140738.</p><p>We infected HEK293 cells with CLP1-sh2, sh3 or the Ctr shRNA, and for each, performed transfection with the <italic>Aire</italic> expression plasmid. After qPCR validation of <italic>CLP1</italic> knockdown (&gt;50% KD), we generated RNA-seq data for each of these samples and analyzed the level of expression of the Aire-sensitive genes. These experiments revealed a significant effect of <italic>CLP1</italic> knockdown, for both CLP1 shRNAs, on the levels of Aire-sensitive gene expression in the <italic>Aire</italic>-transfected HEK293 cells, similar in magnitude, and apparently slightly greater than in AIRE-negative HEK293 cells. Please see new Figure 3—figure supplement 4 (in comparison to Figure 3D Right) and Results section “CLP1 promotes 3’UTR shortening and higher expression at Aire-sensitive genes in HEK293 cells”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Bioinformatics: The reviewers raised a number of concerns and questions regarding bioinformatics methods and analyses, which should be fully addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>1) Please provide more detail on how the d3'UTR ratio, used to measure 3'UTR usage, was calculated. Did the method used consider non-uniform read bias? Whether d3'UTR ratio is based on transcript or genes? Also, please explain why d3'UTR ratio has a maximum value of 2 based on Figure 1C, E, Figure 2A etc?</p></disp-quote><p>* Non-uniform read coverage can be an obstacle to the comparison of read density between different parts of the transcripts, in particular between the 3' ends and the upstream regions. One source of 3’ biased increased read coverage is mRNA degradation associated with mRNA selection through polyA tail targeting. In order to reduce mRNA degradation as much as possible, we used TRIzol for all RNA extractions, notably TRIzol LS for sorted cells. Importantly, we sequenced only high-quality RNA (with RIN values around or over 8). Please see Materials and methods section “RNA-seq and d3’UTR ratios”.</p><p>Another source of 3' biased increased read coverage is the retro-transcription during the preparation of the RNA-seq library if oligo-dTs are used. In this project all RNA-seq libraries were generated using the Truseq (Illumina) or the Smarter (Clontech)/ Nextera (Illumina) chemistry, both including retro-transcription with random primers, therefore avoiding additional bias in 3' read coverage.</p><p>To lower the impact of non-uniform RNA-seq coverage between 3' ends and their upstream regions on the calculation of d3'UTR ratios, we normalized the read density of the cleavable d3’UTR region of each gene with a potential pA, by the read density of its constitutive contiguous upstream region in its last 3’ exon, so that the two considered regions used for d3’UTR ratio calculation are in close proximity within 3’ ends of the genes. Please see Materials and methods section “RNA-seq and d3’UTR ratios”.</p><p>* We provide more detail about how we calculated distal 3’UTR ratio here and in the revised text. After the mapping of the RNA-seq reads to the mm9 genome using Bowtie, we counted the reads that lie within the d3'UTR regions and within their contiguous upstream regions of the last 3’ exons using intersectBed, coverageBed and a GTF file with d3’UTR annotations that we generated as follows:</p><p>First, from the UCSC Table Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables), we chose mm9 mouse genome/ Genes and Gene Predictions/ RefSeq Genes/ refGene, and we obtained one file with coding exon features only and another file with 5' and 3'UTR features. We combined these two files into a single one and split the 3'UTR annotations into distal 3'UTR (d3'UTR) and proximal 3'UTR annotations at the sites of alternative pAs that we identified in parsing the PolyA_DB 2 database.</p><p>Then, we fused into a single feature the proximal 3'UTR annotation with the last coding exon (exon CDS) and formatted the file to fit a GTF format (revised Figure 1—source data 1). For each Refseq gene corresponding to an independent NM_Refseq ID, we divided the RPKM expression of the d3'UTR region by the expression of the upstream region of the last 3’ exon to generate the d3'UTR ratio used as a measure of pA usage. Please see revised Figure 1—source data 1 and Materials and methods section “RNA-seq and d3’UTR ratios”.</p><p>* To identify the genes differentially expressed between two conditions, we counted the reads that map to all exons of the genes, normalized the counts by using DESeq and computed the expression foldchange. We used, for read counting, a pre-formatted GTF file obtained from the UCSC Table Browser, in choosing mm9 mouse genome/ Genes and Gene Predictions/ RefSeq Genes/ refGene. Please see new Figure 1—source data 2 and Materials and methods section “RNA-seq and d3’UTR ratios”.</p><p>* d3'UTR ratios mostly range from 0 to 2 with a small number of genes with ratios reaching up to 10 – 30. These out of scale values possibly result from hampered sequencing of constitutive 3’ regions upstream of alternative pAs due to local high GC content, or from increased transcription within cleavable distal 3'UTR regions due to the presence of cryptic transcriptional start sites. For clearer representation in Figures 1C, E, Figure 2A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B, we cropped out the negative density values – d3'UTR ratios are positive – and the density values above 2 corresponding to a minority of events. However, to provide a complete picture of the d3'UTR ratio distribution, as well as the most accurate relationship between d3’UTR ratios and levels of expression, we have generated scatterplots including all d3'UTR ratios. Please see new Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Results section “Aire-sensitive genes show a preference for short-3’UTR transcript isoforms in mTEChi”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Equal number Aire-neutral datasets were used as the control throughout the manuscript. The authors are asked to address why this small arbitrarily selected dataset can represent the global pattern of Aire-neutral genes. They should describe how the Aire-neutral genes were selected, and whether these are equally low in their basal expression levels (see below).</p></disp-quote><p>* P-values, including those obtained from the Wilcoxon test, are sensitive to sample size and tend to decrease as n increases. The Aire-neutral genes, with an expression foldchange between 0.5 and 2, correspond to thousands of genes, i.e., a much higher number than the Aire-sensitive genes (Figure 1B). For each comparison, to prevent a biased reduction of the p-values due to the very large size of the Aire-neutral sample, we matched its size to the one of the tested Aire-sensitive sample, in selecting the Aire-neutral genes with the closest-to-1 expression foldchange. For instance, in the WT mTEChi comparison of d3’UTR ratios (Figure 1C), we selected the Aire-neutral genes with an expression FC between 1/1.06 and 1.06 to match the size of the Aire-sensitive sample (n=947). In this selection, the genes &quot;less neutral&quot; to Aire's action, i.e., with expression FC away from 1 and closer to 0.5 or 2 were discarded. In addition, performing the d3’UTR ratio comparison using two different Aire-neutral 947 gene subsamples – one corresponding to expression FC between 1.06 and 1.3 and the other to expression FC between 1/1.18 and 1/1.06 – also led to high statistically significant d3’UTR ratio reduction of Aire-sensitive genes (P=8.3*10<sup>-12</sup> and 8.1*10<sup>-9</sup>, respectively). Please see Materials and methods section “Statistical analysis”.</p><p>* In the Aire-sensitive/neutral gene comparisons, the Aire-neutral genes were not expression-matched to the Aire-sensitive genes. To fully address the reviewers’ concern about basal expression levels, we have taken into account the level of gene expression in performing a local regression (loess) of the d3'UTR ratios across expression levels of Aire-sensitive genes and the whole set of Aire-neutral genes in WT and <italic>Aire</italic>-KO mTEChi. While the d3’UTR ratios vary dramatically across genes, at all expression levels, the loess-fitted curve of the Aire-sensitive genes is significantly lower than the one of the Aire-neutral genes, therefore revealing, in WT and <italic>Aire</italic>-KO mTEChi, a preference of Aire-sensitive genes for smaller d3’UTR ratios that is independent of the levels of gene expression. Please see new Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Results section “Aire-sensitive genes show a preference for short-3’UTR transcript isoforms in mTEChi”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Aire-sensitive genes are generally expressed at very low levels as compared to most other genes (= Aire-insensitive/neutral genes) (see also Figure 1B). Please comment on whether or not in the case of 'low abundance' mRNAs, there might be a general technical bias towards detection of more 5' reads even among reads that are all upstream of the proximal pA site (which would result in an artificially low d3'UTR ratio). In this context, are the selected Aire neutral genes on average expressed at a similarly low level (see for instance Figure 4B, right: here, the median expression (RPKM) of Aire-neutral genes is substantially higher than that of Aire-sensitive genes; see also Figure 3D)?</p></disp-quote><p>In the Aire-sensitive/neutral gene comparisons, the Aire-neutral gene subsamples used as controls have the same average expression than the whole set of Aire-neutral genes. The Aire-sensitive genes are expressed at much lower levels than the Aire-neutral gene subsamples. The local regression of d3’UTR ratios against the levels of expression of Aire-neutral or Aire-sensitive genes (previous point and new Figure 1—figure supplement 2) showed that the low expressed genes exhibit, on average, <italic>higher</italic> d3’UTR ratios than the highly expressed genes, therefore showing that the smaller d3’UTR ratios associated with Aire-sensitive genes do not result from a biological or technical general bias due to their low expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Related to Figure 3A, the authors are asked to explain why some known APA factors did not change d3'UTR ratio.</p></disp-quote><p>The 3’ end processing complex is composed of ~35 core 3’ processing factors, including Clp1, that are organized into four specialized RNA binding sub-complexes, as well as ~50 accessory proteins that interact with the core factors and mediate crosstalk between 3’ processing and other cellular processes (Shi et al., 2009). The effect of a number of core factors on 3’UTR length variation has been evaluated in various cellular systems, showing that many of them have no effect on 3’UTR lengthening or shortening (Li et al., 2015). The absence of effect could indicate that these factors do not contribute to the activity of 3’ end processing sub-complexes or that other factors, perhaps with redundant function, can compensate for their loss. For instance, the lack of 3’UTR length variation following the knockdown of Cstf2, a member of the Cstf sub-complex, has been proposed to result from the redundant function of Cstf2T and Cstf2 (Martin et al., 2012, Li et al., 2015). Please see Results section “CLP1 promotes 3’UTR shortening and higher expression at Aire-sensitive genes in HEK293 cells”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For the multi-tissues analysis from various sources, did the authors consider batch effect and other technical bias? Specifically, related to Figure 1G, an important question is whether a gene that shows a short 3'UTR preference in mTECs also does so in the peripheral tissue. Is that what Figure 1G is supposed to address? It is very difficult to understand. Would it be feasible to plot for all the individual 574 Aire-sensitive TRAs from Figure 1D their d3'UTR ratio in mTEChi vs. their d3'UTR ratio in the respective peripheral tissue to ask in how far the distribution of datapoints deviates from a diagonal? Possibly, this might be a more intuitive way of showing whether or not the usage of a proximal 3' UTR differs between mTEChi and a respective peripheral tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>* For the multi-tissue comparison, we included twenty tissue RNA-seq datasets generated by a single lab: that of Bing Ren at UCSD. These datasets were deposited in GEO under two different accession numbers: GSE29278 corresponding to a partial set and GSE36026 to the full set. We modified the Materials and methods section “Multi-tissue comparison analysis” to refer only to the GSE36026 accession number. These RNA-seq datasets were generated as part of the ENCODE project using standardized protocols in order to enable between-sample comparison. In addition to these twenty RNA-seq libraries, the two other libraries that we selected for the multi-tissue comparison, as well as the libraries corresponding to our mTEC samples, we all generated from polyA+ RNA using Illumina chemistry and sequenced on Illumina instruments.</p><p>A main artefact of the RNA-seq library preparation is biased duplicate reads that arise from reverse transcription, PCR or RNA fragmentation bias (Roberts et al., 2011; Sendler et al., 2011), and that introduce local distortion in the read coverage of the transcripts. These artefact duplicate reads are not readily distinguishable from the natural ones that arise from over-sequencing of highly expressed genes. Hence, duplicate reads, including the normal and artefact ones, are usually not removed from RNA-seq data, in which they contribute to the high dynamic range of gene expression values. Here, since our main interest focuses on the local read distribution within 3' ends between a series of samples that were not all generated by the same research center, we chose a conservative way to correct for the artefact reads, in removing all duplicate reads. Please see Materials and methods section “Multi-tissue comparison analysis”.</p><p>In addition, we have confirmed that small d3'UTR ratios of the Aire-sensitive genes in mTEChi were not correlated with the sequencing depth of the mTEChi RNA-seq libraries nor with the length of the generated reads (50bp). This result was obtained by generating successive subsamples of mapped reads (up to the lowest depth of the tissue RNA-seq libraries) by trimming the reads to 36bp (read length of Bing Ren's libraries), and by looking for an effect on d3’UTR ratios. We observed that the high sequencing depth and the 50bp read length have a very limited effect on d3'UTR ratios and that this very limited effect rather goes towards higher d3'UTR ratios. Please see new Figure 1—figure supplement 3 and Results section “Aire-sensitive genes show a preference for short-3’UTR transcript isoforms in mTEChi”.</p><p>* We followed the reviewers’ recommendation and simplified Figure 1G in a way that only the d3'UTR ratios of the Aire-sensitive TRA genes are shown. The preference for short-3'UTR transcript isoforms of these genes in mTEChi resulted from the comparison of the d3'UTR ratios across all tissues and the finding that the d3'UTR ratios of the Aire-sensitive TRA genes in mTEChi are amongst the smallest. Please see revised Figure 1G and Results section “Aire-sensitive genes show a preference for short-3’UTR transcript isoforms in mTEChi”.</p><p>We have generated a scatterplot of the d3'UTR ratios of 762 TRA genes (identified in the multi-tissue comparison) in mTEChi versus their respective tissue of expression and found a dramatic bias towards higher ratios in peripheral tissues, confirming the preference of Aire-sensitive TRA genes for short-3’UTR transcript isoforms in mTEChi, as compared to the periphery.

These annotation files used for RNA-seq and microarray analyses, as well as those used for RNA-seq differential expression, are provided in Figure 1—source data 1 and 2. We have also described more precisely how we carried out read count and differential expression and we provide the R-script that we used to calculate d3’UTR ratios in WT and <italic>Aire</italic>-KO mTEChi (new Figure 1—source data 3).

These bed files were generated using files corresponding to proximal and distal pA genomic location of genes extracted from the PolyA_DB 2 database (new Figure 2—source data 1). Please see new Figure 2—source data 1 and Materials and methods section “CLIP-seq analysis”.</p><p>* We have clarified how we performed microarray differential expression using the aroma.affymetrix R-package and how we extracted expression values of each individual probe of all genes on the array using the same R-package but with additional options listed in the new Figure 3—source data 1. We have also described how we mapped the individual probes to the d3’UTR features and calculated the d3’UTR ratios in providing our R-script and its dependent files (new Figure 3—source data 2). Finally, we provide the R-script that we used to assay the d3’UTR imbalance and its statistical significance (new Figure 3—source data 3).

Details, as the list of potential target genes harboring miRNA conserved sites in 3'UTRs generated through parsing the TargetScan 6.2 database, were included (new Figure 5–source data 1).
