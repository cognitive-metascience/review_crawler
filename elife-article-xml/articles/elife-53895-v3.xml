signalling has to be tightly controlled to ensure proliferation and differentiation of nephron progenitor cells. Here, we show in mice that the signalling molecules RSPO1 and RSPO3 act in a functionally redundant manner to permit WNT/β-catenin signalling and their genetic deletion leads to a rapid decline of nephron progenitors. By contrast, tissue specific deletion in cap mesenchymal cells abolishes mesenchyme to epithelial transition (MET) that is linked to a loss of <italic>Bmp7</italic> expression, absence of SMAD1/5 phosphorylation and a concomitant failure to activate <italic>Lef1, Fgf8</italic> and <italic>Wnt4,</italic> thus explaining the observed phenotype on a molecular level. Surprisingly, the full knockout of LGR4/5/6, the cognate receptors of R-spondins, only mildly affects progenitor numbers, but does not interfere with MET. Taken together our data demonstrate key roles for R-spondins in permitting stem cell maintenance and differentiation and reveal <italic>Lgr</italic>-dependent and independent functions for these ligands during kidney formation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Kidneys filter waste out of the bloodstream to produce urine. Each kidney contains many structures called nephrons which separate the waste from the blood. The number of nephrons in a kidney varies between people, and those with low numbers have a higher risk of chronic kidney disease. Nephrons are formed before birth from a specific group of so-called progenitor cells. Each of these cells can either divide to make others like itself, or it can specialize to make nephron cells. At the end of embryonic kidney development, all the progenitor cells become nephron cells.</p><p>Cells that specialize to become part of a nephron first go through a change called a mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition. Epithelial cells move less than mesenchymal cells, and also develop a clear structure where the two ends of the cell adapt to different roles. Evidence suggests that a cell communication process called WNT/β-catenin signaling controls this transition. Yet the details of how this transition is controlled are not fully understood. One way to activate WNT/β-catenin signaling is with R-spondin proteins, which have been found in developing kidneys.</p><p>Vidal et al. studied R-spondins during the embryonic development of kidneys in mice. Removing R-spondins stopped the progenitor cells from producing more of themselves and increased the number that died. The R-spondins were also needed for the progenitor cells to specialize as nephron cells through the mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition. Further results revealed that R-spondins activate WNT/β-catenin signaling in these cells, even though the proteins that usually act as R-spondin receptors (called LGR4/5/6) could be removed without affecting the results. This suggests that R-spondins interact with different receptor proteins during kidney development.</p><p>These findings highlight the role of R-spondins and WNT/β-catenin signaling in kidney development. Future studies will seek the receptor proteins that R-spondins interact with in kidneys. They may also look to understand how R-spondins balance their different roles in progenitor cells and during cell specialization. These results in mice could also be extended to determine their relevance in human health and disease, including chronic kidney disease, which is responsible for more deaths than breast or prostate cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kidney development</kwd><kwd>wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>mesenchyme to epithelial transition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>305608</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schedl</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Equipe labelisee</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schedl</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the developing kidney, secreted molecules of the R-spondin family control progenitor cell proliferation and nephron formation by permitting WNT/β-catenin signalling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nephron endowment is a critical factor for renal health and low number of nephrons have been associated with chronic kidney disease and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertram et al., 2011</xref>). In mammals, nephrogenesis is restricted to the developmental period and involves a dedicated nephrogenic niche at the most cortical region of the forming kidney that fuels successive rounds of nephron production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McMahon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oxburgh, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Brien, 2019</xref>). The nephrogenic niche consists of three independent progenitor populations that will develop into collecting ducts, stroma (interstitial cells) and nephrons. Nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) form a condensed cap around the tips of the branching ureter. This cap mesenchyme (CM) can be further subdivided into populations that represent cells of progressive differentiation status depending on the position along their migration trajectories around the ureteric tips. Analysis over the last decade have identified at least four different subpopulations: 1) CITED1<sup>+</sup>/SIX2<sup>+</sup> that are considered as ‘ground-state’ progenitors; 2) CITED1<sup>-</sup>/SIX2<sup>+</sup> progenitors; 3) primed CITED1<sup>-</sup>/SIX2<sup>+</sup>/pSMAD<sup>+</sup> progenitors; 4) WNT4<sup>+</sup>/LEF1<sup>+</sup> pretubular aggregates (PTA). Once engaged, PTAs undergo a mesenchyme to epithelial transition (MET) to form epithelialized renal vesicles, which will further differentiate via comma- and S-shaped bodies into segmented nephrons. This traditional view of a molecular and spatial subdivision of the CM has been challenged by findings that nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) are much more mobile than previously appreciated. Indeed, NPCs have been observed to travel back and forth between caps of independent tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Combes et al., 2016</xref>) and between the pretubular aggregate and cap mesenchyme state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lawlor et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The transformation of nephron progenitors into epithelialized nephrons is not an entirely cell-intrinsic process, but requires inductive signals from both the ureteric tip and stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Brien, 2019</xref>). Of particular importance is WNT9b, a molecule released from the branching ureter that induces canonical WNT/β-catenin signalling, stimulates proliferation and thus ensures self-renewal of kidney progenitors. Accordingly, deletion of β–catenin leads to the loss of progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karner et al., 2011</xref>). However, canonical WNT signalling is also required for MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll et al., 2005</xref>) and transient activation of β–catenin in isolated progenitors induces epithelialisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuure et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park et al., 2012</xref>). How the balance between progenitor proliferation and differentiation is achieved is not well understood, but experimental evidence suggests that progenitor proliferation requires low levels of β-catenin activity, whereas genes that are involved in MET are activated in the presence of a strong canonical β-catenin signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramalingam et al., 2018</xref>). In the context of nephrogenesis, a strong β-catenin response appears to rely on the activation of canonical BMP/SMAD pathway, as progenitor cells leaving the niche are positive for pSMAD and deletion of <italic>Bmp7</italic> interferes with MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>WNT/β-catenin signalling is essential for many organ systems and multiple feedback mechanisms have been identified that control signalling strength at almost every level of this signal transduction pathway. WNT receptor availability at the cell membrane is controlled by RNF43 and ZNRF3, two trans-membrane E3 ubiquitin ligases that induce receptor endocytosis and thus negatively regulate WNT signalling. Their action is counteracted by R-spondins (RSPO1-4), a family of secreted molecules that bind to the G-protein-coupled receptors LGR4/5/6. Binding to LGRs permits R-spondins to interact with RNF43/ZNRF3 and suppress endocytosis of the WNT receptor complex, thus enhancing WNT signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Lau et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated a potential role of the R-spondin/LGR axis in controlling renal stem/progenitor behaviour in vivo. We show that <italic>Rspo1</italic> and <italic>Rspo3</italic> are required to maintain the pool of renal progenitors throughout development by supporting their proliferative capacity and preventing their apoptosis. Moreover, strong <italic>R-spondin</italic> signal is essential to allow nephron progenitors to engage in differentiation and undergo MET. RSPO1/3 achieve these functions by their ability to activate the WNT/β−catenin signalling pathway, a role that is primarily mediated in an LGR-independent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>R-spondins</italic> are dynamically expressed during kidney development</title><p>To understand the role of R-spondins during kidney development in mice, we first mapped the expression of the four members of this gene family using qPCR and in situ hybridisation analysis.

To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of a mouse strain carrying an <italic>Lgr4</italic> null allele that was previously generated by our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Da Silva et al., 2018</xref>).

Moreover, MET appeared to be unaffected in LGR4 mutants as exemplified by the activation of LEF1 in PTAs and the presence of WT1 positive cells in proximal proportion of forming nephrons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To test whether LGR5 and/or LGR6 may compensate for the lack of LGR4, we next analyzed wholebody <italic>Lgr4/5/6</italic> triple knockout kidneys at E14.5, the latest developmental stage where these embryos can be collected. The absence of LGR4/5/6 had little effect on early renal development and progenitors were able to undergo MET and form WT1+ glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We conclude that while LGR4 appears to mediate some R-spondin activity within the nephrogenic niche, the majority of signalling occurs in an LGR-independent manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Controlled proliferation and differentiation of renal progenitors is essential for the establishment of sufficient numbers of nephrons that ensure healthy kidney function throughout life. Our analysis has established R-spondins as novel key regulators that ensure the maintenance of a healthy pool of nephron progenitors throughout kidney development and permit MET during nephrogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with their partially overlapping expression pattern, <italic>R-spondins</italic> appear to act in a functionally redundant manner in kidney development and single gene deletion of <italic>Rspo1</italic> or <italic>Rspo3</italic> had only mild effects on progenitor numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, whereas <italic>Rspo1</italic> is present in all SIX2<sup>+</sup> cells, <italic>Rspo3</italic> expression is restricted to a subpopulation that - based on their location at the outermost cortex - appear to represent ‘ground-state’ progenitors. Interestingly, by E18.5 <italic>Rspo3</italic> expression is lost from the nephron progenitor compartment, which is likely to reflect the progressive aging/differentiation of these cells. Indeed, age-dependent changes of nephron progenitors that affect their proliferation capacity and lifespan have been described, previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>At late stages of embryogenesis, <italic>Rspo3</italic> expression becomes almost exclusively restricted to stromal progenitors, which is consistent with recent single sequencing data at E18.5 that highlighted <italic>Rspo3</italic> as a marker for the stromal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Combes et al., 2019</xref>). Stromal expression appears to be important for nephron progenitor maintenance, as <italic>Rspo3</italic> deletion in this compartment (<italic>Foxd1:Cre</italic>) resulted in progenitor loss at later stages of development. Renal progenitor cells are thus sandwiched between stromal cells releasing RSPO3 and the WNT9b producing ureteric bud that ensures their survival at later stages of development.</p><p>In previous studies, R-spondins, and in particular <italic>Rspo3</italic>, have been shown to enhance both canonical and non-canonical WNT signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kazanskaya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scholz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohkawara et al., 2011</xref>). Our analysis demonstrates that upon R-spondin deletion direct downstream targets of β–catenin, such as <italic>Tafa5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karner et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>Axin2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lustig et al., 2002</xref>) are reduced in nephron progenitors indicating that in kidney development R-spondins activate canonical WNT signalling. Indeed, the observed phenotypes largely mimic those seen upon loss of β−catenin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park et al., 2012</xref> and this study). These findings are consistent with recent in vitro data that described <italic>Rspo1</italic> to enhance canonical signalling upon treatment of a mesonephric cell line (M15) with WNT9b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dickinson et al., 2019</xref>). However, at present we can not exclude that R-spondins may also modulate non-canonical WNT signalling, which might affect cell adhesion and migration of NPCs. Live imaging experiments in <italic>Six2-Cre:DM</italic> will be required to address this hypothesis.</p><p>The substantially different phenotypes observed in <italic>CAGG:CreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> (or <italic>Foxd1:Cre</italic>) driven deletion of R-spondins, which impacted progenitor survival, and <italic>Wt1:CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> (or <italic>Six2:Cre)</italic> driven excision that interfered with MET, may at a first glance seem surprising. However, the ubiquitously expressed <italic>CAGG:CreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> strain completely abolished <italic>R-spondin</italic> expression in the kidney and thus effectively blocked β–catenin signalling within progenitors. Since β–catenin signalling is essential for proliferation and survival, progenitor cell numbers rapidly declined in these mutants. By contrast, <italic>Six2:Cre</italic> and <italic>Wt1:CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-induced deletions did not interfere with stromal <italic>Rspo3</italic> expression, which bestowed sufficient β-catenin signalling on progenitors to permit survival. This hypothesis is compatible with a model in which low and high levels of β–catenin signalling regulates Class II and Class I target genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramalingam et al., 2018</xref>). However, the concept of lower β–catenin signalling in uncommitted progenitors seems contradictory considering that they are exposed to higher levels of R-spondins (RSPO1+RSPO3), when compared to cells that engage in MET (only RSPO1). This dilemma can be resolved when introducing an additional ‘switch’ that permits the activation of class I targets (e.g. <italic>Wnt4</italic>/<italic>Lef1</italic>) once progenitors leave the cortical niche. Evidence from knockout studies suggests this switch to involve <italic>Bmp7</italic>-dependent activation of pSMAD signalling at the boundary between the niche and committed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2013</xref>). Since progenitors in <italic>Six2:Cre-DM/Wt1:CreER<sup>T2</sup>-DM</italic> mice have significantly decreased levels of <italic>Bmp7</italic> (a class II target of β-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park et al., 2012</xref>]), progenitor cells fail to activate pSMAD signalling, lack expression of class I targets and as a consequence do not epithelialize.</p><p>We have also addressed the potential role of LGR4/5/6, the cognate receptors of R-spondins, in conveying their action. <italic>Lgr4</italic> single mutants have been described previously to show dilated collecting ducts and reduced kidney size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato et al., 2006</xref>) that could be traced back to a reduction in renal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dang et al., 2014</xref>). Our own analysis with an independent <italic>Lgr4</italic> knockout allele confirms this phenotype, although duct dilation was only seen at late stages of kidney development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Da Silva et al., 2018</xref> and data not shown). In R-spondin mutants we did not observe dilated collecting ducts, which might be explained by persistent expression of <italic>Rspo3</italic> in medullary stroma using the tissue-specific deletion in stromal or nephron progenitors. <italic>Lgr5</italic> was found to be virtually absent from uninduced progenitors, but was strongly expressed within the ureteric tip and the distal part of the developing nephron, two sites of strong β-catenin activity. To our knowledge, no renal abnormalities have been associated with <italic>Lgr5</italic> mutations and the previously published <italic>Lgr4/Lgr5</italic> double mutants show a kidney phenotype comparable to the <italic>Lgr4</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kinzel et al., 2014</xref>). Our RNAScope analysis revealed <italic>Lgr6</italic> expression to be highly restricted to the pretubular aggregates and renal vesicle. Surprisingly, <italic>Lgr4/5/6</italic> triple knockouts are associated with only a mild loss of renal progenitors that are capable to undergo MET, a phenotype that does not phenocopy the dramatic loss of renal progenitors and their inability to undergo MET correlated with the absence of <italic>Rspo1</italic> and <italic>Rspo3</italic>. Due to the embryonic death around E14.5, later stages could not be analysed. Taken together these data indicate that <italic>Lgr4</italic>, but not <italic>Lgr5/6,</italic> contribute to R-spondin signalling in nephron progenitor cells. However, the mild phenotype observed in single <italic>Lgr4</italic> mutants and the triple <italic>Lgr</italic> knockout when compared to <italic>Rspo1/3</italic> mutants, suggests that R-spondins are likely to act primarily in an LGR-independent manner in NPCs. A similar LGR-independent action has recently been described for <italic>Rspo2</italic> in limb and lung development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Szenker-Ravi et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, an alternative mode of action for RSPO2 and RSPO3 has recently emerged that potentiates the WNT/β−catenin pathway through an interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lebensohn and Rohatgi, 2018</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus,</italic> RSPO3 has been shown to interact with Syndecan4 to induce non-canonical (PCP) signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohkawara et al., 2011</xref>) and Syndecan1 has been suggested to present WNT and R-spondins in multiple myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ren et al., 2018</xref>). Further analysis will be needed to identify the proteins responsible for mediating LGR-independent R-spondin action in the kidney.</p><p>The number of nephrons varies dramatically in the human population with a count of 250,000 and 2.5 million glomeruli per kidney being considered as normal. However, lower nephron numbers have been directly linked with hypertension and a higher risk of developing renal diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertram et al., 2011</xref>). Our study has identified R-spondins as regulators that maintain the nephrogenic niche during development and we can speculate that changes in expression levels or protein function in these genes may be associated with renal disorders. Interestingly, the <italic>RSPO3</italic> locus has been identified in two studies to be linked with renal diseases including abnormal blood urea nitrogen (BUN), a hallmark for glomerular filtration dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Okada et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Osman et al., 2018</xref>).

Each value was reported on the graph as a single symbol (black dot for Ctrl and black square for <italic>CAGG:CreER<sup>TM</sup>-DM</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantification of renal progenitors</title><p>SIX2<sup>+</sup> progenitors located in the cap mesenchyme were counted in three sagittal sections (20 μm apart to each other) of kidney samples through the renal pelvis and the average number obtained for every embryo was reported on the graph.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification of Axin2 level of expression from RNAScope analysis</title><p>Three to eight sagittal sections of kidney samples were cut through the renal pelvis (20 μm apart from each other), and subjected to in situ RNA hybridisation (RNAScope technology) using an <italic>Axin2</italic> anti-sense probe. Sections were mounted in Vectashield antifade mounting medium with DAPI and imaged with a Slide scanner Vectra Polaris. RNAScope signal was detected with filter 555 and nuclei with filter 350. Images were analysed with Halo software (Indica labs) using FISH-IF module that was based on cell segmentation and ISH signal per cell. The value obtained for every kidney section analysed is reported on the graph by either a point (for control) or a square (for mutant). Each symbol corresponds to the total RNAScope signal detected per selected kidney field normalised to the total number of cells present in this area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantification of progenitors that are pSMAD1/5 positives</title><p>Immunostaining with anti-pSMAD1/5 antibodies was performed on 3 to 6 sagittal sections (20 μm apart to each other) of kidney samples, and signal was revealed using the Vector Red alkaline phosphatase kit. For every section, progenitors located in CM that were labelled with anti-PSMAD1/5 antibodies were counted and normalised to the total number of progenitors that were in this CM. Every average number obtained for every embryo was reported on the graph as a dot (for control) or a square (for mutant) samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data are shown as mean (± s.e.m).

The kidney capsule was removed and the nephrogenic zone digested by incubating kidneys in collagenaseA/pancreatin mix for 15 min according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al. (2015)</xref>. Nephron progenitors were purified by MACS sorting and resuspended in Apel medium supplemented with 2% PFHM II (Protein Free Hybridoma Medium II), FGF9 (200 ng/ml) and Heparin (1 μg/ml) as growth control medium. Freshly isolated cells were seeded at 200,000 cells per 24-well dish and cultured for 48 hr at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. We tested the effect of medium supplementation with RSPO3 (200 ng/ml) + WNT3a (50 ng/ml) or with Chir (3 μM) only. After 2 days, cells were scrapped with RLT buffer (Qiagen) and RNA extracted using RNeasy Mini kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Clara Panzolini for technical assistance and the entire staff of the iBV animal facility for their dedication.

Nephron progenitor cells exist in a discrete anatomic site in the developing kidney and both self renew throughout fetal life and give rise to nephrons. No NPCs exist in adult life. While the Wnt system has been thoroughly investigated in renal development direct relevance to human kidney malformations has been rarely suggested (PMID: 23520208). Importantly, R-spondins have been recently used to expand organoid cultures of adult kidney epithelia (Nat Biotech 2019). The cell types in adult cultures include proliferating mature epithelia and maybe &quot;stem states&quot; of mature epithelia but surely they do not include NPCs.</p><p>The manuscript is overall elegant and the experiments are properly performed. Nevertheless, the verdict of proliferation versus differentiation of NPCs following an R-spondin cue is still out there. For the manuscript to be acceptable to <italic>eLife</italic> I would suggest a major revision and additional experiments on NPC cultures. Currently R-spondins are not required to propagate NPC ex vivo. To make a strong case for a proliferative versus a differentiative roles , isolation of NPC and analysis of the effects of R-spondins on freshly cultured NPCs is critically needed. I would like to see these data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study takes a close look at the role of R-spondins in the regulation of nephron progenitors and the subsequent formation of nephrons. Using a series of different Cre drivers specific to subsets of cells within the developing kidney, they identify distinct roles for <italic>Rspo1</italic> and <italic>Rspo3</italic> in the formation of nephrons during kidney development. This suggests the involvement of an additional signal to the previously described role of canonical Wnt signalling in the process of MET. Surprisingly, they also demonstrate that the actions of R-spondins are independent of Lgr signalling as the phenotypes were not replicated in cell-specific LGR knockouts. While the mechanism of action was not further investigated, the study was performed well and adds clarity to our understanding of the molecular basis of kidney development. The data presented in large part supports the conclusions that have been made by the authors. The quality of the data is generally high.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53895.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Clarify the use of the term stem cells or progenitors.</p></disp-quote><p>The term “renal stem cell” has been used repeatedly in the literature for nephron precursors, but we agree that nephron progenitors are less controversial.

This makes quantification by qPCR unsuitable. We had therefore opted for in situ hybridization analysis that provides spatial information, and a qualitative assessment of RNA expression. RNA-Scope analysis is considered more quantitative when counting individual dots, but cost-prohibitive if a large number of genes have to be analysed. As a compromise, we have now performed new RNA-Scope experiments for the direct β-catenin target <italic>Axin2</italic> and quantified its expression using the HALO software package. Our new data demonstrate a significant reduction of <italic>Axin2</italic> expression upon NPC-specific deletion of R-spondins (Figure 4E and Figure 2—figure supplement 1).

However, recent results demonstrate that RSPO3 can also act through an LGR-independent mechanism involving HSPGs (Lebensohn and Rohatgi, 2018). As discussed in our manuscript, the <italic>Lgr</italic> knockout kidney phenotype is far less severe than that observed in R-spondins mutants, which implies that the latter must act in an LGR independent manner. Providing functional proof that they act via HSPGs (or through alternative adaptors) is difficult and beyond the scope of this paper. While LGRs only play a minor role in mediating R-spondin activity in the kidney, we believe this observation is still important. If the reviewers insist, we could eventually move the data to the supplementary figures section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) To address proliferative versus a differentiative roles by analysing the effects of R-spondins on freshly cultured NPCs.</p></disp-quote><p>Depending on culture conditions isolated NPCs can be either expanded (low density plating) or induced to undergo MET (high density plating with a pulse of β-catenin inducing agent). We had planned to evaluate the effect of recombinant R-spondins under both of these conditions.</p><p>Low density plating:</p><p>We used the previously established medium by Brown et al., 2015, and cultured freshly isolated NPCs for 72h replacing Chiron (or not) with RSPO3. Surprisingly, in our hands, NPC expansion was also achieved in the absence of Chiron (and RSPO3), perhaps because intrinsic factors (cells continue to produce R-spondins) were sufficient to ensure expansion for the first 72h. Additional experiments, using R-spondin knockout mice had to be abandoned because of the COVID19 lockdown. However, deletion of <italic>Rspo1</italic>/3 at any time point during kidney development (we tested E10.5/E11.5/E12.5/ E13.5) leads to a rapid decline of the NPC population (Figure 2), which clearly demonstrates that these signalling molecules are essential for maintaining the progenitor pool.</p><p>High density plating:</p><p>Kidney progenitors were freshly isolated according to Brown et al., 2015, and cultured for 48h under high density plating conditions in the presence of RSPO3 (200μg/ml) or RSPO3 (200μg/ml) + Wnt3a (50ng/ml) or with Chiron (3μM). Under those conditions recombinant RSPO3 appears to induce canonical β-catenin signalling and initiate the initial steps of MET, as evidenced by the upregulation of <italic>Axin2</italic> and <italic>Wnt4</italic>. (Figure 5D) (unfortunately we could not test other markers due to the COVID-19 lockdown).

The inducible ubiquitous driver (<italic>CAGG:CreER<sup>TM</sup></italic>) has been used to efficiently delete R-spondins in all cell types. Since the effect on kidney progenitor proliferation and survival is very rapid (48h) and can be seen independently of the time of induction (we tested E9.5, E10.5, E11.5, E12.5, E13.5), the phenotype is unlikely to be due to secondary effects caused by phenotypes in other organ systems. Moreover, R-spondins are considered to work locally rather than on an organismal level. Finally, loss of progenitor cell maintenance is also seen when using tissue specific Cre lines such as <italic>Foxd1-Cre</italic> (see Figure 3).
