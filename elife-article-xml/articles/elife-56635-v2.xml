As part of the superphylum of Alveolata, the Apicomplexa are characterized by the presence of the alveoli, which consist in small flattened single-membrane sacs, underlying the plasma membrane (PM) to form the inner membrane complex (IMC) of the parasite. A rigid alveolin network composed of intermediate filament-like proteins is lining the cytoplasmic side of the IMC. The alveolin network is made of proteins sharing conserved repeat motifs called alveolins, which together with the IMC span the length of the parasite from the apical polar ring (APR) to the basal complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mann and Beckers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gould et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson-White et al., 2011</xref>). The IMC plays an essential role in parasite motility by anchoring the actomyosin system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frénal et al., 2017</xref>) and serves as structural scaffold during daughter cells formation within the mother cell, an asexual form of reproduction referred to as endodyogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Francia and Striepen, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The IMC is arranged in a series of rectangular plates sutured together. Several IMC sutures components (ISCs) have been localized to the transversal and longitudinal sutures between alveolar sacs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). The parasite is capped by a single cone-shaped plate called the apical cap. Several proteins have been reported to localize at the apical cap including the IMC sub-compartment protein 1 (ISP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beck et al., 2010</xref>) and nine apical cap proteins (called AC1 to AC9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Centrin2 labels a peripheral ring of six annuli at the boundary of the apical plate and the rest of the alveolar plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2006</xref>). Beneath the alveolin network, a set of 22 subpellicular microtubules (SPMT) spanning two third of the parasite length confers the elongated shape to the tachyzoites. The SPTMs originate at the APR, which serves as microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). Ultrastructural studies have highlighted tight connections between the IMC complex and the SPMTs. More specifically, freeze-fractured studies showed double rows of inner membranous particles (IMPs) at the IMC surface arranged in spiraling longitudinal rows reminiscent of SPMT path exhibiting a repeating pattern with a 32 nm periodicity. This 32 nm periodicity was also observed in the single row of IMP associated with SPMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morrissette et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>The APR and the secretory organelles, rhoptries (implicated in invasion) and micronemes (implicated in motility, invasion and egress), are common features of the apical complex conserved in all motile and invasive apicomplexans. Members of the coccidian subgroup of the phylum, including <italic>Toxoplasma, Neospora, Besniotia, Cyclospora, Sarcocystis</italic> and <italic>Eimeria</italic>, possess an additional organelle termed the conoid. This dynamic organelle is formed by 14 atypical comma-shape tubulin fibers composed of ∼9 protofilaments differing from classical microtubules in that they do not form a closed tubule but rather an open comma shaped structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2002</xref>). The conoid is enclosed between the APR and two preconoidal rings (PCRs) at the apex of the parasite. In addition, two short intraconoidal microtubules are present within the conoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morrissette, 2015</xref>). During division, the conoid is retracted posterior to the APR whereas it protrudes through the APR in a calcium-dependent manner in motile parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mondragon and Frixione, 1996</xref>). The calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) is an essential regulator of microneme exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lourido et al., 2010</xref>) and its deletion results in inhibition of conoid protrusion and a block of the apico-basal flux of F-actin, essential for parasite motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>). The mechanistic contribution of the conoid in motility and invasion has not been elucidated to date. During evolution, the conoid was lost in Haematozoa which include <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. and piroplasmidia (<italic>Theileria</italic> and <italic>Babesia</italic>). In contrast, the conoid is still present in deeply branching <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp. and <italic>Gregarina</italic> spp. Other more distantly related Alveolata (colpodellids, perkinsids and chromerids) possess a similar structure referred to as incomplete conoid or pseudoconoid, built from apical MTs but lacking the APR, which suggests that early branching apicomplexans harbored an ancestral apical complex along with secretory organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gubbels and Duraisingh, 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, the SAS6-like protein, which is localized near the base of the flagellum of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, is found at the preconoidal rings of <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites that do not possess a flagellum, raising questions about the origin of the conoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Leon et al., 2013</xref>). SAS6-like has also been localized apically in both ookinetes and sporozoites but absent in merozoites of <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>, revealing that the morphology and composition of the apical complex might vary between different parasitic life stages and yet retained conserved proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wall et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>More than 250 proteins were enriched in the conoid fraction by a proteomic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2006</xref>) but only a few have been functionally investigated. Knockdown of the APR protein RNG2 results in microneme secretion defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katris et al., 2014</xref>), while the conoid-associated MyoH and the likely associated calmodulin-like proteins are all required for gliding motility that powers invasion and egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graindorge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Long et al., 2017a</xref>). Additionally, the apical complex methyltransferase (AKMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heaslip et al., 2011</xref>), the formin 1 (FRM1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>) and the glideosome-associated connector (GAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacot et al., 2016</xref>) are apical proteins conserved across the Apicomplexa that play essential roles in parasite motility, invasion and egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frénal et al., 2017</xref>). Among the proteins involved in stability of the apical complex, loss of microtubules binding doublecortin (DCX)-domain protein results in shorter disordered conoid with subsequent defect in invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nagayasu et al., 2017</xref>). DCX was later shown to bundle the conoidal tubulin fibers into comma-shape structures likely conferring the cone-shaped configuration of the conoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leung et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the double knockout of kinesin A and apical polar ring protein 1 (APR1) caused a fragmentation of the APR with a conoid frequently partially detached resulting in impairment of microneme secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leung et al., 2017</xref>). Lastly, conoid protein hub 1 (CPH1) is a conserved apicomplexan protein essential for parasite motility, invasion and egress that regulates conoid stability in extracellular parasites without impacting on microneme secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Long et al., 2017b</xref>). Similarly, a recently described protein, the MAP kinase ERK7, localizing to the apical cap is reported to be involved in conoid assembly without impacting on microneme secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Shaughnessy et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we have used ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) to precisely localize AC9 and its partner AC10, identified by BioID, to the alveolin network but exclusively in the apical cap region in-between the SPMTs. Conditional depletion of AC9 and AC10 established that the two proteins are essential for parasite motility invasion and egress, while parasite replication is not affected. U-ExM and electron microscopy revealed striking morphological defects. AC9 or AC10 depleted mature parasites are conoidless, devoid of APR and their SPMTs are disorganized. The arrangement of AC9 and AC10 suggests that both proteins act as a glue between SPMTs, a prerequisite to maintain the overall architecture of the key components of the apical complex when the parasite matures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AC10 is a new apical cap protein closely associated to AC9</title><p>T. gondii AC9 is an hypothetical protein exhibiting no informative protein domain to unravel its function but a strong negative fitness score indicative of essentiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>). AC9 was modified by CRISPR/Cas9 editing at the endogenous locus to generate a fusion with the mini auxin-induced degron (mAID) and HA-tag at the C-terminus to localize and rapidly downregulate the protein upon addition of auxin (IAA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), AC9 colocalizes with ISP1 at the most apical plate of the IMC termed apical cap, delimited by the peripheral annuli stained by centrin2 (Cen2). AC9 appears very early during endodyogeny before the emergence of the daughter parasite scaffold stained with IMC1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Further colocalization with other Ty-tagged proteins at their endogenous loci, revealed that AC9 surrounds the APR marked by RNG2-Ty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katris et al., 2014</xref>) and the conoid localized with CPH1-Ty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A second copy of the gliding associated protein 70 (GAP70)-mycGFP was introduced in the AC9-mAID-HA strain. Like GAP45, GAP70 is acylated and anchored at both the IMC and the PM spanning the space between those two membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frénal et al., 2010</xref>). GAP70-mycGFP localized slightly more apically compared to AC9, which remains confined to the apical plate of the IMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Next, fractionation assay revealed that AC9 is completely resistant to extraction with the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 but is solubilized in sodium carbonate at pH 11. This suggests that AC9 is an alveolin network resident protein associated to other alveolins proteins or a peripheral IMC protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Noteworthy, AC9-mAID-HA migrated on SDS-PAGE at around 70 kDa, slightly higher than the predicted size (60 kDa). To get insights into AC9 potential interacting partners, we opted for the proximity labeling by the biotin ligase BirA approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2018</xref>) given the limited solubility of AC9. A mycBirA construct was inserted at the endogenous C-terminus locus of AC9 by CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and shown to be correctly targeted to the apical cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To assess whether AC9-mycBirA was able to biotinylate proximal proteins, we performed IFA with fluorophore-conjugated streptavidin. In absence of biotin, apicoplast endogenously biotinylated proteins were observed while addition of biotin for 24 hr resulted in accumulation of biotinylated proteins in the apical cap, proving that the enzyme is active at the right position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Of relevance, deoxycholate extracted parasites showed a robust streptavidin staining around the apical cortical microtubules just beneath the conoid indicating biotinylation of components of the parasite cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Analysis of parasites total lysates by WB showed an enrichment of biotinylated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Immunoprecipitation with streptavidin magnetic beads was performed with parasites lysed in cytoskeletal buffer as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) followed by mass spectrometry analysis. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase ACC1 and pyruvate carboxylase are the endogenously biotinylated proteins typically found as top hit in wild type parasites. The clear top hit was a hypothetical protein (TGGT1_292950) followed by two apical cap proteins (AC2 and AC8) and IMC/cytoskeletal proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Candidates were further filtered by expression patterns similar to AC9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). TGGT1_292950 exhibited a very similar cyclic mRNA expression pattern compared to AC9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Upon C-terminal Ty-epitope tagging, the product of the gene colocalized with AC9 in mature parasites and daughter cells and hence was named AC10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Like AC9, AC10 was showed to be partially solubilized by sodium carbonate and completely insoluble in Triton X-100 using the AC10-mAID-HA strain, indicating its alveolin network association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>AC9 and the newly discovered AC10 are alveolin network proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) AC9-mAID-HA localized to the apical cap of both mature and daughter cells (arrows).

Conditional depletion of AC9 or AC10 resulted in a very severe phenotype with parasites impaired in microneme secretion and consequently unable to glide, invade and egress from infected cells. Mature parasites lacking AC9 and AC10 are conoidless and also deprived of APR but replicate normally. Moreover, in the absence of conoid, FRM1, MyoH, AKMT and GAC are missing. In consequence no actin filament is produced and delivered to the glideosome, explaining the extreme severity of the phenotype.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Several ACs are components of the alveolin network conserved in coccidians</title><p>Super-resolution microscopy by STED and U-ExM unambiguously established that AC9 and AC10 are not distributed evenly in the apical cap region but organized in longitudinal rows intercalating between the 22 spiraling SPMTs. Fractionation assays indicated that both proteins are poorly soluble, consistent with their implication in the alveolin network that spreads between the IMC and the SPMTs. The lack of solubility of AC10 hampered biochemical demonstration that AC9 and AC10 form a complex. However, their perfect colocalization and the fact that AC10 depletion phenocopied AC9 and caused its destabilization strongly support their functional and physical association. In addition to AC9 and AC10, AC5 (or TLAP3) was previously suggested to arrange in such longitudinal rows in the apical cap region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). AC9 and AC10 are among the earliest markers of parasite division, prior to ISP1, AC1 and AC5. Like AC9 and AC10, AC8 localizes between SPMTs without being in contact with the APR. In contrast AC2 is coating the SPMTs up to the APR suggesting that it is a microtubule-associated protein (MAPs). It would be informative to assess the precise localization of the other ACs even if the corresponding genes are not predicted to be essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>) to comprehensively define the composition of the alveolin network. Of interest, the first described alveolin protein IMC1 is also arranged in longitudinal rows and not homogeneously distributed around the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mann and Beckers, 2001</xref>). IMC1 appears to form two rows between each SPMT, again reminiscent of the double rows of IMPs observed by freeze-fracture studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morrissette et al., 1997</xref>). IMC1 is well conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dubey et al., 2017</xref>) and harbors a strong negative fitness score, however its function in <italic>T. gondii</italic> has not been reported. Of note, AC9 and AC10 are conserved uniquely in the cyst forming coccidian subgroup of Apicomplexa that includes <italic>T. gondii</italic>, <italic>Neospora caninum</italic>, <italic>Besnoitia besnoiti</italic> and <italic>Cystoisospora suis.</italic> Both proteins are absent in <italic>Eimeria</italic> spp., piroplasmida, haemosporidia and cryptosporidia, while other ACs appear to be conserved in other lineages including distantly related gregarines and chromerids. To determine if AC9 and AC10 could potentially interact with other alveolar proteins or MAPs to stabilize the apical complex we examined the localization of ISP1, AC2, AC3 and AC8 in parasites depleted in AC9 or AC10 and saw no alteration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conoid and APR are lost as consequence of SPMTs disorganization in the absence of AC9 or AC10</title><p>The cascade of events leading to the loss of the conoid and APR involves parasite division. Strikingly, the conoid and APR are present in growing daughter cells and are only lost at the final stage of endodyogeny, when the daughter cells emerge and their cytoskeleton confers shape and rigidity to the parasite. The detached conoid appears to be very rapidly degraded because we fail to detect it inside mature parasites even when scrutinizing with FIB-SEM. However, with IFA taken at early stage on parasites that have completed only one or two division cycles, some degrading conoids could be observed with MyoH used as marker. In larger vacuoles such staining were not observed because the turnover and recycling of materials in the enlarged residual body might be faster. Contrastingly, the daughter cells were always shown to possess the conoid. In deoxycholate extracted AC9 and AC10 depleted parasites, the SPMTs are formed properly but are not joint together by the APR, which is absent in these mutants. A similar but milder phenotype was also reported in the double knock-out of KinA and APR1 with SPMTs partially detached from the parasite apex because of the fragmentation of the APR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leung et al., 2017</xref>). The strategic position of AC9 and AC10 intercalated between SPTMs suggested a possible implication in maintaining the correct interspacing between the SPMTs. Of note, the stability of SPMTs is in part maintained by the glideosome-associated protein with multiple-membrane spans family 1 (GAPM1) and other members of the GAPM family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harding et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here we have exploited the U-ExM technology to examine the SPMTs at an unprecedented level of resolution using anti-tubulin as well as anti-polyglutamylated (PolyE) antibodies. Of relevance the SPTMs are more glutamylated toward the apical pole of the parasites suggesting that the modification accumulates over time and is absent in the atypical tubulin fibers that form the conoid. The application of U-ExM on the AC9 and AC10 depleted mutants revealed a very striking apical disorganization of the SPMTs. The resulting disordered microtubules could cause the destabilization of the APR, which is present at the top of the SPMTs, presumably serving as MTOC. The dramatic consequences of AC9 and AC10 depletion on SPTMs, APR and conoid occur very late during parasite division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Concordantly, no major perturbations on the overall shape of the parasite, the IMC, the annuli and the apical positioning of microneme and rhoptries were observed. At the time when the daughter cells emerge from the mother cell, the tension imposed on the SPMTs could plausibly lead to their disorganization and consequently to the loss of APR and conoid and hence explains why the phenotypes of AC9 and AC10 depletion only appear at the end of the division process.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Role of AC9 and AC10 in the stability of the apical complex.</title><p>Schematic representation of AC9 and AC10 and their role in maintaining the integrity of the structural components of the apical complex during the late stage of parasite division.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56635-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Taken together, these findings lead us to postulate that the loss of the conoid is presumably a consequence of the loss of the APR, which could result from the disorganization of the SPMTs at the apical pole of the parasite. In such a model, the AC9/AC10 complex would act as a glue in between SPMTs and establish a functional link between the alveolin network and the SPMTs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>AC9 (TGGT1_246950) and AC10 (TGGT1_292950).

a triple membrane pellicle made of the plasma membrane and inner membrane sacs called alveoli, which are intimately associated with subcortical microtubules. In addition, coccidian parasites including Toxoplasma harbor a unique apical structure called the conoid. Together with apical secretory organelles, these structures are essential for parasite motility, host cell invasion and egress.

Coccidian parasites including Toxoplasma possess a unique structure called the conoid as part of the apical complex and used by the parasite for invasion, motility and egress. The authors capitalize on the latest techniques (BioID, super-resolution imaging techniques, including for the first time in Toxoplasma ultrastructure expansion microscopy, and conditional knockdown using the auxin degron system), to establish the function and in-depth localization of two alveolin proteins, AC9 and newly identified AC10, in assembly of the sub-cortical microtubules and conoid. Conditional depletion of AC9 or AC10 reveals defects in microneme secretion, egress and host cell invasion, associated with a loss of the apical polar ring and conoid and loss of integrity of the apical complex in mature parasites. This study provides a substantial advancement to our understanding of the complex architecture of apical structures in Toxoplasma.</p><p>All reviewers agree that this is a very elegant study and that no additional experimental work is required.

The coccidian parasites of Apicomplexa group possess conoid made of unique tubulin polymer fibres as part of apical complex and used by parasite for invasion, motility and egress. The authors have demonstrated for first time the use of U.ExM in any Apicomplexan parasite in precisely studying the apical polarity and conoid assembly of the Toxoplasma parasites. They have shown the function of two protein named Apical Protein AC9 and 10 and how they are involved in conoid assembly both in intracellular and extracellular parasite.

In contrast to the mature mother parasite that faces the external milieu, the daughter cells in the cytosol of the mother cells and hence the mechanical forces applied to the growing SPMTs cytoskeleton is presumably reduced compared to tension imposed on the SPMTs of the mature parasite in order to maintain the shape and cope with the osmotic pressure.</p><p>In our view the most plausible, possibly naïve, explanation, is that at the time when the daughter cells emerge from the mother cell, the tension imposed on the SPMTs leads to their disassembly and consequently to the loss of APR and conoid. We are presenting this speculative model more explicitly in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show that a short treatment with IAA is sufficient to completely degrade AC9 and AC10 in AID parasites.

The intrinsic half-life (turnover) of a protein is not easily predictable and many structural proteins are known to be very dynamics. The AiD system is vastly accelerating this turnover. The subcellular localization of a given protein and its access to proteasome is also likely to significantly influence the speed of degradation. Among the many proteins that we have studied via mAID degron system in the laboratory, we have been astonished to observe overall very rapid kinetics of degradation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 6, the authors show that IAA treatment of extracellular mature parasites, although leading to degradation of AC9/AC10, preserves the conoid integrity and microneme secretion.

Noteworthy either wild type or AC9-mAID parasites maintained extracellularly for 2 to 8 hours are anticipated to gradually and considerably lose their ability to glide and to invade host cells. The presence of the conoid and all the apical proteins as well as the ability to secrete of microneme presumably indicates that the parasites are motile and invasive. However, given the drop in microneme secretion we anticipate a significant decrease in motility and invasion both in presence and in absence of IAA! Regarding the SPTMs arrangement, it turns out to be too challenging to treat extracellular parasites for 8h while keeping them fresh enough to perform U-ExM.</p><p>These complementary data would be valuable but not essential to the conclusions.

The conoid as well as the SPMTs are formed normally in the daughter cells of AC9 and AC10 depleted parasites (see Figure 7C middle panels). We suspect that the SPMTs need to be tightly associated to the alveolin network to maintain the apical polar in place (APR) in place.
