However, certain individuals who initially achieve viral suppression to undetectable levels may eventually suffer treatment failure mainly due to adverse effects and the emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants. Here, we report GRL-142, a novel HIV-1 protease inhibitor containing an unprecedented 6-5-5-ring-fused crown-like tetrahydropyranofuran, which has extremely potent activity against all HIV-1 strains examined with IC<sub>50</sub> values of attomolar-to-picomolar concentrations, virtually no effects on cellular growth, extremely high genetic barrier against the emergence of drug-resistant variants, and favorable intracellular and central nervous system penetration. GRL-142 forms optimum polar, van der Waals, and halogen bond interactions with HIV-1 protease and strongly blocks protease dimerization, demonstrating that combined multiple optimizing elements significantly enhance molecular and atomic interactions with a target protein and generate unprecedentedly potent and practically favorable agents.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>drug-resistant HIV-1</kwd><kwd>protease inhibitor</kwd><kwd>CNS penetration</kwd><kwd>GRL-142</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yarchoan</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><name><surname>Ghosh</surname><given-names>Arun K</given-names></name><name><surname>Mitsuya</surname><given-names>Hiroaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitsuya</surname><given-names>Hiroaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitsuya</surname><given-names>Hiroaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Center for Global Health and Medicine Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitsuya</surname><given-names>Hiroaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>GRL-142 is an HIV protease inhibitor with a unique structure and atto-to-picomolar potency against a wide range of HIV strains.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Presently available combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) potently suppresses the replication of HIV-1 and significantly extends the life expectancy of HIV-1-infected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Samji et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marcus et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, mortality rates for HIV-1-infected individuals who are treated before they have substantial immunologic damage have become close to that of general population and cART has been shown to reduce sexual transmission of HIV-1 by 93–96% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, at the end of 2015, ~36.7 million people were living with HIV-1 infection, and 2.1 million people were newly infected and 1.7 million people lost their lives only in 2015 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/global-AIDS-update-2016_en.pdf">http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/global-AIDS-update-2016_en.pdf</ext-link>). However, the cure of HIV-1 infection or AIDS is still elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deeks et al., 2016</xref>) and moreover, our ability to provide effective long-term cART remains a complex issue, since many of those who initially achieve favorable viral suppression to undetectable levels eventually suffer treatment failure. Nevertheless, in regard to the propensity of HIV-1 to develop resistance to antiretroviral agents, protease inhibitors (PIs) generally have high genetic barrier against resistance. In particular, the latest U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved PI, darunavir (DRV), the only PI recommended for first line therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents, 2016</xref>), has a favorable genetic barrier apparently because of its dual mechanism of action: (i) protease enzymatic inhibition activity and (ii) protease dimerization inhibition activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayashi et al., 2014</xref>), and currently represents the most widely used PI for treating HIV-1-infected individuals. Nevertheless, the emergence of DRV-resistant HIV-1 variants has been reported both in vitro and in vivo, and patients with such DRV-resistant HIV-1 variants may experience treatment failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitsuya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Meyer et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, 12–21% of individuals receiving DRV-containing regimens discontinue the treatment due to adverse events, mainly diarrhea and virological failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clotet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Madruga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ortiz et al., 2008</xref>). An alternative PI, atazanavir (ATV), also frequently causes indirect hyperbilirubinemia(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lennox et al., 2014</xref>). Dolutegravir (DTG), an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), is also widely used and recommended in the therapy of HIV-1 infection. However, serious adverse events such as gastrointestinal disorders have been seen in as high as 11% of individuals receiving DTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clotet et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, cART has less benefit in patients with progressive neuropsychological impairment such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), which occur in 40–83% HIV-1-infected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heaton et al., 2010</xref>), and these patients are less likely to achieve long-term virologic suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tozzi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saylor et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, novel antiretrovirals with more potent activity, greater specificity to HIV-1 and tolerability, higher genetic barrier to the emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants, and central nervous system (CNS)-penetration capability are required.</p><p>In the present study, we report a newly generated, two fluorine atoms-containing novel HIV-1 protease inhibitor, GRL-142, which has unprecedentedly potent activity against a wide range of HIV-1 variants with IC<sub>50</sub> values of attomolar to subnanomolar concentrations, extremely high genetic barrier against the emergence of resistance variants, and favorable CNS-penetration capability.

However, GRL-139 failed to block the replication of three highly DRV-resistant HIV-1 variants (HIV<sub>DRV</sub><sup>R</sup>s) that were selected by propagating in the presence of increasing concentrations of DRV and are highly resistant to all presently clinically available PIs including DRV and nucleos(t)ide-reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) such as tenofovir (TDF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoki et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). By contrast, GRL-036 also resembles DRV but has the Cp-Abt moiety and shows an improved anti-HIV-1 profile, more effectively blocking the replication of HIV<sub>DRV</sub><sup>R</sup>s than DRV (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghosh et al., 2017</xref>).

GRL-121 more potently suppressed the replication of all three HIV<sub>DRV</sub><sup>R</sup>s. Interestingly, the addition of two fluorine atoms to GRL-121, generating GRL-142 further strengthened the activity against cHIV<sub>NL4-3</sub><sup>WT</sup> achieving an IC<sub>50</sub> value as low as 0.019 nM compared to the 9 FDA-approved PIs of which IC<sub>50</sub>s range from 3.2 to 330 nM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

Most of the seven variants were significantly less susceptible to two PIs, lopinavir (LPV) and ATV (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), that have presently been relatively well used in clinics. DRV also failed to effectively block most of the seven variants with IC<sub>50</sub> value fold-differences ranging from 2- to 86-fold. However, GRL-121 showed extremely potent activity against all the seven variants examined, presenting IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging 0.0018 to 0.13 nM. The activity of GRL-121 against all the seven variants was significantly more potent than that against cHIV<sub>NL4-3</sub><sup>WT</sup>. Surprisingly, GRL-142 showed even more potent activity against the seven variants with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.0000019 nM (1.9 fM) to 0.015 nM. The activity of GRL-142 against the variants was also significantly more potent than that against cHIV<sub>NL4-3</sub><sup>WT</sup>.

In an attempt to elucidate the dynamics of HIV-1 PR dimerization and the mechanisms of the emergence of HIV-1 resistance against certain PR inhibitors (PIs), we developed an intermolecular FRET-based HIV-1 expression assay system using CYP- and YFP-tagged PR monomers. Using this FRET-based HIV-1 expression assay system, we have previously identified nonpeptidyl small-molecule inhibitors of HIV-1 PR dimerization, including DRV(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2012</xref>). Various plasmids encoding full-length molecular infectious HIV-1 (HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub>) clones producing CFP- or YFP-tagged PR using the PCR-mediated recombination method were prepared. A linker consisting of five alanines was inserted between PR and fluorescent protein. A phenylalanine-proline site (F/P) that HIV-1 PR cleaves was also introduced between the fluorescent protein and reverse transcriptase.

After 72 hr, cultured cells were examined in the FRET-based HIV-1 expression assay and the CFP<sup>A/B</sup> ratios (Y axis) were determined. The arithmetic mean values of the ratios obtained are shown as horizontal bars. A CFP<sup>A/B</sup> ratio that is greater than one signifies that protease dimerization occurred, whereas a ratio that is less than one signifies that the disruption of protease dimerization occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2012</xref>).

Note that the thermal stability curves with GRL-142 significantly shifted to the higher temperature (to the right) than those with no agent, SQV, or DRV. The Tm values with GRL-142 were much higher than those with no agent, SQV, or DRV. The thermal stability curves of human renin and lysozyme did not shift at all with GRL-142 as compared with those with no agent, indicating highly specific binding of GRL-142 to PR<sup>D25N</sup> and TFR-PR<sup>D25N-7AA-His6</sup>.

DRV binds in the proximity of the active site interface of PR and blocks PR subunits dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayashi et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether GRL-142 binds to monomer subunits using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the ESI-MS spectra of PR containing D25N substitution (PR<sup>D25N</sup>), which was folded in the presence of drugs revealed five peaks of differently charged ions in the range of mass/charge ratio (<italic>m/z</italic>) of 1,500–2,900. Since +5 charged monomer ions and +10 charged dimer ions have the same <italic>m/z</italic> (<italic>m/z</italic> = 2164.75 for PR<sup>D25N</sup>), the greatest peak detected at <italic>m/z</italic> 2164.75 was determined to represent two forms, a PR monomer and PR dimer. Thus, the five peaks represent a monomer, two dimers, and two monomer+dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>-top panel). When unfolded PR<sup>D25N</sup> was re-folded in the presence of DRV, six additional significant peaks appeared, three for monomer+DRV, and three for dimer+DRV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>-middle panel). When the same PR<sup>D25N</sup> was re-folded in the presence of GRL-142, six significant peaks appeared, representing three for monomer+GRL-142, and three for dimer+GRL-142 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>-bottom panel). Each of the six additional peaks seen with GRL-142 appeared greater than those seen with DRV. When compared with the heights of the dimer+monomer peak rendered 1.0, the average height of the three peaks of DRV-bound monomers and that of the three peaks of GRL-142-bound monomers were 0.046 and 0.312, respectively; and the average height of the three peaks with DRV-bound dimers and that of the three peaks with GRL-142-bound dimers were 0.060 and 0.188, respectively. These data suggest that GRL-142 more tightly bound to monomers by 6.78-fold and to dimers by 3.13-fold than DRV and at least in part explain the reason GRL-142 much more strongly blocked PR dimerization than DRV.</p><p>We also examined the thermal stability of PR<sup>D25N</sup> in the presence of saquinavir (SQV), DRV, or GRL-142, using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, the T<sub>m</sub> value of PR<sup>D25N</sup> alone was 54.92˚C, while in the presence of SQV and DRV, the values increased to 58.14˚C and 58.21˚C, respectively, suggesting that the thermal stability of PR<sup>D25N</sup> increased when SQV and DRV bound to PR<sup>D25N</sup>. However, in the presence of GRL-142, the T<sub>m</sub> value of PR<sup>D25N</sup> turned out to be substantially high at 65.65˚C and the difference in T<sub>m</sub> values between PR<sup>D25N</sup> alone and GRL-142-bound PR<sup>D25N</sup> reached as high as 10.73˚C, suggesting that GRL-142 more strongly binds to PR<sup>D25N</sup> than SQV or DRV. When we asked whether DRV and GRL-142 bound to TFR-PR<sup>D25N-7AA-His6</sup>, a His-tagged transframe precursor form of PR<sup>D25N</sup> that contains seven N terminus amino acids of reverse transcriptase (7AA; PISPIET), both DRV and GRL-142 clearly bound to TFR-PR<sup>D25N-7AA-His6</sup>, although the binding of GRL-142 (52.07˚C) appeared to be significantly greater than that of DRV (43.30˚C). Considering that GRL-142 much more strongly binds to PR monomer subunits than DRV, as in the case of DRV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayashi et al., 2014</xref>), GRL-142’s monomer binding should be involved in the Gag-Pol auto-processing inhibition and even more effective than that of DRV.</p><p>It is known that fluorination increases lipophilicity because the carbon-fluorine bond is more hydrophobic than the carbon-hydrogen bond, often enhancing cell membrane penetration and oral bioavailability of the compounds containing carbon-fluorine bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Böhm et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, we also determined intracellular concentrations of GRL-142 after incubating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the presence of GRL-142 for 60 min. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, intracellular concentrations of GRL-142 were significantly higher than those of DRV as examined under the same conditions. Achieving such high intracellular concentrations of GRL-142, together with the effective inhibition of PR dimerization, likely contributes to the unprecedentedly potent activity of GRL-142 against HIV-1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Structural analysis of GRL-142</title><p>We determined the structural interactions of GRL-142 with wild-type HIV-1 protease (PR<sup>WT</sup>) using X-ray crystallography.

The vdW energy of interactions between DRV and protease is −57.8 kcal/mol. GRL-142 has much better vdW interactions with protease as demonstrated by its lower interaction energy of −67.5 kcal/mol. The improved vdW interaction energy of ~10 kcal/mol may partly explain the much superior antiviral activity of GRL-142 compared to that of DRV. We also analyzed the vdW interaction energy with selected active site residues. GRL-142 has better interactions with Asp29/Asp29ʹ and Asp30/Asp30ʹ by ~3 kcal/mol. Interaction with these aspartates are important for the improved potency of PIs.

The crystal structure indicates that fluorine substitution causes very favorable halogen interactions within the S1-pocket of PR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The high electronegativity of fluorine (3.98) <italic>versus</italic> hydrogen (2.20) leads to highly polarized halogen bond interactions with the backbone (F···H-C and F···C = O) of the G49 and I50, respectively.

Overall, the two fluorine atoms establish a halogen bond bridge within the S1-pocket by interacting with residues of both subunits of PR<sup>WT</sup>. Moreover, direct interactions of GRL-142 with both R8’ and I50 highly likely contribute significant additional polar interactions compared to other PIs. R8’ and the PR’s flap residues are associated with PR structure, functions, dynamics, substrate binding, and activity of PIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamazaki et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>We also compared the differences in vdW contacts of GRL-142 with V32I amino acid substitution, a key substitution for HIV-1’s acquisition of PI-resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoki et al., 2015</xref>).

Our simulations showed that I32 and I32ʹ have an improved vdW interaction energy (~1 kcal/mol) with GRL-142 compared to V32 and V32ʹ.

By contrast, when GRL-142 was perorally administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg together with RTV (8.33 mg/kg), the C<sub>max</sub> was achieved around 360 min after the PO administration. Plasma samples collected 60 and 360 min after the PO administration contained 0.189 µM and 0.974 µM GRL-142, respectively. Although CSF samples contained below detection levels (&lt;0.000141 µM), brain contained 0.00724 µM and 0.0326 µM in 60 and 360 min, respectively. Since the IC<sub>50</sub> and IC<sub>95</sub> values of GRL-142 were ~19 pM and 0.28 nM, GRL-142 concentrations in brain are calculated to be ~1,882 fold greater than the IC<sub>50</sub> value of GRL-142 and ~114 fold greater than IC<sub>95</sub> of GRL-142, while ~562 fold lower than the CC<sub>50 </sub>value of GRL-142. These data strongly suggest that GRL-142 would potently block the infection and replication of HIV-1 in brain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>GRL-142 should potentially serve as a most powerful agent in constructing future cART and overcome the issue of HIV-1’s drug-resistance. Moreover, since highly potent new drugs such as the INSTIs and potent PIs (e.g., DRV) became available, the design of suppressive ‘salvage’ regimens has been possible for treating heavily antiretroviral therapy-experienced patients harboring multi-drug-resistant HIV-1 variants. However, such ‘salvage’ regimens yet remain challenging with high pill burden, high cost, more adverse effects, and greater risk of nonadherence, leading to virologic failure and viral acquisition of resistance. Thus, simplified antiretroviral regimens such as once-daily 2-tablet combination have been proposed. Indeed, one of such simplified regimens (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide plus DRV) has resulted in durable maintenance of virologic suppression, greater adherence and improved quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huhn et al., 2017</xref>). We posit that GRL-142, with its extremely high genetic barrier against the emergence of resistant HIV-1 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), would serve as a most favorable member of such simplified regimens. GRL-142 might also be used even for monotherapy, a possibly acceptable alternative for long-term clinical management of HIV-1 infection, although cautious and deliberate viral load monitoring and prompt reintroduction of cART as needed should be carried out.</p><p>The unprecedentedly potent antiviral activity of GRL-142 (picomolar to attomolar ranges) against a variety of HIV-1s including highly PI- and NRTI-resistant variants apparently results from markedly increased polar and non-polar interactions of the two novel moieties (<italic>Crn-</italic>THF and Cp-Abt) with critical amino acids of PR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>), extensive halogen bonding networks established by two fluorines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and highly potent inhibition of PR dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). It also appears that the presence of two fluorines results in the increased cell membrane permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which probably contributes to the potent activity of GRL-142. The V32I substitution closely associated with HIV-1 resistance to a variety of PIs further increased vdW contacts with PR<sup>32I</sup> than with PR<sup>V32</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), strongly suggesting that GRL-142 effectively fills the active site cavity of mutated PR and exerts potent activity against various PI-resistant HIV-1 variants. This feature is likely associated with the observation that GRL-142 hardly allows HIV-1 to acquire resistance to GRL-142 under selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, with the favorable CNS penetration capability combined with its potent activity, GRL-142 achieved ~1882 fold greater concentration than its IC<sub>50</sub> and ~114 fold greater concentration than its IC<sub>95</sub> in rat brain, strongly suggesting that GRL-142 would potently block the infectivity and replication of HIV-1 in brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), although the efficacy of GRL-142 on the HIV-1-associated CNS abnormalities has to be examined in controlled clinical studies.

To determine whether each compound exerted HIV-1 protease dimerization, test compounds were added to the culture medium simultaneously with plasmid transfection.

Hydrogen atoms were added using the protein preparation wizard via Maestro (Ver. 10.5.014, Schrodinger LLC, New York, NY). The orientations of added hydrogen atoms were optimized by sampling the orientations of the solvent molecules at pH 7.0 using PROPKA. Hydrogen bonds were calculated using a maximum distance cutoff value of 3.0 Å between the donor and acceptor heavy atoms with minimum angles being 90° (donor) and 60° (acceptor). Hydrophobic contacts were calculated between two carbon atoms (one from the PI and one from PR<sup>WT</sup>) with a maximum 4 Å distance cutoff. The van der Waals contact, C is defined as D12 / (R1 +R2) where D12 is the distance between atomic centers 1 and 2; R1, R2 are the van der Waals radii of atomic centers 1 and 2. C has a value between 0.89 and 1.30 for favorable contacts. To calculate the average van der Waals interaction energy, a 1.2 ns molecular dynamics simulation of GRL-142 or DRV in complex with HIV-1 protease was carried out in explicit water with OPLS3 force field, and the trajectories were analyzed.

Then the Tween-20 was added to the refolded PR solution (0.01% Tween-20) and the solution was concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 10K centrifugal filter units (Millipore). In conducting DSF analysis, the final concentration of each PR used was 10 μM (dimer) and the final compound concentration used was 50 μM. Recombinant human renin was purchased from ProSpec-Tany Technogenic (Ness-Ziona, Israel). Lysozyme was purchased from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA). The final concentration of human renin and lysozyme were 5 μM, respectively. In the experiment, 20 mM compound solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were used as stock solutions. The final buffer used contained 100 mM ammonium acetate pH 5.0, 0.01% Tween-20, SYPRO Orange (5X)(Life Technologies) and 2.5% DMSO with 50 mM sodium chloride for TFR-PR<sup>D25N-7AA-His6</sup>, Human Renin, and Lysozyme or without 50 mM sodium chloride for PR<sup>D25N</sup>.

The MS spectra of PR<sup>D25N</sup> with or without compound were obtained using a Bio-Tof-Q electrospray ionization (ESI) quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). Each sample solution was introduced to the Bio-Tof-Q through an infusion pump at a flow rate of 8 μL/min. Measurement conditions were as follows: dry N<sub>2</sub> gas temperature, 100°C; ESI, positive mode; capillary voltage, 3500 V; voltages of capillary exit and skimmer, 80 V and 45 V, respectively.

The flow rate was set to 0.5 ml min<sup>−1</sup>, and the column was equilibrated with 95% solvent A and 5% solvent B. Following each injection, solvent B was increased to 55% over a 20 min period (2.5% increase per min). At 21 min solvent B was increased to 95% in 1 min and then returned to starting conditions over the next 1 min. Each compound was detected by TOF-MS using an Agilent 6230 mass spectrometer in selective ion monitoring mode. The sodium adducts of each compound provided the most prominent peak and therefore were used for detection purposes although the parent ions provided the relative results. The amount of compound obtained in the extracts was determined by comparison to standards of each purified compound dissolved in DMSO.

In the examination of CNS-penetration capability of GRL-142, male Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc. For oral injection, test compounds were dissolved in 50% propylene glycol (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and 17% (v/v) DMSO. Prepared solutions containing GRL-142 (5 mg/kg) plus RTV (8.33 mg/kg) or DRV (5 mg/kg) plus RTV (8.33 mg/kg) were perorally administered to four rats. Plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain were collected from each rat at indicated time points following the drug administration. Whole brains excised out were carefully washed with PBS and then wiped with filter paper to minimize blood contamination until blood was not visually seen and stored at −80°C until analyzed. Plasma and CSF samples were also stored at −80°C until use.</p><p>GRL-142 or DRV was extracted from the plasma, CSF, and brain samples by a solid-phase extraction method using Oasis MCX µElution plates (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). GRL-142 calibration standards ranging from 0.1 to 100 ng/mL were prepared using standard solutions with rat blank plasma, CSF, and brain. Linearity of the calibration curves were defined by the following formulae: Accuracy (%)=Mean measured value/Nominal value ×100; Precision (%)=Standard deviation/Mean measured value ×100. Acceptable criteria of the accuracy were set up to be within 100 ± 15% and the precision 15% or below. Saquinavir mesylate (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., Toronto Canada) was used as an internal standard (IS).</p><p>Chromatographic separation of GRL-142 from the plasma, CSF, and brain samples was performed using Acquity Ultra Performance LC (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) and an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 × 5.0 mm, 1.7 μm) maintained at 40°C. Mobile phases A and B consisted of 10 mM ammonium formate aqueous solution and acetonitrile, respectively. Separation was performed using gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. Quantitation of each compound was conducted by selected reaction monitoring on a API5000 mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA) with electrospray ionization in the positive mode. The optimized electrospray ionization parameters were as follows: ion source temperature, 650°C; curtain gas, setting 10; nebulizing gas (GS1), setting 40; heater gas (GS2), setting 50; ion spray voltage, 5500 V. The selected reaction monitoring transitions were m/z 707 to 253 for GRL-142, m/z 548 to 392 for DRV, and m/z 672 to 570 for IS. The dwell time was 150 ms for each transition channel.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wes Sundquist as Reviewing Editor and by Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Tomas Cihlar (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The submitted manuscript is focused on novel modifications of HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) and represents a very significant advancement in the design of highly potent compounds, particularly in case of GRL-142, which is the most potent PI reported to date. The described compounds are derivatives of darunavir (DRV) with unique modifications in P1, P2, and/or P2' positions that confer exquisite antiviral potency in vitro against HIV. In addition, high lipophilicity of these compounds may allow for improved penetration across blood-brain barrier. The inhibitor also retains high level activity against highly drug resistant variants of HIV-1 protease that exhibit high levels of resistance to DRV. It should also be taken into account, however, that multiple aspects of pharmacological profiling of these novel compounds remain to be assessed, and their full potential for further development towards products useful for the treatment of HIV infection therefore remains to be determined.</p><p>The following issues need to be addressed prior to publication:</p><p>1) The authors have recently published 3 of the compounds (GRL-036 (compound 27), GRL-139 (compound 4) and GRL-121 (compound 5)) presented in this manuscript with the &quot;Crown-Like Oxotricyclic Core&quot; in J Med Chem 2017 60, 4267-4278. Antiviral data against many of the same variants was presented as were crystal structures including 5TYR. This paper is not referenced at all – and must have been at least &quot;in press&quot; when this manuscript was submitted.</p><p>2) Although the title claims that these inhibitors are aM (10-18) in potency, it is unclear whether measurements of this level of potency are actually possible. Curves showing how many points are measured in the inflection to determine such high potency seem essential. The errors are of similar magnitude as the values and many single site mutations appear to have orders of magnitude higher potency than the wildtype (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>3) Abstract: The claim that current HIV therapies are not well tolerated and cause a lot of resistance needs to be changed because it is not accurate.</p><p>4) Subsection “Identification of GRL-142, an unprecedentedly potent HIV-1 protease inhibitor”, second paragraph and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>: The high potency of GRL-142 against DRV-resistant HIV-1 variants is very encouraging. However, the authors should acknowledge that these viruses are still substantially less sensitive to GRL-142 (up to 63-fold) than the wild-type virus, indicating considerable resistance shift.</p><p>5) Inhibition of dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is unclear as to whether the differences are statistically significant. Also in terms of the anti-viral activity – how could the subtle difference in potential dimerization inhibition – experiments performed in the high μM concentration range – have a tangible impact on the antiviral activity? What was the control experiment to eliminate a possibility of GRL-142 quenching the dimerization-dependent FRET signal rather than truly inhibiting the dimerization? In addition, what is the potency of GRL-142 on inhibiting the enzymatic activity of PR relative to the inhibition of dimerization? Finally, please also explicitly list the variants used in the antiviral assays.</p><p>6) Analysis of contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) as &quot;numbers of contacts&quot; is a very qualitative measure of packing, better would be to calculate the van der Waals energies. The figures in J Med Chem paper were much better representations of the packing and what residues are potentially contributing to affinity. Along similar lines it would be very useful to know which of the residues that evolve in the viral selection are packing against the inhibitor or are remote from the active site?</p><p>7) Subsection “Identification of GRL-142, an unprecedentedly potent HIV-1 protease inhibitor”, last paragraph and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>: What is the explanation for the extreme hypersensitivity of some of the single residue mutant viruses to GRL-142 (e.g., V32I, G48V, and I50V)? This hypersensitivity reaches up to 1,000,000-fold relative to wild-type HIV-1, and such single mutation hypersensitivity seems unprecedented, especially in the case of I50V, which is one of the primary resistance mutations for DRV. This observation raises questions about the activities of the activity measurements.</p><p>8) Subsection “CNS penetration of GRL-142 in rats”: High resistance barrier for GRL-142. While the authors described the genotypic analysis of viruses propagated in the presence of increasing concentrations of GRL-142 (i.e., HIV-DRV-R-P30-142-W36 and rCL<sup>-</sup>HIV-T48-142-W36), no data are presented on the phenotypic sensitivity of these viruses that can propagate in the presence of increasing GRL-142 concentrations. While the authors argue these concentrations were not numerically very high, they still exceeded the IC<sub>50</sub> values by &gt;100fold in some cases. Thus these selected variants should be analyzed for GRL-142 susceptibility shift.</p><p>9) Subsection “CNS penetration of GRL-142 in rats”, CNS penetration: &quot;The plasma concentrations of DRV were much greater than the IC<sub>50</sub> value (~3.2 μM)&quot; This is probably a typo in concentration unit as the IC<sub>50</sub> of DRV is in low nM, not μM range? How do the authors explain undetectable levels of GRL-142 in CSF, yet accumulation in brain? This is rather unexpected since there should be equilibrium between CSF and brain tissue similar to the equilibrium between plasma and PBMCs or lymphoid tissue. Is it possible that the highly lipophilic nature of GRL-142 results in accumulation of the molecule in brain lipid fraction and not the free unbound fraction, making the compound not available to inhibit HIV replication in brain?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28020.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The following issues need to be addressed prior to publication:</p><p>1) The authors have recently published 3 of the compounds (GRL-036 (compound 27), GRL-139 (compound 4) and GRL-121 (compound 5)) presented in this manuscript with the &quot;Crown-Like Oxotricyclic Core&quot; in J Med Chem 2017 60, 4267-4278.

The finalization of the present paper for us to submit for publication took much longer than we anticipated.

A large number of serial dilution causes variability of data due to (i) the adsorption of the compound to the walls of plastic pipets and the plastic surface of microtiter culture plate wells, where serial dilution was directly performed, resulting in the relative loss of the compound adsorbed to the wells and (ii) the carry-over of the compound adsorbed to the walls of pipets to the next microtiter culture plate wells, which could result in the increased delivery of the compound to the next microtiter culture wells. We do not encounter such inherent problems when we handle less potent compounds such as darunavir with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of ~3 nM. Thus, in the initial version of the manuscript, we provided the method of dilution in detail.

Also in terms of the anti-viral activity – how could the subtle difference in potential dimerization inhibition – experiments performed in the high μM concentration range – have a tangible impact on the antiviral activity? What was the control experiment to eliminate a possibility of GRL-142 quenching the dimerization-dependent FRET signal rather than truly inhibiting the dimerization? In addition, what is the potency of GRL-142 on inhibiting the enzymatic activity of PR relative to the inhibition of dimerization?

As can be seen, the CFP<sup>A/B</sup> ratios in the presence of 0.1 nM GRL-142 were less than 1.0 (p=0.0585) than in the absence of the compound. The p values of the difference between the ratios in the presence of 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 nM compared to those in the absence of GRL-142 were 0.0145, 0.0042, 0.0056, and 0.0019, respectively. We have described these statistics in the Results section of the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>ii) Impact of the PR dimerization inhibition on GRL-142’s potent anti-HIV-1 activity.</p><p>GRL-142 inhibited HIV-1 protease (PR) dimerization at 0.1 nM and greater concentrations (Please note that the unit is nM, <italic>not</italic> µM: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which is close to GRL-142’s IC<sub>50</sub> value (0.017 nM) determined in the cell-based HIV-1 replication inhibition assays. However, we cannot directly compare those values since the numbers of the target PR molecules in COS7 are thought to be different from those in the target MT-4 cells exposed to HIV-1. In the FRET-HIV-1 expression assay, the cells are transfected with plasmids encoding an entire length of HIV-1 and the virions are transiently expressed/produced over just ~3 days of the culture following the transfection. In contrast, in the cell-based assays, the target MT-4 cells exposed to HIV-1 continue to express/produce virions over the entire 7-day period of the culture. Nevertheless, the potent PR dimerization inhibition of GRL-142 is thought to explain at least in part the mechanism of the potent anti-HIV-1 activity of GRL-142. We have described this issue in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>iii) Control in the FRET-HIV-1 expression assay.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that two PR inhibitors, darunavir (DRV) and tipranavir (TPV), block PR dimerization in the FRET-HIV-1 expression assay (Koh and Mitsuya et al. JBC 2007 and Aoki and Mitsuya et al. JV 2012). Although we have no particular assay system to ask whether PR inhibitors such as DRV and GRL-142 quench the dimerization-dependent FRET signals, we have previously shown that when an HIV<sub>DRV</sub><sup>R</sup><sub>P51</sub>-derived HIV-1 clone containing 14 amino acid substitutions (L10I, I15V, K20R, L24I, V32I, L33F, M36I, M46L, I54M, L63P, K70Q, V82I, I84V, and L89M) was employed in the FRET-HIV-1 expression assay instead of HIV<sub>NL4-3</sub>, even a relatively high concentration of DRV (100 nM) allowed the occurrence of FRET (Koh JV 2011), strongly suggesting that 100 nM DRV does not quench the FRET signals. Also, other “conventional” PIs (that have no detectable dimerization inhibition) such as saquinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and atazanavir at high concentrations (1 and 10 µM) allowed the occurrence of FRET (Koh and Mitsuya et al. JBC 2007), suggesting there was no quenching. However, the FRET-HIV-1 expression system offers only qualitative (<italic>not</italic> quantitative) analysis. Thus, we also asked if DRV directly blocks PR dimerization using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and demonstrated that DRV binds to PR monomers in a one-to-one molar ratio, inhibiting the first step of PR dimerization, whereas conventional protease inhibitors (such as saquinavir) inhibits enzymatic activity but not dimerization and fails to bind to monomers (Hayashi and Mitsuya et al. PNAS 2014). In the present manuscript, we demonstrate that GRL-142 more tightly binds to PR monomers than DRV, corroborating that GRL-142 truly blocks PR dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>iv) The potency of GRL-142 on inhibiting the enzymatic activity of PR relative to the inhibition of dimerization?</p><p>As we stated in our response to reviewer’s comment 5 (ii) above, the intensity of PR dimerization inhibition is determined using COS7 cells that are transfected with plasmids encoding an entire length of HIV-1 and the virions are transiently expressed/produced in the cytoplasm over ~3 days of the culture following the transfection in the presence or absence of PIs. In contrast, enzymatic inhibition is determined using a solution of purified protease. Thus, it is difficult to stoichiometrically compare the data generated in two different assays. However, it should be certainly adequate to compare the potency levels of dimerization inhibition by DRV and GRL-142. At this time, HIV-1 PR dimerization inhibitors such as DRV, TPV, and GRL-142 also inhibit HIV-1 PR enzymatic activity. If we get HIV-1 PR dimerization inhibitors that do not have PR enzyme inhibition activity, we should be able to more precisely determine the impact of PR dimerization inhibition activity on anti-HIV-1 activity relative to the impact of PR enzyme inhibition activity.</p><p>v) Explicitly list the variants used in the antiviral assays.</p><p>As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have provided a list of viruses used in antiviral assay as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Analysis of contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) as &quot;numbers of contacts&quot; is a very qualitative measure of packing, better would be to calculate the van der Waals energies.

This hypersensitivity reaches up to 1,000,000-fold relative to wild-type HIV-1, and such single mutation hypersensitivity seems unprecedented, especially in the case of I50V, which is one of the primary resistance mutations for DRV. This observation raises questions about the activities of the activity measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>As we stated above in our response to reviewer’s comment 2, we have added the HIV-1 replication inhibition titration curves of DRV, GRL-121, and GRL-142 against cHIV<sub>NL4-3</sub><sup>WT</sup>, cHIV<sub>NL4-3</sub><sup>V32I</sup>, cHIV<sub>NL4-3</sub><sup>G48V</sup>, cHIV<sub>NL4-3</sub><sup>I50V</sup>, and cHIV<sub>NL4-3</sub><sup>V82T</sup> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> of the revised version of the manuscript, where one can see that GRL-142’s HIV-1 titration curves against cHIV<sub>NL4-3</sub><sup>V32I</sup>, cHIV<sub>NL4-3</sub><sup>G48V</sup>, and cHIV<sub>NL4-3</sub><sup>I50V</sup> show GRL-142’s significantly greater antiviral activity against those HIV-1 variants than against cHIV<sub>NL4-3</sub><sup>WT</sup>.

The van der Waals (vdW) interaction energy between GRL-142 and Ile32 is lower by 1.1 kcal/mol compared to the corresponding interaction with Val32. This feature should explain at least in part the potent antiviral activity of GRL-142 against cHIV<sub>NL4-3</sub><sup>V32I</sup>. Of note, substitution of an amino acid in PR may alter interactions not only between the substituted amino acid and a compound but also between amino acids around the substituted amino acid and the compound (Liu, J Mol Biol, 2008; Mittal, J Virol, 2013) and further quantitative analyses remain to be conducted for such binding energy alterations, which is the topic for future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection “CNS penetration of GRL-142 in rats”: High resistance barrier for GRL-142.

How do the authors explain undetectable levels of GRL-142 in CSF, yet accumulation in brain? This is rather unexpected since there should be equilibrium between CSF and brain tissue similar to the equilibrium between plasma and PBMCs or lymphoid tissue. Is it possible that the highly lipophilic nature of GRL-142 results in accumulation of the molecule in brain lipid fraction and not the free unbound fraction, making the compound not available to inhibit HIV replication in brain?</p></disp-quote><p>We regret that the unit µM was a typographic error and corrected to nM in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the undetectable levels of GRL-142 in CSF, two rats were sacrificed each at 60 and 360 minutes after GRL-142 oral administration and GRL-142 concentrations in plasma, CSF, and brain (after irrigation) were determined. Of note, based on our PK study, we chose 60 and 360 minute time points as the early rise phase and plasma peak phase, respectively. It is possible that at an early time point in 60 minutes, GRL-142 might not have reached the equilibrium between CSF and brain tissues. Indeed, in 360 minutes following oral administration relatively good GR-142 concentrations are seen in CSF. Yet the concentrations in brain were generally higher than in CSF. In this regard, as the reviewer mentioned, it is possible that because of the lipophilic feature of GRL-142, the compound might have accumulated in the lipid fraction of the brain. However, when we quantified the GRL-142 amounts in body’s fat tissues of the same rats sacrificed in 360 minutes after oral administration, no significant GRL-142 amount was present. Thus, the GRL-142 distribution features in the CNS remain to be studied further.</p></body></sub-article></article>
