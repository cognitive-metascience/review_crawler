Genetic mutations derived mainly from replication errors have been extensively studied. However, fundamental details of transcript errors, such as their rate, molecular spectrum, and functional effects, remain largely unknown. To globally identify transcript errors, we applied an adapted rolling-circle sequencing approach to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>, and <italic>Mesoplasma florum,</italic> revealing transcript-error rates 3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding genetic mutation rates. The majority of detected errors would result in amino-acid changes, if translated. With errors identified from 9929 loci, the molecular spectrum and distribution of errors were uncovered in great detail. A G→A substitution bias was observed in <italic>M. florum</italic>, which apparently has an error-prone RNA polymerase. Surprisingly, an increased frequency of nonsense errors towards the 3′ end of mRNAs was observed, suggesting a Nonsense-Mediated Decay-like quality-control mechanism in prokaryotes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most cells contain molecules of DNA that carry instructions to make the proteins cells need to perform different tasks.

Similar to genetic mutations, errors that arise when forming RNA transcripts may also alter the tasks a cell performs.

Li and Lynch also found that the transcripts contained more nonsense errors – that is, mutations which prematurely stop transcripts from being translated, resulting in shorter proteins – at the end of the RNA molecule than at the beginning or middle. It is possible that transcripts with errors at the beginning or the middle are more efficiently eliminated than those at the end, suggesting that bacteria have a quality-control mechanism for removing transcripts with premature stop sequences.</p><p>These findings suggest that at any one-time cells carry thousands of transcripts with inaccuracies in their sequence, which likely impact the tasks cells perform.

They can occur during ribonucleotide (rNTP) incorporations by RNA polymerases and/or via post-transcriptional modifications. Errors on RNA transcripts may directly cause dysfunctions due to the regulatory roles of small RNAs and the fate determination of mRNAs by RNA structural motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strathern et al., 2012</xref>). Such errors can also indirectly induce various effects at the protein level. Transcript errors can inactivate proteins and result in a loss-of-function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gordon et al., 2013</xref>). They can also indirectly give rise to misfolded proteins and induce proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gout et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vermulst et al., 2015</xref>). Errors on RNA transcripts may be causal factors leading to neuron degenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van Leeuwen et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Leeuwen et al., 1998b</xref>) and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saxowsky et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, transcript errors represent a significant potential mechanism influencing cellular integrity and fitness.</p><p>Reporter-construct assays have long been the major approach to evaluating the fidelity of RNA polymerases and identifying transcript errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blank et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bubunenko et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nesser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosenberger and Foskett, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenberger and Hilton, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shaw et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Springgate and Loeb, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strathern et al., 2012</xref>), but these methods focus only on individual loci and cannot identify errors without phenotypic marker effects. Conventional high-throughput sequencing approaches have been considered to identify transcript errors at a large scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Dijk et al., 2015</xref>). However, the challenge is to distinguish the real signal of transcript errors from noise produced by technical errors resulting during reverse transcription and sequencing. To circumvent this problem, a rolling-circle amplification-based sequencing (CirSeq) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acevedo and Andino, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acevedo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lou et al., 2013</xref>) was recently proposed and later applied to identify transcript errors in the whole transcriptome of prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Traverse and Ochman, 2016</xref>). We further modified this protocol to minimize RNA damage potentially introduced during the preparation of sequencing libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gout et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we applied an adapted CirSeq approach, which has been demonstrated to identify transcript errors accurately and efficiently at a large scale in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gout et al., 2017</xref>), to prokaryotes for the first time. A large number of transcript errors was detected, and transcript-error rates were revealed to be orders of magnitude higher than corresponding genetic mutation rates. Our results indicate that the bias in molecular spectra of transcript errors can be influenced by both RNA polymerases and cellular rNTP concentrations. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of transcript errors on RNAs provides novel insights into the mechanism of RNA quality-control in prokaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A global view of the transcript error distribution</title><p>Applying the adapted CirSeq method (see Materials and methods) to <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic>, and <italic>M. florum</italic>, RNA sequencing libraries were made with three biological replicates for each species.

Based on the circular genomes of bacteria (except for <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic>, which has one circular chromosome, one linear chromosome, and two plasmids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodner et al., 2001</xref>]), we annotated genomic positions of transcript errors with different potential functional effects and plotted transcript-error rates in 10 kb sliding windows (1 kb for <italic>M. florum</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To test whether transcript errors are randomly distributed across different genes, a previously proposed test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Long et al., 2016</xref>) was performed to identify genes enriched with transcript errors. For each gene, the expected number of transcript errors was calculated as the product of the average transcriptome-wide error rate per base and the sequencing coverage of the gene. The Poisson probability of observing a number of errors greater than or equal to the observed number was calculated. Out of 607, 495, 586, and 186 genes with detected transcript errors in <italic>E. coli, A. tumefaciens, B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>M. florum</italic>, respectively, 1, 4, 0 and 4 genes were revealed to have significantly larger numbers of errors than random expectations (Bonferroni-corrected <italic>P</italic> values of 0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Tables 2-5), suggesting that transcript errors are in general randomly distributed across genes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The distribution of transcript errors across the whole transcriptomes of <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic>, and <italic>M. florum</italic>.</title><p>The first nucleotide of the circular chromosome starts at the 12 o’clock position.

Therefore, a whole transcript with a normal stop codon can be covered by multiple ribosomes towards its 3′ end, with these ribosomes protecting the transcript from degradation by blocking ribonuclease cleavage sites. In contrast, a PTC upstream of the original stop codon will stall the ribosomes, leaving the ribonucleotides between the PTC and the site of the original stop codon unprotected by ribosomes, potentially promoting degradation by cellular ribonucleases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A key to accurately identifying <italic>bona fide</italic> transcript errors is to distinguish them from technical errors and low-frequency genetic mutations.

However, only a small portion of the whole ncRNA transcripts was evaluated in the present study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table 8) because of technical limitations. The rRNA depletion procedure in the sequencing library preparation protocol removes the majority of rRNAs. Secondary structures and nucleotide modifications of tRNAs interfere the cDNA synthesis and sequencing adapter ligations. In the future, to achieve a better measurement of transcript-error rates of ncRNA transcripts, total RNAs can be mixed with rRNA-depleted RNAs at a certain ratio to increase the abundance of rRNAs in the sequencing library. Demethylase enzymes and thermophilic reversetranscriptase can be used to remove nucleotide modifications of tRNAs and to improve processivity in generating cDNAs from highly structured RNA templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schwartz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The molecular spectrum of transcript errors revealed in our work indicates a general C→U substitution bias, which has been proposed to be due to spontaneous deamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Imashimizu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Traverse and Ochman, 2016</xref>) owing to the chemical instability of cytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alberts et al., 2015</xref>). Besides this widely accepted mechanism, non-Watson-Crick base pairing during rNTP incorporations may also contribute to this bias. Because dG and rU can form a base pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sugimoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sugimoto et al., 1997</xref>), mispairing between a template DNA (dG) and an RNA (rU) during rNTP incorporations likely also contributes to the C→U substitution bias.</p><p>Another intriguing observation from the molecular spectra in the present study is the G→A substitution bias in <italic>M. florum</italic>. One source for this substitution may be unrepaired uracils on the DNA antisense strand, which pair with rATPs during transcription, resulting in a G→A substitution on the RNA transcript. Although <italic>M. florum</italic> has a diminutive genome (0.79 Mb) and lacks many genes (RefSeq NC_006055.1), a uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) ortholog whose product presumably removes uracils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCullough et al., 1999</xref>) does exist in the genome. Therefore, the extent to which mismatches between the unrepaired uracil and rATP can explain the G→A bias remains unclear.</p><p>Taking data from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gout et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Imashimizu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Traverse and Ochman, 2018</xref>) and this work together, G→A substitution bias seems to be a general pattern in cells with error-prone transcription machineries. What might be the underlying mechanism? The error spectrum is shaped by two factors. One is the ability of an RNA polymerase to distinguish correct rNTPs from incorrect ones. The other factor, which is sometimes neglected, is the rNTP pool within a cell.

As suggested by this equation, a biased cellular rNTP concentration might present an additional challenge to transcriptional fidelity for certain categories of rNTPs. Based on observations that RNA polymerases have a low ability to distinguish rNTPs with the same structural class of nitrogenous bases and that the cellular concentration of rATPs is the highest among all types of nucleotides in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buckstein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Traut, 1994</xref>), it is reasonable to speculate that the high cellular concentration of rATPs contribute to the observed bias towards G→A substitutions.</p><p>An additional cellular process influencing transcript errors is RNA quality-control. Because genes involved in NMD, such as up-frameshift (UPF) genes, have not been identified in prokaryotes, evidence for the existence of NMD in prokaryotes is still lacking. However, previous studies based on single gene-reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker and Mackie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nilsson et al., 1987</xref>) and our transcriptome-wide survey suggest a Nonsense-Mediated Decay-like quality-control mechanism in prokaryotes. A key implication of the increased frequency of nonsense errors at the 3′ end of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) is that the degradation of RNAs carrying nonsense errors may simply result from a higher degree of exposure to cellular ribonucleases rather than from a reliance on specific protein-based systems.</p><p>Current models of mRNA surveillance mechanisms mostly focus on stop codon-related errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deutscher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richards et al., 2008</xref>), which are expected to represent only a small portion of the total transcript errors in a cell. It is largely unknown whether, and if so by which mechanisms the major transcript errors (missense errors) get degraded. To resolve this, future research will be required to evaluate the rate at which transcript errors are degraded after initially being generated during transcription. This might be possible by comparing transcript errors on nascent transcripts bound to RNA polymerases with those on mature transcripts associated with ribosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacteria strains and growth conditions</title><p>All bacteria strains were inoculated into liquid culture from single colonies and grew to mid-exponential growth phase upon harvest. <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> NCIB 3610 were grown at 37°C in LB liquid medium. <italic>M. florum</italic> L1 (ATCC #33453) was grown at 30°C in SNE liquid medium. <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> C58 was grown at 28°C in LB liquid medium.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>RNA extraction</title><p>Bacteria were harvested from liquid culture media by centrifugation and total RNA was extracted and purified using the FastRNA Blue Kit (MPBiomedicals), RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen), and the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). rRNA was depleted by the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Bacteria) (Illumina) for the following library preparations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Library preparation and sequencing</title><p>We followed a refined protocol of CirSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gout et al., 2017</xref>) to prepare libraries for transcript error identifications.

The CirSeq_v2 pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acevedo and Andino, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acevedo et al., 2014</xref>) can only analyze reads with exactly three repeats and reads generated by CirSeq approach can contain more than four repeats if the original RNA template is smaller than 75 nt. Another pipeline described in a recent work in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gout et al., 2017</xref>) cannot generate consensus calls and recalculate the quality score from a site where not all base calls are identical. Therefore, we developed Python scripts following the methods outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lou et al. (2013)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The structure of repeats within one read was identified by an autocorrelation-based method, in which the length of one potential repeat <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is detected by the maximum fraction of identical base calls that are separated by a distance <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> within one read. The consensus sequence was constructed and the corresponding new quality score was calculated by a Bayesian approach where an inferred consensus call is taken with the maximum posterior probability given all observed base calls. This approach also allows the processing of varied numbers and types of base calls at one site. To identify the ligation junction of circular templates and to reorganize the consensus sequence, a tandem duplicate of the consensus sequence was constructed and then mapped back to the reference genome by BWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>). The longest continuous mapped regions of the duplicated consensus sequences therefore correspond to original RNA fragments. We also excluded the 4 nucleotides at both ends of the reorganized consensus sequence to minimize potential confusions, because mapping can be ambiguous at the two ends of RNA fragments. After mapping of reconstructed consensus sequences, reads uniquely mapped to protein-coding regions and all reads mapped to ncRNA regions were kept. Transcript errors were called if a mismatch between a consensus call and the reference was supported by less than 1% of reads at corresponding loci. To exclude false positives of transcript errors from genetic mutations in multiple copies of ncRNA genes (such as rRNA and tRNA genes), an additional filter was included to exclude an error call that is supported by genetic variations from different copies of ncRNA genes. The transcript error rate of a given region was calculated as the number of transcript errors divided by the total number of rNTPs assayed from the corresponding region.

The probability of capturing a genetic mutation can be calculated by dividing the expected number of genetic mutations generated during cell propagations by the total transcriptome size at the time point of sample collection, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, in which µ is the per site per generation mutation rate, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the number of generations during cell culture, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the size of genome regions get transcribed, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the average expression level per site. This equation can be further simplified as µg.

the engines of evolution. However, how errors accumulate at the different steps of the central dogma of molecular biology has received limited attention. Investigating how errors in transcription and translation affect cell biology first requires that we measure their rates and that we examine how they affect various species. In this study, the authors use a recently developed technology to measure transcription error rates in four species of bacteria. Their results reveal that transcription error rates are higher than mutation rates, that many of these errors lead to amino acid changes if translated and that there may be a mechanism in prokaryotes for the quality control of mRNAs. These results open new research avenues on how cells may control the propagation of errors along the steps of the central dogma and why such error rates may be tolerated by evolution.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Universally high transcript error rates in bacteria&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

But please keep in mind that a substantially changed version could be re-submitted as a new paper.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the questions addressed are interesting and important and consider that it is possible to improve the manuscript so that it meets their criticisms. They found particularly interesting the proposed mechanism based on premature termination but found that it was not fully supported by the analyses and may require actual lab experiments.

Their complete comments appear below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript submitted by Li and Lynch is interested in transcript error rates in bacteria, which were already known to be orders of magnitude more frequent than replication errors. The authors developed a slightly modified version of the previously published CirSeq approach, which produces tandem copies of transcribed fragments from circularized RNA molecules, to allow a more accurate detection of errors on a genome-wide scale. The authors used this method to quantify mutations in transcripts from four representative bacteria, and showed evidence suggesting that the M. florum RNA polymerase is error-prone, with a strong G to A substitution bias compared to the other bacteria. The authors showed data suggesting that nonsense mutations tend to accumulate at the 3' end of transcripts and proposed a model to explain how transcripts containing a premature termination codon could be recognized and degraded by the cell.</p><p>Overall, I found the topic interesting but the results rely on a single type of evidence (CirSeq) and are mostly descriptive. Additional experiments would be required in my opinion to fully support the model proposed by the authors. For example, it would be interesting to introduce a premature termination codon at different positions in a reporter gene such as lacZ and evaluate if such mutated transcripts have a shorter half-life compared to the wild-type. I am still debating whether this is essential for this manuscript or not. I also noted a few suggestions or elements that should be clarified:</p><p>- It would be useful for readers to include a more detailed description of CirSeq as the manuscript heavily depends on this technique. The manuscript was mentioning reference work but a short explanation would help.</p><p>- The average mutation rate of reverse transcriptase is ~1E-4. Since this rate is relatively high, the authors only considered mutations with at least two tandem repetitions in the CirSeq data. Were the reverse transcription errors observed by Gout et al., (2013) evenly distributed across the transcripts (hotspots), and were certain mutations types more predominant than others? If such biases exist, would it still be possible to confidently discriminate between reverse transcription errors versus transcription errors? Can the authors comment on that?</p><p>- In Figure 4 and Figure S1 to Figure S3, how were the replicates processed? Were they combined before the sliding window analysis or after? Would it be relevant to show the error frequency calculated for each replicate to see the inter-replicate variability? The Pearson's correlations coefficients should also be present on the figures, especially for Figure S1 as this comparison is very important for the conclusions. My first impression was that Pearson correlation coefficient from Figure S1 (all transcript errors) would be similar to those reported for Figure 4 (nonsense errors) but the comparison is not possible in this version of the manuscript. Is there a reason to not show the Pearson's correlation coefficient on Figure S1 but show them in Figure 4 and Figure S2- Figure S3? From what I understand in subsection “Biased distribution of nonsense errors in RNA transcripts”, the correlation coefficients calculated on data presented in Figure S1 should not be significant. Is that the case?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Li and Lynch reports the mutational spectrum of transcription in 4 bacterial species.

The primary findings are that <italic>E. coli</italic> errors are an order of magnitude less common than previously reported by Traverse and Ochman, that M. florum has a strikingly high G-&gt;A substitution bias, and that nonsense errors are depleted toward the 3' end of mRNA in a manner compatible with previously hypothesized NMD-like quality control in prokaryotes. Overall, a potential obstacle to publication in <italic>ELife</italic> is the incremental nature of these findings – the methods are not greatly advanced from earlier work including from the same group, this is not the first evidence for NMD-like quality control, and there is speculation about but not proof for the reasons for the high G-&gt;A bias and the discrepancy with previous <italic>E. coli</italic> measurements. I have a number of concerns, especially about the statistics, but correcting them is unlikely to reverse the major findings.</p><p>Probably the biggest issue is the contrast between Figure 4 and Figure S3, used to help infer the mechanism of action of the NMD-like system. Frequencies are a kind of binned data, and it is inappropriate to report correlation coefficients from binned data: see eg <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/06/17/29400/">https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/06/17/29400/</ext-link> or <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://serialmentor.com/blog/2013/8/18/common-errors-in-statistical-analyses">https://serialmentor.com/blog/2013/8/18/common-errors-in-statistical-analyses</ext-link> for discussions of this point. It is definitely not appropriate to claim that the Figure 4 model is better than the Figure S3 model (subsection “Biased distribution of nonsense errors in RNA transcripts”) because the correlation coefficients are larger, especially because the binning is clearly different in the two cases, eg. with far more zeros in Figure S3.</p><p>For these and all similar figures, there should be error bars on each dot from sampling error: for a binomial the error is sqrt(p*(1-p)/n). I was unable to figure out what exactly the normalization to scale the y-axis between 0 to 1 entailed – the fact that no code was made available (despite the <italic>ELife</italic> reporting form instructions to &quot;Include code used for data analysis&quot;) meant that I couldn't compensate for thinly described methods. I see in any case no justification for normalization; it would be better to just give the actual numbers on the y-axis, while keeping the &quot;zoom&quot; the same for visualization purposes.</p><p>The best statistical approach is generally to work with the raw data, which in this case is a vast dataset of 0s (no error) and 1s (error). The number of (rare) errors meeting given criteria follows a Poisson distribution, and a generalized linear model can be used to model this error function. This is what we did for transcription errors in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/554329v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/554329v1</ext-link>, and it leads to vastly greater power to discern the kinds of trends hypothesized in Figure 4 and Figure S3. I realize that, as well as some conflict in asking for use and thus citation of my own work, there may be concerns citing a preprint, but the manuscript is now accepted pending minor revisions in GBE, and citable as such. I would really like to know eg whether M. florum really does have a different shape to <italic>E. coli</italic> in Figure 4 as it appears to, and more sophisticated statistical models are required to answer questions of this sort. Our accepted manuscript provides such models, with code fully available on github.</p><p>Our preprint re-analyzes the data of Traverse and Ochman, and finds that the (non-C-&gt;U) error rate depends on protein abundance. The Discussion section is the only place in the paper that attempts to say why the currently observed non-C-&gt;U error rate is an order of magnitude lower than that previously observed by Traverse and Ochman, attributing all the discrepancy, especially but not limited to cytosine deamination, to RNA damage during library preparation by Traverse and Ochman. This is problematic in the light of our finding of systematic differences that are not expected to be caused by library preparation problems. I don't know why the non-C-&gt;U error rates are so different between the studies either, but it clearly isn't all cytosine deamination, nor all library preparation, and it would be useful to acknowledge this puzzle and comment on other possibilities, e.g. differences in strain or experimental condition.</p><p>Note that the per-gene method to find outliers described in subsection “A global view of the transcript error distribution” is much lower powered than our test for dependence on protein abundance, and so in no way rules out the variation among genes that we discovered. And if the aim is to detect mutations or programmed errors, it is better to do so per-site than per-gene, as we also did to also find that such problems were rare.</p><p>In general, the statistics used in this manuscript assume that sampling error is negligible and that all variance is therefore attributed to biological replication. This underlies the use of t-tests and paired t-tests throughout. However, in tables like Supplementary file 5 and Supplementary file 6, neither error bars nor denominator is given, so I am unable to verify that sqrt(p*(1-p)/n) is negligible. If it is not negligible, then all these t-tests should be weighted rather than the current use of unweighted tests, or better still, a more advanced generalized linear model with a Poisson error term (see above) that simultaneously accounts for all sources of variance should be used instead of t-tests. The problems with the statistical tests used primarily create lower power, and so the positive findings should all hold, but more problematic is that the supplementary data files lack the information needed to allow future reanalysis of the data using better methods.</p><p>Another statistical problem is in calculating expected percentages (subsection “To calculate the expected percentages of transcript errors with different effects”). The equation used assumes that while the error rates of the 3 sites within the codon might be different, every codon has an equal error rate. The much more logical alternative would be to assume site-specific error rates that do not depend on which codon the site is found in. If our finding that error rates depend on protein abundance is also true, this will contribute to misleading results even after this correction is made. We found that the difference between error rates at synonymous vs. non-synonymous sites was entirely attributable to the dependence of codon bias strength on protein abundance, i.e. that variation in error rate was at the gene level not the codon level.</p><p>Figure 2 legend refers to the analysis only of genes with detected transcript errors. This would seem to create a variety of ascertainment biases, inflating the error rate overall as zeros are neglected, and preferentially neglecting potentially large numbers of genes each of low expression.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Universally high transcript error rates in bacteria&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Joanna Masel (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Li and Lynch measure the rate of transcription errors in a few prokaryotes. This is a revised version of a previous manuscript. The reviewers appreciate the importance of the work and the changes that have been made to the initial version. However, there are still some concerns about the statistical analyses and interpretation of the data. The comments are summarized below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Data analysis and interpretation:</p><p>1) They uncovered almost the full spectrum of transcription errors, but somehow omitting indel errors from their data set. As is, this work will serve as a method reference for people interested in transcription errors. Based on their spectrum analysis, the authors speculate about different mechanisms by which these errors can be made. In order to be complete, the authors should analyze and report indels from their existing data.</p><p>2) Concerning the model to explain the biased distribution of nonsense errors in mRNA, they proposed an NMD mechanism no yet characterized in bacteria, but this can easily be explained by transcription polarity described first by Morse and Yanofsky, (1969).</p><p>3) In order to make the sequencing method user-friendly, I would strongly suggest that the authors include a flowchart for the analysis of the sequencing data as they have done for the technical concept in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Statistical analyses:</p><p>4) While claims based on comparing the magnitudes of correlation coefficients of different binned data sets has now been removed, correlation coefficients for data that is not just binned (frequency data), but also non-independent (sliding windows) continue to be reported in Figure 4, Figure S2, and Figure S3. Corresponding regression models on these non-independent sliding window datapoints are inappropriately used to generate p-values. An alternative and somewhat less flawed approach is given only in the response to reviews document and not in the manuscript itself. This is presented as being the method of Meer et al., &quot;with minor modifications&quot;, although they are not that minor, as they sacrifice the main advantage of that method. A good statistical model should have a good model of the error function. Count data has a binomial error function, well approximated as a Poisson. The advantage of the method of Meer et al., is that it exactly models this Poisson, but the method is dismissed in the response to reviews because it explicitly accounts for the fact that the raw count data depends on the number of reads, as though this were a bad thing. The alternative presented in the response to reviews does avoid the non-independence problem of the sliding window, but it still assumes homoscedasticity with respect to #errors/#reads, an assumption that is violated in practice given many more reads at some sites than others. If the authors want to model Equation (1) instead of Equation (2) (as numbered in the response to reviews), I would find this acceptable if and only if they (a) use a weighted regression to account for the known heteroscedasticity (ie at least model the magnitude of the error even if they don't model its shape), and (b) place this analysis in the manuscript itself as a replacement for doing a regression on the output of non-independent sliding-window-bins. The sliding window is perfectly appropriate and indeed very helpful as a visualization of the data, but inappropriate for the fitting and testing of statistical models.</p><p>5) I take issue with the claim in subsection “A global view of the transcript error distribution” that transcript errors are randomly distributed across genes. After a Bonferroni correction for the number of genes, the manuscript has very little power with which to make such a claim of evidence of absence. What is more, Meer et al., showed (using a different <italic>E. coli</italic> dataset) that the error rate does depend on the strength of selection on the gene in question, as assessed by its protein abundance. This analysis had much higher power than the current study, firstly because there was only one degree of freedom and hence no need for a radical Bonferroni correction, and secondly because explicit modeling of the error function as described above will generally increase power. Given that (uncited) evidence that contradicts the manuscript's claim for randomness has already been published, and the lower power of the current manuscript's basis for making this claim, a claim of randomness should not be made unless the authors are able to apply the same or similarly high-powered method and directly show contradictory results. Should the previously published claim non-randomness be supported, this would have implications for the authors' model of randomly generated transcript error, eg subsection “Characterization of transcript errors”. In this passage too, the statistics are problematic. Observed and expected &quot;data&quot; are compared using a paired t-test, as though the expectations were themselves data with error magnitudes homoscedastic with those of the observed data.</p><p>6) I am also confused by the bootstrapped standard deviation in Figure 4, Figure S2, and Figure S3. In Figure 4, why bootstrap rather than use the known formula for a binomial? In Figure S2 and Figure S3, why bootstrap only the numerator and not the denominator of the quantity whose error is being assessed?</p><p>7) I still fear that the casual reader will take away from the Discussion section that differences between the two studies in error rates other than C-&gt;U are trivial in magnitude, which is not the case.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54898.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>In this revision, we have addressed all the reviewers’ comments.

However, the highest RT error rate is &lt; 1.5x10<sup>-4</sup>, so the probability of observing the same RT error in two tandem repeats and misidentifying it as a transcript error is &lt; 2.25x10<sup>-8</sup>. Because the transcript-error rates that we observe are on the order of 10<sup>-6</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup>, RT errors cannot contribute more than ~2% of detected transcript errors by including at least two tandem repeats of CirSeq reads.</p><p>In summary, whereas in principle it might be possible to finesse a maximum-likelihood procedure to factor in RT errors in a full data set, this would be error-prone itself, only introducing another source of sampling variance in the final analysis, and given the points made above, we are confident that RT errors are not contributing to our estimates in more than a very minor way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-In Figure 4 and Figure S1 to Figure S3, how were the replicates processed?

The primary findings are that <italic>E. coli</italic> errors are an order of magnitude less common than previously reported by Traverse and Ochman, that M. florum has a strikingly high G-&gt;A substitution bias, and that nonsense errors are depleted toward the 3' end of mRNA in a manner compatible with previously hypothesized NMD-like quality control in prokaryotes. Overall, a potential obstacle to publication in ELife is the incremental nature of these findings – the methods are not greatly advanced from earlier work including from the same group, this is not the first evidence for NMD-like quality control, and there is speculation about but not proof for the reasons for the high G-&gt;A bias and the discrepancy with previous <italic>E. coli</italic> measurements. I have a number of concerns, especially about the statistics, but correcting them is unlikely to reverse the major findings.</p><p>Probably the biggest issue is the contrast between Figure 4 and Figure S3, used to help infer the mechanism of action of the NMD-like system. Frequencies are a kind of binned data, and it is inappropriate to report correlation coefficients from binned data: see eg https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/06/17/29400/ or https://serialmentor.com/blog/2013/8/18/common-errors-in-statistical-analyses for discussions of this point. It is definitely not appropriate to claim that the Figure 4 model is better than the Figure S3 model (subsection “Biased distribution of nonsense errors in RNA transcripts”) because the correlation coefficients are larger, especially because the binning is clearly different in the two cases, eg. with far more zeros in Figure S3.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the correlation coefficient from binned data should be avoided in evaluating the correlation between the frequency of nonsense errors and the distance between the nonsense error and the position of the original stop codon in a single base-resolution.</p><p>We did the sliding-window (99% overlap of neighboring windows) analysis in the present study for the following reasons:</p><p>1) Considering the sample size of nonsense errors (n=59-108) in each species, we can’t evaluate the distribution of the frequency of nonsense errors at single-base resolution. Our goal is simply to compare the frequency of nonsense errors at the very 3’ end to that at more upstream regions.</p><p>2) This being said, we have evaluated the correlations using individual points before binning (details shown in the following response), and the results are consistent with the sliding-window analysis.</p><p>3)Instead of binning data into separated windows, the step size of our sliding-window analysis is 1 nt and there is a 99% overlap between neighboring windows. This approach allows us to smooth fluctuations at a small scale, considering the small sample size of nonsense errors.</p><p>We also agree that it is not appropriate to claim a lack of correlation in analyses as shown in the Figure S3 because there are a lot of zeros. Data collected in the present study cannot help us to distinguish whether the absolute or relative distance between PTCs and 3’ end of RNAs matters for the efficiency of degradation. Therefore, we have removed the Figure S3 of the previous version and corresponding paragraphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For these and all similar figures, there should be error bars on each dot from sampling error: for a binomial the error is sqrt(p*(1-p)/n). I was unable to figure out what exactly the normalization to scale the y-axis between 0 to 1 entailed – the fact that no code was made available (despite the ELife reporting form instructions to &quot;Include code used for data analysis&quot;) meant that I couldn't compensate for thinly described methods. I see in any case no justification for normalization; it would be better to just give the actual numbers on the y-axis, while keeping the &quot;zoom&quot; the same for visualization purposes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included more details on how we ran analyses related to Figure 4, and error bars are included. We have also posted scripts and corresponding data on the Lynch-lab Github site.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The best statistical approach is generally to work with the raw data, which in this case is a vast dataset of 0s (no error) and 1s (error).

The Discussion section is the only place in the paper that attempts to say why the currently observed non-C-&gt;U error rate is an order of magnitude lower than that previously observed by Traverse and Ochman, attributing all the discrepancy, especially but not limited to cytosine deamination, to RNA damage during library preparation by Traverse and Ochman. This is problematic in the light of our finding of systematic differences that are not expected to be caused by library preparation problems. I don't know why the non-C-&gt;U error rates are so different between the studies either, but it clearly isn't all cytosine deamination, nor all library preparation, and it would be useful to acknowledge this puzzle and comment on other possibilities, e.g. differences in strain or experimental condition.</p></disp-quote><p>The most striking difference comes from the C-to-U error rate. As we discussed in the manuscript, a lower C-to-U error rate in our study may result from enzymatic fragmentation approach which minimizes the RNA damages, in particular cytosine deaminations.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that non C-to-U error rates are also different between the present and Traverse and Ochman’s studies, and note that it is entirely possible that metal ion-based fragmentation may also induce non C-to-U error rates.</p><p>We have provided details on our data and analysis methods, such as the strain number, growth phase, and criteria to filter false positives, which may be helpful for future studies to compare with our work. We realize that the reviewer’s recent conclusion in a theoretical paper relies on the previous Traverse data set, which we believe has significant issues, but it is not clear that this should bear on a judgement of our empirical work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Note that the per-gene method to find outliers described in subsection “A global view of the transcript error distribution” is much lower powered than our test for dependence on protein abundance, and so in no way rules out the variation among genes that we discovered. And if the aim is to detect mutations or programmed errors, it is better to do so per-site than per-gene, as we also did to also find that such problems were rare.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the per-site method described in the paper that the reviewer suggested. For example, in an <italic>E. coli</italic> sample, we calculated the probability that the transcript-error frequency at one site is higher than the random expectation according to cumulative binomial distribution. A significance cutoff of 5.4x10-9 (Bonferroni corrected p-value of 0.02) was used. A hotspot site was defined as being supported by at least two biological replicates. Results are shown below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54898-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Running this per-site method, first, we found transcript errors are generally randomly distributed, which is consistent with the per-gene method. Second, we also found the bias in different base substitution rates needs to be considered in this per-site model. For example, in <italic>M. florum</italic>, where the most hotspots were inferred, most hotspot sites correspond to GA errors. If a GA specific error rate is used, the number of hotspot sites decreases to 10. Lastly, we found that the feasibility of the per-site method depends on a high coverage at each site, which is not always the case in practice.We emphasize that all of our data will be freely available to the reviewer for further analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, the statistics used in this manuscript assume that sampling error is negligible and that all variance is therefore attributed to biological replication. This underlies the use of t-tests and paired t-tests throughout. However, in tables like Supplementary file 5 and Supplementary file 6, neither error bars nor denominator is given, so I am unable to verify that sqrt(p*(1-p)/n) is negligible. If it is not negligible, then all these t-tests should be weighted rather than the current use of unweighted tests, or better still, a more advanced generalized linear model with a Poisson error term (see above) that simultaneously accounts for all sources of variance should be used instead of t-tests. The problems with the statistical tests used primarily create lower power, and so the positive findings should all hold, but more problematic is that the supplementary data files lack the information needed to allow future reanalysis of the data using better methods.</p></disp-quote><p>To provide information for future reanalysis, we have included details, such as numerators and denominators in tables like Supplementary file 5 and Supplementary file 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another statistical problem is in calculating expected percentages (subsection “To calculate the expected percentages of transcript errors with different effects”). The equation used assumes that while the error rates of the 3 sites within the codon might be different, every codon has an equal error rate. The much more logical alternative would be to assume site-specific error rates that do not depend on which codon the site is found in. If our finding that error rates depend on protein abundance is also true, this will contribute to misleading results even after this correction is made. We found that the difference between error rates at synonymous vs. non-synonymous sites was entirely attributable to the dependence of codon bias strength on protein abundance, i.e. that variation in error rate was at the gene level not the codon level.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we would like to clarify the method we used to calculate the expected percentages. There are two biases we considered. The first is the bias in codon usages. The second is the bias in nucleotide-specific error rates. We do not assume every codon has an equal error rate; instead we calculated the error rate of each type of codon based on the nucleotide-specific error rate.</p><p>Second, we would like to argue that the finding from the reviewer’s study that the variation in error rate is at the gene level is only supported by the <italic>E. coli</italic> data set from Traverse and Ochman. It is unclear whether it holds true for other three bacterial species in the present study.</p><p>Lastly, the reviewer suggested to use site/gene-specific error rates to approximate empirical observations. However, we intend to compare expected percentages calculated from random expectations to observed percentages to reveal potential error-correction processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 legend refers to the analysis only of genes with detected transcript errors.

Morse and Yanofsky explicitly excluded the arrested transcription mechanism for polarity and suggested that the polarity results from degradation of the untranslated region of RNAs that are immediately distal to a nonsense codon and are not covered by ribosomes. Therefore, the transcription polarity and the ribosomerelease model essentially refer to the same underlying biological process. The transcription polarity in Morse and Yanofsky, 1969 emphasizes the destabilizing effect of genetic polar mutants and it is not widely interpreted as a quality-control mechanism for mRNAs.</p><p>In the present study, we interpreted the biased distribution of nonsense errors as a result of a potential NMD-like mechanism not only because of the biased distribution of nonsense transcript errors in mRNAs, but also because of observations shown in Table 1, where the expected percentages of nonsense errors tend to be higher than the observed ones.</p><p>We also clarified in the manuscript that the ribosome-release model was firstly proposed by Brogna and Wen, 2009 as a speculative model for NMD. We believe both previous studies (Figure 3CD and Table 1. Entry 14,15 of Baker and Mackie, 2003; Figure 3 of Braun et al., 1998; Figure 2A of Nilsson et al., 1987) and our survey provide empirical evidence for this model and therefore highlight the existence of potential NMD-like mechanism in prokaryotes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In order to make the sequencing method user-friendly, I would strongly suggest that the authors include a flowchart for the analysis of the sequencing data as they have done for the technical concept in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. One of the goals of this study is to serve as the method reference for the transcript error community. We have now included a flowchart in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 to show how CirSeq reads are processed. Crucial steps such as how consensus sequences are constructed and reorganized are illustrated in detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Statistical analyses:</p><p>4) While claims based on comparing the magnitudes of correlation coefficients of different binned data sets has now been removed, correlation coefficients for data that is not just binned (frequency data), but also non-independent (sliding windows) continue to be reported in Figure 4, Figure S2, and Figure S3. Corresponding regression models on these non-independent sliding window datapoints are inappropriately used to generate p-values. An alternative and somewhat less flawed approach is given only in the response to reviews document and not in the manuscript itself. This is presented as being the method of Meer et al.,( &quot;with minor modifications&quot;, although they are not that minor, as they sacrifice the main advantage of that method. A good statistical model should have a good model of the error function. Count data has a binomial error function, well approximated as a Poisson. The advantage of the method of Meer et al., is that it exactly models this Poisson, but the method is dismissed in the response to reviews because it explicitly accounts for the fact that the raw count data depends on the number of reads, as though this were a bad thing. The alternative presented in the response to reviews does avoid the non-independence problem of the sliding window, but it still assumes homoscedasticity with respect to #errors/#reads, an assumption that is violated in practice given many more reads at some sites than others. If the authors want to model Equation (1) instead of Equation (2) (as numbered in the response to reviews), I would find this acceptable if and only if they (a) use a weighted regression to account for the known heteroscedasticity (ie at least model the magnitude of the error even if they don't model its shape), and (b) place this analysis in the manuscript itself as a replacement for doing a regression on the output of non-independent sliding-window-bins. The sliding window is perfectly appropriate and indeed very helpful as a visualization of the data, but inappropriate for the fitting and testing of statistical models.</p></disp-quote><p>Here the reviewer has two major comments. One is on the sliding-window analysis of binned data, and the other suggests accounting for sampling errors by using a weighted regression approach.</p><p>In response to the first major comment, we agree with the reviewer that the correlation coefficient from binned data should be avoided in evaluating the correlation between the frequency of nonsense errors and the distance between the nonsense error and the position of the original stop codon in a single base-resolution. In the current version of manuscript, we did the sliding-window (99% overlap of neighboring windows) analysis only for data visualization.</p><p>As the reviewer suggested, sampling errors should be considered in the regression analysis. We have updated the method by using a weighted regression method to evaluate whether there is a correlation between the frequency of a nonsense error and its distance from the original stop codon. The weight was calculated as the reciprocal of the variance of the nonsense error frequency, where the variance can be estimated as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf38"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula>. 𝑅 refers to the number and of ribonucleotides assayed (the read coverage), and 𝑝 is the estimated frequency of transcript errors.</p><p>The statistics from the weighted linear regression indicates that the negative correlation revealed by the sliding window analysis is significant in <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, and <italic>M. florum</italic>, but not in <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic>. Compared to other three species, a smaller number of nonsense errors were detected in <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> (59 vs. 109, 113, 105 in other three species), which may result in a low statistical power to reveal a potential pattern for the distribution of nonsense errors at a single base-resolution. This speculation is supported by our previous study (https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/10/e1701484, Figure 4F), where an increased number of nonsense errors detected in yeast transcription fidelity mutants vs. the wild type helps to reveal the negative correlation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I take issue with the claim in subsection “A global view of the transcript error distribution” that transcript errors are randomly distributed across genes. After a Bonferroni correction for the number of genes, the manuscript has very little power with which to make such a claim of evidence of absence. What is more, Meer et al., showed (using a different <italic>E. coli</italic> dataset) that the error rate does depend on the strength of selection on the gene in question, as assessed by its protein abundance. This analysis had much higher power than the current study, firstly because there was only one degree of freedom and hence no need for a radical Bonferroni correction, and secondly because explicit modeling of the error function as described above will generally increase power. Given that (uncited) evidence that contradicts the manuscript's claim for randomness has already been published, and the lower power of the current manuscript's basis for making this claim, a claim of randomness should not be made unless the authors are able to apply the same or similarly high-powered method and directly show contradictory results. Should the previously published claim non-randomness be supported, this would have implications for the authors' model of randomly generated transcript error, eg subsection “Characterization of transcript errors”. In this passage too, the statistics are problematic. Observed and expected &quot;data&quot; are compared using a paired t-test, as though the expectations were themselves data with error magnitudes homoscedastic with those of the observed data.</p></disp-quote><p>We think this comment comes from the discrepancy between the argument of gene-specific transcript-error rates from Meer et al., 2019 and our observation of randomly distributed transcript errors. In response to this comment, we would like to first revisit observations and the corresponding conclusion from Meer et al., 2019. By analyzing a different <italic>E. coli</italic> dataset from Traverse and Ochman, 2016, Meer et al. claim an inverse correlation between protein abundance and non C-to-U transcript-error rates and argue for potential gene-specific transcript-error rates shaped by selection. Because the C-to-U error rate in the previous study is likely overestimated owing to technical errors, it is unclear whether the Meer et al., conclusion holds for the overall error rate. It is also unclear whether the gene-specific error rate argument applies for prokaryotes other than <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>In the present study, we provided a per-gene approach to evaluate the distribution of transcript errors, where the sampling error related to the coverage of genes has been considered as Poisson distributed. Besides, we also ran a per-site analysis suggested by the reviewer. Results from both analyses indicate, in general, there is no sign for gene-specific transcript-error rates.</p><p>We have also updated the statistics and used chi-square tests to compare expected and observed percentages displayed in Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) I am also confused by the bootstrapped standard deviation in Figure 4, Figure S2, and Figure S3.

In Figure S2 and Figure S3, why bootstrap only the numerator and not the denominator of the quantity whose error is being assessed?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the number of transcript errors observed at one locus is expected to follow a binomial distribution. Therefore, we have updated those figures and calculated the binomial standard deviation of error frequencies according to the read coverage and the frequency of transcript errors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) I still fear that the casual reader will take away from the Discussion section that differences between the two studies in error rates other than C-&gt;U are trivial in magnitude, which is not the case.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that although the most striking differences comes from the C-to-U error rate, other types of substitution rates are also different between the present study and Traverse and Ochman’s study.
