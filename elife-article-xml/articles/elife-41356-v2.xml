stem cell intermediary stages. Although iN technology has an enormous potential for modeling age-related diseases, as well as therapeutic approaches, the technology faces limitations due to variable conversion efficiencies and a lack of thorough understanding of the signaling pathways directing iN conversion. Here, we introduce a new all-in-one inducible lentiviral system that simplifies fibroblast transgenesis for the two pioneer transcription factors, Ngn2 and Ascl1, and markedly improves iN yields. Further, our timeline RNA-Seq data across the course of conversion has identified signaling pathways that become transcriptionally enriched during iN conversion. Small molecular modulators were identified for four signaling pathways that reliably increase the yield of iNs. Taken together, these advances provide an improved toolkit for iN technology and new insight into the mechanisms influencing direct iN conversion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>direct reprogramming</kwd><kwd>iN</kwd><kwd>transgenesis</kwd><kwd>pathway analysis</kwd><kwd>lentivirus</kwd><kwd>induced neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mertens</surname><given-names>Jerome</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000952</institution-id><institution>Paul G.

As opposed to induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming and differentiation, direct iN conversion bypasses the pluripotent stage as well as any other stem cell-like stages and preserves epigenetic information of their donorâs age, making it a particularly valuable tool to study aging and aging-related disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mertens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Victor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). iN technology has also shown promise in vivo as a strategy to replace damaged cells following brain injury by direct conversion of non-neuronal cell types into neurons directly within the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heinrich et al., 2010</xref>). Using combinations of pro-neuronal and region-/subtype-specific transcription factors, a variety of neuronal subtypes has been produced via direct conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caiazzo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Son et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Victor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vadodaria et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsunemoto et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Because iN conversion lacks a proliferating stem cell intermediate, the iN numbers obtained are largely dependent on conversion efficiency; therefore, great efforts have been undertaken to improve iN process yields. The identification and the combination of Ngn2 with Ascl1 as two pro-neuronal pioneer transcription factors that can induce neuronal identity in non-neuronal cells have been key features in the advancement of this technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ladewig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mertens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). The efficient delivery of Ngn2/Ascl1 into fibroblasts, and their robust, controllable transgene expression, left room for improvement and, because variations in the transduction and conversion efficiencies from different donors are common limitations, we have developed a new all-in-one lentiviral system for inducible Ngn2/Ascl1 expression called UNA.</p><p>Chemical modulation of several cellular signaling pathways has been shown to improve iN conversion and thus enable iN technology as a legitimate alternative to iPSC differentiation. Inhibition of TGF-b/SMAD signaling via blockade of AKT kinases, inhibition of GSK-3b signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ladewig et al., 2012</xref>), adenylyl cyclase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ladewig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">GascÃ³n et al., 2016</xref>), inhibition of REST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Masserdotti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xue et al., 2013</xref>), induction of canonical Bcl-2 signaling, and inhibition of lipid oxidation pathways via ferroptosis inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">GascÃ³n et al., 2016</xref>) have all been shown to greatly promote iN conversion. However, because these known signaling pathway modulators have either been adopted from iPSC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>) or are the result of educated guessing or simply of trial-and-error experiments, no systematic efforts have been made to utilize broad and unbiased datasets to identify the pathways and corresponding modulators that orchestrate iN conversion. We sought to optimize the iN conversion media composition with small molecular pathway modulators to reach efficient iN conversion even in suboptimal human fibroblast lines. To that end, we have performed timeline RNAseq transcriptome analysis over the time course of direct iN conversion and have discovered four pathways that are instrumental in iN conversion. Based on these pathways, we identified four small molecules that could be combined into an improved iN conversion medium, ZPAK, which reliably boosted iN conversion of young and old fibroblasts into epigenetically age-equivalent iNs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An optimized all-in-one viral system simplifies fibroblast transduction and increases conversion efficiency</title><p>Lentiviral delivery of pro-neuronal transcription factors is the most widely used technique for direct iN conversion due to its outstanding efficiency and relative ease to use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parr-Brownlie et al., 2015</xref>). Successful strategies involve the use of constitutive or inducible expression of either only a single pioneer factor, such as Ngn2 or Ascl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith et al., 2016</xref>), a combination of a pioneer factor with secondary factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vierbuchen et al., 2010</xref>), a combination of a pioneer factor with subtype-specifying transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caiazzo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vadodaria et al., 2016</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsunemoto et al., 2018</xref>), or the use of two coupled pioneer factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ladewig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mertens et al., 2015</xref>). Typically, these factors are distributed across several lentiviral vectors; however, given that lentiviral transduction is not 100% efficient and because an individual fibroblast must be transduced with two or more viruses to survive chemical selection and successfully reprogram, this strategy left room for improvement. To eliminate the need for co-infection, we combined the tetOn system cassette consisting of the rtTA<sub>Adv</sub>. [Clonech] driven by the UbC promoter, the iN cassette consisting of Ngn2:2A:Ascl1 under control of the TRE<sub>tight</sub> promoter [Clontech], and a puromycin-resistance gene driven by the PGK promoter to yield the UNA construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). To test the efficiency of UNA compared to our conventional two-vector system (EtOÂ +N2A), we selected fibroblasts from three individual donors that had not yielded optimal iN conversion efficiencies in the past (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). Dermal fibroblasts were transduced with similar titers of either EtOÂ +N2A or UNA, selected by puromycin or puromycin/G418, respectively, and converted to iNs using our previously described conversion medium (NC) containing noggin as well as the small molecules CHIR-99021 (GSK3Ã inhibitor), SB-431542, LDN-193189, A-83â01 (ALK inhibitors), forskolin, and db-cAMP (cAMP increase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mertens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ladewig et al., 2012</xref>). Following three weeks of conversion, cells were live-stained for the neural surface marker PSA-NCAM, which stains reprogrammed iNs but not fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Flow cytometry revealed that UNA-derived iNs exhibited significantly more PSA-NCAM-positive cells than EÂ +Â N2A, boosting efficiencies by up to 90â100% for the two suboptimal fibroblast lines, but also increasing efficiencies of the lines that already converted well by 30 Â± 8% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâE</xref>). In addition, immunocytochemical co-staining for the neuronal markers ÃIII-tubulin and NeuN revealed that UNA iNs were on average twice as likely to be positive for NeuN or ÃIII-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1FâH</xref>). Based on these experiments, we reasoned that the use of the single all-in-one lentiviral vector UNA was notably easier and less prone to experimental error, as well as significantly more efficient in generating larger numbers of mature iNs compared to a multiple vector strategy.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41356.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>An optimized all-in-one viral system simplifies fibroblast transduction and increases conversion efficiency.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of all-in-one lentiviral system for inducible overexpression of N2A for iN conversion.

Based on the regulated genes and overlap of the called pathways, we selected one small molecule activator and one inhibitor for each of the 10 pathways, with the strategy of initiating diametrically opposing regulation of a given pathway. Each of the 20 compounds had been previously been reported to be effective in tissue culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2âsource data 2</xref>). Preference was given to molecules that targeted an intersection of two or more called pathways rather than specifically targeting the canonical signaling cascade of one pathway. When screening for PSA-NCAM-positive cells by flow cytometry following 21 days in NC plus the respective compound, four compounds were found to significantly (p&lt;0.05) increase the frequency of PSA-NCAM-positive iNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2CâE</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2âsource data 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) Interestingly, the compound that acted in the opposite direction decreased iN conversion efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2CâD</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2âsource data 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These four conversion booster compounds were Pyrintegrin (PY; Integrin activator), AZ960 (AZ; Jak2 inhibitor), ZM336372, (ZM; Raf-1 activator), and KC7F2 (KC; HIF1Î± inhibitor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The iNs derived in NC plus any of these four compounds resulted in a significant (p&lt;0.01) increase in the number of NeuN- and ÃIII-tubulin-positive cells compared to those derived in NC medium alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2FâH</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, the combination of all four compounds (ZPAK) resulted in an even higher iN yield than any of the compounds individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2FâH</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

When comparing the average and median expression of the genes in these GO terms, we observed consistent upregulation in NC+ZPAK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These data indicate that NC+ZPAK yields iNs with a more defined and probably more human brain-like transcriptional profile. To assess neuronal enrichment in a threshold-free manner, and to quantify overlap of expression with adult brain, we employed the rank-rank hypergeometric overlap (RRHO) test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Plaisier et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, this method generates a map of the transcriptional overlap between any two systems by comparing two ranked lists of differentially expressed genes. We applied this method to compare the overlap of NC versus NC-ZPAK to fibroblast versus adult brain (Allen Institute) to evaluate the extent to which either condition more closely resembled adult brain gene expression. Using RRHO, we observed a pronounced bias in the overlap of NC-ZPAK with adult brain, indicating that, relative to NC, NC-ZPAK iNs were indeed more similar to brain expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). To make a direct comparison of the functional maturity of NC to NC+ZPAK iNs, we performed calcium imaging of NC and NC+ZPAK iNs, revealing that NC+ZPAK iNs have more spontaneous calcium transients than iNs cultured in NC alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5</xref>). As calcium transients have been established as a reliable readout of neural activity in vitro, this direct comparison between NC and NC+ZPAK iNs provides further evidence that ZPAK is producing a more mature and defined neuronal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rosenberg and Spitzer, 2011</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that NC-ZPAK iNs possess a transcriptional profile more closely resembling that of mature neurons and that the original fibroblast transcriptional program, as well as other non-neuronal directions, were substantially reduced or absent.</p><p>To gain a better understanding of how each of the four pathway modulators improves iN conversion, we sought to obtain a more detailed understanding of the individual processes influenced by ZM, PY, AZ, and KC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Inhibition of JAK2 removes fibroblasts from the cell cycle and promotes mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)</title><p>Removal of fibroblasts from the cell cycle has been reported to improve neuronal reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Based on the enrichment of the IGF-1 signaling and the specific transcriptional footprint called by the IPA software, we selected the JAK2 inhibitor AZ as a promising and well-characterized inhibitor, because IGF1/IGF1R is known to enhance cell cycle entry of fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mairet-Coello et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gross and Rotwein, 2016</xref>) and signals through the JAK2 substrate STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xiong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nosaka et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang and Derynck, 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We therefore asked whether AZ removed fibroblasts from the cell cycle to enable direct conversion. As expected, Western blot analysis for STAT3 revealed that converting fibroblasts cultured in NC showed a decrease in STAT3 within the first six days of conversion, and the addition of AZ strongly promoted this decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Using carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) to examine cell divisions by flow cytometry, we consistently detected that fibroblasts cultured with 0.1 Î¼M AZ or ZPAK went through significantly fewer divisions than fibroblasts cultured in control medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Importantly, flow cytometry for DAPI staining did not detect elevated toxicity in AZ-treated cells. Change in the cell phenotype from multipolar mesenchymal cells to polarized epithelial cells is an important developmental process known as the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chaffer et al., 2007</xref>). MET machinery plays an important role during direct conversion of fibroblasts to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 2017</xref>), and p-STAT3 dimers directly promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wendt et al., 2014</xref>).

To determine which ZPAK molecules primarily facilitate these structural modifications, we used ÃIII-tubulin-based tracing and scoring to assess the neuronal complexities of iN cultures derived in NC containing either PY, ZM, AZ, or KC; we found that both PY and ZM produced significantly increased complexity scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4EâF</xref>). Interestingly, PY was shown previously to promote integrin Î²1 stability and signaling of human pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2010</xref>), and we reasoned that PY also enhanced integrin-dependent attachment to extracellular matrices of iNs, thereby promoting neurite outgrowth and interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

As our additional ZPAK pathway modulators might impact the cellular age of the derived iNs, we sought to verify that ZPAK did not affect the epigenetic age of derived iNs based on age-dependent DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2015</xref>). Similar to other global aging features, age-dependent DNA methylation of CpGs has been shown to be preserved in iNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huh et al., 2016</xref>) and reverts to a predicted prenatal age even in iPSCs from donors older then 90 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lo Sardo et al., 2017</xref>). We quantified CpG methylation for 850,000 sites for two young (0 and 1 years), two middle age (both 29 years), and two old (71 and 87 years) purified iN cultures in NC+ZPAK, as well as one young (1 year) and one old (87 years) unconverted fibroblast culture. Based on the top 5000 differentially methylated regions identified using ChAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morris et al., 2014</xref>), we observed a clear difference between young and old donors, with middle-age donors showing an intermediate age-dependent CpG methylation pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Most importantly, the methylation patterns of the young and old NC+ZPAK iNs were largely unchanged compared to their parental fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To apportion the majority of the variation, principal component analysis (PCA) based on all 850,000 CpGs consistently clearly separated the samples with respect to their age as the strongest component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Consequently, iN yields from current protocols are often paltry, necessitating large numbers of converting cells to get sufficient successfully reprogrammed iNs for experimental analysis. Further, improvements to these protocols are largely based on trial and error, with few predictive tools available. In this study, we leveraged RNAseq data to uncover several key molecular events that can be targeted with small molecules to improve iN yield. These modifications, combined with our streamlined lentiviral system, provide a state-of-the-art improvement in current iN direct reprogramming protocols and shed insight into mechanisms driving neuronal specification during reprogramming.</p><p>Efficiently overcoming competing cellular programs has long been a challenge in the somatic reprogramming field. Here, we report that ZPAK causes a more thorough elimination of competing fibroblast programs on the transcriptional level than classic medium, as represented by both upregulation of neuron-specific genes and, importantly, downregulation of myogenic and fibroblast-specific genes known to limit neuronal specification during late reprogramming. These transcriptional changes are accompanied by other important phenotypes associated with neuronal fate, including removal of cells from the cell cycle, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased GCAMP activity, and enhanced mesenchymal to epithelial plasticity. There has also been an increased recognition of the important role of cytoskeleton remodeling during somatic cell reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sakurai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). Neurons have elaborate cytoskeleton structures that are highly specialized and critical for proper function. As the morphological changes from a fibroblast to a neuron are substantial, we were interested to discover that two of our compound modifications, ZM and PY, were associated with increased neuronal morphological complexity in addition to increasing iN yield. This phenotype was accompanied by an increase in F-Actin activity, a potent component of cellular plasticity. Cytoskeleton remodeling is associated with sheer stress, and the actin cytoskeleton can sense and respond to these stresses with apoptotic signals. Therefore, we propose that the inclusion of ZM and PY in direct neuronal reprogramming could promote cytoskeleton reorganization and spare converting fibroblasts from mechanical stress-induced apoptosis. Our findings illustrate the important contribution actin structure makes during reprogramming and suggests that increased cellular structural plasticity could be a fruitful strategy for improving neuronal lineage commitment during reprogramming.</p><p>Classic direct conversion protocols, which we and others have used to differentiate fibroblasts to mature human neurons, are highly inefficient and fail to successfully reprogram the majority of input cells. Additionally, a significant heterogeneity exists in the reprogrammed pool, with many cells existing in a state that is not quite fibroblast, not quite neuron. Although many relevant phenotypes have been found between patient and control neuronal cultures reprogrammed in currently used media, we predict that new phenotypes might be revealed from studying neurons in conditions that more thoroughly commit fibroblasts to neuronal fate specification and, in turn, might lead to the discovery of more effective treatments for neurological disorders. Further, as iNs have shown promise in cell replacement therapies, we propose that using culture conditions that completely commit fibroblasts to the neuronal lineage will result in an increased therapeutic potential of iNs for possible neuronal replacement. Importantly, ZPAK improves iN yields even at very late fibroblast passages that could be required to produce therapeutic numbers of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Although 100% efficiency in establishing neuronal specification remains elusive, the development of new neuronal reprogramming techniques, such as UNA and ZPAK media, takes us one step closer to this goal.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

All data for one experiment were acquired from cells cultured and processed in parallel on the same microscope with the exact same setting reused. For analysis, 2 Âµm confocal sections through the nuclear layer were acquired from three confocal z stacks. Neurolucida software was used for manual tracing of entire neuronal processes, and data were analyzed using NeuroExplorer (MicroBrightField Inc). All tracings were performed in a blinded manner. For phalloidin staining, automatic thresholding in ImageJ was used to binarize the images and green fluorescence intensity was calculated minus background intensity. At least 50 different cells were analyzed in each experiment, and the meanÂ Â±Â SEM optical density (OD) was then calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Calcium Imaging</title><p>iNs converted in NC or NC+ZPAK were transduced with lentiviral particles for CAG-GCAMP5G and LV-hSyn-dsRed at 21 days of conversion and replated on astrocytes for maturation as described above. Calcium imaging were performed four weeks after plating on astrocytes. Imaging was performed in BrainPhys media (Stemcell Technologies) on a Yokogawa Cell Voyager 1000 Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope. We only analyzed 10 cells per field that were hSyn-dsRedÂ +Â and exhibited neuron identity. Calcium responses were calculated as the change in fluorescence intensity (Î<italic>F</italic>) over the initial fluorescence intensity (F-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>,in which F is the fluorescence at a given time point and F<sub>0</sub> was calculated as the average of the first five inactive fluorescence measurements at the start of imaging. A non-response area for each recording was measured for background subtraction, and imaging bleach was corrected for using the ImageJ plugin Fiji (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The threshold for a positive calcium event was defined as local maxima when fluorescence response within a soma exceeded a value greater than three standard deviations above the mean.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>SYBR qPCR</title><p>Bulk mRNA was extracted as described above, and 1 Î¼g of RNA was then reverse transcribed using the Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase kit (Thermo Fisher). Quantitative differences in gene expression were determined by real-time qPCR using SYBR Green Master Mix (Bio-Rad) and a spectrofluorometric thermal cycler (CFX384, Bio-Rad). Values are presented as the ratio of target mRNA to GAPDH expression obtained for each time point and treatment.

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Chemical modulation of transcriptionally enriched signaling pathways to optimize conversion of fibroblasts into neurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Marisa Karow (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper by Herdy et al. describes an interesting attempt to improve the process by which neurons are produced directly from patient fibroblasts. The theoretical advantage of such a method, should it be sufficiently efficient, is that it may be capable of preserving some of the epigenetic changes, occurring during aging or other conditions, in the neurons. The authors formulated a method that uses a revised lentiviral vector that drives the expression of two different neurogenic transcription factors along with a combination of small molecule signaling modulators. Overall, the new method appears to result in a substantial improvement in the production of induced neurons, including from a few patient lines that were &quot;low performers&quot; under the original induction conditions.</p><p>The three reviewers agree that this manuscript is worth publishing after a set of focused experiments are performed. Most of the comments are directed at achieving a greater understanding of the actions of the small molecules. Some additional information concerning the consistency of the effects of ZPAK on different sets of fibroblasts and on the total scalability of the new differentiation protocol are also requested. Since this is a Resource and Tools paper, we have tried to restrict the requests to ones that we agree will make the protocols more useful and comprehensive.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Analyzing effects of treatment with single compounds and with ZPAK.</p><p>Can the authors clarify:</p><p>â¢ Which fibroblast line(s) were used for the analyses in Figure 2 and subsequent figures?</p><p>â¢ Whether they tested multiple inhibitors and activators of the same pathways to generate the data for Figure 1. If they tested multiple, did they all work to some degree or were the results more mixed?</p><p>â¢ How well ZPAK works across the different patient lines?</p><p>â¢ If they compared the effects of ZPAK to those of the individual compounds based on testing single compound concentrations? Were the concentrations chosen from prior literature or from dose-response experiments that they performed? In either case, additional data to ensure that even single compounds at more optimal concentrations wouldn't have comparable effects to those of ZPAK should be included.</p><p>2) Understanding the effects of small molecule signaling modulators.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic> </p><p>Following NC+ZAPK treatment and Ngn2/Ascl1 expression, the fibroblasts adopt a mixed neuronal phenotype as assessed on a molecular level (Figure 3D). Are any of the neuronal branches adopted with higher frequency? Is there a change when switching from NC to NC+ZAPK? Did the authors check for this via immunofluorescence or electrophysiology?</p><p>The authors mention the alternative myogenic fate (as induced by Ascl1 alone in murine fibroblasts (Treutlein et al., 2016) being more highly expressed in the NC condition as compared to NC+ZPAK. Could they confirm this via staining?</p><p>In Figure 4C the authors show that AZ-treated cells went through significantly fewer divisions. Was cell division assessed in NC+ZAPK versus NC? In Figure 4E it looks like there are more cells in NC+ZAPK.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3 (reviewer 1 had similar questions to those described clearly below):</italic> </p><p>Comparing NC and NC+ZPAK in Figure 3, it appears the authors used bulk fibroblasts undergoing iN conversion at days 5, 10, 15 and 20. However, given the boost in conversion efficiency with ZPAK (Figures 2D-H), could the fact that there are more neurons and fewer fibroblasts in the NC+ZPAK conversion condition compared to the NC condition account for the increased 'adult / defined' neuronal signature? Can the authors rule out a change in cell ratios and ability to detect small transcript changes in a sub-population rather than changes to the neuron population specifically? In order to conclude that NC+ZPAK not only improves efficiency of conversion but also generates neurons that are more 'human brain-like' the authors need to compare NC neurons to NC+ZKAK neurons directly (e.g., through transcriptional analysis of BIII-tub positive neurons, immunophenotyping of neurons to quantify specific markers that are representative of the reported signature, etc.).</p><p>In order to support the authorsâ conclusions about gene changes over time in Figure 3, key genes from the RNA-seq dataset should be validated by qPCR with error bars. Specifically, showing changes in key neuro, muscle and fibroblast genes over time; key neuronal genes at later time-points that corroborate the more mature phenotype implied from the Allen brain comparison in Figure 3H; glutamatergic and GABAergic genes in order to conclude that they are expressed at roughly similar levels in Figure 3D.</p><p>The differences between NC and NC+ZPAK implied in Figures 3G and 3H seem somewhat at odds with the modest transcriptional changes reported, i.e., &quot;NC-ZPAK iNs possess a transcriptional profile more closely resembling that of mature neurons and that the original fibroblast transcriptional program, as well as other non-neuronal directions, were substantially reduced or absent.&quot; But, the first paragraph of the subsection âZPAK induces a defined neuronal transcription that more closely relates to the adult brain transcriptome than NC aloneâ indicates only 143 genes were significantly differentially expressed between NC and NC+ZPAK pooling all differences across days 5, 10, 15 and 20. How do the authors integrate these two pieces of data?</p><p>The authors should also include the number of differentially expressed genes for each time-point and the full list of 143 DEGs, as supplementary figures. Since this is a small/important gene set for this study, it should be readily accessible.</p><p>Does the transcript data support the mechanistic data in Figures 4-5? Is there transcriptional evidence to support the signaling pathways induced by ZPAK over the course of conversion? (if so, again, specific gene changes should be validated from the RNA-seq). Upon activation of these signaling pathways, and dramatic differences in neurite complexity shown in Figures 4E-F, again one might expect to see more differentially expressed genes between NC and NC-ZPAK.</p><p>3) Usefulness of the new protocol.</p><p>The authors are correct to point out that efficiency matters for investigators trying to produce cultures enriched in neurons and for those trying to make large numbers of neurons for proteomic or screening applications. However, by way of comparison, direct differentiation from iPSCs involves generating neurons from pluripotent cells that can be grown in virtually unlimited numbers. In the case of the current method, the numbers of neurons that can be produced from fibroblasts is the product of the number of fibroblasts that can be generated from each patient sample X the efficiency of differentiation. The authors have shown that the efficiency of their method is better, but how well does the method work in fibroblasts that have been passaged sufficiently to give rise to the billions of neurons that may be required? The lines used in this work were already passaged &gt;10 times, which is promising. However, the authors should demonstrate the process will continue to work on these fibroblast lines, especially those derived from older donors, that are passaged sufficiently to produce the requisite large numbers of neurons.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41356.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Analyzing effects of treatment with single compounds and with ZPAK.</p><p>Can the authors clarify:</p><p>â¢ Which fibroblast line(s) were used for the analyses in Figure 2 and subsequent figures?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewersâ comment and agree that the cell lines used for each figure should be presented more clearly.

We have revised our wording to make this strategy clearer in the revised manuscript (subsection âTime based RNAseq identifies signaling pathways directing iN conversionâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ How well ZPAK works across the different patient lines?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the consistency of ZPAK in improving direct conversion across many cell lines is a central and very important point. All presented data regarding ZPAK efficiency in our original manuscript were based on at least three individual fibroblast lines, and we see a consistent increase in conversion efficiency for all lines. To further strengthen this important point, we added new data showing the percentage of PSA-NCAM-positive cells following NK and NK<sup>+</sup>ZPAK conversion of all 10 lines used in the manuscript. The data were added to the new Figure 2âfigure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ If they compared the effects of ZPAK to those of the individual compounds based on testing single compound concentrations?

Indeed, for our initial screen of the individual compounds, we used concentrations based on literature (typically targeting a 2x EC50 concentration, also see Figure 2âfigure supplement 2). However, when the four ZPAK components were combined, we observed slightly adverse effects. We therefore optimized the concentrations for the final ZPAK cocktail accordingly, yielding our âfinalâ ZPAK concentrations (1/4<sup>th</sup> of full concentrations). For the revised manuscript, we have added new data, presented as Figure 2âfigure supplement 4, to make this point clearer. We now show that (A) our final ZPAK cocktail produced more PSA-NCAM-positive iN cells than the âfullâ or half concentrations; (B) the final ZPAK cocktail is superior to any individual compounds in various concentrations, and (C-D) neuronal morphologies and neuronal marker expression are optimal in the final ZPAK cocktail compared to the full and half concentrations. Further, to increase clarity, we noted the concentrations used in the figure legends when appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Understanding the effects of small molecule signaling modulators.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Following NC+ZAPK treatment and Ngn2/Ascl1 expression, the fibroblasts adopt a mixed neuronal phenotype as assessed on a molecular level (Figure 3D). Are any of the neuronal branches adopted with higher frequency? Is there a change when switching from NC to NC+ZAPK? Did the authors check for this via immunofluorescence or electrophysiology?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment and agree that it is important to understand if there is a difference in neuronal subtype fate commitment during conversion induced by ZPAK. Although we saw no significant differences in lineage-specifying mRNAs between NC and NC+ZPAK regarding glutamatergic versus GABAergic fate in our original manuscript, we have now extended Figure 3D towards cholinergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic neuron-specific gene expression. Also here, we did not observe any indication of differential subtype determination between NC and NC+ZPAK.</p><p>In this new analysis, we did not observe clear differences between NC and ZPAK regarding subtype-specific gene expression. However, the levels of dopaminergic and serotonergic marker genes showed a more mixed pattern at D20 between the individual cell lines, which can likely be attributed to their low levels of expression.</p><p>Thus, to further verify stable subtype commitment and to confirm the very low levels of monoaminergic neurons in our cultures, we performed immunocytochemistry using neuronal subtype-specific antibodies against GABA, vGlut1, ChAT, TH, and 5-HT to test for GABAergic, glutamatergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic, respectively. These new data were added as Figure 3âfigure supplement 2.</p><p>Quantifications of immunofluorescence stainings of D20 NC and NC+ZPAK iNs revealed a clear bias towards glutamatergic neurons and a smaller population of GABAergic neurons, with ~75% of NeuN+ cells staining positive for vGlut1, and ~25% of NeuN+ cells staining positive for GABA. We observed &lt;5% of cells staining positive for markers of cholinergic, dopaminergic, or serotonergic neurons. These results are consistent with previous data (Mertens et al., 2015, Vadodaria et al., 2016), the transgenes used to reprogram in the UNA construct (Berniger et al., 2007; Heinrich et al., 2010), and with the RNA-Seq data presented in Figure 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors mention the alternative myogenic fate (as induced by Ascl1 alone in murine fibroblasts (Treutlein et al., 2016) being more highly expressed in the NC condition as compared to NC+ZPAK.

These new data were added to the supplement as Figure 3âfigure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4C the authors show that AZ-treated cells went through significantly fewer divisions. Was cell division assessed in NC+ZAPK versus NC? In Figure 4E it looks like there are more cells in NC+ZAPK.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the Materials and methods (subsection âDirect Conversion of Human Fibroblasts into iNsâ), fibroblasts are pooled into high densities that on their own result in contact inhibition; only after 24h did we change to conversion media with dox, further blocking cell cycles. Thus, differences in de facto proliferation after plating are not expected to significantly influence final iN yields and densities, whereas conversion efficiency does. The observed proliferation-blocking effect of AZ, which is further accompanied by a loss of total STAT3, most likely increased conversion efficiency by promoting a postmitotic G0-like state, and thereby made the cells more amenable to adopting a neuronal identity. This explanation is consistent with previous reports of AZ960 limiting division of T cells and the known role of STAT3 in mediating cell growth and proliferation in many cell types (Yang et al., 2010; Sherry et al., 2009; Corvinus et al., 2005).</p><p>Thus, while in the representative image in Figure 4F there appear to be more cells, this observation is a direct result of more cells making it into the neuronal state with complex morphologies. Non-neuronal cells have not been traced and reconstructed and are thus not visible in this image. Instead, we feel that Figure 2D better demonstrates the described phenomenon, as it also shows similar DAPI densities, whereas more of these cells converted into Î²III-tubulin-positive neurons. To further verify that not only AZ, but also ZPAK promotes a postmitotic state, we have added new CFSE experimental data that include ZPAK, and we have extended Figure 4 accordingly (see Figure 4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3 (reviewer 1 had similar questions to those described clearly below):</p><p>Comparing NC and NC+ZPAK in Figure 3, it appears the authors used bulk fibroblasts undergoing iN conversion at days 5, 10, 15 and 20. However, given the boost in conversion efficiency with ZPAK (Figures 2D-H), could the fact that there are more neurons and fewer fibroblasts in the NC+ZPAK conversion condition compared to the NC condition account for the increased 'adult / defined' neuronal signature? Can the authors rule out a change in cell ratios and ability to detect small transcript changes in a sub-population rather than changes to the neuron population specifically? In order to conclude that NC+ZPAK not only improves efficiency of conversion but also generates neurons that are more 'human brain-like' the authors need to compare NC neurons to NC+ZKAK neurons directly (e.g., through transcriptional analysis of BIII-tub positive neurons, immunophenotyping of neurons to quantify specific markers that are representative of the reported signature, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>This a very good point and a rather complex one to answer experimentally in its entirety. First, our functional data on morphological complexity, cytoskeletal dynamics, and mitochondrial membrane potential are all <italic>âspecific markersâ â¦â representative of the reported signatureâ</italic>. These results are indicative of â<italic>better neuronsâ</italic>, rather than merely â<italic>more neuronsâ</italic>. However, we still cannot rule out that a change in cell ratios (more neurons) underlies the observed transcriptome changes at least partially.</p><p>To provide further evidence and perform a direct comparison between NC and NC+ZPK iNs, we analyzed neural activity in four separate cell lines using live Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging (the new Figure 3âfigure supplement 6). Briefly, cells were transduced with lentiviral particles for synapsin dsred and GCAMP5G and underwent live calcium imaging on a spinning disk confocal (A). Panel B illustrates that overall, cells reprogrammed in NC+ZPAK had more spontaneous calcium events than those in NC alone, and that the most active cells observed were iNs reprogrammed in NC+ZPAK. When comparing the activity of all cells studied in this experiment (n=160), we observed a significant increase in the number of calcium transients produced by iNs converted in NC+ZPAK (panel C). As calcium transients have been established as a reliable readout of neural activity in vitro, this direct comparison between NC and NC+ZPAK iNs provides further evidence that ZPAK is producing a more mature and defined neuronal state (Rosenberg and Spitzer, 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In order to support the authorsâ conclusions about gene changes over time in Figure 3, key genes from the RNA-seq dataset should be validated by qPCR with error bars. Specifically, showing changes in key neuro, muscle and fibroblast genes over time; key neuronal genes at later time-points that corroborate the more mature phenotype implied from the Allen brain comparison in Figure 3H; glutamatergic and GABAergic genes in order to conclude that they are expressed at roughly similar levels in Figure 3D.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed qPCR validation of selected key genes to verify their differential expression over time or at day 20 in NC and NC+ZPAK. The new data were added as Figure 3âfigure supplement 5. SYBR green qPCR on genes highlighted in Figure 3F showed similar patterns, as identified by RNAseq, which is consistent with our observations of decreased proliferation, suppression of myogenic genes, and improved neuronal maturity and differentiation as a result of ZPAK.</p><p>Additionally, as stated above in the our first answer to reviewer #1, neuronal subtype specification in NC and NC-ZPAK was validated by extending Figure 3D towards rarer subtypes and by testing the immunofluorescence of subtype markers GABA, vGlut1, ChAT, TH, and TPH2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The differences between NC and NC+ZPAK implied in Figures 3G and 3H seem somewhat at odds with the modest transcriptional changes reported, i.e., &quot;NC-ZPAK iNs possess a transcriptional profile more closely resembling that of mature neurons and that the original fibroblast transcriptional program, as well as other non-neuronal directions, were substantially reduced or absent.&quot; But, the first paragraph of the subsection âZPAK induces a defined neuronal transcription that more closely relates to the adult brain transcriptome than NC aloneâ indicates only 143 genes were significantly differentially expressed between NC and NC+ZPAK pooling all differences across days 5, 10, 15 and 20. How do the authors integrate these two pieces of data?</p></disp-quote><p>To determine DE genes, we applied p-value adjusted for multiple testing by the Benjamini-Hochberg method, and we set a false discovery rate cutoff at 0.05 (padj &lt; 0.05), yielding 143 DE genes. However, although the list of significantly differentially expressed individual genes is not very long, when assessing populations of genes via both gene ontology analysis (Figure 3G) and RRHO (Figure 3H), we observed that classes of neuronal genes were significantly more likely to be upregulated in NC+ZPAK than NC, even when the individual genes themselves werenât significantly differentially expressed. While this strategy is based on a significance cutoff and thus meets a comparatively high standard (that likely produces very few false-positive DE genes), we expect that, by limiting ourselves to this method, we missed many transcriptome changes. For the revised manuscript, we provide an additional strategy to challenge our view that ZPAK significantly improved the neuronal transcriptomes and that the 143 genes likely underestimated these differences.</p><p>We first selected pre-defined gene sets from databases such as the GO and KEGG and next plotted the mean and median fold change in NC versus NC-ZPAK of all genes per GO/KEGG gene set. While no statistical cutoff is provided, this type of analysis shows general expression changes of pre-defined and validated functional gene sets between NC and NC+ZPAK. For example, without applying any pre-filtering, several gene sets such as Neuron Differentiation, Neurite Development or Axon Guidance (GO terms) showed an upregulation in NC+ZPAK both when assessing the mean and median expression changes. These data were added as Figure 3âfigure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also include the number of differentially expressed genes for each time-point and the full list of 143 DEGs, as supplementary figures. Since this is a small/important gene set for this study, it should be readily accessible.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the list of significantly differentially expressed genes at each time point should be included in an easily accessible manner. We thus included a list of all DE genes in a table as part of the supplementary information as Figure 3âsource data 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does the transcript data support the mechanistic data in Figures 4-5? Is there transcriptional evidence to support the signaling pathways induced by ZPAK over the course of conversion? (if so, again, specific gene changes should be validated from the RNA-seq). Upon activation of these signaling pathways, and dramatic differences in neurite complexity shown in Figures 4E-F, again one might expect to see more differentially expressed genes between NC and NC-ZPAK.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggests, there is encouraging but modest transcriptional evidence supporting the mechanistic data in Figure 4, with the Log2 fold change trending in the direction of the changes reported, but these differences in transcript levels arenât significant when controlled for multiple observations as is necessary with RNA-Seq analysis. We thus agree that the list of significantly differentially expressed genes between NC and NC+ZPAK, with 143 genes at day 20, appears relatively small at first sight. As discussed above, however, we assume that the strict significance cutoff, the sampling from only three fibroblast donors (which for timeline RNA-Seq is already quite work- and cost-intensive), and the fact that bulk RNA was assessed might produce many false-negative genes. For the revised manuscript, we attempted to broaden the view on the transcriptome changes. For example, we show that gene sets that directly relate to the results presented in Figure 4E-F, such as Axon Guidance and Neurite Development, are generally upregulated in ZPAK (see our fourth answer to reviewer #3). In addition to the differences in neurite complexity, we have also observed significantly increased neural activity as assessed by live cell calcium imaging (see our first answer to reviewer #3). Thus, we reason that the accumulated impact of transcriptional bias towards neuronal fate induced by ZPAK results in iNs with a more defined and mature neuronal phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Usefulness of the new protocol.</p><p>The authors are correct to point out that efficiency matters for investigators trying to produce cultures enriched in neurons and for those trying to make large numbers of neurons for proteomic or screening applications. However, by way of comparison, direct differentiation from iPSCs involves generating neurons from pluripotent cells that can be grown in virtually unlimited numbers. In the case of the current method, the numbers of neurons that can be produced from fibroblasts is the product of the number of fibroblasts that can be generated from each patient sample X the efficiency of differentiation. The authors have shown that the efficiency of their method is better, but how well does the method work in fibroblasts that have been passaged sufficiently to give rise to the billions of neurons that may be required? The lines used in this work were already passaged &gt;10 times, which is promising. However, the authors should demonstrate the process will continue to work on these fibroblast lines, especially those derived from older donors, that are passaged sufficiently to produce the requisite large numbers of neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>The ability to make large numbers of iNs is indeed important for future application of this technology, and the reviewer is correct to highlight this significant goal of the improved protocol. As the fibroblasts are the only cells in this protocol that can be expanded and passaged to produce large numbers of cells, the iN approach from non-transformed fibroblasts will never yield the cell numbers that iPSC can deliver. Here, the limitation is the fibroblasts and not the conversion efficiency, and the scope of this manuscript is improving iN conversion, not extending fibroblast passages and proliferation speed, which probably results in detrimental effects on the beneficial aspects of the iN technology, such as age preservation.</p><p>However, to get the best from the fibroblasts as a cell source, we sought to verify that iNs can be obtained from highly passaged (&gt;30) fibroblasts. To this end, we produced 4 lines with &gt;30 passages to test for direct conversion with UNA and NC+ZPAK. We verified that these high passage cells were approaching replicative senescence by SA-B-Gal staining. First, we observed that the overall efficiency was reduced in both conditions when compared to early passages, which was expected based reports of senescence-limiting iN conversion (Sun et al., Nat Commun 2014). However, we found that NC+ZPAK still produced a significantly increased yield of iNs compared to NC alone also from late passage fibroblasts. We have included these data in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
