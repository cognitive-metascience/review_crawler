regulation. It is activated by cytosolic ADP ribose (ADPR) and contains a nudix-type motif 9 (NUDT9)-homology (NUDT9-H) domain homologous to ADPR phosphohydrolases (ADPRases). Human TRPM2 (hsTRPM2) is catalytically inactive due to mutations in the conserved Nudix box sequence. Here, we show that TRPM2 Nudix motifs are canonical in all invertebrates but vestigial in vertebrates. Correspondingly, TRPM2 of the cnidarian <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> (nvTRPM2) and the choanoflagellate <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic> (srTRPM2) are active ADPRases. Disruption of ADPRase activity fails to affect nvTRPM2 channel currents, reporting a catalytic cycle uncoupled from gating. Furthermore, pore sequence substitutions responsible for inactivation of hsTRPM2 also appeared in vertebrates. Correspondingly, zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) TRPM2 (drTRPM2) and hsTRPM2 channels inactivate, but srTRPM2 and nvTRPM2 currents are stable. Thus, catalysis and pore stability were lost simultaneously in vertebrate TRPM2 channels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>channel enzyme</kwd><kwd>ADP ribose</kwd><kwd>Nudix hydrolase</kwd><kwd>selectivity filter</kwd><kwd>rundown</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Early Career Scientist Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csanády</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003825</institution-id><institution>Magyar Tudományos Akadémia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LP2017-14/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csanády</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Human Capacities of Hungary</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ÚNKP 17-4-I-SE-61</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tóth</surname><given-names>Balázs</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003825</institution-id><institution>Magyar Tudományos Akadémia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bolyai Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tóth</surname><given-names>Balázs</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Human Capacities of Hungary</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ÚNKP-FIKP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csanády</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Human Capacities of Hungary</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ÚNKP 18-4-SE-132</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tóth</surname><given-names>Balázs</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Invertebrate TRPM2 channels have stable pores but act as chanzymes that hydrolyze their activating ligand ADP ribose (ADPR), whereas vertebrate TRPM2 channels are catalytically dead but undergo pore inactivation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 2 (TRPM2) protein forms Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable non-selective cation channels that are expressed in immune cells, pancreatic beta cells, cardiomyocytes, and neurons in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nagamine et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Togashi et al., 2006</xref>). TRPM2 channels become activated under conditions of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hara et al., 2002</xref>) and contribute to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that triggers insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Uchida et al., 2011</xref>), immune cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yamamoto et al., 2008</xref>), and heat responses of heat sensitive neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus responsible for body temperature regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Song et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPM2 channels contributes to neuronal cell death following brain ischemia and in certain neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaneko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fonfria et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hermosura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McQuillin et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, TRPM2 has become an attractive pharmacological target for treating chronic inflammatory diseases, diabetes, congenital hyperinsulinism, excessive fever, and neuronal cell death following stroke.</p><p>Each subunit of a homotetrameric TRPM2 channel is formed by ~1500 amino acid residues that are organized into a large cytosolic N-terminal region, a pore forming transmembrane region with a topology typical to voltage-gated cation channels, and a cytosolic C-terminal region. The N-terminal region falls into three subdomains. In the C-terminal region, the conserved TRP helices and coiled-coil region are followed by an ~270 amino acid domain termed NUDT9-H, for homology with the soluble mitochondrial enzyme NUDT9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>), an ADP-ribose (ADPR) hydrolase (ADPRase) which splits ADPR into AMP and ribose-5-phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perraud et al., 2003</xref>). TRPM2 channels are co-activated by binding of cytosolic ADPR and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McHugh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Csanády and Törocsik, 2009</xref>), but their activity also requires the presence of phosphatydil-inositol-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tóth and Csanády, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The NUDT9-H domain of human TRPM2 binds ADPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Grubisha et al., 2006</xref>) but is enzymatically inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iordanov et al., 2016</xref>). ADPRase enzymes belong to the large family of Nudix (<underline>nu</underline>cleoside <underline>di</underline>phosphate linked moiety <underline>X</underline>) hydrolases that harbor a highly conserved ‘Nudix box’ sequence (consensus: REUXEE, U = hydrophobic) at the heart of a more extended ‘Nudix motif’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mildvan et al., 2005</xref>). In the structure of the mitochondrial NUDT9 protein (Nudix box: R<underline>E</underline>FGE<underline>E</underline>), the side chains of the first and third conserved glutamate (underlined) are both seen to participate in the formation of salt bridges that stabilize the active site, and the first glutamate is also involved in the coordination of a catalytic Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shen et al., 2003</xref>); mutant NUDT9 proteins with RILGEE or REFGKK Nudix box sequences are inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perraud et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shen et al., 2003</xref>), just as the NUDT9-H domain of human TRPM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iordanov et al., 2016</xref>) which lacks the Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordinating glutamate (Nudix box: RILRQE).</p><p>Recent electron-cryomicroscopy structures of sea anemone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2018</xref>), and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) TRPM2 revealed an overall organization similar to that of other TRPM family channels in which the N-terminal regions, together with the C-terminal TRP and coiled-coil helices, assemble into a two-layered cytosolic structure below the transmembrane domain (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Autzen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Winkler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yin et al., 2018</xref>). In the zebrafish and human TRPM2 structures, an additional cytosolic layer formed by the four NUDT9-H domains is clearly resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, TRPM2 channels from the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> (nvTRPM2) remain activatable by ADPR following deletion of the NUDT9-H domain, suggesting the presence of an additional ADPR binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kühn et al., 2016</xref>). Correspondingly, in the ADPR-bound structure of zebrafish TRPM2, a clear density for a bound ADPR molecule is seen in a cleft formed by the first N-terminal domain (the ‘N-terminal site’). The relative contributions of the N- and C-terminal ADPR binding sites to channel activation are still controversial. Although due to limited resolution the presence of ADPR bound to the NUDT9-H domain could be confirmed neither in the zebrafish nor in the human structure, in both structures pore opening was seen to be coupled to large conformational rearrangements of the four NUDT9-H domains. Moreover, channel activity was diminished by mutations in the N-terminal site in zebrafish, but not human, TRPM2, whereas it was abolished for both proteins by deletion of the NUDT9-H domain. Thus, the precise roles of the two types of ADPR binding site in TRPM2 channel activation remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the Nudix box sequences are canonical for all invertebrate TRPM2 proteins, but their enzymatic activities have never been directly tested. In intact cells, deletion or mutations of the NUDT9-H domain sensitized nvTRPM2 currents toward activation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which was interpreted to reflect ADPRase activity of the intact protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kühn et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we expressed and purified both full-length nvTRPM2 protein and its isolated NUDT9-H domain (nvNUDT9-H; Nudix box: A<underline>E</underline>FGE<underline>E</underline>), as well as full-length TRPM2 protein from the choanoflagellate <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic> (srTRPM2) and its isolated NUDT9-H domain (srNUDT9-H; Nudix box: R<underline>E</underline>FME<underline>E</underline>), and found robust ADPRase activity for all four proteins. We then investigated how manipulations that abolish nvNUDT9-H enzymatic activity affect channel function. We further noticed that mutations in the selectivity filter that are responsible for the inactivation of human TRPM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tóth and Csanády, 2012</xref>) are also absent in invertebrates, and therefore compared inactivation properties for two invertebrate and two vertebrate TRPM2 channel orthologs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>nvTRPM2 is a true channel-enzyme, and isolated nvNUDT9-H recapitulates its catalytic properties</title><p>Sequence alignment of NUDT9-H domains of TRPM2 channel orthologs from unicellular flagellates to mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>right</italic>) reveals that the deleterious EF→IL substitution in the Nudix box appeared between chordates and vertebrates: the Nudix box sequences of all invertebrates are canonical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>right</italic>, <italic>blue sequences</italic>), whereas those of all vertebrates are vestigial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>right</italic>, <italic>red sequences</italic>). This observation suggested to us that invertebrate TRPM2 channels might be active chanzymes. The TRPM2 protein of the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> (nvTRPM2) has been shown to form functional channels activated by ADPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kühn et al., 2015</xref>) and is readily expressed and purified in large quantities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). To address its catalytic activity, we expressed full-length nvTRPM2 in HEK-293S cells and purified the detergent-solubilized protein to homogeneity (Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The protein was tested for ADPRase activity using a sensitive coupled enzymatic assay (Materials and methods), based on the colorimetric detection of inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) released from both ADPRase products (AMP and ribose-5-phosphate) by co-applied alkaline phosphatase. Because Nudix-family enzymes require the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and basic pH for maximal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perraud et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mildvan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iordanov et al., 2016</xref>), the assay was done at pH = 8.0, in the presence of 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>.

In CFTR, ATP hydrolysis cycles at cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains are strictly coupled to conformational changes that open and close (gate) the channel pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Csanády et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, the catalytic activity of the cytosolic kinase domain in TRPM6/7 is not linked to gating conformational changes of those channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krapivinsky et al., 2014</xref>). Comparison of the ligand-free, closed, and ADPR+Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound, open, conformations of zebrafish and human TRPM2 suggested large movements of the four NUDT9-H domains upon opening of ADPR-bound channels. These rearrangements appear to stabilize the open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting a potential influence of NUDT9-H ligand-occupancy on channel gating. To test whether any coupling exists between the catalytic cycle at the nvNUDT9-H domain and nvTRPM2 channel gating, we employed three independent strategies to inhibit hydrolysis of the bound ligand, and compared their impacts on nvNUDT9-H ADPRase activity and on the activity of full-length nvTRPM2 channels.</p><p>Consistent with the exquisite Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependence of nvNUDT9-H catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), omission of Mg<sup>2+</sup> from the reaction buffer with or without additon of 100 μM CDTA (free [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] low nanomolar and low micromolar, respectively) abolished ADPRase activity of the protein to below the limit of detection of our assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Indeed, although no significant contamination by inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) could be detected in any of the compounds used in the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>bars 1–4</italic>), P<sub>i</sub> was released at a low but detectable rate by alkaline phosphatase (AP) in the presence of ADPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>bars 5–7</italic>). This background signal, which is independent of free [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] (compare three <italic>purple bars</italic>), reflects slow spontaneous hydrolysis of ADPR at alkaline pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iordanov et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the robust ADPRase activity of nvNUDT9-H measured in millimolar free [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>green bar</italic>) was reduced to this background level when free [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] was lowered to micro- or nanomolar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, compare <italic>orange bars</italic> to <italic>purple bars</italic>). Control experiments using AMP as a substrate confirmed that the activity of the co-applied alkaline phosphatase was independent of free [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] and not rate limiting for the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>white bars</italic>).

Currents were repeatedly activated by cytosolic exposure to Ca<sup>2+</sup> plus ADPR (<italic>black</italic> and <italic>purple bars</italic>), either in the presence of 2 mM cytosolic Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<italic>green bars</italic>), or in the presence of 100 μM CDTA (<italic>orange bar</italic>). Interestingly, currents activated in the absence of cytosolic Mg<sup>2+</sup> were almost twofold larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>left pair of bars</italic>). However, this effect reflected a similarfold increase in unitary current amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>right pair of bars</italic>), from ~−2.5 pA to ~−4 pA at −20 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), rather than a change in channel open probability: in the presence of cytosolic Mg<sup>2+</sup>, at −20 mV membrane potential, Na<sup>+</sup> influx through open nvTRPM2 channel pores is blocked by cytosolic Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Moreover, the time constants of channel deactivation upon sudden removal of cytosolic ADPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <italic>colored numbers</italic>, in ms), obtained from single-exponential fits (<italic>colored lines</italic>) was not measurably prolonged by Mg<sup>2+</sup> removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), as would be expected if ADPR hydrolysis facilitated pore closure.

On the other hand, these data do not provide information on potential changes in steady-state gating kinetics of single nvTRPM2 channels. For instance, any effects of the mutations on channel opening rate, or parallel changes in opening and closing rate upon Mg<sup>2+</sup> removal, would remain undetected in the macroscopic recordings. We therefore extracted steady-state single-channel gating transition rates in the presence of saturating (100 μM) ADPR for WT nvTRPM2 in the presence and absence of cytosolic Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), as well as for E1443I/F1444L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) and E1446K/E1447K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) nvTRPM2 channels in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, by studying microscopic currents in patches containing 1–12 active channels in which individual gating transitions remained well resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>, <italic>yellow insets</italic> with expanded time scale). As long as the number of active channels in the patch can be estimated with confidence, the gating rates of individual channels can be reliably extracted from such recordings by maximum likelihood fits to the dwell-time distributions (see Materials and methods). Dwell-times at the highest conductance level (i.e. with all channels open) were single-exponentially distributed, whereas at all other conductance levels the dwell-time distributions showed two exponential components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such a pattern of dwell-time histograms uniquely identifies a bursting gating pattern with one open and two closed states, as shown earlier for hsTRPM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Csanády and Törocsik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tóth et al., 2014</xref>), which displays two distinct populations of closed events (long, &gt;100 ms, ‘interburst’; brief,~2 ms, ‘flickery’) but a single population of open events. Using a three-state C<sub>slow</sub>↔O↔C<sub>fast</sub> scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tóth et al., 2014</xref>) to model nvTRPM2 gating, we extracted unitary transition rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) and calculated open probabilities (P<sub>o</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), mean open burst durations (τ<sub>b</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), and mean closed interburst durations (τ<sub>ib</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).

Expression of both proteins caused the appearance of large macroscopic currents that depended on the presence of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ADPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,D</xref>).

For nvTRPM2, enzymatic activity has been suggested based on indirect evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kühn et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we show that the ancient TRPM2 channels of the choanoflagellate <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic> and of the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> are indeed true chanzymes which, unlike their human ortholog, hydrolyze their activating ligand ADPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). This is consistent with the presence of canonical Nudix box sequences in all invertebrate TRPM2 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>right</italic>, <italic>blue sequences</italic>). We could not ascertain whether the mutations in the key Nudix box positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>right</italic>, <italic>asterisks</italic>) are solely responsible for the loss of catalysis in vertebrate TRPM2 channels, as we were unable to obtain hsNUDT9-H constructs with ‘revertant’ Nudix box motifs (Nudix box: REFRQE or REFGEE) in soluble form. Thus, although the Nudix box mutations are clearly <italic>sufficient</italic> to abrogate enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perraud et al., 2003</xref>), it remains possible that in vertebrate TRPM2 channels additional mutations have accumulated which are also incompatible with catalysis (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kühn et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>For both srTRPM2 and nvTRPM2, the isolated NUDT9-H domains serve as convenient soluble model systems with <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values identical to those of the full-length proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>). We observed a somewhat (~3 fold) larger K<sub>M</sub> value for full-length nvTRPM2 compared to its isolated NUDT9-H domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), a slight discrepancy which might be explained by structural constraints imposed on the nvNUDT9-H domain by the rest of the channel protein, which is expected to reside in a closed-channel conformation under the conditions of our enzymatic assay (in the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>).</p><p>The steep Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependence (Hill coefficient ~2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) of the molecular turnover rate for nvTRPM2 is consistent with at least two Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions coordinated in the vicinity of the bound nucleotide, and its pH-dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) with general base catalysis, as found in other members of the Nudix hydrolase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mildvan et al., 2005</xref>). Of note, whereas in all Nudix enzymes an intact Nudix box motif is required for structural integrity of the active site and for Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordination, the identity of the actual catalytic base has greatly diverged. In some members, it is provided by a Nudix-box glutamate (pK<sub>a</sub> ~7.6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harris et al., 2000</xref>), in others by a glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gabelli et al., 2002</xref>) or a histidine (pKa ~6.7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Legler et al., 2002</xref>) outside the Nudix box, and in the closely related NUDT9 enzyme the identity of the catalytic base is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shen et al., 2003</xref>). For nvTRPM2, the observed pK<sub>a</sub> of ~6.8 in high Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) would be consistent with either scenario.</p><p>For srTRPM2, the molecular turnover rate was smaller than for nvTRPM2 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), but clearly measurable. Indeed, our sensitive enzymatic assay allows reliable quantitation of <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values as low as 0.04 s<sup>−1</sup>: even for such slow enzymes, employing higher protein concentrations allows robust separation of the enzymatic activity from the background signal caused by spontaneous ADPR hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition to a Mg<sup>2+</sup> and pH dependence qualitatively similar to that observed for nvNUDT9-H, srNUDT9-H catalytic activity was further augmented at Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in the tens of millimolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The physiological relevance of such a low-affinity Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding site is unclear, but might potentially become important, considering that these marine choanoflagellates live in sea water which contains ~50 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Although we did not test Mg<sup>2+</sup> permeability for srTRPM2, both hsTRPM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tóth and Csanády, 2012</xref>) and nvTRPM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) channels are highly permeable to Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, in marine invertebrate organisms, under physiological conditions, local cytosolic Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations might become elevated in the vicinity of an open TRPM2 channel pore.</p><p>In some chanzymes, such as the CFTR channel, the catalytic cycle is strictly coupled to gating conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Csanády et al., 2010</xref>), whereas in others, such as TRPM6/7, the two processes occur entirely uncoupled from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krapivinsky et al., 2014</xref>). The recent discovery of an additional ligand-binding site in TRPM2, implied by intact ADPR-dependent currents of nvTRPM2 channels lacking the NUDT9-H domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kühn et al., 2016</xref>) and confirmed in the structure of zebrafish TRPM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2018</xref>), rendered <italic>strict</italic> coupling between enzymatic activity and channel gating unlikely. On the other hand, comparison of closed (apo) and open (ADPR-bound) structures of both zebrafish and human TRPM2 revealed large gating-associated conformational changes in the NUDT9-H domains that seemed to contribute to open-state stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). It thus remained a possibility that ADPR binding to NUDT9-H, and hence the catalytic cycle of enzymatically active ancient orthologs, might impact on channel gating (<italic>loose</italic> coupling).</p><p>Using three independent approaches, we show here that complete (or near-complete) disruption of catalysis at the nvNUDT9-H domain fails to affect macroscopic or microscopic gating parameters of full-length nvTRPM2 channels. In particular, if ADPR hydrolysis facilitated channel closure, then disrupting catalysis would be expected to slow steady-state channel closing rate, or channel deactivation following sudden ligand removal, neither of which was observed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6G</xref>, respectively). Thus, the catalytic cycle of nvTRPM2 is entirely uncoupled from pore gating.</p><p>Of note, the steady-state mean burst durations (1–2 s) measured in the presence of saturating ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) were at least tenfold longer than the deactivation time constants upon ligand removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6G</xref>). Insofar as the latter is a measure of mean burst duration at zero ligand concentration, these findings suggest an even more pronounced [ADPR] dependence of burst durations for nvTRPM2 than reported for the human channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tóth et al., 2014</xref>), implying that ADPR bound to the activating site (likely the N-terminal site) remains readily exchangeable even in the open state.</p><p>If not required for channel gating, then what role did the robust ADPRase activity of ancient TRPM2 channels play? One possible explanation is that the channels used this strategy to rapidly clear away their activating ligand, thereby limiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in time. Indeed, invertebrate TRPM2 channels do not possess an intrinsic mechanism for inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–C</xref>). Moreover, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through their highly Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable pores provides a positive feedback by supplying one of the two activating ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, prolonged activation of a channel as Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable as the nvTRPM2 pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) would be expected to result in Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and cell death. Thus, degradation of the other essential ligand, ADPR, would seem a plausible strategy for self-regulation. By boosting TRPM2 ADPRase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>), Mg<sup>2+</sup> influx through the open pore might contribute important negative feedback to the regulation of invertebrate TRPM2 channel activity. Directly addressing this possibility in live cells of various invertebrate species is beyond the scope of the present study, but given that cytosolic ADPR levels are in the low micromolar range (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heiner et al., 2006</xref>), the measured <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for nvTRPM2 (~10 s<sup>−1</sup>/subunit at pH = 7.1 and 2 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>;~40 s<sup>−1</sup>/subunit at basic pH and high [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] relevant to marine organisms), and even for srTRPM2 (~2 s<sup>−1</sup>/subunit), are compatible with such a hypothesis. For example, in a <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic> cell (cell volume ~10<sup>−15</sup> liter; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dayel et al., 2011</xref>), 10 μM ADPR corresponds to ~10<sup>4</sup> molecules, which could be cleared by srTRPM2 channels within 1–2 min, assuming only ~25 tetrameric channels/cell.</p><p>If so, then why did this enzymatic activity get lost through the course of evolution, and what other mechanism might have taken over its role? Based on sequence alignment, the mutations in the Nudix box sequence which abolished catalysis in TRPM2 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>right</italic>), and the specific changes in the pore sequence that cause inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>left</italic>), appeared at about the same evolutionary time, between chordates and vertebrates. Indeed, functional experiments confirmed stable pores for the two invertebrate channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–C</xref>), but inactivating pores for the two vertebrate channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D–E</xref>) tested in this study. It is therefore possible that pore inactivation of TRPM2 channels emerged to provide an alternative mechanism for turning off channel activity. An advantage of the latter mechanism might be that it allows the time window of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPM2 channels to be regulated independently of the degradation time course of cytosolic ADPR, which might have acquired additional functions as a signaling molecule in vertebrates. Further studies in intact cells will be required to test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The nv/srTRPM2 protein was released from the resin using PreScission protease, and further purified by gel filtration on a Superose 6 10/300 column (GE Healthcare).</p><p>Isolated srNUDT9-H and (WT and mutant) nvNUDT9-H domains were expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) and purified using a protocol similar to that described previously for human NUDT9-H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iordanov et al., 2016</xref>). In brief, bacterial cultures were grown at 25°C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-1-thio-galactopyranoside (IPTG) upon reaching OD<sub>600</sub> of ~0.5. After overnight incubation at 25°C, the cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5 with HCl)/150 mM NaCl, supplemented with Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific). The cleared supernatant was subjected to Strep-Tactin affinity chromatography following the manufacturer’s instructions (IBA GmbH). The affinity-purified proteins were then concentrated (10,000 MWCO Vivaspin, Sigma-Aldrich) and passed through a gel filtration column (Superdex 200 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare), and the main peak fractions were isolated. Affinity tags were not removed. Protein purity was visually checked by SDS PAGE, and protein identity confirmed by the band position and the main peak position on the gel filtration profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using theoretical molar extinction coefficients (ε<sub>0</sub> = 58,320 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup> for nvNUDT9-H and 66,100 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup> for srNUDT9-H at 280 nm); the yield was ~5 mg/L of culture for srNUDT9-H, and also for both WT and mutant nvNUDT9-H, proteins. The purified proteins were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20°C until used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Enzymatic activity assay</title><p>The ADPRase activities of purified srTRPM2, nvTRPM2, srNUDT9-H, and WT and mutant nvNUDT9-H were assessed through colorimetric detection of inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) liberated from the ADPR cleavage products AMP and ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) by co-applied alkaline phosphatase (AP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rafty et al., 2002</xref>). Because AP liberates P<sub>i</sub> from AMP and R5P, but not from intact ADPR, 2 moles of P<sub>i</sub> are released per mole of ADPR hydrolyzed. For nv/srTRPM2, 15 μl volumes of reaction buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.06% digitonin) containing 0.4 nM purified protein, 2–3 U bovine AP, and 10–300 μM ADPR were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. For NUDT9-H proteins, 150 μl volumes of reaction buffer (50 mM MES, HEPES, or Tris (pH 5.7 to 8.5), 0-320 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) containing 0.5, 10, 50, or 500 nM purified protein, 2–3 U bovine AP, and 5–320 μM ADPR were incubated for 4–5 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped and the liberated P<sub>i</sub> visualized by adding 85 (nv/srTRPM2) or 850 (NUDT9-H proteins) μl coloring solution (6:1 vol/vol ratio mixture of 0.42% ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate in 1N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and 10% L-ascorbic acid) followed by incubation for 20 min at 45°C. Absorption was measured at 820 nm (NanoPhotometer P300, Implen GmbH) and compared to that of a standard curve. The coloring solution was freshly made, and the standard curve (1–2000 μM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) obtained, daily. Reactions with 100 μM AMP (instead of ADPR) served as positive controls. All reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich.</p><p>The molecular turnover rates (k<sub>cat</sub>) for full-length nv/srTRPM2 were calculated from the P<sub>i</sub> liberated from 2 mM ADPR in 10 min by 10–140 nM protein (subunit). k<sub>cat</sub> values for NUDT9-H proteins were calculated after 5–10 min reactions using 20 (WT sr), 0.5 (WT nv), 50 (E1443I/F1444L nv) or 500 (E1446K/E1447K nv) nM protein and saturating ADPR. Not more than 10% of the initial substrate was hydrolyzed during the reactions, that is saturation was maintained throughout the incubation time. To test hydrolytic activity of WT nvNUDT9-H in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, MgCl<sub>2</sub> was omitted from the reaction buffer with or without addition of 100 μM 1,2-cyclohexylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid (CDTA). The ability of WT nvNUDT9-H to hydrolyze AMPCPR was tested by substituting ADPR in the reaction mixture with 100 μM AMPCPR. All assays were performed at least in triplicates, and data are displayed as mean ± SEM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Visualization of enzymatic activity by thin-layer chromatography (TLC)</title><p>20 μL reaction mixtures containing 10 mM ADPR and 0.1 μM wild-type nvNUDT9-H, 3 μM nvNUDT9-H E1443I/F1444L, 40 μM nvNUDT9-H E1446K/E1447K, or 1 μM wild-type srNUDT9-H were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.5) supplemented with 16 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. 1 μl aliquots of the reaction mixtures were placed on Polygram SIL G/UV254 plates (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), dried and developed in 0.2 M NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> in ethanol:water 7:3 (vol/vol). 10 mM ADPR and 10 mM AMP enzyme-free controls were treated identically and used to visualize the nucleotides' positions on the TLC sheet, and to monitor the spontaneous degradation of ADPR.

Pipette solution contained (in mM) 140 Na-gluconate, 2 Mg-gluconate<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA (pH = 7.4 with NaOH). The pipette electrode was placed into a 140 mM NaCl based solution carefully layered on top (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Csanády and Törocsik, 2009</xref>).

Recordings were obtained at 25°C at a membrane potential of −20 mV, under continuous superfusion of the cytosolic patch surface. Solution exchange time constant was &lt;50 ms.

To extract mean burst (τ<sub>b</sub>) and interburst duration (τ<sub>ib</sub>), the set of dwell-time histograms obtained for all conductance levels was fitted by a C<sub>slow</sub>-O-C<sub>fast</sub> model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) using maximum likelihood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Csanády, 2000</xref>), and τ<sub>b</sub> and τ<sub>ib</sub> calculated from the fitted rate constants as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tóth et al., 2014</xref>). Of note, the choice of a C-O-C model is not unique for describing the observed gating pattern, as a C-C-O model is identically suitable. However, whereas the extracted transition rates obviously depend on the chosen model, the calculated mean burst and interburst durations are model-independent.</p><p>The number of active channels in the patch (N) was estimated as the maximum number of simultaneously open channels (N'). The likelihood of the presence of additional active channels in the patch (i.e. N &gt; N') was evaluated using a statistical test based on a comparison of channel opening rate (1/τ<sub>ib</sub>) with the cumulative time spent at level N' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Csanády, 2000</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Leon D Islas as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Tibor Rohacs (Reviewer #2); David E Clapham (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>TRPM2 channels belong to a special category of ion channels coupled to enzymes name chanzymes. Your manuscript addresses important evolutionary aspects of the function of TRPM2 channels. The key finding is that the Nudix homology domain of invertebrates is catalytically active, which is consistent with their Nudix box sequence containing two key glutamate residues important for catalytical activity of this enzyme family. Vertebrate TRPM2 channels lack these residues and they have been shown earlier to be catalytically inactive. In this study, you used a combination of biochemistry and electrophysiology to investigate the biophysical and enzymatic properties of TRPM2 from two invertebrate organisms. You provide convincing evidence that the multiple pore/NUDT9-H mutations of invertebrate TRPM2 lead to proteins with vastly different function. Invertebrate TRPM2, particularly nvTRPM2, is clearly a functional ADPRase.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the subsection “srTRPM2 is also an active enzyme”, the Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependence of ADPR hydrolysis of the isolated srNUDT9 domain is given as 1 mM, however this cannot be estimated from the data since there are only two Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration points.</p><p>2) Please also indicate if the full srTRPM2 channel was tested for catalytic activity.</p><p>3) Since the time constant of solution change in inside out patches is 50 ms and the time constants of current decay upon ADPR removal are barely two times that, I do not think that meaningful conclusions can be obtained from comparison of the decay time constants, especially when comparing to the burst lengths.</p><p>4) Regarding the calculation of the burst-length and inter-burst intervals, the authors calculate this parameters from open and closed dwell times obtained from multi-channel patches. Since in this conditions the individual open and closed times are meaningless, the authors correctly only calculate burst lengths. However, the inter-burst intervals are also very difficult to interpret and the fitting to a 3-state model is not unique. Since the burst length calculation in multichannel patches is highly dependent on a correct estimation of the number of channels, the authors should clearly explain how this estimate was obtained and what are the limitations of the analysis as it was performed.</p><p>5) The excised patch data in some of the figures are not quantified. I recommend that in Figures 4 and 5 current amplitudes are quantified, and the number of experiments is unambiguously stated. In its current form, it is not clear if the n for the time constants in Figure 4C and in Figure 5C refer to number of patches tested, or number of individual measurements i.e. for Figure 4, does the tau for panel 4B counts as n=6 for Mg<sup>2+</sup> or n=1? Also in Figure 8, even though the difference between invertebrate and drTRPM2 is striking based on the representative traces, some quantification is necessary.</p><p>6) Can the authors rescue catalytic activity of hsTRPM2 with changing residues in the nudix domain to those in invertebrates? In other words is the difference in the nudix box the sole reason for the lack of activity or did vertebrate channels accumulate other mutations also that destroy catalytic activity?</p><p>7) It is not clear that srNUDT9-H is an enzyme given the low <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>. This protein binds ADPR with a micromolar affinity, however the rate of catalysis is low and little affected by pH or Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Knowing that background ADPR hydrolysis occurs in their experimental setting (Figure 4A) and that non-functional enzymes have <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values around 0.4 (Figure 6B), how confident are you that srNUDT9-H is a bona fide enzyme (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values around 1.5-2.0) compared to nvNUDT9-H (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> near 40)? The authors might want to defend their conclusion that this is an enzyme or discuss the possibility that it is non-functional.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44556.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the subsection “srTRPM2 is also an active enzyme”, the Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependence of ADPR hydrolysis of the isolated srNUDT9 domain is given as 1 mM, however this cannot be estimated from the data since there are only two Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration points.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially focused our attention primarily onto nvTRPM2 since we had previously characterized its structure and function in great detail (Zhang et al., 2018). We therefore contented ourselves to simply showing that srTRPM2 is also catalytically active. The reviewers were quite right that the K<sub>1/2</sub> for Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding cannot be reliably determined from two data points: our rough estimate was based on the assumption of a simple binding curve which in retrospect turned out to be incorrect. We have now performed complete titrations of srNUDT9-H with Mg<sup>2+</sup> at two different fixed pH values (7.1 and 8.5). The curves, shown in Figure 3B, reveal a more complex dependence of <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> on [Mg<sup>2+</sup>], suggesting the presence of high- and low-affinity binding sites. The mechanistic interpretation of these findings is presented in the first paragraph of the subsection “srTRPM2 is also an active enzyme”, and its possible biological relevance in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please also indicate if the full srTRPM2 channel was tested for catalytic activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not initially test enzymatic activity for full-length srTRPM2, because this protein preparation is unstable, showing clear signs of precipitation during size-exclusion chromatography. Nevertheless, we have now attempted some enzymatic assays on the full-length protein. These assays clearly confirmed that full-length srTRPM2 is also active, and its estimated <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> value (which, considering the above limitations, has to be taken as a lower estimate) is consistent with the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> observed for the isolated srNUDT9-H domain. These results are now shown in Figure 3C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Since the time constant of solution change in inside out patches is 50 ms and the time constants of current decay upon ADPR removal are barely two times that, I do not think that meaningful conclusions can be obtained from comparison of the decay time constants, especially when comparing to the burst lengths.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers correctly note that the macroscopic relaxation time constants might be slightly overestimating the true time constants of current decay which would be observed with an extremely fast solution exchange system. However, even given these limitations both of our conclusions regarding these time constants are solid. (i) Mg<sup>2+</sup> removal does certainly not prolong these time constants, as would be expected if ADPR hydrolysis accelerated channel closure. We now use this more careful wording in the second paragraph of the subsection “Disrupting catalysis at the NUDT9-H domain does not affect macroscopic gating parameters of nvTRPM2W”. (ii) Our comparison between these time constants and steady-state burst lengths is similarly safe: we conclude (Discussion, seventh paragraph) that steady-state bursts are at least tenfold longer than the relaxation time constants. If the measured relaxation time constants overestimate the true values, then this conclusion holds even stronger.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Regarding the calculation of the burst-length and inter-burst intervals, the authors calculate this parameters from open and closed dwell times obtained from multi-channel patches. Since in this conditions the individual open and closed times are meaningless, the authors correctly only calculate burst lengths. However, the inter-burst intervals are also very difficult to interpret and the fitting to a 3-state model is not unique. Since the burst length calculation in multichannel patches is highly dependent on a correct estimation of the number of channels, the authors should clearly explain how this estimate was obtained and what are the limitations of the analysis as it was performed.</p></disp-quote><p>The algorithm used here for burst analysis is extremely robust and, since its original publication ~20 years ago, has been successfully used by several groups (working mainly in the CFTR field), resulting in &gt;50 published papers. All of the concerns raised by the reviewers were carefully investigated and discussed in the original study (Csanády, 2000) and in following publication (Csanády et al., 2000). We have therefore not provided a detailed description of the algorithm here. On the other hand, we do realize that multi-channel kinetic analysis is a specialized technique which will be unfamiliar to many readers, so we have added some clarifying explanations, without going into very great depth.</p><p>The reviewers' concerns touch on three independent issues:</p><p>i) Interpretation of dwell times in multi-channel patches:</p><p>“…the authors calculate this parameters from open and closed dwell times obtained from multi-channel patches… in this conditions the individual open and closed times are meaningless…”</p><p>&quot;Open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; dwell times are indeed meaningless under such conditions. Instead dwell times can be calculated for each conductance level, i.e., dwell times during which 0, 1, 2,.… N channels are open (as shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1). Construction of such dwell-time histograms for each conductance level simply requires that the individual gating transitions remain well resolved, which was certainly the case here, as shown in Figure 7A-C (insets). How can such dwell-time histograms be interpreted in terms of a single-channel gating scheme? With the assumption of N identical and independent channels the entire system of N channels can be considered as a single macro-system which can exist in a finite number of macro-states, the transition rates among which are well defined functions of the single-channel transition rate constants (Horn and Lange, 1983). Therefore, fitting the set of N+1 dwell-time histograms (for conductance levels 0, 1,… N) of a multi-channel patch with the underlying single channel gating scheme is just as meaningful as fitting the closed- and opentime histograms of a single-channel patch. Indeed, because the time constants and fractional amplitudes of the exponential components of each dwell-time histogram, as well as their relative scaling, are well-defined functions of the same set of single-channel transition rates, such a data set provides robust constraints for determining the latter.</p><p>ii) Identifiability of the underlying gating model from multi-channel patches:</p><p>“… the inter-burst intervals are also very difficult to interpret… and the fitting to a 3-state model is not unique.”</p><p>Dwell-times at the highest conductance level (i.e., with all channels open) were single-exponentially distributed, whereas at all other conductance levels the dwell-time distributions showed two exponential components (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). Such a pattern of dwell-time histograms uniquely identifies a bursting gating pattern with one open (O) and two closed (C<sub>fast</sub>, C<sub>slow</sub>) single-channel states. At conductance level N, the macrosystem of N such channels can exist in only one macro-state (all channels are in state O), giving rise to a single exponential distribution (the time constant of which equals the single-channel open time divided by N). Conversely, at conductance level N-1 the macro-system can exist in two possible macro-states: either N-1 channels are in state O and 1 channel in state C<sub>slow</sub> (giving rise to the slower component of the distribution), or N-1 channels are in state O and 1 channel in state C<sub>fast</sub> (giving rise to the faster component of the distribution). Finally, at levels below N-1 there are increasing numbers of possible macro-states, but those in which more than 1 channel simultaneously dwells in C<sub>fast</sub> will be negligibly visited. Therefore, at any conductance level k (&lt;N) only two components will be detected in practice: a slow component corresponding to the macro-state with k channels in state O and N-k channels in state C<sub>slow</sub>, and a fast component corresponding to the macro-state with k channels in state O, N-k-1 channels in state C<sub>slow</sub>, and 1 channel in state C<sub>fast</sub>. This pattern is very obvious in the histograms shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1. In summary, the presence of one exponential component at level N and two exponential components at level N-1 clearly identifies one open and two closed states, just as unambiguously as a single-exponential open-time distribution and a double-exponential closed-time distribution would do in a single-channel patch. A brief summary of this explanation is now included in the subsection “Catalytic cycle at the NUDT9-H domain is not coupled to gating conformational changes”.</p><p>The choice of a C-O-C model is indeed not unique for describing the observed gating pattern: a C-C-O model would be identically suitable. However, whereas the extracted transition rates obviously depend on the chosen model, the calculated mean burst and interburst durations are model-independent. This is now stated in Materials and methods (subsection “Kinetic analysis of microscopic current recordings”).</p><p>iii) Estimation of the correct number of channels in a multi-channel patch:</p><p>“Since the burst length calculation in multichannel patches is highly dependent on a correct estimation of the number of channels, the authors should clearly explain how this estimate was obtained and what are the limitations of the analysis as it was performed.”</p><p>Correct estimation of the number of active channels (N) is just as important for recordings with superimposed channel openings, as it is for the case of a patch in which no superimposed channel openings are seen. The approaches used to estimate N are also similar in both cases. In general, N can be estimated with high confidence when the P<sub>o</sub> is high, but not when the P<sub>o</sub> is low. For the nvTRPM2 constructs studied here P<sub>o</sub> was high (~0.8), and therefore, estimating N was not a problem.</p><p>The number of active channels in the patch (N) was estimated as the maximum number of simultaneously open channels (N'). The likelihood of the presence of additional active channels in the patch (i.e., the hypothesis of N&gt;N') was evaluated using a statistical test based on a comparison of channel opening rate (1/τ<sub>ib</sub>) with the cumulative time spent at level N' (Csanády et al., 2000). For all patches included in the analysis the possibility of N&gt;N' could be excluded with high confidence (p&lt;0.001). This is now stated in Materials and methods (subsection “subsection “Kinetic analysis of microscopic current recordings”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The excised patch data in some of the figures are not quantified.

In other words is the difference in the nudix box the sole reason for the lack of activity or did vertebrate channels accumulate other mutations also that destroy catalytic activity?</p></disp-quote><p>We could not ascertain whether the mutations in the key Nudix box positions (Figure 1, right, asterisks) are solely responsible for the loss of catalysis in vertebrate TRPM2 channels, as we were unable to obtain hsNUDT9-H constructs with &quot;revertant&quot; Nudix box motifs (Nudix box: R<underline>EF</underline>RQE or R<underline>EFGE</underline>E) in soluble form. Thus, although the Nudix box mutations are clearly <italic>sufficient</italic> to abrogate enzymatic activity (Figure 6B, Perraud et al., 2003), it remains possible that in vertebrate TRPM2 channels additional mutations have accumulated which are also incompatible with catalysis (cf., Kuhn et al., 2015). This is now discussed in the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is not clear that srNUDT9-H is an enzyme given the low k<sub>cat</sub>. This protein binds ADPR with a micromolar affinity, however the rate of catalysis is low and little affected by pH or Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Knowing that background ADPR hydrolysis occurs in their experimental setting (Figure 4A) and that non-functional enzymes have k<sub>cat</sub> values around 0.4 (Figure 6B), how confident are you that srNUDT9-H is a bona fide enzyme (k<sub>cat</sub> values around 1.5-2.0) compared to nvNUDT9-H (k<sub>cat</sub> near 40)? The authors might want to defend their conclusion that this is an enzyme or discuss the possibility that it is non-functional.</p></disp-quote><p>srNUDT9-H is clearly a functional enzyme. First, we now show that catalysis by srNUDT9-H is absolutely dependent on Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and also sensitive to pH (Figure 3B). Second, clearly separating even slow enzymatic activity from spontaneous background hydrolysis is not an issue, since those two processes can be discerned by increasing the amount of enzyme used in the assay. Indeed, even a <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> as low as 0.04 s<sup>-1</sup> (for the nvKK mutant, Figure 6B) can be reliably determined by our assay. We now show in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 the actual inorganic phosphate signal for all of the low-activity proteins, and compare them to the background signal. Third, we now show that full-length srTRPM2 is also enzymatically active (Figure 3C). Fourth, the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of ~2 s<sup>-1</sup> for srTRPM2 is taken per subunit, the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for a tetrameric channel is ~8 s<sup>-1</sup> (and might be further boosted by ~2-fold in very high Mg<sup>2+</sup> (cf., Figure 3B, and Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
