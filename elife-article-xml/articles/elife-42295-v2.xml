Without conserved global stress response regulators, how the obligate intracellular bacterium <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> arrives at a physiologically similar ‘persistent’ state in response to starvation of either nutrient remains unclear. Here, we report on the iron-dependent regulation of the <italic>trpRBA</italic> tryptophan salvage pathway in <italic>C. trachomatis.</italic> Iron starvation specifically induces <italic>trpBA</italic> expression from a novel promoter element within an intergenic region flanked by <italic>trpR</italic> and <italic>trpB</italic>. YtgR, the only known iron-dependent regulator in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, can bind to the <italic>trpRBA</italic> intergenic region upstream of the alternative <italic>trpBA</italic> promoter to repress transcription. Simultaneously, YtgR binding promotes the termination of transcripts from the primary promoter upstream of <italic>trpR</italic>. This is the first description of an iron-dependent mechanism regulating prokaryotic tryptophan biosynthesis that may indicate the existence of novel approaches to gene regulation and stress response in <italic>Chlamydia.</italic></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42295.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All forms of life must take up nutrients from their environment to survive. <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, a bacterium that causes many sexually-transmitted infections, is no exception.

Now, using human cells grown in the laboratory and infected with <italic>Chlamydia</italic> bacteria, Pokorzynski et al. show that iron starvation switches on the tryptophan salvage pathway. <italic>Chlamydia</italic> most likely senses changes in iron levels via a protein called YtgR, and a closer look at the bacterial DNA revealed that YtgR interacts with the genes of the tryptophan salvage pathway. When iron levels were high, YtgR locked on to the DNA in the middle of this set of genes. This effectively switched off the genes on either side of the binding site. When iron levels dropped, YtgR came away from the DNA, releasing the genes and allowing the cell to use them to start making its own tryptophan. Together these findings indicate that, when the bacteria sense that iron levels have dropped, they prepare for a shortage of tryptophan too.</p><p>Chlamydia is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide.

This and future studies aimed at understanding how these bacteria respond to immune attack may reveal new ways to prevent or treat these infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic></kwd><kwd>stress response</kwd><kwd>tryptophan biosynthesis</kwd><kwd>iron-dependent regulation</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>repression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI065545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carabeo</surname><given-names>Rey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008227</institution-id><institution>Achievement Rewards for College Scientists Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pokorzynski</surname><given-names>Nick D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31AI136295</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pokorzynski</surname><given-names>Nick D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM008336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pokorzynski</surname><given-names>Nick D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AI007025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brinkworth</surname><given-names>Amanda J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI132406</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carabeo</surname><given-names>Rey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of the atypical tryptophan biosynthetic operon of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> revealed the simultaneous regulation of transcriptional initiation and termination by an iron-dependent repressor, expanding known regulatory mechanisms of this pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nutrient acquisition is critical for the success of pathogenic bacteria. Many pathogenic bacteria must siphon nutrients from their hosts, such as nucleotides, amino acids and biometals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eisenreich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ray et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skaar, 2010</xref>). This common feature among pathogens renders them susceptible to nutrient limitation strategies associated with the host immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hood and Skaar, 2012</xref>). Counteractively, bacterial pathogens have evolved sophisticated molecular mechanisms to respond to nutrient deprivation, involving increasingly complex and sophisticated nutrient-sensing regulatory networks. These stress response mechanisms are essential for pathogens to avoid clearance by the immune system. By delineating their function at the molecular level, we can better target aspects of the host-pathogen interface suitable for therapeutic manipulation. However, stress responses in the obligate intracellular bacterium <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> are relatively poorly characterized, leaving unanswered many fundamental questions about the biology of this pathogen.</p><p><italic>C. trachomatis</italic> is the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and infection-derived preventable blindness worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">CDC, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Newman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>). Genital infections of chlamydia disproportionately affect women and are associated with serious sequelae in the female reproductive tract such as tubal factor infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hafner, 2015</xref>). Chlamydiae are Gram-negative bacterial parasites that develop within a pathogen-specified membrane-bound organelle termed the inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore and Ouellette, 2014</xref>). Chlamydial development is uniquely characterized by a biphasic interconversion of an infectious elementary body (EB) with a non-infectious, but replicative reticulate body (RB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelrahman and Belland, 2005</xref>). An obligate intracellular lifestyle has led to reductive genome evolution across chlamydial species; Chlamydiae have retained genes uniquely required for their survival, but have become nutritionally dependent on their hosts by discarding many metabolism-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clarke, 2011</xref>). Of note, <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> does not possess genes necessary for eliciting a stringent response to nutrient starvation (<italic>e.g. relA, spoT</italic>), suggesting that this pathogen may utilize novel mechanisms to respond to nutrient stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stephens et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>It is well established that in response to various stressors, Chlamydiae deviate from their normal developmental program to initiate an aberrant developmental state, termed ‘persistence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wyrick, 2010</xref>). This persistent state is distinguished by the presence of viable, but non-cultivable, abnormally enlarged chlamydial organisms that display dysregulated gene expression. Importantly, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> can be reactivated from persistence by abatement of the stress condition. As such, chlamydial persistence at least superficially resembles a global stress response mechanism. Yet the mechanistic underpinnings of this phenotype are poorly understood, with most published studies focusing on the molecular and metabolic character of the aberrant, persistent form. It is therefore unclear to what extent primary stress responses contribute to the global persistent phenotype in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p><p>The best described inducer of persistence is the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). The bacteriostatic effect of IFN-γ has been primarily attributed to host cell tryptophan (Trp) catabolism, an amino acid for which <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> is auxotrophic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Byrne et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fehlner-Gardiner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taylor and Feng, 1991</xref>). Following IFN-γ stimulation, infected host cells up-regulate expression of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1), which catabolizes Trp to <italic>N</italic>-formylkynurenine via cleavage of the indole ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Macchiarulo et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> cannot recycle kynurenines, unlike some other chlamydial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wood et al., 2004</xref>), and thus IFN-γ stimulation effectively results in Trp starvation to <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>. The primary regulatory response to Trp starvation in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> is mediated by a TrpR ortholog, whose Trp-dependent binding to cognate promoter elements represses transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akers and Tan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlson et al., 2006</xref>). This mechanism of regulatory control is presumably limited in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, as homologs of genes regulated by TrpR in other bacteria (<italic>e.g. trpF, aroH, aroL</italic>) have not been shown to respond to Trp limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wood et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In many Gram-negative bacteria, such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>trpR</italic> is monocistronic and distal to the Trp biosynthetic operon. In <italic>C. trachomatis,</italic> TrpR is encoded in an operon, <italic>trpRBA</italic>, which also contains the Trp synthase α- and β- subunits (TrpA and TrpB, respectively), and possesses a 348 base-pair (bp) intergenic region (IGR) that separates <italic>trpR</italic> from <italic>trpBA</italic>. TrpBA catalyzes the final steps of Trp biosynthesis in bacteria; TrpA converts indoleglycerol-3-phosphate (IGP) to indole which is then condensed with serine by TrpB to form Trp. In <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, TrpA cannot bind IGP and thus <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> requires indole as a substrate to synthesize Trp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fehlner-Gardiner et al., 2002</xref>). Despite significant research on the chlamydial <italic>trpRBA</italic> operon, the functional significance of the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR is poorly characterized. While a putative TrpR operator sequence was identified in the IGR overlapping an alternative transcriptional origin for <italic>trpBA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlson et al., 2006</xref>), TrpR binding was not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akers and Tan, 2006</xref>). Based on in silico predictions, an attenuator sequence has been annotated within the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merino and Yanofsky, 2005</xref>), but this has not been thoroughly validated experimentally. Regardless, the IGR is &gt;99% conserved at the nucleotide sequence level across ocular, genital and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) serovars of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, indicating functional importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seth-Smith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stephens et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thomson et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, outside of TrpR-mediated repression, the complete detail of <italic>trpRBA</italic> regulation remains poorly elucidated and previous reports have indicated the possibility of more complex mechanisms of regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brinkworth et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The requirement of TrpBA for <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> to survive IFN-γ-mediated Trp starvation is well documented. However, IFN-γ is also known to limit iron and other essential biometals to intracellular pathogens as a component of host nutritional immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cassat and Skaar, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hood and Skaar, 2012</xref>). Whether <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> has adapted to respond to these various IFN-γ-mediated insults remains unclear. <italic>Chlamydia</italic> have a strict iron dependence for normal development, evidenced by the onset of persistence following prolonged iron limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raulston, 1997</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> presumably acquire iron via vesicular interactions between the chlamydial inclusion and slow-recycling transferrin (Tf)-containing endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ouellette and Carabeo, 2010</xref>). IFN-γ is known to down-regulate transferrin receptor (TfR) expression in both monocytes and epithelial cells with replicative consequences for resident intracellular bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrd and Horwitz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrd and Horwitz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Igietseme et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nairz et al., 2008</xref>). However, iron homeostasis in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is poorly understood due to the lack of functionally characterized homologs to iron acquisition machinery that are highly conserved in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pokorzynski et al., 2017</xref>). Only the <italic>ytgABCD</italic> operon, encoding a metal permease, has been clearly linked to iron acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miller et al., 2009</xref>). Intriguingly, the YtgC (CTL0325) open reading frame (ORF) encodes a N-terminal permease domain fused to a C-terminal DtxR-like repressor domain, annotated YtgR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>). YtgR is cleaved from the permease domain during infection and functions as an iron-dependent transcriptional repressor to autoregulate the expression of its own operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>). YtgR represents the only identified iron-dependent transcriptional regulator in <italic>Chlamydia.</italic> Whether YtgR maintains a more diverse transcriptional regulon beyond the <italic>ytgABCD</italic> operon has not yet been addressed and remains an intriguing question in the context of immune-mediated iron limitation to <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>.</p><p>Consistent with the highly reduced capacity of the chlamydial genome, it is likely that <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> has a limited ability to tailor a specific response to each individual stress. In the absence of identifiable homologs for most global stress response regulators in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, we hypothesized that primary stress responses to pleiotropic insults may involve mechanisms of co-regulation by stress-responsive transcription factors. Here, we report on the unique iron-dependent regulation of the <italic>trpRBA</italic> operon in <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis.</italic> We propose a model of iron-dependent transcriptional regulation of <italic>trpRBA</italic> mediated by the repressor YtgR binding specifically to the IGR, which would enable <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> to respond similarly to the antimicrobial deprivation of Trp or iron mediated by IFN-γ. Such a mechanism of iron-dependent regulation of Trp biosynthesis has not been previously described in any other prokaryote and adds to the catalog of regulatory models for Trp biosynthetic operons in bacteria. Further, it reveals a highly dynamic mode of regulatory integration within the <italic>trpRBA</italic> operon, employing bipartite control at the transcription initiation and termination steps.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Brief iron limitation via 2,2-bipyridyl treatment yields iron-starved, but non-persistent <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic></title><p>To identify possible instances of regulatory integration between iron and Trp starvation in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, we optimized a stress response condition that preceded the development of a characteristically persistent phenotype. We reasoned that in order to effectively identify regulatory integration, we would need to investigate the bacterium under stressed, but not aberrant, growth conditions such that we could distinguish primary stress responses from abnormal growth. To specifically investigate the possible contribution of iron limitation to a broader immunological (<italic>e.g.</italic> IFN-γ-mediated) stress, we utilized the membrane-permeable iron chelator 2,2-bipyridyl (Bpdl), which has the advantage of rapidly and homogeneously starving <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> of iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thompson and Carabeo, 2011</xref>). We chose to starve <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovar L2 of iron starting at 12 hr post-infection (hpi), or roughly at the beginning of mid-cycle growth. At this point the chlamydial organisms represent a uniform population of replicative RBs that are fully competent, both transcriptionally and translationally, to respond to stress. We treated infected HeLa cell cultures with 100 μM Bpdl or mock for either 6 or 12 hr (hrs) to determine a condition sufficient to limit iron to <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> without inducing hallmark persistent phenotypes. We stained infected cells seeded on glass coverslips with convalescent human sera and analyzed chlamydial inclusion morphology under both Bpdl- and mock-treated conditions by laser point-scanning confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Following 6 hr of Bpdl treatment, chlamydial inclusions were largely indistinguishable from mock-treated inclusions, containing a homogeneous population of larger organisms, consistent with RBs in mid-cycle growth. However, by 12 hr of Bpdl treatment, the inclusions began to display signs of aberrant growth: they were perceptibly smaller, more comparable in size to 18 hpi, and contained noticeably fewer organisms, perhaps indicating a defect in bacterial replication or RB-to-EB differentiation. These observations were consistent with our subsequent analysis of genome replication by quantitative PCR (qPCR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At 6 hr of Bpdl treatment, there was no statistically distinguishable difference in genome copy number when compared to the equivalent mock-treated time-point. However, by 12 hr of treatment, genome copy number was significantly reduced 4.47-fold in the Bpdl-treated group relative to mock-treatment (p<italic>=</italic>0.00151). We then assayed the transcript expression of two markers for persistence by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR): the early gene <italic>euo</italic>, encoding a transcriptional repressor of late-cycle genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and the adhesin <italic>omcB,</italic> which is expressed late in the developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Characteristic persistence would display elevated <italic>euo</italic> expression late into infection and suppressed <italic>omcB</italic> expression throughout development. We observed that at 6 hr of Bpdl treatment, there was no statistically distinguishable difference in either <italic>euo</italic> or <italic>omcB</italic> expression when compared to the mock-treatment. Still at 12 hr of Bpdl treatment, <italic>euo</italic> expression was unchanged. However, <italic>omcB</italic> expression was significantly up-regulated following 12 hr of Bpdl-treatment (p<italic>=</italic>0.0024). This was unexpected, but we note that <italic>omcB</italic> expression has been shown to vary between chlamydial serovars and species when starved for iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pokorzynski et al., 2017</xref>). The decision to begin our brief iron starvation at 12 hpi may produce notable transcriptional differences from previous studies in which iron starvation was induced at the beginning of the chlamydial developmental cycle, and thereby prevented the establishment of a normal transcriptional program by <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Collectively, these data indicated that 6 hr of Bpdl treatment was a more suitable time-point at which to monitor iron-limited stress responses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42295.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Brief iron limitation via 2,2-bipyridyl treatment precedes the onset of characteristic chlamydial persistence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2-infected HeLa cells were fixed and stained with convalescent human sera to image inclusion morphology by confocal microscopy following Bpdl treatment at the indicated times post-infection.

These data therefore also indicated that 6 hr of treatment would be ideal to monitor non-persistent responses to Trp limitation.</p><p>We next sought to determine whether our brief 6 hr Bpdl treatment was sufficient to elicit a transcriptional iron starvation phenotype. We chose to analyze the expression of three previously identified iron-regulated transcripts, <italic>ytgA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), <italic>ahpC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and <italic>devB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), by RT-qPCR under Bpdl- and mock-treated conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thompson and Carabeo, 2011</xref>). In addition, we analyzed the expression of one non-iron-regulated transcript, <italic>dnaB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), as a negative control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brinkworth et al., 2018</xref>). Following 6 hr of Bpdl treatment, we observed that the transcript expression of the periplasmic iron-binding protein <italic>ytgA</italic> was significantly elevated 1.75-fold relative to the equivalent mock-treated time-point (p=0.0052). However, we did not observe induction of <italic>ytgA</italic> transcript expression relative to the 12 hpi time-point. Here, we considered that apparent increases in transcription could be due to two factors: developmental regulation and transcriptional response to stress. Therefore, expression of genes of interest were monitored over time, for example 18 versus 12 hpi, in addition to single-timepoint comparisons, for example 18 hpi only. While we did not observe induction of <italic>ytgA</italic> over time, which would be more consistent with an iron-starved phenotype (<italic>i.e.</italic> ‘turning on’ gene expression), we reason that this is a consequence of the brief treatment period. This is in agreement with the need to prolong iron chelation to observe the transcriptional induction of <italic>ytgA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raulston et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thompson and Carabeo, 2011</xref>).

The modestly elevated expression of these genes likely represents <italic>bona fide</italic> transcriptional responses to iron starvation given that the treatment condition was optimized to avoid gross changes in chlamydial development. The transcript expression of <italic>devB</italic>, encoding a 6-phosphogluconolactonase involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, was not observed to significantly respond to our brief iron limitation condition, suggesting that it is not a component of the primary iron starvation stress response in <italic>C. trachomatis.</italic> As expected, the transcript expression of <italic>dnaB</italic>, a replicative DNA helicase, was not altered by our iron starvation condition, consistent with its presumably iron-independent regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brinkworth et al., 2018</xref>).

The truncated Trp biosynthetic operon, <italic>trpRBA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), has been repeatedly linked to the ability of genital and LGV serovars (D-K and L1-3, respectively) of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> to counter IFN-γ-mediated stress. This is due to the capacity of the chlamydial Trp synthase in these serovars to catalyze the β synthase reaction, that is the condensation of indole to the amino acid serine to form Trp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fehlner-Gardiner et al., 2002</xref>). In the presence of exogenous indole, <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> is therefore able to biosynthesize Trp such that it can prevent the development of IFN-γ-mediated persistence.

Here again, we analyzed changes in transcript levels at the 18 hpi time-point and between the 12 hpi and 12 hpi + 6 hr time-points. This allowed us to determine if differences in expression could be accounted for by reduced, maintained or induced expression relative to 12 hpi. When starved for Trp for 6 hr, we observed that the expression of <italic>trpR</italic>, <italic>trpB</italic> and <italic>trpA</italic> were all significantly induced greater than 5.18-fold relative to 12 hpi (p=0.0040, 0.020 and 0.0036, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). All three ORFs were also significantly elevated relative to the equivalent mock-treated time-point (p=0.0039, 0.019 and 0.0035, respectively).

While we observed that the transcript expression of all three ORFs was significantly elevated at least 2.1-fold relative to the equivalent mock-treated time-point (p=0.015, 0.00098 and 0.0062, respectively), we made the intriguing observation that only the expression of <italic>trpB</italic> and <italic>trpA</italic> was significantly induced relative to 12 hpi (p=0.00383 and 0.0195, respectively). The marginal elevation in <italic>trpR</italic> expression at the 18 hpi time-point was surprising given that this gene was not identified as iron-responsive in a recent genome-wide RNA-sequencing study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brinkworth et al., 2018</xref>).

Taken together, these findings demonstrate that an important stress response pathway, the <italic>trpRBA</italic> operon, is regulated by the availability of both Trp and iron, consistent with the notion that the pathway may be cooperatively regulated to respond to various stress conditions. Notably, iron-dependent regulation of Trp biosynthesis has not been previously documented in other prokaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Specific iron-regulated expression of <italic>trpBA</italic> originates from a novel alternative transcriptional start site within the <italic>trpRBA</italic> intergenic region</title><p>We hypothesized that the specific iron-related induction of <italic>trpBA</italic> expression relative to <italic>trpR</italic> expression may be attributable to an iron-regulated alternative transcriptional start site (alt.

Given the low expression of the <italic>trpRBA</italic> operon during normal development, we utilized two sequential gene-specific amplification steps (nested 5’-RACE) to identify 5’ cDNA ends in the <italic>trpRBA</italic> operon. These nested RACE conditions resulted in amplification that was specific to infected-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Using this approach, we analyzed four conditions: 12 hpi, 18 hpi, 12 hpi + 6 hr of Bpdl treatment, and 12 hpi + 6 hr of Trp-depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We observed three RACE products that migrated with an apparent size of 1.5, 1.1 and 1.0 kilobases (kb). At 12 and 18 hpi, all three RACE products exhibited low abundance, even following the nested PCR amplification. This observation was consistent with the expectation that the expression of the <italic>trpRBA</italic> operon is very low under normal, iron and Trp-replete conditions. However, we note that the 6 hr difference in development did appear to alter the representation of the 5’ cDNA ends, which may suggest a stage-specific promoter utilization within the <italic>trpRBA</italic> operon. In our Trp starvation condition, we observed an apparent increase in the abundance of the 1.5 kb RACE product, which was therefore presumed to represent the primary TSS upstream of <italic>trpR</italic>, at nucleotide position 511,389 (<italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2 434/Bu). Interestingly, the 1.0 kb product displayed a very similar apparent enrichment following Bpdl treatment, suggesting that this RACE product represented a specifically iron-regulated TSS. Both the 1.5 and 1.0 kb RACE products were detectable in the Trp-depleted and iron-depleted conditions, respectively, during the primary RACE amplification, consistent with their induction under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42295.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Iron-dependent induction of <italic>trpBA</italic> expression initiates within the <italic>trpRBA</italic> intergenic region from a novel alternative transcriptional start site.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Total RNA was harvested from infected HeLa cells at the indicated times post-infection to examine iron-dependent and Trp-dependent changes in the 5’-cDNA profile of the <italic>trpRBA</italic> operon by Rapid Amplification of 5’ cDNA Ends (5’-RACE).

In brief, a candidate DNA promoter element was cloned into the pCCT expression vector between an arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter and the reporter gene <italic>lacZ</italic>. This plasmid was co-transformed into BL21 (DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> along with an IPTG-inducible pET151 expression vector with (pET151-YtgR) or without (pET151-EV) the C-terminal 139 amino acid residues of CTL0325 (YtgC). Note that we have previously demonstrated that this region is a functional iron-dependent repressor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>). To verify the functionality of this assay, we determined whether ectopic YtgR expression could repress pCCT reporter gene expression in the presence of three candidate DNA elements: a no-insert empty vector (pCCT-EV), the putative promoter element for <italic>C. trachomatis dnaB</italic> (pCCT-<italic>dnaB</italic>), and the promoter region of the <italic>ytgABCD</italic> operon (pCCT-<italic>ytgABCD</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). As expected, from the pCCT-EV reporter construct, ectopic YtgR expression did not significantly reduce the activity of β-galactosidase. Additionally, reporter gene expression from pCCT-<italic>dnaB</italic>, containing the promoter of non-iron-regulated <italic>dnaB,</italic> was not affected by ectopic expression of YtgR. In contrast, in the presence of pCCT-<italic>ytgABCD</italic>, induction of YtgR expression produced a significant decrease in β-galactosidase activity (p=0.03868) consistent with its previously reported auto-regulation of this promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Using this same assay, we then inserted into the pCCT reporter plasmid 1) the <italic>trpR</italic> promoter element (pCCT-<italic>trpR</italic>), 2) the putative <italic>trpBA</italic> promoter element represented by the IGR (pCCT-<italic>trpBA</italic>), and 3) the same putative <italic>trpBA</italic> promoter element with a mutated YtgR operator sequence that was diminished for both palindromicity and A-T richness, two typical features of prokaryotic promoter elements (pCCT-<italic>trpBA</italic>ΔOp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmitt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tao et al., 1992</xref>). Note that the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR is &gt;99% conserved at the nucleotide level across urogenital, ocular and LGV serovars of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, and the putative YtgR operator sequence is 100% identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). When YtgR was ectopically expressed in the pCCT-<italic>trpR</italic> background, we observed no statistically distinguishable change in β-galactosidase activity, indicating YtgR could not regulate transcription from the <italic>trpR</italic> promoter. However, in the pCCT-<italic>trpBA</italic> background, ectopic YtgR expression significantly reduced β-galactosidase activity at levels similar to those observed in the pCCT-<italic>ytgABCD</italic> background (p=0.01219). This suggested that YtgR was capable of repressing transcription from the <italic>trpBA</italic> promoter element specifically. Interestingly, this repression phenotype was abrogated in the pCCT-<italic>trpBA</italic>ΔOp background, where we observed no statistically meaningful difference in β-galactosidase activity, demonstrating that YtgR transcriptional repression of <italic>trpBA</italic> is operator-dependent. We subsequently addressed whether the region of the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR containing the YtgR operator site was sufficient to confer YtgR repression in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We cloned three fragments of the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR into the pCCT reporter plasmid: the first fragment represented the 5’-end of the IGR containing the operator site at the 3’-end (pCCT-IGR1), the second fragment represented a central region of the IGR containing the operator site at the 5’-end (pCCT-IGR2), and the third fragment represented the 3’-end of the IGR and did not contain the operator site (pCCT-IGR3). Surprisingly, we observed that none of these fragments alone were capable of producing a significant repression phenotype in our reporter system.</p><p>To verify that YtgR repression of the <italic>trpBA</italic> promoter element was dependent upon iron availability, we assessed repressor activity in the presence or absence of 500 µM Bpdl, mimicking previously utilized approaches for assessing iron-dependent repressor activity of the homologous DtxR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ding et al., 1996</xref>). YtgR is known to bind cognate DNA elements in an iron-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>), and as such any repressor activity of YtgR should be a direct consequence of its ability to bind DNA in the presence of iron. When we treated co-transformed <italic>E. coli</italic> expressing YtgR and harboring the pCCT-<italic>trpBA</italic> reporter plasmid, we observed a modest but statistically significant increase in β-galactosidase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; p=0.01409), consistent with the alleviation of YtgR repression at the <italic>trpBA</italic> promoter element.</p><p>To demonstrate that the repression phenotype observed in this reporter system was attributable to DNA-binding of YtgR, we optimized a targeted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) qPCR method to detect the abundance of co-immunoprecipitated promoter fragments with the recombinant YtgR domain. As before, we co-transformed the pET151-YtgR expression vector with pCCT-<italic>trpBA</italic>, pCCT-<italic>trpBA</italic>∆Op, pCCT-<italic>trpR</italic> or pCCT-<italic>dnaB</italic> and then fixed the co-transformed cells with formaldehyde prior to immunoprecipitation of the cross-linked 6xHis-YtgR-DNA complexes. Using this system, we observed a significant enrichment of <italic>trpBA</italic> promoter relative to the <italic>dnaB</italic> negative control promoter (p=0.0018; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). However, enrichment of the <italic>trpR</italic> promoter was marginal and not statistically distinguishable from that of <italic>dnaB.</italic> Consistent with its requirement for repression, enrichment of <italic>trpBA∆</italic>Op was also marginal and statistically indistinguishable from <italic>trpR</italic> or <italic>dnaB</italic>, suggesting that mutation of the putative operator sequence alone is sufficient to abrogate YtgR DNA-binding to the <italic>trpBA</italic> promoter. In conjunction with the IGR fragment analysis, these findings indicated that while the operator site was necessary for YtgR DNA-binding and transcriptional repression, further unknown structural elements in the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR may be required for repression. Nonetheless, this demonstrated the existence of a functional YtgR binding site that conferred transcriptional regulation to <italic>trpBA</italic>, independent of the major <italic>trpR</italic> promoter. Collectively, the most parsimonious model derived from these data is that specific and direct iron-dependent DNA-binding of YtgR at the identified operator site acts to repress expression of genes downstream of the <italic>trpBA</italic> promoter element.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Transcripts initiated at the primary <italic>trpR</italic> promoter terminate at the YtgR operator site</title><p>We hypothesized that YtgR binding at the <italic>trpRBA</italic> YtgR operator site may disadvantage the processivity of RNAP reading-through the IGR from the upstream <italic>trpR</italic> promoter, possibly leading to transcript termination.

Using this coverage map, we sought to semi-quantitatively assess the mapping of reads across the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR to gain insight regarding possible transcription readthrough.

This observation is consistent with the alleviation of YtgR repression under iron-starved conditions permitting readthrough of transcription from the upstream <italic>trpR</italic> promoter. However, due to high variation and the low number of reads mapping to this region, we were unable to detect a significant difference in coverage (p=0.11) using the genomewide RNA-seq analysis toolkit in the CLC Genomics Workbench. Regardless, a comparable increase in reads mapping to the upstream <italic>trpR</italic> CDS was not observed (1.54-fold increase, p=0.32), suggesting that under iron replete conditions, transcripts originating from the primary <italic>trpR</italic> promoter may be terminated before reading through the IGR, thereby accounting for the increase in reads mapping to IGR_trpB following Bpdl treatment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42295.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Transcription from the primary <italic>trpR</italic> promoter terminates in the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR at the YtgR operator site.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coverage map of RNA-Sequencing reads mapped to the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2/434 Bu genome (NC_010287) edited to contain annotations for IGRs.

For both IGR_euo (1.17-fold, p=0.58) and IGR_lpdA (1.40-fold, p=0.37), we did not observe a similar increase in read coverage following Bpdl treatment indicating that the increased coverage at IGR_trpB is likely specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Qualitatively, we note that only IGR_trpB displays relatively uniform read coverage across the defined region, while both IGR_euo and IGR_lpdA have non-uniform coverage, reinforcing the idea that the reads mapping to IGR_trpB originate upstream in the <italic>trpR</italic> ORF and readthrough the entire region, thus presenting the opportunity for premature termination.

We extracted individual RPKM values for each of these regions from this dataset and observed the same trend in mean fold-change differences reported from the genomewide analysis: only IGR_trpB was substantially increased relative to its upstream ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Despite being informative, genomewide RNA-Seq is ultimately insufficient to elucidate particular mechanistic details of transcriptional regulation in the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR and therefore we turned to more sensitive and quantitative methods to investigate possible transcript termination within the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR.</p><p>To identify transcription termination sites (T<bold><underline>T</underline></bold>Ss) in the <italic>trpRBA</italic> operon in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, we utilized 3’-RACE to map the 3’-ends of transcripts using gene-specific primers within the <italic>trpR</italic> CDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; lower panel). We again utilized two RACE amplification cycles to generate distinct, specific bands suitable for isolation and sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>). By gel electrophoresis of the 3’-RACE products, we observed the appearance of four distinct bands that migrated with an apparent size of 0.55, 0.45, 0.40 and 0.20 kb. In our Trp-depleted condition, we observed only a very weak amplification of the 2.5–3 kb full-length <italic>trpRBA</italic> message by 3’-RACE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, we did observe it across all replicates.

As expected, only in the Trp-depleted sample did we observe robust amplification of the full-length <italic>trpRBA</italic> message. We note however that image contrast adjustment reveals a very weak band present in all experimental samples. Therefore, the specific 3’-RACE analysis identified novel transcription termination events within the <italic>trpRBA</italic> operon.</p><p>To identify the specific TTS locations, we gel extracted the four distinct 3’-RACE bands across all conditions and cloned them into the pRACE sequencing vector as was done for the 5’-RACE experiments. We then sequenced the inserted RACE products and mapped them to the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2 434/Bu genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This revealed a highly dynamic TTS landscape within the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR, which has not previously been investigated (For a full description of mapped 3’-RACE products, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The 0.20 kb RACE product mapped to the 3’-end of the <italic>trpR</italic> CDS, with a mean nucleotide position of 511,665 and a modal nucleotide position of 511,667 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Contrastingly, the other three 3’-RACE products did not map in such a way so as to produce specific, unambiguous modal peaks. Instead, their distribution was broader and more even, with only a few nucleotide positions mapping more than once. Accordingly, the 0.45 kb product mapped with an average nucleotide position of 511,889, just downstream of the 1.1 kb 5’-RACE product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4C</xref>), while the 0.55 kb product mapped with an average nucleotide position of 511,986, upstream of the 1.0 kb 5’-RACE product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4D</xref>).

Thus, for amplicons downstream of termination sites, a higher downstream amplicon-to-common amplicon ratio would indicate increased readthrough.

As before, we assayed four conditions: 12 hpi, 18 hpi, 12 hpi +6 hr Bpdl and 12 hpi +6 hr Trp-depletion. Under normal developmental conditions, we expected that there would not be dramatic changes in readthrough, though we note that changes in development or nutrient availability could have this affect under normal conditions. Under Trp-depleted conditions, we predicted that the inactivation of the TrpR repressor would produce a robust readthrough phenotype that, in accordance with the literature and evidence provided herein, would transcribe the full-length <italic>trpRBA</italic> message. Thus, Trp-depletion served as a positive control for our readthrough analysis. We hypothesized that under iron-depleted conditions, we would not observe a significant increase in readthrough 5’ of the YtgR operator site, but when YtgR is inactivated, we should be able to detect an increase in readthrough 3’ of the operator site as the transcription machinery is no longer blocked by the bound repressor and is permitted to continue transcription into the downstream sequence.</p><p>Consistent with our model, readthrough 5’ of the YtgR operator site was not affected by Bpdl treatment, whereas Trp-depletion resulted in significantly more readthrough than all other conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; p&lt;0.05 for all comparisons). However, 3’ of the YtgR operator site, Bpdl treatment significantly increased readthrough compared to 12 and 18 hpi (p&lt;0.05 for all comparisons), suggesting that inactivation of YtgR by iron depletion alleviates transcription termination at this site. We performed this same analysis with an alternative amplicon 3’ of the YtgR operator site and observed a similar increase in readthrough, confirming that the effect was not unique to the amplicon we used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>; p&lt;0.005 for all comparisons). When this readthrough analysis is applied 3’ of the alternative <italic>trpB</italic> TSS, we observe that following Bpdl-treatment, the readthrough value substantially exceeds 1.0, consistent with transcription of <italic>trpBA</italic> independent of <italic>trpR</italic> under this condition. Moreover, only the Bpdl-treated group is significantly different from the other treatment conditions (p&lt;0.05 for all comparisons). Notably, Trp-depletion did not increase the readthrough value, suggesting that Trp-depletion does not relieve YtgR repression at the alt. TSS and the levels of <italic>trpA</italic> remain relatively constant to those of <italic>trpR</italic>. It is therefore possible that under Trp-depleted, but iron-replete conditions, YtgR repression of the alternative <italic>trpBA</italic> promoter acts as a rheostat for full-length <italic>trpRBA</italic> transcription, helping to maintain a constant ratio of <italic>trpR</italic> to <italic>trpBA</italic>. Together, these analyses indicated that iron limitation resulted in transcription readthrough specifically at the YtgR operator site.</p><p>To investigate whether or not this readthrough phenotype was dependent upon YtgR, we again turned to our heterologous two-plasmid reporter system. We designed a reporter vector (pCCT-RT) that harbored the entire <italic>trpR</italic>-IGR DNA sequence such that any transcription initiated at the upstream arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter would have to readthrough the entire <italic>trpR</italic> ORF and the IGR before reaching the reporter gene <italic>lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Note that this is functionally similar to expression of the <italic>trpRBA</italic> operon under Trp-starved conditions: the major Trp-dependent promoter upstream of <italic>trpR</italic> would be activated and initiate readthrough independent of the presence of YtgR bound downstream in the IGR. As such, we performed the same RT-qPCR readthrough analysis on RNA harvested from BL21 (DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> co-transformed with pCCT-RT and either pET151-EV or pET151-YtgR. We observed that ectopic expression of YtgR significantly reduced readthrough into the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>; p=0.003561), consistent with YtgR DNA-binding specifically inhibiting readthrough via a mechanism of transcript termination at the operator site. In support of this result, we additionally observed a significant decrease in β-galactosidase activity as measured by the Miller assay from the pCCT-RT vector when YtgR was ectopically expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>; p=0.01723), indicating that YtgR-dependent inhibition of readthrough limits the expression of downstream genes. In sum, YtgR binding to the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR at the predicted operator site concomitantly represses transcription from the alternative <italic>trpBA</italic> promoter while blockading transcription readthrough from the upstream <italic>trpR</italic> promoter, ultimately rendering the expression of <italic>trpBA</italic> susceptible to changes in iron availability. Importantly, alleviated transcript termination at the YtgR operator site may offer a mechanistic explanation for the moderate elevation in <italic>trpR</italic> expression observed following iron starvation, as enhanced readthrough at the YtgR operator site under this condition may produce more stable mRNA species relative to normally developing <italic>C. trachomatis.</italic> Thus, YtgR may function as an iron-dependent attenuator of <italic>trpRBA</italic> expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we provide a mechanistic explanation for the specific iron-limited induction of <italic>trpBA</italic> expression mediated by the repressor YtgR, representing a novel instance of integrated stress adaptation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Utilizing an infected-epithelial cell culture model, we identified a previously undescribed iron-regulated promoter element independent of <italic>trpR</italic> within the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR that is responsible for the iron-limited induction of <italic>trpBA</italic> expression. Using in silico and biochemical methods, we demonstrate that YtgR binds the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR to regulate iron-dependent <italic>trpBA</italic> expression. Importantly, transcriptional repression in our heterologous system was shown to be dependent on an unaltered operator sequence that bears significant homology to the previously defined operator element in the <italic>ytgA</italic> promoter. Furthermore, our infected-cell culture studies revealed that transcripts originating from the primary <italic>trpR</italic> promoter terminate within the IGR, notably at the putative YtgR operator site, and that transcription read-through at this locus is iron- and YtgR-dependent. Thus, we propose that YtgR regulates <italic>trpBA</italic> expression at two levels: repression of the <italic>trpBA</italic> promoter and premature termination of the major transcript generated from the <italic>trpR</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; a comprehensive graphic of all T(S/T)Ss is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

TSS within the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlson et al. (2006)</xref> identified an alt. TSS within the IGR which they suggested was responsible for <italic>trpBA</italic> expression. In these studies, we were unable to confirm the presence of the previously identified alt. TSS by 5’-RACE. This is likely because Carlson, <italic>et al</italic>. examined the presence of transcript origins following 24 hr of Trp starvation, whereas here we monitored immediate responses to stress following only 6 hr of treatment. Prolonged Trp depletion would result in a more homogeneously stressed population of chlamydial organisms that may exhibit the same preferential utilization of the promoter identified by Carlson, <italic>et al</italic>., the detection of which is precluded in a more heterogeneous, transiently-stressed population. This may explain the observation of multiple T(S/T)Ss across the <italic>trpRBA</italic> operon in our studies. However, the contribution of such a Trp-dependent alt. TSS as identified by Carlson <italic>et al.</italic> to the general stress response of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> remains unclear given its association with presumably abnormal organisms. Does utilization of this alt. TSS indicate abnormal growth or a <italic>bona fide</italic> stress adaptation? Moreover, Akers and Tan were unable to verify TrpR binding to the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR by EMSA, suggesting that some other Trp-dependent mechanism may control transcription from this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akers and Tan, 2006</xref>). Ultimately, our approach of investigating more immediate responses to stress revealed previously unreported mechanisms functioning to regulate Trp biosynthesis in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, underscoring the value of transient as opposed to sustained induction of stress.</p><p>Another mechanism of regulation reported to control the chlamydial <italic>trpRBA</italic> operon is Trp-dependent transcription attenuation. Based on sequence analysis, a leader peptide has been annotated within the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merino and Yanofsky, 2005</xref>). Presumably, this functions analogously to the attenuator in the <italic>E. coli trpEDCBA</italic> operon; Trp starvation causes ribosome stalling at sites of enriched Trp codons such that specific RNA secondary structures form to facilitate RNAP readthrough of downstream sequences – in the case of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, <italic>trpBA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yanofsky, 1981</xref>). However, robust experimental evidence to support the existence of attenuation in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> is lacking. To date, the only experimental evidence that supports this model was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlson et al. (2006)</xref>, who demonstrated that in a TrpR-mutant genetic background, an additional increase in <italic>trpBA</italic> expression could be observed following 24 hr Trp-depletion. However, this could be attributable to an alternative Trp-dependent, but TrpR-independent mechanism controlling <italic>trpBA</italic> expression at the alt. TSS identified by Carlson, <italic>et al</italic>. None of the data presented here point conclusively to the existence of a Trp-dependent attenuator. The additional termination sites identified in our 3’-RACE assay may represent termination events mediated by a Trp-dependent attenuator, but without more specific analysis utilizing mutated sequences we cannot attribute attenuator function to those termination sites. We cannot exclude the possibility that the other TTSs observed in our 3’-RACE analysis are iron-dependent, or the product of other forms of post-transcriptional regulation such as RNA processing, stability, etc. Our focus herein was to determine the YtgR-mediated mechanism of regulation, and we have defined at least one iron-dependent, YtgR-mediated termination site. Iron-dependent termination at other TTSs in the IGR would invariably produce the same effect of limiting <italic>trpBA</italic> expression under iron-replete conditions.</p><p>In <italic>Bacillus subtilis,</italic> Trp-dependent attenuation of transcription takes on a form markedly different from that in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Whereas attenuation functions in cis for the <italic>E. coli trp</italic> operon, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> utilize a multimeric <underline>T</underline>ryptophan-activated <underline>R</underline>NA-binding <underline>A</underline>ttenuation <underline>P</underline>rotein, TRAP, which functions in trans to bind <italic>trp</italic> operon RNA under Trp-replete conditions, promoting transcription termination and inhibiting translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gollnick et al., 2005</xref>). This interaction is antagonized by anti-TRAP in the absence of charged tRNA<sup>Trp</sup>, leading to increased expression of TRAP regulated genes. We suggest that YtgR may represent the first instance of a separate and distinct clade of attenuation mechanisms: iron-dependent <italic>trans-</italic>attenuation. This mechanism may function independently of specific RNA secondary structure, relying instead on steric blockage of RNAP processivity, but ultimately producing a similar result. Possible regulation of translation remains to be explored. The recent development of new genetic tools to alter chromosomal sequences and conditionally knockdown gene expression in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> should enable a more detailed analysis of <italic>trpRBA</italic> regulation, including possible <italic>trans</italic>-attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keb et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mueller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ouellette, 2018</xref>).</p><p>As a Trp auxotroph, what might be the biological significance of iron-dependent YtgR regulation of the <italic>trpRBA</italic> operon in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>? We have already noted the possibility that iron-dependent <italic>trpBA</italic> regulation in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> may enable the induction of a similar response to both Trp and iron starvation, stimuli likely mediated by IFN-γ in vivo. This mechanism also presents the opportunity for <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> to respond similarly to distinct <italic>sequential</italic> stresses, where a particular stress may prime the pathogen to better cope with subsequent stresses. To reach the female upper genital tract (UGT), where most significant pathology is identified following infection with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, the pathogen must first navigate the lower genital tract (LGT). <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infections of the female LGT are associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), which is characterized by obligate and facultative anaerobe colonization, some of which produce indole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sasaki-Imamura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ziklo et al., 2016</xref>). This provides <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> with the necessary substrate to salvage tryptophan via TrpBA. Interestingly, the LGT is also likely an iron-limited environment. Pathogen colonization and BV both increase the concentration of mucosal lactoferrin (Lf), an iron-binding glycoprotein, which can starve pathogens for iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spear et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Valenti et al., 2018</xref>). Lf expression is additionally estrogen-regulated, and thus the LGT may normally experience periods of iron limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kelver et al., 1996</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>trpB</italic> expression has been shown to be uniquely up-regulated in estradiol-supplemented infected cell cultures, perhaps indicating the involvement of estrogen-regulated mechanisms of cell-intrinsic iron starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amirshahi et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, the expression of TfR is constrained to the basal cells of the LGT stratified squamous epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lloyd et al., 1984</xref>), which likely restricts necessary Tf-bound iron from <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infecting the accessible upper layers of the stratified epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nogueira et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ouellette and Carabeo, 2010</xref>).</p><p>For <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, iron limitation may therefore serve as a critical signal in the LGT, inducing the expression of <italic>trpBA</italic> such that Trp is stockpiled from available indole, allowing the pathogen to counteract impending IFN-γ-mediated Trp starvation. We suggest the possibility that iron limitation in the LGT may be a significant predictor of successful pathogen colonization in the UGT and that iron-dependent regulation of <italic>trpBA</italic> may be an important virulence trait in genital serovars of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>. Unfortunately, testing these hypotheses in cell culture models of infection presents a significant challenge. Evaluating rescue of chlamydial growth in the presence of indole to specifically assess the iron-dependent role of <italic>trpBA</italic> requires simultaneous Trp and iron depletion. The former ensures indole utilization by the bacteria, and the latter de-represses YtgR-regulated <italic>trpBA</italic> expression. In theory, this is feasible, but in practice the combined stress rapidly induces aberrant development, muddying results obtained from such studies (data not shown). Ideally, genetic approaches could be employed to distinguish the regulatory effects of YtgR independent of TrpR. However, the genetic manipulation of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors (<italic>e.g.</italic> YtgR) will presumably have unpredictable off-target effects. Genetically altering <italic>cis</italic>-acting factors – such as operator sequences – is more feasible, but at present we lack the information necessary to rationally mutate these sequences in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> to interrogate these questions. The tight regulatory coordination at both the transcription initiation and termination steps would likely mean any mutation in the <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences would affect both processes indiscriminately. Furthermore, in vivo infection models present challenges: attempting to answer these questions will likely require the use of non-human primate studies, as mouse models of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection do not recapitulate immune-mediated Trp starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nelson et al., 2005</xref>). Ultimately, these limitations do not undermine the biological significance of an iron-dependent mode of regulating Trp salvage, given the critical role played by this pathway during infection.</p><p>Finally, and of note, the expression of the unique class Ic ribonucleotide diphosphate reductase-encoding <italic>nrdAB</italic> was also recently shown to be iron-regulated in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brinkworth et al., 2018</xref>). The regulation of <italic>nrdAB</italic> is known to be mediated by the presumably deoxyribonucleotide-dependent transcriptional repressor NrdR, encoded distal to the <italic>nrdAB</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Case et al., 2011</xref>). As NrdR activity is not known to be modulated by iron availability, this raises the intriguing possibility that here too a unique iron-dependent mechanism of regulation may integrate chlamydial stress adaptations to promote a unified response across various stresses. Future studies may require more metabolomics-based approaches to thoroughly dissect the integration of these stress responses, as transcriptome analyses alone often miss broader, pathway-oriented metabolic coordination. Ultimately, these studies point towards a need to carefully re-evaluate the molecular stress response in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, with greater emphasis on the use of targeted approaches and treatment protocols that induce stress, but not persistence.

The putative YtgR operator was aligned to the entire 348 bp intergenic region of the <italic>trpRBA</italic> operon (<italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2 [434/Bu] genome position 511,692–512,039). The alignment parameters were set as follows: Matrix: DNAfull, Gap Open:10, Gap Extend: 0.5, Output Format: pair. These are the default conditions and were chosen to remove bias from the alignment results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Two-Plasmid reporter assay</title><p>The YtgR-binding reporter assay was performed essentially as described, with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>). Promoter regions of interest were amplified from the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2 (434/Bu) genome by PCR using the indicated primer sets, which included KpnI restriction endonuclease sites at the 5’ and 3’ ends of the promoter amplicon. The amplified fragments and the pCCT-EV plasmid were then KpnI-digested and the promoters ligated into the vector using T4 or Quick Ligase (New England BioLabs). Insert directionality was confirmed by directional colony PCR and positive clones were sequence verified. pCCT-<italic>trpBA</italic>ΔOperator was cloned by amplifying two fragments of the pCCT-<italic>trpBA</italic> vector with one ~ 60 mer primer containing the bases to be substituted for each fragment. Thus, the whole vector was split into two half-fragments containing the substituted bases. The two fragments were then cloned back together using In-Fusion Homology-Directed cloning (Takara Bio) to yield the final vector. Electrocompetent BL21(DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> (Sigma Aldrich) were co-transformed by electroporation with the pCCT reporter plasmid and the pET151 expression vector (-EV or –YtgR) and plated on double selective LB agar containing 50 μg/mL carbenicillin and 15 μg/mL tetracycline. Prior to plating of transformed cells, 50 μL of 40 mg/mL X-Gal in DMSO (EMD Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) was applied to the plate for colorimetric determination of β-galactosidase expression. Transformants were incubated overnight at 37° C. The following evening, blue colonies from each experimental condition were selected and cultured overnight in LB liquid broth containing 0.2% (<italic>w/v</italic>) D-glucose (for catabolite repression of expression vectors), 50 μg/mL carbenicillin and 15 μg/mL tetracycline. Cultures were incubated overnight at 37° C. The following morning, overnight cultures were spun down to remove glucose-containing media and sub-cultured in LB liquid broth medium containing 50 μM FeSO<sub>4</sub>, 50 μg/mL carbenicillin and 15 μg/mL tetracycline to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.45. Cultures were incubated for 1 hr at 37° C and sub-cultured a second time in the same media to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1. Cultures were returned to the incubator for another hour prior to the addition of 500 μM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to induce pET151 expression from the <italic>lac</italic> promoter. Cultures were incubated another hour prior to the addition of 0.2% L-arabinose to induce <italic>lacZ</italic> expression from the <italic>araBAD</italic> promoter. Cultures were incubated a final 2 hr prior to the collection of a 0.1 mL volume of cells for assaying β-galactosidase activity by the Miller Assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller, 1972</xref>). Cell pellets were stored at −80° C prior to being assayed. To assay β-galactosidase activity, cell pellets were first re-suspended in Z-buffer (pH 7.0, 60 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 40 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> and 2.7 μL/mL β-mercaptoethanol). 50 μL of 0.1% SDS and 100 μL of chloroform were then added to each sample prior to thorough vortexing. Samples were equilibrated for 5 min at 30° C and 200 μL of 4 mg/mL ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) prepared in Phosphate Buffer (pH 7.0, 60 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 40 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) were added to the samples to initiate the reaction. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 500 μL 1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. Absorbance was measured on a FLUOStar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany) at 420 nm and Miller Units were calculated as:<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mn>1000</mml:mn> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>×</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>420</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>×</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>v</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Where <italic>t</italic> = reaction time, <italic>v</italic> = volume of cells and <italic>OD<sub>final</sub></italic> = OD<sub>600</sub> at the time of sample collection. It was empirically determined that the subtraction of absorbance at 550 nm had a negligible effect on the calculated value. A blank sample lacking cells was included in each experimental batch and used as a reference for absorbance. For each experimental condition, three independent co-transformed colonies were assayed in technical triplicate. In some instances, significantly high Miller Unit outliers were excluded by Grubb’s Test (p&lt;0.05) under the assumption that extreme <italic>lacZ</italic> expression may reflect plasmid copy number or reporter gene expression issues.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Two-Plasmid chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)</title><sec id="s4-12-1"><title>Preparation of lysates</title><p>Co-transformed BL21(DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> were cultured exactly as described for the Two-Plasmid assay with the exception that volumes were scaled up proportionately to increase sample size. For bipyridyl-treated experiments, 50 µM FeSO<sub>4</sub> was excluded and 500 µM 2,2-bipyridyl in DMSO was added for the final three hours of culturing alongside IPTG. At the end of culturing, samples were fixed by diluting fresh 37% methanol-stabilized formaldehyde solution (Sigma Aldrich) to a final concentration of 1% and incubating the sample for 10 mins with periodic vortexing. Fixation was then quenched by the addition of 250 mM glycine to each sample and incubation proceeded for another five mins with periodic vortexing. Samples were then centrifuged for 15 mins at 3000xg, 4 ˚C to pellet fixed cells. The supernatant was discarded and samples were stored at −80˚ C. Fixed samples were thawed on ice and resuspended in 1 mL of ice-cold Pierce RIPA Lysis Buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Samples were then divided into three 330 µL aliquots (experimental IP, control IP and input) and immediately processed for sonication. Sonication was performed using the Biorupter Plus sonication device (Diagenode, Denville, New Jersey, USA) with an attached water cooler. Samples were sonicated on high power for a total of 20 thirty-second on/off cycles at 4° C. These sonication conditions were not optimized for a particular DNA fragment size given that the target DNA promoter element was located on a plasmid and therefore isolated from possible off-target genomic binding sites. Sonicated lysates were then centrifuged to clear cell debris at 14,800 RPM for 5 mins at 4° C in a Sorvall Legend Mirco 21R centrifuge (ThermoFisher Scientific). Lysates were pre-cleared by incubating with 10 μL of Pierce Protein A/G Magnetic beads (ThermoFisher Scientific) at 4° C with rotation for 1 hr. Cleared lysates were then immediately processed for immunoprecipitation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-2"><title>Immunoprecipitation</title><p>For experimental IPs, Pierce Protein A/G Magnetic beads were loaded with His-Tag (D3I1O) XP Rabbit monoclonal antibody (12698, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, Danvers, MA, USA).

Antibody-loaded beads were prepared by incubating 25 μL of beads with 10 μL of antibody in 500 μL TBS-T (ThermoFisher Scientific) at 4° C for 2.5 hr with rotation. Antibody beads were separated on a magnetic rack and then blocked in 500 μL 5% BSA +200 mg/mL sheared salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen) by incubating for 1 hr at 4° C with rotation. Blocked antibody beads were separated on a magnetic rack and then resuspended in TBS-T to their original volume. These conditions were scaled proportionately when doing multiple IPs. 25 μL of blocked antibody beads were then added to 330 μL of cleared sonicated lysate and incubated overnight at 4° C with rotation. The following morning, beads were separated on a magnetic rack and washed first with 300 μL ice-cold Low Salt Immune Complex Wash Buffer (EMD Millipore) incubated for five mins at RT° C with rotation. Beads were separated on a magnetic rack and washed a second time with 300 μL ice-cold High Salt Immune Complex Wash Buffer (EMD Millipore) incubated for five mins at RT° C with rotation. A final wash was carried out using 300 μL ice-cold LiCl Immune Complex Wash Buffer (EMD Millipore) incubated for five mins at RT° C with rotation. Protein-DNA complexes were then eluted off of the washed beads by incubating the beads in 420 μL Pierce IgG Elution Buffer, pH 2.0 (ThermoFisher Scientific) for five mins at RT° C with rotation. The beads were then immediately separated on a magnetic rack and the eluate was added to 80 μL 1 M Tris, pH 8.5 to neutralize pH.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-3"><title>DNA isolation</title><p>Cross-links were reversed by incubating eluted Protein-DNA complexes and input lysates at 95° C for 1 hr, with 750 RPM shaking.

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A bipartite iron-dependent transcriptional regulation of the tryptophan salvage pathway in <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Derek Fisher (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study investigates iron-regulated expression of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> tryptophan biosynthetic genes, which have been linked to surviving IFN-Ɣ stimulation of host cells and thus virulence. The authors established experimental conditions to decouple the effects of iron and trp starvation, both of which can be induced by IFN-Ɣ stimulation, and they showed discoordinate regulation of the <italic>trpRBA</italic> operon by iron. Iron regulation appears to be mediated through binding of the iron-dependent regulator, YtgR, to the trpR-trpB intergenic region (IGR) upstream of a newly-identified, iron-regulated promoter. The authors also explored the possibility that YtgR binding to the IGR causes transcriptional termination to reduce expression of <italic>trpBA</italic>, although the data for this model are less convincing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The βgal results reported in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 indicate that binding of YtgR to the IGS may require more than the putative operator sequence. Demonstration of iron-dependent, direct interactions between YtgR and the IGS/operator site would provide clarity on this point. EMSA or YtgR/operator DNA dot blot assays previously reported by the Carabeo group (PMID: 22689982) measuring iron-dependent, direct binding to the IGS region would provide strong support for the trp IGS YtgR operator site designation and iron-regulation, and could allow for rapid screening of sequence elements needed for YtgR binding. The latter approach might allow for the in silico identification of other YtgR operator sites.</p><p>2) The section on iron limitation and transcription read-through was not well written. It was hard to understand and not fully explained. The three graphs should be shown at the same scale so that they can be fairly compared. What is the significance of decreased read-through at 18 hpi compared to 12 hpi, and which should BpdI treatment be compared to? This is not a trivial consideration because the difference between 12 and 18 hpi could potentially be due to increased attenuation by tryptophan and/or iron levels. What does it mean that there was less read-through with depletion or iron than tryptophan? The presence of residual read-through despite iron depletion should be acknowledged and discussed. The result with tryptophan depletion was described as being expected but the reasoning was not given. How do you know if tryptophan and iron affect read-through through the same or different mechanisms?</p><p>3) It's critical for the study to establish iron-starvation conditions that don't induce persistence, but 1 of the 2 persistence markers did not respond as expected. Additional transcriptional markers of persistence (Belland, 2003) should be tested to confirm that 6 hours of BpdI treatment did not induce persistence. Ideally these persistence marker should include iron-dependent and iron-independent genes.</p><p>4) The RT-qPCR results in Figure 1D showing an increase in transcript levels of the late gene omcB following iron depletion are at odds with prior work from the group using a <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovar D isolate (Thompson and Carabeo, 2011) which showed decreased omcB transcript levels. This is touched on by the authors, who point out that omcB levels and iron stress responses seem to vary across chlamydial species and <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovars. This creates a potential concern that <italic>trpBA</italic> iron-mediated regulation might be LGV specific and may not occur in serovar D-K isolates which are more prevalent causes of infection in females (and the female reproductive tract in particular). This becomes problematic in relation to the hypothesis that YtgR-mediated regulation allows for differential responses to environments in the lower versus upper genital tract if serovars D-K do not show the LGV-type response. Alignment of the IGS regions across serovars might address this point. Experimentally, the βgal assay (Figure 5) using non-LGV IGS regions and confirmation of iron regulated control of <italic>trpBA</italic> (RT-qPCR, Figure 3) in non-LGV serovars would support that the results are not LGV-specific and occur in serovars more frequently isolated from infected women. This would increase the significance of the study.</p><p>5) While it is clear that trpR transcription terminates in the IGR, the data for iron-regulated termination within the IGR are fairly weak. For one, why were the comparisons in Figure 7C-E made to the 12hr instead of the 18hr time point, the latter of which appears to indicate a decrease in the ratio of both trpR and the IGR transcripts compared to read-through transcripts. Secondly, Figure 3C shows increased trpR levels in iron depleted condition when compared to mock treatment at the same infection time point, similar to the iron-regulated genes shown in Figure 2, indicating this transcript is regulated by iron. Without more in-depth analysis of trpR promoter activity and trpR transcript stability, I'm not certain these results can be interpreted as iron-regulation of transcriptional read through.</p><p>6) The impact of the study would be increased by data supporting the model that YtgR binding to its operator decreases RNA polymerase processivity. While these studies would be challenging in Chlamydia especially in a 2-3 month time frame expected for the revision, they could be done with the heterologous transcription assay. This approach would allow the effect of YtgR and other transcription factors on read-through transcription to be compared. It could also be used to show if this effect is dependent on iron or tryptophan. One concern regarding iron-regulated termination is that the data are not wholly consistent with this idea. Specifically, the data show some modest iron regulation of trpR, depending on what time points are used to evaluate the data (see Figures 3 and</p><p>7). Moreover, there are two TTS in the IGR downstream of the YtgR operator, suggesting termination can occur independently of YtgR binding. Thus it is possible that multiple factors, including RNA stability, RNA processing, and termination, are contributing to their observations. In the absence of additional data, the authors should temper their conclusions.</p><p>7) Is this the first demonstration of iron regulating a <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> virulence trait? This should be put into broader context of bacterial pathogenesis, where iron regulation of virulence is a recurrent theme for many pathogens, and highlighted as a new twist on this theme.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42295.042</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The βgal results reported in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 indicate that binding of YtgR to the IGS may require more than the putative operator sequence.

This approach has been used in previous publications to determine the iron-dependency of DtxR repression in similar reporter systems (Ding et al., 1996). Using this approach, we observed a moderate but significant increase in Β-galactosidase activity, which would be expected if the deprivation of iron inactivated YtgR DNA-binding and alleviated repression of lacZ.</p><p>We have optimized a targeted chromatin immunoprecipitation qPCR assay to demonstrate direct and operator-dependent interactions between YtgR and the <italic>trpBA</italic> promoter element in the two-plasmid reporter system. This experiment revealed that YtgR specifically interacts with the <italic>trpBA</italic> promoter element, but not the promoter of trpR or dnaB, and that this interaction depends on the native operator sequence within the <italic>trpBA</italic> promoter. These studies were attempted in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected cells with a polyclonal antibody raised against YtgC, but we were unable to efficiently immunoprecipitate cross-linked YtgR-DNA complexes with the raised antibody.</p><p>We were unable to conduct the biolayer interferometry (BLI) assay that we used in our previous publication because those experiments were performed by a collaborator (Dr. Scott Grieshaber) using the core facilities at the University of Florida at Gainesville. We do not have access to the BLI equipment anymore because Dr. Grieshaber has left Florida. Instead we decided to take advantage of our two-plasmid assay to demonstrate transcriptional repression of the lacZ reporter, and binding of YtgR to the IGR operator sequence via chromatin immunoprecipitation. While we were successful in establishing iron-dependent transcriptional repression by YtgR, we could not achieve consistent results with the controls and “unknown” samples in our ChIP assay in the presence of bipyridyl. We were able to pinpoint the issue with the addition of bipyridyl because other experiments we conducted, including the effects of the mutated operator sequence on DNA binding of YtgR, gave the expected outcomes with the control samples. However, we were unable to resolve the issue. The addition of bipyridyl relieved transcriptional repression in the doubly transformed <italic>E. coli</italic>, but its presence affected isolation of YtgR-DNA fragment interaction.</p><p>Despite these technical issues, we believe that our data collectively point to YtgR being an iron-dependent transcriptional repressor that targets the operator sequence within the conserved intergenic region, in conjunction with our previously published data that demonstrated YtgR binding to a different operator sequence in an iron-dependent manner.</p><p>Note that we have replaced the previous pCCT-lpdA negative control with that of pCCT-dnaB for consistency, i.e. other figures used the dnaB as negative control (Figure 2D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The section on iron limitation and transcription read-through was not well written.

To simplify the analysis, we are now only comparing two amplicons: one constant upstream “normalization” and various downstream “readthrough” amplicons. They include amplicons located upstream of the putative YtgR-dependent termination site, one that is located downstream of this site, and one at the predicted termination immediately after the TrpA CDS. RT-qPCR was performed for each amplicon separately for each mRNA sample. To further account for possible variation, the normalization amplicon was also included. Because this amplicon was common to all transcripts driven from the major trp promoter, it was used for normalization. This analysis is comparable to the analysis we performed in Figure 4B. In this instance, however, the collection of amplicons used to determine readthrough at the YtgR operator site excluded any that would detect transcripts originating from the alternative transcriptional start site, i.e. downstream of the <italic>trpBA</italic> promoter. We have also included a control amplicon as before at the 3’ end of the <italic>trpA</italic> sequence to indicate transcripts originating from the major trp promoter, AND those originating from the <italic>trpBA</italic> promoter, which when combined results in a ratio of &gt;1.</p><p>The previous figure was not as intuitive as we would have liked, but to answer the reviewer’s question in reference to the previous figure, we can only speculate that the decreased readthrough at 18 h relative to 12 h could have been due to differences in iron availability that Chlamydia experienced during its development. Having said this, we reanalyzed the data using a different normalization amplicon. By doing so, there was no longer a difference between 12 and 18 h. This lack of difference was consistent across all amplicons monitored. We hope that this reanalysis addressed the reviewer’s additional concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What does it mean that there was less read-through with depletion or iron than tryptophan? The presence of residual read-through despite iron depletion should be acknowledged and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This could be due to differences in promoter strength or robustness of transcription from the major trp promoter and the alternative promoter within the IGR that would translate differences in levels of transcripts. Assuming different promoter strengths, under Trp-starved condition, transcription initiates robustly from the major trp promoter, while under iron-limiting condition, transcription starts from the relatively weaker alternative promoter. The former would be expected to yield a higher ratio relative to the latter. This would be consistent with the data shown in Figure 7B where the readthrough ratio approaches 1 for the Trp-starved samples, indicating readthrough to complete transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The result with tryptophan depletion was described as being expected but the reasoning was not given.</p></disp-quote><p>The results (Figures 3A and 6B) were expected based on previous reports by Carlson et al., Akers and Tan, Woods et al. that have already demonstrated the transcriptional induction of the trp operon under Trp depletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How do you know if tryptophan and iron affect read-through through the same or different mechanisms?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the mechanism of readthrough under iron- or Trp-depleted conditions, our argument would be that the mechanism is different. YtgR DNA-binding mediates readthrough under iron-limited conditions as a function of transcript termination, and inactivation of TrpR repression in the absence of the co-repressor Trp mediates readthrough under Trp-depleted conditions by inducing transcription initiation. However, the mechanism of Trp-dependent readthrough is only a side-note, with YtgR modulation of transcription termination being one of the major findings. Trp-depletion was simply used as a control because of its established regulation of trp operon transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It's critical for the study to establish iron-starvation conditions that don't induce persistence, but 1 of the 2 persistence markers did not respond as expected.

The purpose of this experiment was to identify a treatment duration that did not result in reduced replication (e.g. genome copy number), and aberrant expression of developmentally regulated genes (e.g. <italic>euo</italic> and <italic>omcB</italic>). We essentially discounted the time point where one or more of these criteria indicated persistence, and focused on the 6-h treatment for the rest of the manuscript. Rather than focus on the unexpected behavior of <italic>omcB</italic> at the “12+12” timepoint, we highlight the identification of a treatment protocol (e.g. “12+6”) that maintained normal developmental expression of <italic>omcB</italic> and <italic>euo</italic>. As further support for the “12+6” treatment condition, we (Brinkworth et al., 2018) published a genomewide analysis of the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> transcriptome, and observed only a small collection of genes differentially expressed during iron starvation. These genes included trpB and trpA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The RT-qPCR results in Figure 1D showing an increase in transcript levels of the late gene omcB following iron depletion are at odds with prior work from the group using a C. trachomatis serovar D isolate (Thompson and Carabeo, 2011) which showed decreased omcB transcript levels. This is touched on by the authors, who point out that omcB levels and iron stress responses seem to vary across chlamydial species and C. trachomatis serovars. This creates a potential concern that trpBA iron-mediated regulation might be LGV specific and may not occur in serovar D-K isolates which are more prevalent causes of infection in females (and the female reproductive tract in particular). This becomes problematic in relation to the hypothesis that YtgR-mediated regulation allows for differential responses to environments in the lower versus upper genital tract if serovars D-K do not show the LGV-type response.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the manuscript to discuss the inconsistency of <italic>omcB</italic> expression between this study and previous findings (subsection “Brief iron limitation via 2,2-bipyridyl treatment yields iron-starved, but non-persistent Chlamydia trachomatis”, first paragraph), the latter typically involved treatments at the start of infection. Not only has <italic>omcB</italic> expression been observed to vary under different stress conditions, but our decision to begin treatment at midcycle of chlamydial development necessarily means that previous reports that began stress treatment at the time of infection do not apply to this work and are not predictive for our studies. To discount the potential confounding effects of variations in omcB expression, we constrained our experiments to the 6 h treatment starting at 12 h post-infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alignment of the IGS regions across serovars might address this point. Experimentally, the βgal assay (Figure 5) using non-LGV IGS regions and confirmation of iron regulated control of trpBA (RT-qPCR, Figure 3) in non-LGV serovars would support that the results are not LGV-specific and occur in serovars more frequently isolated from infected women. This would increase the significance of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the concern about LGV vs. urogenital serovars, we have provided a sequence alignment of the <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR between serovars L2, D, A and B which demonstrates a &gt;99% sequence identity, with 100% conservation at the putative YtgR operator site (Figure 5—figure supplement 1, subsection “YtgR specifically binds to the <italic>trpRBA</italic> intergenic region in an operator-dependent manner to repress transcription of <italic>trpBA</italic>”, third paragraph). We had also noted this in the text in the initial submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) While it is clear that trpR transcription terminates in the IGR, the data for iron-regulated termination within the IGR are fairly weak. For one, why were the comparisons in Figure 7C-E made to the 12hr instead of the 18hr time point, the latter of which appears to indicate a decrease in the ratio of both trpR and the IGR transcripts compared to read-through transcripts.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above in our third response to point 2, we have re-analyzed the transcription readthrough data, which we believe addresses several of the concerns mentioned (Figure 7B, subsection “YtgR mediates iron-dependent termination of upstream transcripts at the putative <italic>trpRBA</italic> operator site”). We refer the reviewer to our third response to point 2 for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, Figure 3C shows increased trpR levels in iron depleted condition when compared to mock treatment at the same infection time point, similar to the iron-regulated genes shown in Figure 2, indicating this transcript is regulated by iron. Without more in-depth analysis of trpR promoter activity and trpR transcript stability, I'm not certain these results can be interpreted as iron-regulation of transcriptional read through.</p></disp-quote><p>We have two pieces of evidence that the trpR promoter is not subject to regulation by YtgR. First, as shown in Figure 5C that the presence of trpR promoter sequence did not confer YtgR-dependent transcriptional repression of the lacZ reporter. Second, the trpR promoter was not recognized by YtgR in the ChIP assay shown in Figure 5E. However, we cannot discount the possibility of a YtgR-independent iron-dependent regulation of the trpR promoter. What we would like to emphasize is that despite an iron-dependent, but YtgR-independent mechanism of transcriptional induction of trpR, presumably at the major trp promoter, the conclusion remains the same with regards to the role of YtgR in regulating trpR transcript termination. Indeed, in our β-galactosidase assay, the presence of DNA encompassing the trpR ORF and the intergenic region (IGR) in our <italic>E. coli</italic> heterologous system led to the repression of lacZ activity when YtgR was expressed. Both lacZ transcript and β-galactosidase enzyme activity were monitored. This indicated that YtgR binding to the IGR was sufficient to block RNA polymerase passage. To reiterate, the conclusion that YtgR mediates termination of transcription originating at the major trp promoter still stands, despite a possible iron-dependent, but YtgR-independent transcription regulation at the trp promoter. We also discuss the possibility that YtgR may function to attenuate transcription, and thus expression of trpR, which would offer a possible mechanism for the elevated expression of trpR observed by RT-qPCR under iron-limited conditions. Modifications to the text have been made to reflect the marginal iron-dependent regulation of trpR, and reinforce the conclusion that YtgR is sufficient to mediate termination of transcription of the trpR ORF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The impact of the study would be increased by data supporting the model that YtgR binding to its operator decreases RNA polymerase processivity. While these studies would be challenging in Chlamydia especially in a 2-3 month time frame expected for the revision, they could be done with the heterologous transcription assay. This approach would allow the effect of YtgR and other transcription factors on read-through transcription to be compared. It could also be used to show if this effect is dependent on iron or tryptophan. One concern regarding iron-regulated termination is that the data are not wholly consistent with this idea. Specifically, the data show some modest iron regulation of trpR, depending on what time points are used to evaluate the data (see Figures 3 and 7). Moreover, there are two TTS in the IGR downstream of the YtgR operator, suggesting termination can occur independently of YtgR binding. Thus it is possible that multiple factors, including RNA stability, RNA processing, and termination, are contributing to their observations. In the absence of additional data, the authors should temper their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the above concern about RNA polymerase processivity, we have adapted our two-plasmid system such that the reporter plasmid contained the entire <italic>trpR</italic> ORF and <italic>trpRBA</italic> IGR upstream of the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene (Figure 7C). Thus, RNAP initiated at the pBAD element would be required to readthrough the whole endogenous <italic>trpR</italic>-IGR sequence prior to reaching <italic>lacZ</italic>. We then monitored readthrough by RT-qPCR (as explained above) in the presence or absence of YtgR (Figure 7D). Using this system, we observed a significant decrease in the amount of readthrough to the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene when YtgR was expressed, consistent with the idea that YtgR binding to the IGR inhibits RNAP processivity and induces transcript termination. Moreover, we were able to use this system to demonstrate a significant reduction in β-galactosidase activity when YtgR is ectopically expressed (Figure 7E), confirming that <italic>lacZ</italic> is indeed not being transcribed similarly under these conditions. We have commented on the fact that we cannot discount a possible role for the other TTSs in this iron-dependent regulation (Discussion, third paragraph), but we argue that any iron-dependent regulation of the other TTSs would produce the same result of limiting <italic>trpBA</italic> expression. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that there is iron-dependent termination at the YtgR operator and that YtgR regulation of the IGR inhibits readthrough. The most parsimonious model is therefore that YtgR binding to its operator site in the IGR terminates transcription from the upstream <italic>trpR</italic> promoter, limiting downstream <italic>trpBA</italic> expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Is this the first demonstration of iron regulating a C. trachomatis virulence trait?</p></disp-quote><p>With obligate intracellular pathogens like Chlamydia, it is difficult to make distinctions between virulence and survival. However, factors that are considered virulence factors in other pathogens have been demonstrated in Chlamydia to respond to iron starvation. For example, a report from Slepenkin et al., 2007 described the induction of transcription of various components of the type III secretion system upon treatment with the iron chelator Desferal. We found a similar transcriptional induction of components of the type III secretion system in shorter iron starvation by bipyridyl (Brinkworth et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This should be put into broader context of bacterial pathogenesis, where iron regulation of virulence is a recurrent theme for many pathogens, and highlighted as a new twist on this theme.</p></disp-quote><p>We have commented on two aspects of chlamydial virulence (or pathogenesis) in the female genital tract that are likely impacted by iron-dependent YtgR regulation of <italic>trpBA</italic>: the possibility of deploying a unified response to counter the pleiotropic insults of IFN-γ stimulation (Introduction, last two paragraphs), as well as the possibility that iron-dependent regulation of <italic>trpBA</italic> may have a specific and unique role in activating tryptophan biosynthesis in the lower genital tract, where the substrate for salvage, indole, is available, allowing <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> to prepare for oncoming IFN-γ stress (Discussion, fifth and sixth paragraphs). We have added an additional statement that this may play an important role in virulence in genital serovars of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
