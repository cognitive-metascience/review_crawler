different types of tumors, often without an appropriate expression of their classical receptors. We observed that receptor-negative cancer cells could be stimulated by the soluble chemokines. Searching for alternative receptors we detected that all cells expressing or transfected with transmembrane chemokine ligands bound the soluble chemokines with high affinity and responded by phosphorylation of intracellular kinases, enhanced proliferation and anti-apoptosis. This activity requires the intracellular domain and apparently the dimerization of the transmembrane chemokine ligand. Thus, shed soluble chemokines can generate auto- or paracrine signals by binding and activating their transmembrane forms. We term this novel mechanism “inverse signaling”. We suppose that inverse signaling is an autocrine feedback and fine-tuning system in the communication between cells that in tumors supports stabilization and proliferation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10820.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10820.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10820.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cells that make up an animal need to communicate with each other for a variety of purposes, including controlling the growth and repair of tissues. Commonly, such signaling involves ‘ligand’ molecules binding to specific ‘receptor’ proteins embedded in the cell membrane. When a ligand docks to the right receptor protein, the parts of the receptor inside the cell change shape. This activates signaling pathways within that cell.</p><p>Types of ligands called transmembrane ligands are found embedded in cell membranes. Some cancer cells have high levels of transmembrane ligands called CXCL16 and CX3CL1 but do not produce the corresponding receptors for these molecules. The part of these ligands that sits outside of the cells can also be separated from the rest of the molecule to produce a soluble ligand that can move around outside the cell.</p><p>By studying cancer cells using microscopy and biochemical approaches, Hattermann, Gebhardt et al. now show that the soluble forms of CXCL16 and CX3CL1 bind to their transmembrane equivalents. This activates signaling pathways that promote cell growth and make the cancer cells more resistant to cell death. However, this signaling did not occur if the transmembrane ligands were altered to lack the part normally found inside the cell, which suggests that transmembrane CXCL16 and CX3CL1 act as receptors.</p><p>It was not previously known that a soluble ligand could activate its transmembrane equivalent. Hattermann, Gebhardt et al. have named this process “inverse signaling”, and suggest that it helps to fine-tune the communication between cells. Future experiments will need to study the importance of inverse signaling in living animals and investigate how it works alongside other signaling methods.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10820.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10820.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Chemokines</kwd><kwd>receptor</kwd><kwd>Cellular communication</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LU869/6-1</award-id> <principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lucius</surname><given-names>Ralph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HE3400/5-1</award-id> <principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Held-Feindt</surname><given-names>Janka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01EY1103</award-id> <principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Held-Feindt</surname><given-names>Janka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ME 758/10-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mentlein</surname><given-names>Rolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In a new mechanism of cellular communication termed “inverse signaling&quot;, a transmembrane chemokine acts as a &quot;receptor&quot; for its previously shed form.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The chemokines CX3CL1/fractalkine and CXCL16 are transmembrane (<italic>tm</italic>) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matloubian et al., 2000</xref>) that are converted to soluble ligands by metalloproteinases, in particular ADAM10 and ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hundhausen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ludwig et al., 2005</xref>). These soluble (<italic>s-</italic>) chemokines induce signal transduction and chemotaxis in target cells which express their classical G protein-coupled receptors CX3CR1 and CXCR6/Bonzo; however, also firm adhesion between <italic>tm-</italic>chemokine- and chemokine-receptor-bearing cells has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Imai et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wilbanks et al., 2001</xref>). Of note, both chemokines themselves, show potential signal transduction sites in their short intracellular domains, but so far signaling via the transmembrane forms has not been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matloubian et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, several transmembrane ligands themselves are known to transduce signals after binding of their respective receptor. This reverse transduction of signals by transmembrane ligands has been initially observed with ligands of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family after binding to their cognate receptors (or to antibodies), and thus bidirectional responses are produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ferran et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eissner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lettau et al., 2011</xref>). This principle has been also described for IL-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neely et al., 2004</xref>), ephrin-ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klein, 2009</xref>) and semaphorins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Reverse signaling can induce several biological functions, e. g. co-stimulation, silencing, transmission of additional signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eissner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun and Fink, 2007</xref>), or synapse formation and plasticity in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klein, 2009</xref>). Reverse signaling may thus be an alternative to an autocrine-signaling loop with classical receptors. So far, reverse signaling has only been reported for distinct transmembrane ligand molecules although signaling motifs for reverse signaling are more abundant and also found within the transmembrane variants of the chemokine family.</p><p>Investigating the role of transmembrane chemokines in cancer, we detected a remarkable high synthesis in several types of tumor cells without an appropriate expression of their classical receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Held-Feindt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hattermann et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we looked for alternative functions and receptors. We found that cells expressing high levels of a <italic>tm-</italic>chemokine also responded to their soluble counterparts without expressing the respective G protein-coupled chemokine receptor. Further detailed investigations revealed that <italic>tm-</italic>chemokines themselves, in fact, responded to soluble chemokines via a novel mechanism by binding their soluble forms and subsequently inducing signals and functional responses. We propose that this novel mechanism leads to auto- or paracrine activation of cells expressing <italic>tm</italic>-chemokines that either function as surface receptor or can be shed to generate soluble ligands of another <italic>tm</italic>-chemokine on the cell surface.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transmembrane chemokines are highly expressed in several types of tumor cells</title><p>By quantitative RT-PCR we detected high levels of CXCL16 and CX3CL1 in human glioma, neuroblastoma, colon carcinoma, lower levels in breast cancer cells, and LOX melanoma cells produced very low or non-detectable mRNA amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> upper panel; Δ C<sub>T</sub> in logarithmic scale, thus a 3.3 higher Δ C<sub>T</sub>value indicates a 10-fold lower expression). Beside tumor cells, also endothelial cells and monocytes like THP-1 cells express <italic>tm</italic>-chemokines. In contrast to this broad distribution of ligands, the expression of the receptors CXCR6 and CX3CR1 was restricted to only a few cell types, e.g. activated T-cells (positive control, compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ludwig et al., 2005</xref>) or monocytes/monocytic THP-1 cells. The expression of CX3CL1 and CXCL16 was confirmed on protein level by immunocytochemistry (lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which revealed high expression for the brain tumor cell lines and low expression for the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7. The LOX melanoma cell line showed no protein expression, and therefore was chosen as a control cell line in the subsequent experiments. CXCR6 and CX3CR1 were not detectable in the solid tumor cell lines on protein level either (not shown) by immunocytochemistry using antibodies that were suitable for this application in recent investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Held-Feindt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hattermann et al., 2013</xref>).

Pre-incubation with <italic>Pertussis</italic> toxin did not influence signal transduction of responsive <italic>tm</italic>-chemokine-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Its inhibitory effect was confirmed in stimulations of CX3CR1<sup>+</sup>-THP-1 cells. Also, an engineered peptide receptor-antagonist of fractalkine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermand et al., 2008</xref>) mediated ERK phosphorylation in primary glioma cells comparable to the recombinant soluble peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lower part). We additionally analyzed the expression profile of a broad panel of CXC-chemokine and decoy receptors. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, glioma cell lines did not express CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR6, CX3CR1, but high levels of CXCR7, which is a receptor for CXCL11 and CXCL12 and can mediate G-protein independent signals via arrestin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Odemis et al., 2012</xref>). However, inhibition of CXCR7 by the synthetic antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hattermann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamaguchi et al., 2014</xref>) CCX733 exhibited no influence on <italic>tm</italic>-chemokine signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As chemokine decoy receptors (D6, DARC, CCX-CKR) were expressed in glioma as well as LOX cells, they could be ruled out as mediators for <italic>tm</italic>-chemokine effects that were absent in the melanoma cells. A viral encoded putative receptor for CX3CL1, US28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matlaf et al., 2013</xref>), was detected neither in glioma cells, nor in LOX melanoma cells, and thus, can be excluded for <italic>s-</italic>CXCL16 or <italic>s-</italic>CX3CL1 signaling. Additionally, the expression of CD44, a receptor for hyaluronic acid and further ligands, e.g. CCL5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roscic-Mrkic et al., 2005</xref>)was determined at comparable protein levels in glioma cells and melanoma cells. These findings as well as independence of <italic>s-</italic>chemokine-mediated signal transduction from <italic>Pertussis</italic> toxin suggest that classical G protein-coupled chemokine receptors are not involved in the described effects of <italic>s</italic>-chemokines.

We here provide evidence for a novel form of auto- and paracrine signaling of transmembrane ligands produced by their shed, soluble ligands – a process that we term ‘inverse signaling’. Whereas reverse signaling requires the binding of the transmembrane ligand to its classical membrane-bound or soluble receptor, the inverse signaling depends on binding of the soluble ligand to its transmembrane counterpart.</p><p>This binding of the soluble forms of the chemokines CXCL16 and CX3CL1 to their transmembrane counterparts - as a prerequisite for inverse signaling - was verified by FACS analysis, morphological assays at the light- and electron-microscopic levels and chemical cross-linking experiments. Similarly, di- and multimerization of the chemokine domain of CX3CL1 had already earlier been shown by X-ray crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoover et al., 2000</xref>), and is also known for some other (soluble) chemokines.</p><p>Next to the ability to bind to <italic>tm-</italic>chemokines, <italic>s</italic>-chemokines may also elicit intracellular signals. This could be clearly shown in primary glioblastoma cells and corresponding cell lines. After transfection with <italic>tm-</italic>chemokine expression vectors, previously non-responsive cells may also exert inverse signaling upon stimulation with <italic>s-</italic>chemokines. Opposite to overexpression, silencing of <italic>tm</italic>-chemokines reduces signaling induced by <italic>s</italic>-chemokine stimulation. Consequently, by two different approaches (overexpression and silencing) signal transduction of the <italic>s</italic>-chemokines was shown to depend on the expression level of transmembrane CXCL16 or CX3CL1 in the responsive cell line. Apart from recombinant peptides, also the naturally shed soluble ligands as contained in conditioned media were able to induce inverse signaling and, as a sign of specificity, antibodies raised against the chemokine domain of CXCL16 or CX3CL1 yielded comparable signals. This activation of <italic>tm</italic>-chemokine signaling by intact antibodies but not by corresponding monovalent F(ab) fragments supports a putative necessity of di/oligomerization of the <italic>tm</italic>-chemokines for the inverse signaling. And indeed, a clustering/bundle formation of transmembrane CX3CL1 has been observed in transfected and primary cells by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) and homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermand et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ostuni et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>However, it is not unlikely, that inverse signaling may require a co-receptor supporting the <italic>tm</italic>-chemokines. Some other classical chemokine receptors evaluated are either absent, or can be excluded. For example, inverse signaling is insensitive to <italic>Pertussis</italic> toxin, an inhibitor of classical chemokine receptor signaling via G<sub>i/o</sub>-proteins, and is not affected by inhibition of CXCR7, a non-canonical chemokine receptor signaling via arrestin. However, putative co-receptors (and also intracellular binding partners) need further investigation.</p><p>Signaling domains of the intracellular tails of transmembrane ligands seem to be critical for the signal transduction in reverse signaling, and thus also may transduce inverse signaling. For example, TNF-α, FasL and other members of the TNF family, contain S/TXXS/T sequences and proline-rich domains (FasL) that can bind adaptor proteins and thereby transduce signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kennelly and Krebs, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Watts et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eissner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun and Fink, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amanchy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Daar, 2012</xref>). In contrast, ephrins and semaphorins signal through PDZ-binding motifs and also proline-rich domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Daar, 2012</xref>). As shown by transfection/stimulation experiments with C-terminally-truncated <italic>tm</italic>-chemokines, the intact intracellular domains are also essential for the inverse signaling. Identification of the exact binding sites for kinases/adaptor proteins are ongoing and beyond the scope of this investigation. Potential activation sites include cytoplasmic SXXS-sequences (comparable to those of the TNF family) and additionally SH2-binding sites (YXPV/R). In CX3CL1, both sites are highly conserved from monotremes through marsupials to highly developed mammals; in the case of CXCL16, they are found – as far as known - in primates and only same mammals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the transfer to a rodent <italic>in vivo</italic> model has to be carefully designed. Of note, the reverse signaling of TNF-α has long been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ferran et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lettau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eissner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shao and Schwarz, 2011</xref>), but exact mechanisms of further downstream signaling are not yet known. Apparently, there may be an analogy of transmembrane ligand signaling between ligands of the TNF family and transmembrane chemokines that might be elucidated in future investigations.<table-wrap

signaling, reverse signaling in the case of TNF members mediates co-stimulation, direct stimulation, desensitization and migration yielding a fine-tuning in adaptive immunity and a regulatory feedback in innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eissner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun and Fink, 2007</xref>). Reverse signaling of ephrins triggers cell adhesion or differentiation, in particular in the nervous system, spine and synapse formation, but also in bone modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matsuo and Otaki, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2010</xref>), whereas reverse signaling of semaphorins similarly regulates cell guiding and repulsion, especially in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). As far as we know, inverse signaling of transmembrane chemokines appears to induce mainly autocrine stimulatory and stabilizing effects like increased proliferation and anti-apoptosis. These tumor cell protective effects could also be confirmed in transfection experiments enabling a direct comparison of the chemokine effects in <italic>tm-</italic>chemokine expressing versus not-expressing cells of the same cell line. To our knowledge, these effects seem to depend on the <italic>tm</italic>-chemokine expression level rather than the (tumor) cell type. Obviously, tumors would clearly profit from such positive feedback. The importance of autocrine loops in many types of tumors becomes obvious regarding for example growth factors like epidermal (EGF) or platelet-derived (PDGF) growth factors. However, also in inflammation or under non-pathological conditions in tissue development these stabilizing autocrine loops may play important roles.</p><p>The expression of transmembrane chemokines can be induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IFN-γ and interleukin-1β, e.g. in fibroblasts and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garcia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Isozaki et al., 2011</xref>) regulating their role in inflammatory (trans-) migration processes. The release of the chemokine domain is mediated by the cell surface proteases ADAM10 and ADAM17 in a constitutive (mainly ADAM10) or cytokine-induced manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ludwig et al., 2005</xref>). ADAM17 was initially discovered as TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE) liberating soluble cytokine from the transmembrane form. Later, other ADAMs were identified as similar ‘sheddases’, but they also cleave receptors, adhesion molecules and intracellular signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pruessmeyer and Ludwig, 2009</xref>). ADAMs are supposed to terminate reverse signaling by cleaving transmembrane ligands of the TNF family bound to their receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun and Fink, 2007</xref>). In case of ephrin-A, ADAM10 is constitutively associated with the EphA receptor that clusters and is activated upon ligand binding; this positions the proteinase domain for effective ephrin-A5 cleavage and the cleavage occurs in <italic>trans</italic>, with ADAM10 and its substrate being on the membranes of opposing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janes et al., 2005</xref>). This mechanism ensures that only Eph-bound ephrins are recognized and cleaved. A corresponding regulatory role of ADAMs as for reverse can also be supposed for inverse signaling. Since different physiological and pathophysiological mediators or therapeutics tightly regulate ADAM activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reiss and Saftig, 2009</xref>), inverse signaling should also be modulated in diverse ways in health and disease. However, this question may only be satisfactory addressed in carefully designed future <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments.</p><p>A potential regulation of the <italic>tm</italic>-chemokine signaling may also be expected by the interplay of ‘inverse’ and ‘classical’ signaling, since both, classical receptors and transmembrane chemokines compete for the same soluble ligand. For example in an inflammatory context, binding of <italic>s-</italic>chemokines to <italic>tm-</italic>counterparts might reduce the recruitment of immune cells expressing the classical receptors, and vice versa might a massive infiltration of <italic>s-</italic>chemokine binding immune cells reduce the effects of inverse signaling. Moreover, it can be hypothesized that inverse signaling interacts with signaling of classical receptors, e.g. by adapter proteins. Thus, the observed novel mechanism adds to the understanding of the complex chemokine system.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Inverse signaling is an autocrine feedback and fine-tuning systems in the communication between cells. Here, soluble ligands that are shed from their transmembrane counterparts induce signals through binding to the transmembrane ligands.

Cells were stimulated with 0.1 µg/ml F(ab) fragment for 20 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Plasmids, mutations and transfection experiments</title><p>Expression vectors for CXCL16-HA (with a hemagglutinin HA tag) and CX3CL1 were established as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2004</xref>) in a pcDNA3.1 backbone (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), and pcDNA 3.1 was used for control transfections. Transfection was performed with TurboFect (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) in serum-free DMEM without antibiotics using 4 µg of the respective expression vectors with pcDNA3.1 backbone and 4 µl TurboFect in a total volume of 1 ml. After 6 hr, cells were rinsed and normal growth medium (RPMI + 10% FCS) was added. Successful transfection was controlled by immunocytochemistry and/or qRT-PCR. Stable clones were generated by selection with 0.75 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem), and colonies were picked after 10–20 days, amplified and checked for expression by quantitative RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. Site directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit following the manufacturer´s advice (Agilent Technologies, Böblingen, Germany). The complementary primer pairs were designed to generate a double stop codon following the transmembrane domain (MWG-Biotech, AG Ebersberg, Germany; CXCL16: 5’-ctttcctatgtgctg<bold>tgatag</bold>aggaggagggggcag-3’, CX3CL1: 5’-tggccatgttcacctac<bold>tagtaa</bold>ctccagggctgccctcg-3’) yielding expression of C-terminally truncated <italic>tm-</italic>chemokines, respectively. Successful mutations were verified by sequencing of the plasmids (GATC Biotech AG, Koblenz, Germany). Surface expression of overexpressed native or truncated <italic>tm</italic>-chemokines was verified by immunocytochemistry. Successful C-terminal truncation of CXCL16 was proven by immunocytochemistry (see below) using antibodies against the extracellular chemokine of CXCL16 (PeproTech, #500-P200) and the HA-tag of CXCL16 (Cell signaling, #2367, clone 6E2). Successful C-terminal truncation of CX3CL1 was proven by band shift in western blot (see below) with an antibody against the extracellular domain of CX3CL1 (Pepro Tech, #500-P98). Therefore, cell membranes were isolated<sup>17</sup> and - to obtain defined bands - subjected to N-deglycosylation by PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Western blot was performed as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>RNA was isolated with the TRIZOL reagent, digested by DNase, cDNA synthesized and real time RT-PCR was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ludwig et al., 2005</xref>) using TaqMan primer probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA): <italic>hGAPDH</italic> (Hs99999905_m1), <italic>hCXCL16 (Hs00222859_m1), hCXCR6 (Hs00174843_m1), hCX3CL1 (Hs00171086_m1), hCX3CR1 (Hs00365842_m1), hCXCR3 (Hs00171041_m1), hCXCR4 (Hs00607978_s1), hCXCR7 (Hs00664172_s1), hD6 (Hs01907876_s1), hDARC (Hs01011079_s1), hCCX-CKR (Hs00664347_s1).</italic> A Custom TaqMan primer probe set was used for the detection of the cytomegalovirus gene encoding protein US28: US28F-5′- CGGCAACTTCTTGGTGATCTTC-3′, US28R-5′- CATCGCCGGAGCATTGA-3′, FAM- CCATCACCTGGCGACGTCGGA-MGB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matlaf et al., 2013</xref>).

Primary antibodies were: anti-CXCL16 and anti-CX3CL1 (both from rabbit, diluted 1:100 in PBS, PeproTech), and anti-HA (mouse, 1:100; Cell signaling); secondary antibodies: donkey anti-rabbit or donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa 555 (1:800, Invitrogen/ Life technologies). For binding experiments with CXCL16, cells were incubated with directly Cy3-labeled CXCL16 or lactalbumin (negative control with comparable molecular weight) at 4°C for 60 min in the dark, washed, fixed and nuclei counterstained with DAPI. Labeling was performed using monoreactive Cy3 NHS ester (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 2 µg protein was incubated with a four-fold excess of reactive dye in 0.2 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 8.4 (total reaction volume 90 µl). The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 µl 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.3. For binding experiments with CX3CL1, cells were incubated with biotinylated CX3CL1 or the control peptide (Fluorokine, R&amp;D Systems) at 4°C for 60 min, washed, incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 streptavidin (Invitrogen/ Life technologies), washed again, fixed and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. For flow cytometry analyses, cells were detached using 0,5 mM EDTA, stained with the CX3CL1 Fluorokine Assay following the manufacturer’s advice. For CXCL16 experiments, recombinant CXCL16 (Pepro Tech) was biotinylated with the One-step antibody biotinylation kit (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA) and used (instead of biotinylated CX3CL1) with the Fluorokine kit components. Cells were analyzed using a FACSCanto System (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany). For electron microscopy, cells seeded on coated cover slips were pre-incubated in serum free DMEM (+0.5% fatty-acid free BSA) for 30 min at 37°C, then slowly cooled down (30 min room temperature, 15 min 8°C, 15 min 4°C). All following incubation and washing steps were performed at 4°C and with pre-chilled buffers and media. Cells were briefly washed (3x) with 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, and incubated with the primary antibody (anti-CXCL16 or anti-CX3CL1, see above, 1:100) for 60 min, washed again and incubated with the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit with adsorbed 15 nm gold (Au) particles, diluted 1:40, British BioCell International, Cardiff, UK) for 60 min. Cover slips were washed again and incubated with 3 µg/ml either recombinant CXCL16 with adsorbed 5 nm gold particles or with biotinylated recombinant CX3CL1 (R&amp;D Systems) and subsequent with streptavidin adsorbed to 5 nm gold particles (British BioCell International). Cells were fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde/ 0.5% paraformaldehyde, embedded in Araldite, sectioned and viewed on a Zeiss EM 900 electron microscope. Samples were only slightly contrasted (45 min 2% osmium tetroxide before embedding and 5 min uranyl acetate (saturated) after sectioning), as strong contrasting (e.g. with lead citrate) would not allow for clear detection of gold particles. Thus, contrast of electron micrographs was digitally enhanced.

Briefly, 200,000 cells/well were seeded on 6-well dishes, grown to confluence, scratched with a pipet tip, washed and supplemented with stimuli, media with 10% fetal calf serum served as positive control. In each experiment, three scratch regions were photographed at 0 and 24 hr. Scratch areas were measured and differences between 24 and 0 hr were determined (yielding the settled area). Stimuli were normalized to non-stimulated controls. To measure proliferation, 5000 cells/well were seeded on 96 well plates and grown for 24 hr. Then media were changed to DMEM containing 1% BSA (plus respective stimuli or 10% fetal calf serum as positive control). After 24 hr incubation, proliferation was determined by the measurement of tetrazolium salt WST-1 cleavage (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and normalized to non-stimulated control (3 individual wells for each stimulus). To investigate reduction of apoptosis, 300.000 cells were seeded in 25 mm<sup>2</sup> culture flasks and cultured for 2 days to reach confluency of 80%. Apoptosis was induced by addition of Temozolomide (400 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) or 0.1 µg/ml Camptothecin applied in a stock solution in DMSO; the final solvent concentration of 2% (Temozolomide), 0.1% (Camptothecin) or 0.1 µM Staurosporine in cultures was also used in controls. After 48 hr, caspase-3/7 activity in glioma cells was measured with 40 µM Ac-DEVD-AMC (AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarine; Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) after lysis in 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4. Alternatively, 18 hr after stimulation cleavage of Poly (ADP Ribose) Polymerase (PARP) was measured by Western blot (150,000 cells/25 mm<sup>2</sup> flask, grown for 30 hr and stimulated for 18 hr) or immunocytochemistry (30, 000 cells/cover slip, grown for 30 hr and stimulated for 18 hr) as described above using an antibody specifically detecting cleaved PARP (Asp124, 1:500 for WB, 1:100 for ICC; Cell Signaling). An antibody against GAPDH (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) served as loading control for Western blot, the immunocytochemistry signal obtained by fluorescence microscopy was measured and normalized to the nuclear area yielding OD/nucleus area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Values are given as means ± standard deviations (SD) of independent biological replicates, respectively.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Hattermann and colleagues describe results from a series of studies investigating the role of trans membrane chemokines CXCL1 and 16 to signal in a novel transmembrane mechanism. The authors provide data that shed chemokines can act in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. They termed this mechanism &quot;inverse&quot; signaling. They put these results in the context of tumor biology and suggest it is a previously unrecognized of cell to cell communication. The signaling mechanism identified is novel, with a wealth of evidence of its functionality in vitro, in several cell line models. Cells negative for the classical receptors respond with the soluble chemokines in the presence of the membrane bound forms, non-responsive cells will respond to the soluble chemokines after transfecting the cells with the transmembrane forms, and inactivating the transmembrane forms by deleting their c-terminus, responsible for the intracellular domain diminish the signal transduction. Furthermore the authors showed the binding of the soluble forms to the transmembrane forms, and also other evidence for the novel signaling is provided.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the studies are well described and performed. Clearly, the results are novel and will likely be of interest. All three reviewers agreed on the interest in the studies and the potential significance of the findings. The biggest criticism is that no parallel in vivo data is provided. This is somewhat limiting, especially as the authors discuss the results in the context of tumor biology. Ideally this could be addressed with experimental evidence. At a minimum, this needs to be put in better context.</p><p>There were a few concerns raised about the in vitro studies that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) Why are the levels of the CXCL16 and CX3CL1 similar in all cells where they are expressed, like the signal is on/off- type?</p><p>2) Why would all cell types respond with equal robust readouts? No cell-specific responses were provided, and I feel this to a bit odd.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> – In contrast to the stated conclusion, inhibition of CXCR7 appears to block the effects of the soluble chemokines (as there is not much more ERK phosphorylation compared with control when treated with inhibitor, compared with when the cells are treated with vehicle). I would advise repeating this assay to establish their conclusion with certainty.</p><p>This is a bit concerning because CXCR7 is a canonical receptor and its blockade should have no effect whatsoever since the whole premise of the paper is that canonical receptors are <italic>not</italic> required for inverse signaling.

Clearly, the results are novel and will likely be of interest. All three reviewers agreed on the interest in the studies and the potential significance of the findings. The biggest criticism is that no parallel in vivo data is provided. This is somewhat limiting, especially as the authors discuss the results in the context of tumor biology. Ideally this could be addressed with experimental evidence. At a minimum, this needs to be put in better context. There were a few concerns raised about the in vitro studies that need to be addressed. 1) Why are the levels of the CXCL16 and CX3CL1 similar in all cells where they are expressed, like the signal is on/off- type?</italic></p><p>This question is indeed very interesting as this point might hint to a tissue/environment specific restriction of the “inverse signaling” and is therefore linked to the next reviewers’ comment. To address this question (expression of <italic>tm-</italic>chemokines = on/off?), we now show more ICC stainings for CXCL16 and CX3CL1 of selected cell lines in the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. These micrographs clearly indicate that expression levels are different in the respective (tumor) cell lines: while the brain tumor cell lines (glioma, neuroblastoma) show strong expression patterns, the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 shows only slight protein expression of the transmembrane chemokines. The LOX melanoma cell line does not express CXCL16 or CX3CL1 on protein level. Corresponding text passages have been added to the Results and the figure legend. Thus, protein expression corresponds to the mRNA expression levels obtained by qRT-PCR. However, these data are presented in a log-scale in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (top). Thus, expression differences shown in the graph appear to be smaller than they are. To facilitate the readability of these data, we have added an explanation on ΔC<sub>T</sub> values (a 3.33 alteration of ΔC<sub>T</sub> value corresponds to a ten-fold altered expression) in this part of the Results section.</p><p>Together with the reviewers’ next comment on the cell specificity of the cellular responses this comment led us to the obvious question if the low but detectable expression level of MCF-7 cells affects the existence and dimension of the inverse signaling. Thus, we have performed some additional experiments addressing the activation of the MAP kinase pathway and the rescue from apoptosis also with MCF-7 cells, and added the respective results to the Supplementary material (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Indeed, the <italic>tm</italic>-chemokine low expressing cell line MCF-7 shows only slight activation of MAP kinase signaling upon stimulation with <italic>s</italic>-chemokines, and the rescue from apoptosis is only mild, and hardly robust.</p><p>On this note, the data hint to a cell type specific expression strength rather than emphasizing an on/off signal. This is also supported by observations by us and others that both <italic>tm</italic>-chemokines are induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines, and therefore can be regulated by environmental conditions. A corresponding remark citing some examples in the literature has been added to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) Why would all cell types respond with equal robust readouts? No cell-specific responses were provided, and I feel this to a bit odd.</italic> </p><p>This point is – as already explained above – related to the previous point as a specific response may on the one hand depend on the cell type or on the other hand on the respective expression level. Concerning different cell lines, we see different activation kinetics of the MAP kinase in different glioma cell lines upon stimulation with the <italic>s</italic>-chemokines (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To, however, more properly address the raised concern, we performed stimulation experiments with a breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, expressing low levels of <italic>tm</italic>-chemokines. As mentioned above, this cell line showed also activation of the MAP kinase pathway and a rescue from apoptosis. However, these effects were clearly smaller and less robust in comparison to the <italic>tm</italic>-chemokine high expressing glioma cell lines. These data were added as supplementary material to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), and a note was added to the Results.</p><p>Apart from this, in a separate manuscript, we show responses and effects of “inverse signaling” in meningioma cells that closely mirror the cellular effects of glioma cells as described in this manuscript. Briefly, primary human meningioma cells (meningioma: benign brain tumor descending from the meninges) showed activation of the MAP kinase pathway, enhanced proliferation and a reduction of caspase activity upon stimulation with CXCL16.</p><p>Taken together, our data emphasize an activation of the MAP kinase pathway and anti-apoptotic/proliferative effects of the “inverse signaling” of <italic>tm</italic>-chemokines that depends on the expression level of the <italic>tm</italic>-chemokines rather than the respective (tumor) cell type.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> – In contrast to the stated conclusion, inhibition of CXCR7 appears to block the effects of the soluble chemokines (as there is not much more ERK phosphorylation compared with control when treated with inhibitor, compared with when the cells are treated with vehicle). I would advise repeating this assay to establish their conclusion with certainty.</italic> </p><p><italic>This is a bit concerning because CXCR7 is a canonical receptor and its blockade should have no effect whatsoever since the whole premise of the paper is that canonical receptors are not required for inverse signaling. Thus it might be important to get them to sort this out.</italic> </p><p>To more substantiate this, we replaced the western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> with a more convincing experiment, and added replications of this experiment to the supplementary figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, to explain the phenomenon of non-canonical chemokine receptor signaling for a broader readership we have addressed this point in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
