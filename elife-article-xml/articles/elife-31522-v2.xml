MukBEF shares the distinctive architecture of other SMC complexes, with one prominent difference; unlike other kleisins, MukF forms dimers through its N-terminal domain. We show that a 4-helix bundle adjacent to the MukF dimerisation domain interacts functionally with the MukB coiled-coiled ‘neck’ adjacent to the ATPase head. We propose that this interaction leads to an asymmetric tripartite complex, as in other SMC complexes. Since MukF dimerisation is preserved during this interaction, MukF directs the formation of dimer of dimer MukBEF complexes, observed previously in vivo. The MukF N- and C-terminal domains stimulate MukB ATPase independently and additively. We demonstrate that impairment of the MukF interaction with MukB in vivo leads to ATP hydrolysis-dependent release of MukBEF complexes from chromosomes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31522.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most DNA in a cell is arranged in structures called chromosomes. From bacteria to humans, chromosomes have to be compacted and highly organized to allow the cells to maintain and use their genetic information. In all organisms, large ring-shaped protein complexes play a crucial role in managing chromosomes. They transport and organize DNA thanks to reactions whose precise mechanism remains unknown. In bacteria, MukB and a type of kleisin called MukF are two examples of molecules involved in chromosome management.</p><p>Two MukBs join at one end to form a hinge; at the other end, each MukB protein has a neck and a head. The two heads are linked by the kleisin to form a large protein ring, which can open to capture DNA. The MukB heads can trigger a biochemical reaction that creates the energy essential to trap and release DNA during DNA transport.</p><p>Here, Zawadzka et al. study how the different components of the MukB-kleisin complex interact with each other to undergo the biochemical reactions that lead to DNA transport. The experiments show that the kleisin joins two MukB heads by attaching the base of one to the neck of the other, asymmetrically closing the ring. The separate interactions of different regions of the kleisin to the head and neck of MukB independently activate the two MukB heads, thereby controlling essential steps in the reactions with DNA. Two MukB-kleisin ring complexes are joined to each other because of a tight interaction between the two kleisin molecules. This leads Zawadzka et al. to suggest that DNA is sequentially grabbed and released from these two rings during DNA transport, similar to how a climbing rope is attached and released through carabiners.</p><p>Cells cannot survive or be healthy without their chromosomes being accurately managed. It is still unclear how molecules such as MukBs and kleinsins drive this process. A better picture of their structure and interactions is an essential first step to understand these mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MukBEF</kwd><kwd>SMC proteins</kwd><kwd>molecular machines</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Investigator Award (099204/Z/12Z)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sherratt</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP2013-K-017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sherratt</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id><institution>Narodowe Centrum Nauki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015/19/P/NZ1/03859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zawadzki</surname><given-names>Pawel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001870</institution-id><institution>Fundacja na rzecz Nauki Polskiej</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>First TEAM/2016-1/9</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zawadzki</surname><given-names>Pawel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complex, MukBEF, a dimeric MukF kleisin binds and activates MukB SMC ATPases through two independent interfaces provided by distinct MukF N- and C-terminal domains.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>SMC (<underline>S</underline>tructural <underline>M</underline>aintenance of <underline>C</underline>hromosomes) complexes have important roles in managing and processing chromosomes in all domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gligoris and Löwe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nolivos and Sherratt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uhlmann, 2016</xref>). The distinctive architecture of SMC proteins is conserved with the N-and C-terminal globular domains coming together to form an ATPase head and the intervening polypeptide folding upon itself to form ~50 nm long intramolecular coiled-coil arms, with a dimerisation hinge distal from the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Upon ATP binding, the heads of SMC dimers engage to generate two ATPase active sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haering et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lammens et al., 2004</xref>). In eukaryotes, SMC complexes are exclusively heterodimeric, whilst those in bacteria are homodimers. Nevertheless, the distinctive SMC architecture is conserved, with a kleisin protein linking the two ATPase heads of an SMC dimer, thereby forming a large tripartite proteinaceous ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> inset). Essential accessory ‘kite’ (<underline>k</underline>leisin <underline>i</underline>nteracting winged-helix <underline>t</underline>andem <underline>el</underline>ements) or ‘hawk’ (<underline>H</underline>EAT repeat subunits containing proteins <underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>w</underline>ith <underline>k</underline>leisins) bind the kleisin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palecek and Gruber, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wells et al., 2017</xref>). Hawk proteins are present in cohesins and condensins, while kites are present in bacterial SMC complexes, including MukBEF, and eukaryote SMC5/6 complexes. This suggests that the bacterial complexes are more evolutionarily related to the SMC5/6 complexes of eukaryotes than to eukaryote cohesins and condensins. A substantial body of work has led to the hypothesis that DNA segments are topologically entrapped within these tripartite rings. ATP binding and hydrolysis are required for the entrapping of DNA within the rings, loading, and for DNA release, unloading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arumugam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Çamdere et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuylen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gruber et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haering et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haering et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kanno et al., 2015</xref>; ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nasmyth, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uhlmann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilhelm et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31522.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MukBEF complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left panel; Schematic of a MukF dimer based on the structure of the MukF N-terminal region bound by MukE (pdb, 3EUH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woo et al., 2009</xref>) and the C-terminal domain (pdb 3EUK, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woo et al., 2009</xref>), with a cartoon of the intervening middle region.

Organisms encoding MukBEF have co-evolved a number of other distinctive proteins, some of which interact with MukB physically and/or functionally; specifically, topoisomerase IV and MatP both interact with MukB in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">BrezellecBrézellec et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayama and Marians, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hayama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicolas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nolivos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vos et al., 2013</xref>). MukB forms SMC homodimers, whereas MukF is the kleisin and MukE the kite protein that binds MukF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palecek and Gruber, 2015</xref>). All three proteins of the MukBEF complex are required for function, and their impairment leads to defects in chromosome segregation, manifested by impairment of segregation of newly replicated origins (<italic>ori</italic>) and mis-orientation of chromosomes with respect to their genetic map within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Danilova et al., 2007</xref>).

MukF is an atypical kleisin, in that it forms stable dimers through interacting N-terminal winged-helix domains (WHD), while its C-terminal domain interacts with the MukB head at the cap, as is the case for characterised SMC kleisins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fennell-Fezzie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woo et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, one MukB dimer is expected to bind a MukF dimer and two MukE dimers in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); ATP binding leads to head dimerisation, accompanied by steric expulsion of one of the two MukF C-terminal domains and head engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woo et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> left panel).</p><p>Here, we reveal that MukF, like other characterised kleisins, interacts functionally with the MukB neck, through a 4-helix bundle in its N-terminal domain, while its C-terminal domain interacts with the MukB head at the cap. We show that this interaction with the MukB neck is required for MukBEF function in vivo, and infer that this interaction is established and broken during cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis. Impairment of this interaction in vivo leads to ATP hydrolysis-dependent release of MukBEF clusters from chromosomes. Interactions of the MukF N-terminal domain with the MukB neck and MukF C-terminal domain with the MukB head, activate MukB ATPase independently and additively in vitro, with the addition of both fragments restoring wild type MukB ATPase levels. Each of these ATPase activities was inhibited by MukE, with the inhibition being relieved in the presence of DNA. We show that interaction of the MukF N-terminal domain with the MukB neck did not compromise MukF dimerisation. Therefore, MukF dimerisation in heads-engaged MukBEF complexes directs formation of dimers of MukBEF dimers, thereby explaining the stoichiometry observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> right panel).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The MukF N-terminal domain interacts with the MukB neck</title><p>Because of the intriguing distinction between dimeric MukF and monomeric kleisins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we set out to test, if the MukF N-terminal domain would interact with the MukB neck, thereby exhibiting the architecture of other SMC dimers and their cognate kleisins. In order to undertake an initial characterisation of MukB-MukF interactions, C- and N-terminal MukF Flag-tagged truncations, immobilised on anti-Flag resin, were analysed for binding to intact MukB and its truncated derivatives containing just the ATPase head (MukB<sub>H</sub>), or the head plus approximately a third of the adjacent coiled-coil region (MukB<sub>HN</sub>). The latter variant would be expected to retain any ‘neck’ interaction determinants for MukF, based on similarity with kleisin interacting ‘necks’, adjacent to the SMC heads of other SMC complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bürmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gligoris et al., 2014</xref>). MukF C-terminal derivatives, FC1 and FC2, interacted with MukB, and all of its derivatives, as expected, because the MukB ATPase head participates in this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woo et al., 2009</xref>). FN2, containing the N-terminal dimerisation WHD and an adjacent 4-helix bundle, interacted strongly with intact MukB and MukB<sub>HN</sub>, but not with MukB<sub>H</sub>, consistent with FN2 interacting with the MukB neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Since we reproducibly recovered low levels of MukB<sub>H</sub> in pulldowns with FN2, the MukB head might also bind FN2 weakly, although we could not substantiate this by further biochemical analyses (below). We detected no interactions of FN1, containing just the WHD involved in MukF dimerisation, with the MukB derivatives. In contrast, FN3, containing the 4-helix bundle (helices 6–9), and FN4, carrying only helices 8 and 9, interacted with MukB and MukB<sub>HN</sub>, but not MukB<sub>H</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent with this, FN6 lacking helices 8 and 9 failed to show an interaction in size exclusion chromatography-multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) assays (below) and FN7, lacking helix 9 failed to interact with MukB<sub>HN</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> bottom right panel). We conclude that while helices 8 and 9 of the 4-helix bundle are sufficient for interaction with the MukB neck, helix 9 is essential.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31522.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The MukF N-terminal domain interacts with MukB neck.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left panel; schematics of MukF truncations.

MukB<sub>HN</sub> was monomeric in solution, while FN2 was dimeric, as expected from structural analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fennell-Fezzie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woo et al., 2009</xref>). When mixed at a molar ratio of 1 MukB<sub>HN</sub> monomer:1.25 2FN2 (in the figures, we refer to FN2 dimers as 2FN2, to reflect their dimeric state), two additional peaks of masses 165 kDa and 284 kDa were evident in addition to the MukB<sub>HN</sub> monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> left panel). We interpret these as complexes in which either one or two MukB<sub>HN</sub> molecules bound independently to a single FN2 dimer. Consistent with this interpretation, more of the larger complexes were observed at higher MukB<sub>HN</sub> to 2FN2 ratios (3:1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The relatively low proportion of complexes of stoichiometry MukB<sub>HN</sub>-2FN2-MukB<sub>HN</sub> as compared to MukB<sub>HN</sub>-2FN2 in the presence of a large excess of MukB<sub>HN</sub>, indicates that binding of the second MukB<sub>HN</sub> to MukB<sub>HN</sub>-2FN2 complex may be less favourable than binding of the first MukB<sub>HN</sub> to FN2.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31522.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Complexes of MukF N- and C-terminal domains with MukB head variants.</title><p>Binding and stoichiometry of complexes was determined by SEC-MALS.

They were designed to be at different locations on the putative candidate coiled-coil helix, that protrudes from the C-terminal subdomain of the MukB head, in positions that were predicted to point towards the MukF 4-helix bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). MukBm3 (L1219K L1226K) had about 35% of wild type ATPase activity when activated by full length MukF; FN2 was unable to activate its ATPase, while FC2 activated it as efficiently as wild type MukF, consistent with its defect in interaction with FN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Although we believe that this protein can fold correctly, the failure to have its ATPase activated by the MukF C-terminal domain is not yet understood; perhaps substitutions at these residues result in an alteration of the coiled-coil structure adjacent to the head, thereby compromising head engagement.

These data suggest that the MukBm3 altered residues (L1219K and L1226K) could either be directly involved in the interaction with MukF 4-helix bundle, or that their replacement by charged lysine residues, interferes with a normal interaction interface.</p><p>Using the <italic>E. coli</italic> MukEF crystal structure (pdb, 3EUH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woo et al., 2009</xref>), along with the structure of the engaged MukB heads, we modelled a FN2 dimer bound by two monomers of MukB<sub>HN</sub>. This indicated that unless a major conformational change within FN2 dimer takes place upon MukB<sub>HN</sub> binding, the arrangement of the heads, imposed by interaction of their necks with the 4-helix bundles of the dimer, would be very different from the one revealed by the structure of the engaged MukB heads complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6A</xref>). The motifs that compose the two ATPase active sites in each head monomer would be distant and rotated away from each other. Therefore, if simultaneous binding of the two necks within the intact MukB dimer by the two N-terminal domains of MukF dimer is possible, it would produce a complex whose heads would not be able to engage in ATP binding. Whether such a complex is generated at any stage of the MukBEF activity cycle remains to be determined.</p><p>In conclusion, the functional interaction between the MukF N-terminal helix 9 and the neck region of MukB coiled-coil revealed and characterised here is equivalent to the similar interaction in other characterised SMC complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gligoris et al.

We then tested whether MukE could equally inhibit the ATPase activated by the isolated C- and N-terminal domains of MukF. The incorporation of MukE into a MukBF complex depends on the asymmetric binding of a MukE dimer to the MukF middle region, which also interacts with MukB head in the engaged MukB heads complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> left panel).

These observations of ATP hydrolysis-dependent release are consistent with the interface between the MukF N-terminal domain and the neck disengaging more frequently than the interface between MukF C-terminal domain and the cap during the activity cycles of MukBEF. Alternatively, disruption of the MukF-neck interaction could lead to more imminent release of DNA from the complex. We note that at least one MukF C-terminal domain-MukB cap interface in a dimeric MukBEF complex has to be broken in each activity cycle to allow the formation of an asymmetric heads-engaged dimeric complex in which only one MukB monomer can bind a MukF C-terminus because of steric occlusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woo et al., 2009</xref>).

First, the demonstration that the MukF N-terminal domain interacts functionally with the MukB neck, with impairment of this interaction leading to MukBEF complex release from chromosomes and a Muk<sup>-</sup> phenotype. Second, the observation that the MukF C- and N-terminal domains activate MukB ATPase independently and additively, with each domain contributing ~50% of the maximal activity in steady state assays. We propose that both of these properties relate to the formation of an asymmetric complex between a MukB dimer and MukEF after ATP binding and consequent MukB head engagement.</p><p>A crystal structure of a complex between a heads-engaged <italic>Haemophilus ducreyi</italic> MukB dimer bound by MukFE revealed this asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; pdb 3EUK; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). In the asymmetric structure, only one MukB head was bound by a MukF C-terminal domain, with the adjacent MukF middle region binding to the second MukB monomer of the MukB dimer, thereby sterically occluding the binding of a second MukF C-terminal domain. This asymmetry induced by MukB head engagement was also observed in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woo et al., 2009</xref>). Because the MukF N-terminal domain was absent in the variant used, the interaction uncovered here between the MukF N-terminal domain and the MukB neck was not evident. This view of an asymmetric MukBEF complex when heads are engaged is supported by biochemical and in vivo studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012a</xref>). Furthermore, such an asymmetry directed by interaction of the C- and N-terminal domains of kleisin with the head and neck of SMC dimers appears to be functionally conserved, regardless of whether they form SMC homodimers or heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bürmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gligoris, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huis in‘t Veld et al. 2014</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31522.035</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Summary of MukBF interactions and a model for DNA transport.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top panel; Schematics of possible configurations of MukB and MukF interactions in ATP-bound head-engaged asymmetric complexes of MukBEF.

The state shown in the middle panel (parentheses) could rarely exist if ATP binding and hydrolysis were to be coordinated between the two MukBEF dimers. For presentational simplicity, we have shown MukBEF ring opening through head disengagement, by release and transfer of the MukF C-terminal domain to the ‘<italic>cis</italic>-configuration’, although results here and elsewhere provide stronger support for ring opening through release of the MukF N-terminal domain from the MukB neck. In reality, the patterns of DNA binding and release, and the conformational changes in the complexes are likely to be more complicated, with both an upper and a lower chamber in each dimeric complex (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diebold-Durand et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uhlmann, 2016</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-31522-fig9-v2"/></fig><p>However, unlike other kleisins, which are apparently monomeric, MukF is a stable dimer and its dimerisation domain is adjacent to the 4-helix bundle, to which helices 8 and 9 belong.

Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that the asymmetric complex has the MukF C- and N-terminal domains bound to only one of the two MukB molecules, since we have shown that a single monomer of MukB<sub>HN</sub> can interact with separated MukF N- and C-terminal domains. If this were the case, an additional asymmetric interaction of the MukF middle region with the MukB monomer that is not bound by the MukF C- and N-terminal domains would be present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>; top panel; cis). Examination of the heads-engaged asymmetric MukBEF crystal structure, in which the MukF N-terminal is absent, does not allow us to distinguish between these possibilities.</p><p>Interaction between the MukF N- terminal domain and MukB neck is not only essential for MukBEF function in vivo, but also appears to be broken and reformed during cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis. Additionally, interaction between the MukF C-terminal domain and the MukB cap may also break and reform during ATP binding and hydrolysis cycles. The observation that impairment of the normal MukF-MukB interactions leads to ATP hydrolysis-dependent loss of MukBEF clusters from chromosomes indicates that by opening of at least one MukB-MukF interface, DNA can be released from the ‘bottom ring chamber’ formed by a kleisin bridging a MukB head and the MukB neck of a partner molecule. This result provides further support for a mechanism in which ATP hydrolysis is required to release MukBEF and other SMC complexes from chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nolivos et al., 2016</xref>). Equivalent interfaces between the kleisin and SMC3 neck in the yeast, <italic>drosophila</italic> and human cohesin complexes have also been proposed to act as DNA exit gates and it has been proposed that this interaction, which is not required for loading onto chromosomes, turns-over in response to ATP binding and hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckouët et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buheitel and Stemmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eichinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elbatsh et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although, a DNA exit gate formed by the SMC coiled-coil neck-kleisin interaction appears to be conserved, we think it possible that other interfaces could additionally be used for DNA release. For example, the hinge dimerisation interface, which has been proposed to be a DNA entrance gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buheitel and Stemmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gruber et al., 2006</xref>), might additionally function as an exit gate under some conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uhlmann, 2016</xref>). Because there are two potential proteinaceous chambers in SMC complexes, the upper one formed by a heads-engaged SMC complex and the lower one by the kleisin bound to the SMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diebold-Durand et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uhlmann, 2016</xref>), each of these chambers could have exit (and entrance) gates for DNA segments entrapped within each of them. In MukBEF, interaction of MatP-<italic>matS</italic> with the MukB hinge has been proposed to promote ATP hydrolysis-dependent release of MukBEF clusters from the <italic>ter</italic> region of the chromosome, suggestive of release through the dimerisation hinge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nolivos et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, MukB-dependent stimulation of catalysis by TopoIV could arise as a consequence of DNA exiting the MukB hinge and being presented to the TopoIV entrance gate, which is in proximity to the MukB hinge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zawadzki et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We propose that the observed independent and additive regulation of MukB ATPase by the MukF C- and N-terminal domains, may reflect asymmetry in the two ATPases resulting from asymmetric heads-engaged MukBEF dimer complexes. One of these could be activated by the MukF N-terminal domain and the other by the C-terminal domain. Nevertheless, examination of the heads-engaged MukBEF crystal structure did not reveal any differences in the two ATPase active sites. How the C- and N-terminal MukF domains activate MukB ATPase remain unclear; but their independent and additive action through interaction with different MukB targets, most likely on separate MukB molecules, is in our opinion, most consistent with them activating separate ATPase sites in a MukB dimer. Whether these activations occur at the stage of ATP binding, head engagement, the actual catalytic step, or several of these, remains to be determined.</p><p>Asymmetric ATPase mechanisms have been demonstrated for ABC transporters, which share the overall organisation of their ATPase heads with SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">ter Beek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Procko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, eukaryotic heterodimeric SMC complexes have active site region differences; for example, comparison of SMC1 sequences with those of SMC3 show protein family-specific differences, with their ATPases being differentially regulated, and in at least some cases, with independent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckouët et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Çamdere et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elbatsh et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2016</xref>).</p><p>We have inferred previously from in vivo experiments that ATP hydrolysis by MukBEF is required for both loading and unloading onto DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nolivos et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, one plausible explanation of our data is that the MukB neck-kleisin interaction acts in DNA unloading, leaving the MukB head-kleisin interaction to function in loading onto chromosomes. Similarly, a functional asymmetry in yeast cohesion ATPase active sites has been proposed, with the one equivalent to the kleisin-neck interaction uncovered here being required for release from chromosomes, while both ATPases were implicated in loading onto chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Çamdere et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elbatsh et al., 2017</xref>). Our own data do not address whether the interaction with the MukB neck is also required for loading.</p><p>The significance of how and why MukE inhibits the MukB ATPase activated by either the MukF C-terminal, or the N-terminal domains, remains unclear. It could arise simply from the fact that MukE binding stabilises a particular MukBF conformation, thereby leading to less turnover during the steady state multiple turnover ATPase assays. Alternatively, or additionally, this could reflect MukE playing a regulatory role during transitions between various stages of MukBEF activity cycle. Other in vitro and in vivo studies have postulated a regulatory role of MukE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gloyd et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">She et al., 2013</xref>), although details of how this regulation is mediated have been unclear. Nevertheless, depletion of MukE in vivo mimics the ATP hydrolysis-impaired phenotype of a MukB<sup>EQ</sup> mutant, which loads slowly onto DNA in the <italic>ter</italic> region, but is unable to undergo the multiple cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis required to target to <italic>ori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nolivos et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The ability of DNA to relieve MukE inhibition of MukB ATPase could result from MukE and DNA competing for binding to the MukB head. This is consistent with in vitro studies, which showed competition between MukEF and DNA for MukB binding and that MukEF inhibited MukB-mediated DNA condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Petrushenko et al., 2006b</xref>). Furthermore, a patch of positively charged amino acid residues on the surface of MukB head, close to the base of the neck, was shown to be important for interaction with DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woo et al., 2009</xref>). Projection of B-form DNA onto this patch highlights the potential competition of DNA- and MukE-binding to a MukBF complex, which may reflect alternative states during the MukBEF-DNA activity cycle.</p><p>A range of structures, alongside extensive biochemical and functional analyses, leads to the conclusion that all SMC complexes, including MukBEF, share distinctive architectures and similarities in their likely molecular basic mechanisms of action on chromosomes. Central to the SMC complex mechanism is the ability to bind and hydrolyse ATP in a modulated fashion, which directs stable loading onto chromosomes, regulated release from chromosomes and autonomous rapid transport with respect to DNA, which is likely to depend on such loading and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diebold-Durand et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Terkawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Any such transport must require at least two specific DNA-SMC complex attachment points on different conformational states of the complex, with coordinated transitions as transport proceeds. Our finding that MukF dimerisation is maintained during its interaction with the MukB neck, not only validates our demonstration of dimers of MukBEF dimers in active MukBEF clusters in vivo, but provides support for our previously proposed ‘rock (or rope) climber’ model for the transport of MukBEF dimer of dimers with respect to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012a</xref>). This model assumes that dimers of MukBEF dimers are a minimal functional unit, in which coordinated capture and processing of DNA segments by each MukBEF dimer, similar to the action of a climber reaching out to ‘grab’ a rock/rope alternatively with each arm. The staggered cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis, DNA trapping and release and associated conformational changes could effectively coordinate the activity within the partner dimers within MukBEF dimers. For SMC complexes that do not obviously form dimers of dimers, the type of loop-capture and fusion model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diebold-Durand et al., 2017</xref> has merits. In this, DNA loops captured in the upper SMC chamber are transferred to the lower chamber, where they fuse with a pre-existing loop, thereby meeting the basic requirements for ATP hydrolysis-driven transport.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>E.coli</italic> K12 AB1157)</td><td>mukBmYPetEF</td><td>SN 182 Nolivos et al.; <break/>DOI:10.1038/ncomms10466</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>E.coli</italic> K12 AB1157)</td><td>mukB EQ mYPetEF</td><td>SN 182 Nolivos et al.; <break/>DOI:10.1038/ncomms10466</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, for protein expression <break/>(<italic>E.coli</italic> C3013I)</td><td/><td>NEB</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain, for MukB protein expression <break/>(<italic>E.coli</italic> C3013I) C3013I - mukB 3xflag tag</td><td>mukB 3xFLAG C3031</td><td>FLOI - this work; <break/>derivative of SN 54; Nolivos et al; <break/>DOI:10.1038/ncomms10466</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>E.coli</italic> K12 AB1157)</td><td>RRL 149; Δ mukB</td><td>Nolivos et al.; <break/>DOI:10.1038/ncomms10466</td><td/></tr><tr><td>strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>E.coli</italic> K12 AB1157)</td><td>Ab 233; Δ mukF mukBGFP</td><td>Nolivos et al.; <break/>DOI:10.1038/ncomms10466</td><td/></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti MukF- (mouse polyclonal)</td><td>gift from Kenneth Marians, <break/>Memorial Sloan Kettering Center, <break/>New York</td><td/></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>Anti-Mouse IgG (whole molecule)– <break/>Peroxidase antibody produced in goat</td><td>SIGMA</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_258167">AB_258167</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>commercial assay or kit</td><td>ENZCheck Phosphate Assay</td><td>Life Technologies</td><td/></tr><tr><td>software, algorithm</td><td>ASTRA 6</td><td>Wyatt Technologies</td><td/></tr><tr><td>software algorithm</td><td>MicrobTracker-Matlab</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sliusarenko et al.

Cells were grown at 22°C, to A<sub>600</sub>0.4–0.6, induced with 0.2% L-Arabinose for 3 hr. Cultures were spun down and cell pellets were resuspended in gel loading buffer and proteins were separated by a 4–20% gradient SDS PAGE followed by Western blots with mouse anti-MukF antibody as primary and goat anti-mouse as secondary antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quantitative mass spectroscopy</title><p>In-solution trypsin digestion. Bacterial lysates were prepared from 50 ml cultures grown in M9 minimum media to A<sub>600</sub> ~0.2, with expression from pBAD- induced with 0.2% arabinose for 1 hr. Cells were centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended in 200 μL of 0.1% SDS in PBS, sonicated and incubated for 5 min at 100°C. After centrifugation, supernatant was collected and protein concentration was as assessed using the BCA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) method. Then, 10 μg of protein extract was digested with 0.2 μg of sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) overnight at 37°C Proteins were reduced with DTT and alkylated using iodoacetamide. Each sample was prepared for digestion in duplicate.</p><p>NanoLC-MS/MS Analysis. For each run, 1.5 μg of the digested protein samples was injected onto an RP C18 precolumn (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) connected to a 75 μm i.d. ×25 cm RP C18 Acclaim PepMap column with a particle size of 2 μm and a pore size of 100 Å, using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Every sample was injected in duplicate at random. Before analysis, the system was calibrated using Pierce LTQ ESI Positive Ion Calibration Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The following LC buffers were used: buffer A (0.1% (v/v) formic acid in Milli-Q water) and buffer B (0.1% formic acid in 90% acetonitrile). The peptides were eluted from the column with a constant flow rate of 300 nL.min<sup>−1</sup> with a linear gradient of buffer B from 5% to 65% for 120 min. At 100 min, the gradient was increased to 90% B and was held there for 10 min. Between 110 and 120 min, the gradient returned to 5% to re-equilibrate the column for the next injection. The peptides eluted from the column were analysed in the data-dependent MS/MS mode on a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The instrument settings were as follows: the resolution was set to 70,000 for MS scans, and 17,500 for the MS/MS scans to increase the acquisition rate. The MS scan range was from 300 to 2000 m/z. The MS AGC target was set to 1 × 106 counts, whereas the MS/MS AGC target was set to 5 × 104. Dynamic exclusion was set with a duration of 20 s. The isolation window was set to 2 m/z.</p><p>Analysis of proteomic data. After each LC-MS/MS run, the raw files were analysed by Proteome Discoverer, version 1.4.14 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The identification of proteins was performed using the MASCOT engine against the UniProt after adding to database sequences of recombinant proteins FN2 and FC5. Analyses were completed using the following parameters: a tolerance level of 10 ppm for MS and 0.05 Da for MS/MS and with 1% FDR. Trypsin was used as the digesting enzyme, and one missed cleavage was allowed. Estimation of protein abundance was based on the emPAI parameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishihama et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Senior Investigator Award to DJS (099204/Z/12Z) and by the Leverhulme Trust (RP2013-K-017).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Asymmetric MukB ATPases are regulated independently by the N- and C-terminal domains of MukF kleisin&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrea Musacchio as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Zawadzka et al. investigates the architecture of the <italic>E. coli</italic> MukBEF complex, its implications for the ATPase cycle and cellular functions. SMC complexes are genomic linkers that co-entrap DNA double helices using a large protein structure. Most SMC complexes form tripartite protein rings by the association of two SMC proteins with one kleisin subunit. In case of MukBEF, the exact architecture is less clear. MukF is an unusual member of the family of kleisin proteins. It forms homodimers via the interaction of its extreme N-terminal domain. In contrast, the kleisin subunits of other SMC complexes are known to interact with the head-proximal SMC coiled coil to form one of the three SMC ring interfaces.</p><p>All three reviewers agree that the manuscript provides solid and important new insights into MukBEF biochemistry and that it should appeal to a wide readership. However, the reviewers also raised a number of points, many of which can be addressed through textual changes or changes to the figures, as detailed below. Reviewer 2 found the manuscript very hard to read, and recommends that you work on your figures to make them more comprehensible. The reviewer also would like to see shorter figure legends and a substantially shortened Discussion section. There is also a general feeling that a cartoon drawing of the 'rock climber' model based on the authors' new findings would be desirable.</p><p>A strong objection, underlined by all three reviewers (and discussed again at points 7 and 8 of the &quot;Required experimental additions&quot; section), concerns the claim that MukB-F contains two independent ATPase domains. The reviewers believe that the data fail to demonstrate that the architecture of holo-MukBEF complexes is asymmetric. It is possible that a given MukF dimer binds symmetrically to either a single MukB dimer or to a dimer of MukB dimers. It is also unclear, whether FN or FC regulate the two MukB head domains differentially. The presented data is consistent with symmetric ATP hydrolysis by MukB. For instance, binding to FN or to FC might promote MukB head engagement rather than the ATP hydrolysis step. Thus, it seems premature to entertain different timing or different purpose for ATP hydrolysis by the one or the other MukB head domain. It is especially important that, among the other points, you adequately address this specific concern.</p><p>Required experimental additions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. In this semi-quantitative interaction assay it appears that interaction of the FN2, FN3 and FN4 deletion proteins with MukB is sequentially weakened, in this order. This suggests that the N-WHD and helixes 6 and 7 also make a contribution to MukB interaction. Is this the case? Clarification could come from the inclusion of FN4 in comparison with FN2 in the quantitative interaction assay (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

However, the reviewers also raised a number of points, many of which can be addressed through textual changes or changes to the figures, as detailed below. Reviewer 2 found the manuscript very hard to read, and recommends that you work on your figures to make them more comprehensible. The reviewer also would like to see shorter figure legends and a substantially shortened Discussion section. There is also a general feeling that a cartoon drawing of the 'rock climber' model based on the authors' new findings would be desirable.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the figures substantially to address this point and to make them more accessible to the general reader. We have made figure legends more concise; they now more accurately describe the figures. Furthermore, as requested, we have added an additional figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), which summarizes the findings presented in the paper and shows how these relate to the rock/rope climbing model proposed in outline earlier [which is revised appropriately, taking into account the results here]. We have re-written the Discussion section to make it more concise and incisive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A strong objection, underlined by all three reviewers (and discussed again at points 7 and 8 of the &quot;Required experimental additions&quot; section), concerns the claim that MukB-F contains two independent ATPase domains. The reviewers believe that the data fail to demonstrate that the architecture of holo-MukBEF complexes is asymmetric. It is possible that a given MukF dimer binds symmetrically to either a single MukB dimer or to a dimer of MukB dimers. It is also unclear, whether FN or FC regulate the two MukB head domains differentially. The presented data are consistent with symmetric ATP hydrolysis by MukB. For instance, binding to FN or to FC might promote MukB head engagement rather than the ATP hydrolysis step. Thus, it seems premature to entertain different timing or different purpose for ATP hydrolysis by the one or the other MukB head domain. It is especially important that, among the other points, you adequately address this specific concern.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken these important concerns into account in our revised manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the reviewers’ objection to our suggestion that the independent activation of MukB ATPase hydrolysis by the N- and C-terminal subdomains of MukF may reflect a presence of two independently-controlled ATPases, which become active at different stages of MukBEF-DNA activity cycle, we agree that this was a speculative suggestion. We therefore, have removed any references to this from the Title, Abstract and the Results section, and we have limited any discussion of this to the Discussion section, where it is raised as one possible hypothesis that could explain our data. We discuss this critically in relation to past and emerging new literature (in particular to a new BioRxiv paper from the Rowland-Haering labs; Elbatsh et al., 2017).</p><p>With regard to MukB dimers forming an asymmetric complex on ATP (or equivalent) binding in the presence of MukEF, we more explicitly point out that the crystal structure of a MukBEF heads-engaged complex determined by Byung-Ha Oh and colleagues (Woo et al., 2009) demonstrated an asymmetric complex that provides a platform for the interpretation of our data. This structure provided a partial molecular explanation of the asymmetry, because in the heads-engaged state, binding of a second MukF C-terminal domain was sterically prevented by the binding of the MukF middle region attached to the C-terminal domain bound to a head. Furthermore, this paper showed that this displacement of a second MukF C-terminal domain during MukB head engagement occurs in solution and the MukF middle region is required for this displacement. Nevertheless, this work could not address any interaction of the MukF N-terminal domain with the MukB neck, because this domain was absent in the proteins used for crystallography. Our demonstration of such an interaction demonstrates MukBEF likely has an asymmetric architecture comparable to other SMC complexes (notably <italic>B. subtilis</italic> SMC and eukaryote cohesin complexes). We agree that our work does not provide direct evidence for the N-and C-terminal domains of MukF binding to different monomers of MukB dimer and this is clearly pointed out with appropriate schematics in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and accompanying text). Nevertheless, unless the Woo et al. asymmetric structure is functionally irrelevant, then our demonstration of the MukF-MukB neck interaction, substantiates and strengthens the case for asymmetry in the heads-engaged dimeric complex, although the dimer of dimers complex would be symmetric.</p><p>In our opinion, all of this is addressed satisfactorily in the revised manuscript. Parenthetically, if both N- and C-terminal domains within a MukF monomer bind ‘in cis’ to the same MukB monomer, asymmetry would still be present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), although there would be less justification for proposing that they activate two different ATPases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Required experimental additions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. In this semi-quantitative interaction assay it appears that interaction of the FN2, FN3 and FN4 deletion proteins with MukB is sequentially weakened, in this order. This suggests that the N-WHD and helixes 6 and 7 also make a contribution to MukB interaction. Is this the case? Clarification could come from the inclusion of FN4 in comparison with FN2 in the quantitative interaction assay (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Else, this should at least be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in pointing out that superficial examination of the semi-quantitative pulldowns, indicates that interaction of N-terminal MukF truncations with MukB or MukBHN may weaken as the variants get smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> top left and right panels). Nevertheless, closer examination shows that the levels of the respective MukF variants on the FLAG resin also decreases in the same order, consistent with the possibility that the level of pulldown signal is influenced by the amount of ‘bait’ on the resin. Therefore, we see no strong grounds to implicate either the N-WHD or helices 6 and 7 in the interaction. Close examination of the figure makes this point obvious; we now point this out in the revised legend. Importantly, these assays demonstrate that a MukF truncation bearing helices 8 and 9 is sufficient for interaction with the MukB neck in extracts. The variant FN4, containing helices 8 and 9, was not biochemically tractable during and after purification, so we have been unable to study its interaction with the MukB neck by SEC-MALS etc. We now state this in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In addition, in this experiment, there also appears to be a detectable interaction between FN2 and the MukB head domain (MukB-H).

Nevertheless, we were unable to validate such an interaction by SECMALS, suggesting that either it is not real, or it is insufficiently strong to survive gel filtration.

Unfortunately, “free” MukB heads or MukBHNs do not dimerize significantly in the presence of ATP/AMPPNP under any experimental conditions we have tried and did not support significant ATPase levels in the presence or absence of MukF. Therefore, the experiments proposed in 7 above were not informative. Similarly, constructs carrying covalently joined dimeric MukBHNs showed very little MukF-dependent ATPase and are potentially compromised in mutant experiments because a given MukB N-terminal domain can potentially form a ‘head’ with either of the two C-terminal MukB domains in the covalent dimer. Experiments to address this issue are important, but challenging, and in our opinion beyond the scope of this manuscript. Parenthetically and worryingly, we understand from colleagues working with other SMC complexes, that the dimerization hinge may be important for ATPase activity, therefore making the sorts of experiments proposed here even more challenging.</p><p>In our opinion, the revised manuscript deals with all of these concerns satisfactorily.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>: The observed dissolution of MukB foci by overexpression of FN might alternatively be explained by the disruption of MukF dimers by FN.

What is shown is that the EQ mutant is resistant to displacement by overexpressed MukF fragments.

The reason for the different response to MukF fragment overexpression could therefore be indirect.
