A major challenge of lineage conversion is to generate specific cell subtypes. The pancreatic islets contain three major hormone-secreting endocrine subtypes: insulin<sup>+</sup> β-cells, glucagon<sup>+</sup> α-cells, and somatostatin<sup>+</sup> δ-cells. We previously reported that a combination of three transcription factors, Ngn3, Mafa, and Pdx1, directly reprograms pancreatic acinar cells to β-cells. We now show that acinar cells can be converted to δ-like and α-like cells by Ngn3 and Ngn3+Mafa respectively. Thus, three major islet endocrine subtypes can be derived by acinar reprogramming. Ngn3 promotes establishment of a generic endocrine state in acinar cells, and also promotes δ-specification in the absence of other factors. δ-specification is in turn suppressed by Mafa and Pdx1 during α- and β-cell induction. These studies identify a set of defined factors whose combinatorial actions reprogram acinar cells to distinct islet endocrine subtypes in vivo.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01846.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01846.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01846.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In mammals, the pancreas is responsible for controlling blood sugar by secreting insulin from specialized β-cells. Other cells in the pancreas, called δ-cells and α-cells, secrete other hormones to assist the β-cells. Diabetes is caused when this system breaks down: either the body attacks its own β-cells (type I diabetes), or the body stops responding properly to insulin (type II).</p><p>Type I diabetes is usually treated with insulin injections, but there is increasing interest in the possibility of replacing the defective β-cells instead. Building on previous work in which a fourth type of pancreatic cell, called an acinar cell, was reprogrammed to become a β-cell, Li et al. have now shown that the same technique can be used to produce α- and δ-cells as well. Just as the reprogrammed β-cells secreted insulin, like real β-cells, the reprogrammed α- and δ-cells also behaved like real α- and δ-cells.</p><p>The reprogramming technique relies on using a combination of three transcription factors—which are called Ngn3, Pdx1 and Mafa—to treat the acinar cells from mice. Previously, it was shown that using a combination of all three transcription factors reprogrammed the acinar cells to become β-cells. Now, Li et al. show that the Ngn3 transcription factor on its own appears to suppress certain genes that are usually expressed in acinar cells, and goes on to cause the acinar cells to become δ-cells. However, a combination of Ngn3 and Mafa produces a mixture of α- and δ-cells. The next challenge is to adapt this reprogramming technique to generate different types of hormone secreting cells from human tissue sources in order to explore its therapeutic potential.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01846.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01846.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>pancreatic endocrine cell</kwd><kwd>direct lineage conversion</kwd><kwd>in vivo reprogramming</kwd><kwd>acinar to endocrine conversion</kwd><kwd>islet delta, alpha, beta cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4 R00 DK077445</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Qiao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000901</institution-id><institution>Juvenile Diabetes Research foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Weida</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japanese Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakanishi</surname><given-names>Mio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zumsteg</surname><given-names>Adrian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakanishi</surname><given-names>Mio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combinations of transcription factors can convert pancreatic acinar cells into endocrine α-, β- and δ-cells in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular reprogramming is a rapidly expanding area of regenerative medicine. With suitable reprogramming factors, adult cells can be instructively converted to induced pluripotent stem cells (pluripotent reprogramming) or other types of adult cells (lineage reprogramming) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gurdon and Melton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graf and Enver, 2009</xref>). Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) can be differentiated into many cell types in the body. However, the generation of iPS cells and their subsequent differentiation is a lengthy and technically demanding process. Lineage conversion between adult cell types offers a promising alternative, directly producing defined cell types in vitro or even in vivo that may be used for disease modeling and cellular therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou and Melton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vierbuchen and Wernig, 2011</xref>). Recent examples of lineage reprogramming include the conversion of pre-B cells to macrophages, pancreatic acinar, α-cells, and gut cells to insulin-secreting β-cells, cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocyte-like cells, amniotic cells to endothelial cells, and skin fibroblasts to neurons, oligodendrocytes, neural precursors, or blood progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ieda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Szabo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thorel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vierbuchen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caiazzo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ginsberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Talchai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Najm et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Despite increasing success of lineage conversion, a major challenge of this approach is to direct the formation of specific cell types: there is a great diversity of cell types in the adult body, and many of them are further differentiated into closely related subtypes. The most extensive subtype diversification can be found in the mammalian central nervous system, where hundreds of neuronal subtypes exist. A few mammalian neuronal subtypes, including dopaminergic-like and motoneuron-like cells, have been produced from fibroblast conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caiazzo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Son et al., 2011</xref>); methods to generate many others remain to be defined. To study subtype specification in lineage reprogramming, it is necessary to first establish models, where a defined set of factors promote formation of distinct subtypes. A recent study in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> provided such an example, where removal of a chromatin factor confers neurogenic competence to germ cells, which can be subsequently converted to different neuronal subtypes by neuron selector genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tursun et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To establish models of mammalian subtype specification in lineage reprogramming, we focused our studies in a relatively simple system, the adult pancreas, where the endocrine islets are surrounded by acinar cells, a type of exocrine cells that secret digestive enzymes. The islets contain three major endocrine subtypes: insulin<sup>+</sup> β-cells, glucagon<sup>+</sup> α-cells, and somatostatin<sup>+</sup> δ-cells. β-cells secret insulin and play a key role in blood glucose regulation, whereas α- and δ-cells secrete glucagon and somatostatin to support β-cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edlund, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jensen, 2004</xref>).</p><p>We reported previously that pancreatic acinar cells can be directly converted to insulin<sup>+</sup> β-cells in adult mouse pancreas by combined actions of three transcription factors, Ngn3, Pdx1, and Mafa (referred to as M3 factors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). We now report that acinar cells can also be converted to the other endocrine subtypes, namely, somatostatin<sup>+</sup> δ-like cells and glucagon<sup>+</sup> α-like cells, by Ngn3 and Ngn3+Mafa respectively. A defined set of factors can therefore reprogram acinar cells to the three major islet endocrine subtypes. Further studies indicate that Ngn3, but not Mafa and Pdx1, promotes establishment of a generic endocrine state in acinar cells at the onset of reprogramming by suppressing acinar fate-regulators and activating pan-endocrine genes. Ngn3 also promotes δ-subtype specification in the absence of other factors. Mafa and Ngn3 in turn suppress δ-specification in α- and β-cell formation, thus ensuring creation of singular endocrine subtypes. Our studies establish a series of models where combinatorial functions of defined factors convert pancreatic acinar cells to three distinct endocrine subtypes in vivo. These models provide a powerful system to gain mechanistic understanding of the lineage reprogramming process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reprogramming acinar to δ-, α-, and β-like endocrine cells</title><p>We have previously reported that pancreatic acinar cells can be converted to insulin<sup>+</sup> β-like cells by the combined activity of three reprogramming factors: Ngn3, Mafa, and Pdx1, referred to as M3 factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Employing the same experimental system of adenoviral expression in adult mouse pancreas, which specifically targets acinar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we examined the role of individual M3 factors in endocrine reprogramming. Surprisingly, Ngn3 alone induced formation of somatostatin<sup>+</sup> (Sst) cells in approximately 40% of infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>), whereas Mafa or Pdx1 alone did not induce any hormone positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, co-infection of Ngn3- and Mafa-induced formation of both glucagon<sup>+</sup> (Gcg) and somatostatin<sup>+</sup> cells, which are distinct from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E,F</xref>). The other two-factor combinations, Ngn3 with Pdx1 and Pdx1 with Mafa, did not yield hormone positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Somatostatin and glucagon are the principle hormones of endocrine δ- and α-cells. These data suggest that different combinations of three reprogramming factors could convert pancreatic acinar cells in vivo to the three major islet endocrine cell types: δ-, α- and β-cells. The expression of reprogramming factors in δ- and α-cell induction is transient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), similar to β-cell induction using the same experimental approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). To confirm the identity of the induced Sst<sup>+</sup> and Gcg<sup>+</sup> cells, we examined whether the induced cells have key features of endogenous δ- and α-cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01846.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Induction of somatostatin<sup>+</sup>, glucagon<sup>+</sup>, and insulin<sup>+</sup> cells with defined factors in adult mouse pancreas in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of experimental strategy.

In particular, the secretory granules of each islet subtype have characteristic morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Larsson et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leiter et al., 1979</xref>). Electron microscopy analysis revealed that the secretory granules of induced δ-cells are spherical or ellipsoidal with matrix filling the entire granule space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,E′</xref>). This morphology is typical of endogenous δ-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,D′</xref>) and distinct from that of α-or β-granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, we observed that the induced δ-cells were embedded among acinar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, arrow points to dense assembly of endoplasmic reticulum in a neighboring acinar cell), consistent with their origins from acinar cells. In contrast, endogenous δ-cells reside exclusively within islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>To further characterize the induced δ-cells, we generated gene expression data from FACS purified induced δ-cells (day 10 after infection) using mCherry, a fluorescent marker coexpressed with Ngn3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cherry<sup>+</sup> cells contain approximately 40% induced δ-cells. Gene profiling with illumina arrays yielded 1283 genes enriched in the induced δ-cells (30 days after induction) relative to acinar cells (GEO: GSE52522). Because there is currently no method available that allows purification of endogenous δ-cells, we compared their expression profile with that of whole islets, which are comprised largely of β-cells. 632 of the induced genes (49%) overlapped with the islet-enriched gene set that we previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>) (GEO: GSE12025). Given that δ-cells represent a minor fraction of total mouse islet cells (5.5% as determined by FACS, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), the non-overlapping genes (651) may contain δ-cell-enriched factors that are under-represented in the whole-islet samples. Indeed, among the top 30 most highly induced genes in the δ-like cells, many show low expression in whole islet samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). We detected up-regulation of <italic>Hhex</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), a gene recently implicated in δ-cell biology (72nd ADA abstract, Klaus Kaestner lab). In contrast, glucagon, insulin, and the β-cell marker Nkx6.1 are abundantly expressed in islets but absent from induced δ-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p>We analyzed the DNA methylation status of several gene promoters to assess epigenetic changes in the conversion of acinar to δ-like cells. These genes included <italic>Somatostatin</italic> (δ-cells), <italic>Amylase2</italic> (acinar cells), and <italic>Insulin2</italic> (β-cells). Studies have shown that insulin2 gene expression is regulated by DNA sequences located within approximately 400 bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hay and Docherty, 2006</xref>). Similarly, approximately 200 bp of the <italic>Amylase 2</italic> promoter is sufficient to direct acinar-specific expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Minami et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore assayed CpGs located in these critical promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). There are very limited studies on the <italic>Somatostatin</italic> promoter so we assayed seven CpGs that fall within a highly conversed promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). We adapted an intracellular FACS protocol to purify endogenous and induced δ-cells after staining with somatostatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pechhold et al., 2009</xref>). We note that this protocol allows isolation of genomic DNA but not intact mRNA from the pancreatic tissues. We have not been successful at generating gene-profiling data from the induced δ-cells using the intracellular FACS method.</p><p>None of the CpG sites assayed in the <italic>somatostatin</italic> promoters was methylated in all samples tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), indicating that this promoter is not subject to regulation by DNA methylation. <italic>Amylase2,</italic> a gene exclusively expressed in pancreatic acinar cells, was largely unmethylated in acinar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In contrast, the induced δ-cells showed strong methylation in this promoter similar to islet δ-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). The <italic>Insulin2</italic> promoter was fully methylated in acinar cells but partially demethylated in both endogenous and induced δ-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). For both amylase and Insulin promoters, the methylation differences of acinar/islet δ-cell and acinar/induced δ-cell are statistically highly significant (p&lt;0.001) whereas there is no significant difference between islet δ-cells and induced δ-cells (p=0.23 and 0.30 for amylase and insulin promoter respectively). These studies suggest that substantial DNA methylation changes occurred during acinar to δ-cell conversion in the promoters we studied. It is notable that not all cell fate conversion events are associated with DNA methylation changes. For example, no significant DNA methylation was observed in the conversion of pre-B cells to macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rodriguez-Ubreva et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We evaluated the ability of induced δ-cells to secret hormones in an in vitro secretion assay. The acinar fraction that contains induced δ-cells was isolated 30 days after induction and stimulated with the secretagogue Arginine. The induced δ-cells responded to Arginine and released somatostatin, in a manner similar to isolated islets which contain endogenous δ-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). In contrast, control acinar cells did not respond to Arginine stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), consistent with the fact that they do not express endocrine hormones. These data suggest that induced δ-cells possess cellular machineries necessary for hormone production, storage, and release.</p><p>The data described above collectively indicate that δ-like cells induced by Ngn3 expression in adult pancreas possess key features of endogenous δ-cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ngn3 and Mafa converts acinar to α-like cells</title><p>Co-infection of adult mouse pancreas with two different adenoviruses carrying Ngn3- and Mafa-induced formation of glucagon<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Genetic deletion of Arx during embryonic development results in the absence of α-cells, whereas ectopic expression of Arx in β-cells causes their phenotypic drift towards α-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collombat et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhawan et al., 2011</xref>). We observed strong Arx expression in all induced Gcg<sup>+</sup> cells, although some Gcg<sup>−</sup> cells also expressed Arx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B,B′</xref>).

The induced α-cells are readily observable 2 month after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Electron microscopy analysis of the induced α-cells indicates that they share a similar ultrastructure as the endogenous α-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>).

To test whether the induced δ-and α-cells also derive from acinar cells, we used a genetic lineage tracing strategy similar to the previous study.

Ngn3 plays a critical role in establishing a generic endocrine state in acinar cells by suppressing acinar fate regulators (Ptf1a, Nr5a2, Mist1) and activating pan-endocrine factors (Pax6, Islet1, etc) (upper panel). Down-regulation of acinar regulators is critical as they can block reprogramming. In endocrine subtype-specification (lower panel), Ngn3 promotes δ-fate in the absence of other factors. Mafa and Pdx1 act in concert with Ngn3 to promote α- and β-specification. Both Mafa and Pdx1 can suppress δ-subtype specification, whereas α-specification is also suppressed in β-induction. Combinatorial actions of the three reprogramming factors therefore led to formation of distinct endocrine subtypes. (<bold>C</bold>) A summary table of reprogramming factor functions.

Ngn3 plays a central role in promoting the endocrine state at the onset of reprogramming by suppressing acinar fate regulators and activating pan-endocrine genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, upper panel). This early step is critical as continued expression of key acinar factors will block endocrine conversion.</p><p>Compared with Ngn3, Mafa suppresses acinar regulators but does not activate pan-endocrine genes, whereas Pdx1 lacks the ability to initiate either of these two events. It is likely that the main function of Mafa and Pdx1 is to collaborate with Ngn3 to activate subtype-specific genes such as Arx in α-induction (this study) and Nkx6.1 in β-induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Another important function of Mafa and Pdx1 is to suppress δ-specification, thus ensuring formation of singular α- and β-subtypes, and preventing hybrid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, lower panel). Our data together suggest that each of the three factors possesses both activator and suppressor functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). It will be important to fully elucidate the molecular details of these functions in future studies.</p><p>During pancreatic development, numerous studies have highlighted the importance of Ngn3 in controlling endocrine fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jensen, 2004</xref>). A recent study showed that ectopic expression of Ngn3 in embryonic pancreas suppressed exocrine fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Qu et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, Ngn3 can suppress exocrine fate and promote endocrine fate during both embryogenesis in progenitor cells and during adulthood in differentiated acinar cells. The function of Pdx1 has also been extensively studied and demonstrated to be critical in early pancreatic fate determination, as well as a later role in beta cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murtaugh, 2007</xref>). It is not clear, however, exactly what role Pdx1 plays in δ- and α-cell specification in embryogenesis. Mafa is expressed in pancreatic β-cells during development and plays a role in controlling β-cell gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hang and Stein, 2011</xref>). The ability of Mafa to induce α-cell formation in collaboration with Ngn3 from acinar is nevertheless not entirely surprising. Its close homologue Mafb is expressed during pancreas development in a subset of endocrine progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nishimura et al., 2006</xref>). Mafb deletion leads to decreased α- and β-cell numbers, suggesting a role for Maf factor in α-cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nishimura et al., 2008</xref>). Taken together, there are clear similarities in the function of Ngn3, Mafa, and Pdx1 in normal endocrine development and endocrine reprogramming from acinar cells. Nevertheless, the epigenetic landscape of pancreatic progenitors and adult acinar cells in which these factors operate is presumably very different. Further, the ‘generic endocrine state’ established by Ngn3 in acinar cells is not equivalent to an endocrine progenitor in pancreas development. For example, expression of pancreatic progenitor genes such as <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Hnf6</italic> was not detected during the reprogramming process (data not shown).</p><p>One surprising finding from our study is that Ngn3 alone promotes δ-cell formation from acinar cells. Among the pancreatic endocrine subtypes, relatively little is known about the δ-cells. No genetic factors have been discovered that specify δ-cell fate in pancreas development. The molecular details of how Ngn3 functions to specify δ-subtype remains to be determined.</p><p>Conversion of acinar cells to α-cells requires both Ngn3 and Mafa. The optimal method to induce Gcg<sup>+</sup> α-like cells is by co-expression of Ngn3 and Mafa from two separate viruses at a 1:1 ratio. Varying the ratio of the two viruses or polycistronic co-expression of both factors led to reduced α-cell formation. These results are reminiscent of induced pluripotent reprogramming from fibroblasts where polycistronic co-expression of OSKM factors led to substantially reduced efficiency of iPS formation compared with random infection by OSKM factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2009</xref>). This difference has been suggested to result from a need for appropriate reprogramming factor stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carey et al., 2011</xref>). We speculate that the induction of α-like cells may similarly require optimized Ngn3/Mafa stoichiometry along with other conditions such as specific expression level and dynamics of the factors, which can be met at the more ‘flexible’ co-injection system with each cell expressing variable levels of Ngn3/Mafa, compared with the more ‘fixed’ polycistronic expression system. Future experiments will be required to elucidate mechanisms of α-cell induction.</p><p>Our studies suggest that a suitable strategy to produce specific subtypes of cells by lineage conversion is to combine factors that confer broad competence with factors that confer subtype specificity. An elegant example was demonstrated in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where removal of a chromatin factor and employment of neuron selector genes allows conversion of germ cells to different neuronal subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tursun et al., 2011</xref>). The mammalian system is far more complex, but similar principles may well apply. It is hoped that insight from lineage reprogramming studies will lead to informed design and improved technology, thereby helping to unlock the tremendous therapeutic potential of this approach.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction and purification of adenovirus</title><p>Genes of interest were first cloned into a shuttle vector containing a 2A-Cherry, then into the pAd/CMV/V5-DEST adenoviral vector (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Senior editor, Janet Rossant, and 2 other reviewers.</p><p>The Senior editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Senior editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper of Li et al. is a sequel to an earlier publication in which the senior authors described the in vivo reprogramming of acinar cells into β islet cells in the pancreas, using a combination of three specific transcription factors. They now go an important step further, describing the effect of individual or dual combinations of these factors, which result in the formation of α- and δ-cells. They also deduce a sequence of synergistic and cross-antagonistic interactions of these factors that result in three defined cell states. The results are very interesting and overall convincing, although a few serious concerns remain.</p><p>Major concerns to be addressed:</p><p>1) The purification of endogenous and induced delta and alpha cells described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref> is unconvincing. First, since the reprogramming vectors introduced carry cherry as an infection marker it is unclear why the i-δ cells are cherry negative. Second, the i-α cells (D) could represent an autofluorescence artifact since a similar population can be seen in C. Here, a WT control must be shown, and signals recorded in irrelevant channels.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> the i-δ cells do not produce more somatostatin than islet control cells, although these contain only 5 % δ-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref>). How can it then be concluded that 'the i-δ cells respond to arginine and released somatostatin, indicating that they possess the cellular machineries...' (penultimate paragraph in the Results section “Ngn3 converts acinar to δ-like cells”)? Minimally, to make this claim it is necessary to show the hormone production of i-δ cells not stimulated with arginine (as well as that of islet controls). Also, in the text it appears as if endogenous delta cells were tested, which was obviously not the case.</p><p>3) Please explain efficiency of co-infection. Assuming an infection rate of smaller than 100 % one would expect in a 3-factor infection using different viruses that there is at least a small fraction of single and double infected cells. It is therefore quite surprising why in the 3-factor condition not a single Sst or Gcg<sup>+</sup> cell was found. Or similarly, Ngn3+Pdx1 co-infection should lead to some Ngn3-only infected cells. Have the authors validated with e.g., different fluorescence proteins that co-infection rates are indeed 100 %? Along the same lines, this requirement of 100 % infection efficiency to explain the data is somewhat at odds with the authors suggestion that low infection rates would explain their finding that with Ngn3+Mafa both Sst (presumably Ngn-only) and Gcg cells (presumably Ngn+Mafa).</p><p>4) How stable is the transformation long term, given that the cells are not in the right islet environment? They state δ- and α-cells are stable for at least 2 months – is this the end? Did the authors confirm that the exogenous transgenes are silenced? And in what time frame were they silenced?</p><p>5) The induced δ-cells could be sorted using mCherry from the vector – what time after induction was this – 10 days? How long does mCherry stay on in the induced cells? Can you use mCherry to sort the cells and do the in vitro secretion assays on sorted cells to ensure no contamination with exocrine cells?</p><p>6) Some discussion of the relevance of the findings to the regulatory pathways of normal pancreatic development would be helpful. The studies on using different vectors to assess the hierarchy of activation and repression of the different cell fates are nicely done and do provide a model of how this set of transcription factors can control cell fate conversion. What was not so clear was whether and how this regulatory hierarchy works during normal development of the pancreas. It is stated that the Ngn-induced state is not the same as that of an early pancreatic progenitor, but is Ngn normally involved in repressing acinar cell fate? More discussion on the similarities and differences between the induced state and the normal cell fate controls would be useful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01846.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The purification of endogenous and induced delta and alpha cells described in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4"><italic>Figure 2–figure supplement 4</italic></xref> <italic>is unconvincing.

Here, a WT control must be shown, and signals recorded in irrelevant channels</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are correct that both i-δ and i-α cells are cherry<sup>+</sup>. An observation we made that is relevant to the question raised by the reviewers is that upon fixation of cells with paraformaldehyde, Cherry fluorescence diminishes rapidly, indicating a quenching effect. Such a fixation step was performed in the intracellular FACS experiments and depending on the fixation time, the strength of the Cherry signal could vary significantly. A fixation time that differs by a few minutes made a difference in Cherry signal. In contrast, staining for hormones (somatostatin or glucagon) was performed after fixation and their fluorescence was unaffected by fixation length. Our records show that the original i-δ FACS data were collected from cells that went through longer fixation, thus the cherry fluorescence was weak. We now present FACS data with shorter fixation time, where stronger Cherry signals are apparent in i-δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>On the second point raised by the reviewers, we now provide all the control FACS plots associated with i-α purification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>. These data clearly show that the signals are not autofluorescence.</p><p><italic>2) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2I</italic></xref> <italic>the i-δ cells do not produce more somatostatin than islet control cells, although these contain only 5 % δ-cells (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4"><italic>Figure 2–figure supplement 4</italic></xref><italic>).

Also, in the text it appears as if endogenous delta cells were tested, which was obviously not the case</italic>.</p><p>The original presentation of the data, as the reviewers pointed out, was unclear. We have now clarified this data set by showing the relative hormone secretion for i-δ and i-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, respectively) with and without Arginine stimulation. We further added acinar cells as a control. Our data showed that acinar cells did not secrete somatostatin or glucagon in response to Arginine, whereas i-δ and i-α secreted hormone upon stimulation.</p><p>The reviewers are right that whole islets, not isolated endogenous cells, were used as controls. We thank the reviewers for pointing out this error. The text has now been corrected.</p><p><italic>3) Please explain efficiency of co-infection. Assuming an infection rate of smaller than 100 % one would expect in a 3-factor infection using different viruses that there is at least a small fraction of single and double infected cells. It is therefore quite surprising why in the 3-factor condition not a single Sst or Gcg</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>cell was found. Or similarly, Ngn3+Pdx1 co-infection should lead to some Ngn3-only infected cells. Have the authors validated with e.g., different fluorescence proteins that co-infection rates are indeed 100 %? Along the same lines, this requirement of 100 % infection efficiency to explain the data is somewhat at odds with the authors suggestion that low infection rates would explain their finding that with Ngn3+Mafa both Sst (presumably Ngn-only) and Gcg cells (presumably Ngn+Mafa)</italic>.</p><p>In this study, we used two different strategies to co-express two or three factors simultaneously. Where possible, our first choice is to use polycistronic co-expression. In this approach, multiple factors are expressed from a single construct in a single adenovirus. The co-expression is enabled by the viral 2A peptides placed between the factors. Published studies suggest that this polycistronic approach can lead to near 100 % co-expression of the factors (Szymczak and Vignali, 2005). Our studies also showed excellent co-localization of the 3-factors when expressed polycistronically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). We observed that Polycistronic expression of the 3-factor indeed led to exclusive formation of i-β cells, with essentially no i-δ and i-alpha formation (after counting over 2,000 cherry<sup>+</sup> cells, one or two Sst<sup>+</sup> and glucagon<sup>+</sup> cells were detected). Similarly, Ngn3.Pdx1 data were from polycistronic expression of Ngn3 and Pdx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>A second strategy we used for multi-factor expression is by co-injection of multiple adenoviruses with each carrying a single factor. The reviewers are right that co-expression by this method is not 100%. Our estimation is that it varies from 92-98% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). We used co-injection mainly to induce i-α cells (Ngn3+Mafa) because this method yielded more i-α cells compared with polycistronic expression. The precise mechanism for this difference is unclear. We discussed these observations in the Results section and the Discussion section.</p><p>Getting back to the reviewers’ point, when we co-injected the 3-factor instead of polycistronic expression, we indeed observed small numbers of Sst<sup>+</sup> and glucagon<sup>+</sup> cells. Similarly, co-infection of Ngn3 and Pdx1 can lead to formation of a small number of Sst<sup>+</sup> cells, as the reviewers predicted.</p><p>We have revised the figure legends and text throughout to clarify where polycistronic expression was used and where co-injection was used.</p><p><italic>4) How stable is the transformation long term, given that the cells are not in the right islet environment? They state δ- and α-cells are stable for at least 2 months – is this the end? Did the authors confirm that the exogenous transgenes are silenced? And in what time frame were they silenced</italic>?</p><p>We have not tracked the induced cells beyond 2.5 months. We agree with the reviewers that outside the islet environment, the induced endocrine cells may not be able to persist long-term. Future experiments will be required to fully elucidate the long-term behavior of the induced cells.</p><p>We present new qPCR results and immunohistochemistry data to document the time line of transgene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>). qPCR results showed strong transgene expression 2 days after viral infection, substantial decline by day 10, and a return to baseline level by day 30. These results indicate that transgene expression mediated by adenovirus in adult mouse pancreas is transient, consistent with what we reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) The induced δ-cells could be sorted using mCherry from the vector – what time after induction was this – 10 days? How long does mCherry stay on in the induced cells? Can you use mCherry to sort the cells and do the</italic> in vitro <italic>secretion assays on sorted cells to ensure no contamination with exocrine cells</italic>?</p><p>The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and 2G</xref> are from FACS isolated cherry<sup>+</sup> cells 10 days after induction. Our observation from this study and others is that cherry expression can be detected in induced endocrine cells many months after the initial induction, although the fluorescence goes down with time. However, FACS significantly damages cells due to harsher enzymatic digestion required to dissociate tissue into single cells as well as the FACS procedure itself. Data from such damaged cells will not be reliable. The acinar cells do not express any of the endocrine hormones and they do not respond to Arginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Acinar cells present in the hormone secretion samples should therefore not interfere with the results.</p><p><italic>6) Some discussion of the relevance of the findings to the regulatory pathways of normal pancreatic development would be helpful. The studies on using different vectors to assess the hierarchy of activation and repression of the different cell fates are nicely done and do provide a model of how this set of transcription factors can control cell fate conversion. What was not so clear was whether and how this regulatory hierarchy works during normal development of the pancreas. It is stated that the Ngn-induced state is not the same as that of an early pancreatic progenitor, but is Ngn normally involved in repressing acinar cell fate? More discussion on the similarities and differences between the induced state and the normal cell fate controls would be useful</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We added a paragraph in the Discussion to discuss in length relevant information on the three factors in endocrine cell development during embryogenesis and compare their functions in reprogramming.</p></body></sub-article></article>
