Using <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells, we show here that seipin, an ER protein implicated in LD biology, mediates a discrete step in LD formation—the conversion of small, nascent LDs to larger, mature LDs. Seipin forms discrete and dynamic foci in the ER that interact with nascent LDs to enable their growth. In the absence of seipin, numerous small, nascent LDs accumulate near the ER and most often fail to grow. Those that do grow prematurely acquire lipid synthesis enzymes and undergo expansion, eventually leading to the giant LDs characteristic of seipin deficiency. Our studies identify a discrete step of LD formation, namely the conversion of nascent LDs to mature LDs, and define a molecular role for seipin in this process, most likely by acting at ER-LD contact sites to enable lipid transfer to nascent LDs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16582.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16582.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16582.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living organisms often store energy in the form of fat molecules called triglycerides. Enzymes in a compartment of the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum catalyze the chemical reactions needed to make these triglycerides. The cell then stores the triglycerides in a different structure called the lipid droplet. Lipid droplets form from the endoplasmic reticulum in an organized manner, but little is known about the cellular machinery that gives rise to lipid droplets.</p><p>A protein called seipin is thought to be involved in lipid droplet formation. Seipin resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and a shortage of this protein in cells leads to abnormal lipid droplets – that is, cells often have lots of tiny lipid droplets or a few giant ones. People who lack seipin lose much of their fat tissue and instead store fat in the wrong places, such as the liver.</p><p>Now, Wang et al. have studied the seipin protein in insect and human cells grown in the laboratory. The experiments confirmed that cells that lack the seipin protein form lots of tiny dot-like structures containing triglycerides that fail to grow into normal-sized lipid droplets. These lipid droplets have different proteins on their surface, which may impair their ability to store fat. Wang et al. also discovered that in normal cells, the seipin protein is found at distinct spots in the endoplasmic reticulum. This distribution appears to allow seipin to come into contact with the small, newly formed lipid droplets and enable them to grow.</p><p>Together these findings suggest that the seipin protein could form part of a molecular machine that allows more triglycerides to be added into newly formed lipid droplets causing the droplets to grow as normal. When seipin is not present the newly formed lipid droplets initially become stuck in a smaller form. As a consequence, a few of these tiny droplets later enter a different cellular pathway of lipid droplet expansion, which turns them into abnormally large lipid droplets.</p><p>Future challenges will be to determine precisely how seipin enables newly formed lipid droplets to grow. It will also be important to confirm whether seipin works with other proteins as part of a molecular machine and, if so, to investigate how these proteins affect the formation and growth of lipid droplets.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16582.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16582.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

Although most eukaryotic cells make LDs, the mechanism underlying the initial formation of LDs is mostly unknown. Excess storage of neutral lipids, such as triacylglycerols (TGs) and sterol esters, in LDs underlies many common metabolic diseases, such as obesity. Additionally, there is considerable interest in increasing cellular TG storage for industrial applications.</p><p>In essence, LD formation corresponds to establishing an oil-in-water emulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Thiam et al., 2013b</xref>). In cells, this appears to be a well-organized process and can be conceptually separated into several distinct biochemical steps that are particularly evident when cells are incubated with exogenous fatty acids to induce them to form TG-containing LDs. In the initial step, enzymes utilize fatty acids and glycerolipids to synthesize neutral lipids, such as TGs, in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). TGs are subsequently packaged into nascent LDs that grow and are thought to bud from the ER to form initial LDs (iLDs). How cells utilize proteins to harness the principles of emulsion physics to control these initial steps in LD formation is unclear.</p><p>Much later, a second LD pathway responds to fatty acid loading of cells. A subset of the mature iLDs is converted to expanding LDs (eLDs) when specific TG synthesis enzymes [e.g., glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT4) and acyl CoA:diacylglycerol <italic>O</italic>-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2)] migrate from the ER to LDs via membrane bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilfling et al., 2013</xref>). Targeting of GPAT4 to LDs and formation of these bridges depends on the Arf1/COP-I proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wilfling et al., 2014b</xref>). Another enzyme, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase 1 (CCT1), binds to phosphatidylcholine (PC)-poor surfaces of eLDs, where it becomes activated and catalyzes the synthesis of PC to coat eLD surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krahmer et al., 2011</xref>). In this manner, eLDs grow dramatically through coordinated synthesis of core and surface lipids.</p><p>The current study focused on the initial steps in LD formation and on the ER-localized protein seipin, which has been implicated in LD formation with an uncertain role (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cartwright and Goodman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fei et al., 2011a</xref>). The seipin gene was initially identified by mutations in rare but severe forms of congenital generalized lipodystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Magré et al., 2001</xref>). Subsequently, LD morphology screens in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> showed that the seipin homologue Fld1 is required for normal LDs; in its absence, cells have many small LDs or a few 'supersized' or giant LDs, depending on growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fei et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Szymanski et al., 2007</xref>).

Alternatively, seipin might affect LDs by regulating lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boutet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fei et al., 2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2011c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Szymanski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wolinski et al., 2015</xref>) or by causing defects in ER calcium homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated seipin function in LD formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian cells. We found that seipin acts at a distinct step of LD biogenesis, after nascent LDs form during iLD formation. Our data suggest that seipin localizes to ER-LD contact sites and enables nascent LDs to acquire more lipids from the ER and grow to form mature iLDs. Without seipin, this process appears to be blocked, resulting in massive accumulation of small nascent LDs. The few LDs that do grow exhibit aberrant targeting of lipid synthesis enzymes, such as GPAT4, involved in forming eLDs. The latter process likely explains the giant LD phenotype characteristically found in seipin-deficient cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Seipin deficiency leads to altered LD morphology without evidence for altered lipid metabolism</title><p>As reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fei et al., 2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Szymanski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tian et al., 2011</xref>), we showed that depletion of seipin from <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells by RNAi (~80% knockdown efficiency, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) led to formation of giant LDs after prolonged oleic acid treatment to induce LD formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,</xref> 24 hr).

LDs are thought to form in several steps. First, TG is synthesized in the ER by lipid synthesis enzymes, such as DGAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yen et al., 2008</xref>). When the TG reaches a critical mass, it is thought to undergo phase separation and bud from the ER as iLDs. We hypothesized that seipin might act at one of these steps to facilitate iLD formation.</p><p>Since LDs were abnormal by 1 hr of formation in seipin knockdown cells, we examined earlier stages. Such studies require a fluorescent probe sensitive enough to detect TG collections during the earliest steps of LD formation. These normally have too little lipid mass to be detected by conventional neutral lipid dyes (e.g., BODIPY) that partition preferentially into the neutral lipid phase. We therefore developed a probe, which we named <italic>LiveDrop</italic>, that contains the membrane hairpin domain (amino acids 160–216) of the glycerolipid synthesis enzyme GPAT4 fused to a fluorescent protein (<italic>mCherry or eGFP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilfling et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

To test whether the conserved regions are important for its function in iLD formation, we overexpressed fluorescently tagged regions of seipin in a setting of seipin depletion in the S2 cell model. We knocked down seipin with dsRNA targeting the 3′UTR to avoid degradation of expressed seipin proteins. These knockdowns were somewhat less efficient than targeting the open reading frame, with ~65% of cells exhibiting accumulation of BODIPY-negative <italic>LiveDrop</italic> puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). When full-length <italic>Drosophila</italic> seipin was expressed in the knockdown cells, the numbers of <italic>LiveDrop</italic> puncta were dramatically reduced in most cells. Tagging with a fluorescent protein localized to the N- or C-terminus resulted in similar rescue efficiency 30 min after oleate loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Deletion of the N- or C-terminal cytosolic domain or both did not affect the rescue efficiency of seipin overexpression. In contrast, expression of the N- or C-terminus alone did not rescue the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). These results suggest that the evolutionarily conserved regions of seipin (i.e., the ER luminal domain and transmembrane domains) are required for seipin’s function in organizing iLD formation. In agreement with evolutionary conservation of seipin’s function, expression of human seipin in seipin-depleted <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells completely abolished abnormal <italic>LiveDrop</italic> puncta accumulation, and mature iLDs formed normally in all transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16582.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The conserved transmembrane domains and ER luminal loop of seipin are important for its function in initial LD formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Prevention of the seipin-depletion phenotype by expression of the transmembrane domains and ER loop, but not by the N- or C-terminus of <italic>Drosophila</italic> seipin.

Accumulation of nascent iLD intermediates in the early stages might indirectly result in fewer but larger LDs. We hypothesized that the LD expansion pathway, catalyzed by TG synthesis on eLDs, is aberrantly activated during seipin deficiency. In the LD expansion pathway, GPAT4 targets to selected LDs to initiate localized TG synthesis to expand LDs, and GPAT4 is thus a marker for eLDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilfling et al., 2013</xref>).

In control cells, GPAT4 localizes to LDs much later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) (not until 1 hr after induction of LDs, not shown). At 20 min after adding oleic acid, 18% of LDs in seipin knockdown cells were marked by GPAT4, but only 1–2% in control cells were GPAT4-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C</xref>).

If phospholipids, specifically PC, are deficient on eLDs in seipin-deficient cells, CCT1 should have increased targeting to LDs during formation. Indeed, seipin-depleted cells exhibited earlier and markedly increased CCT1 targeting to LDs, compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Further, when seipin-deficient cells were treated with PC liposomes or choline supplementation, no giant LDs (diameter &gt; 2.5 μm) in seipin deficiency were formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, yellow box). In contrast, PC liposomes corrected the phenotype of CCT1 deficiency, and as expected, choline supplementation did not. We also altered phospholipid synthesis by knock down of CCT1 or CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (ECT) and tested the effect on seipin knockdown. ECT knockdown is predicted to shift the balance of phospholipid synthesis to PC from PE. As expected, CCT1 depletion aggravated, and ECT depletion abolished, the seipin knockdown phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). These data suggest that faster LD expansion in seipin-depleted cells leads to more eLDs with transient PC deficiency, and this likely leads to LD coalescence to form giant LDs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the current study, we identify a discreet step in LD formation—the conversion of small, nascent LDs (&lt;200 nm diameter) to larger, mature initial LDs (typically 300–500 nm diameter)—and show that seipin acts at this step of LD biogenesis. Oligomers of seipin form highly mobile foci in the ER that interact with small, nascent LDs at ER-LD contact sites and enable their growth to mature iLDs, likely by promoting neutral lipid transport. Without seipin, the precursors of this step, small nascent LDs, accumulate to large numbers adjacent to the ER but fail to grow. With ongoing TG synthesis, some of these intermediates, or possibly other LDs arising from random coalescence of ER TG collections, appear to prematurely engage the eLD pathway, and undergo expansion mediated by LD-localized lipid synthesis enzymes (e.g., GPAT4 and CCT1). As a late phenotype of seipin deficiency, giant LDs (&gt;1–2 µm diameter) form eventually from these fewer abnormal eLDs, probably by coalescence due to a relative lack of PC on their surfaces. This model explains both aspects of the seipin-deficient phenotype—many small LDs and occasional giant LDs—that we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fei et al., 2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Szymanski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tian et al., 2011</xref>) have observed.</p><p>Our data uncover a specific step in LD formation that was previously unrecognized, namely the growth and maturation of nascent LDs to mature iLDs. In wildtype cells, LD formation intermediates at this step are difficult to observe, likely due to their rapid transition through the process. However, with seipin depletion, progression through this step is blocked, resulting in the apparent accumulation of large numbers of intermediates (small, nascent LDs), found in our studies by electron tomography, that fail to mature. These findings indicate that seipin functions downstream of initial lens formation and TG budding, at a more distal step in the maturation of nascent LDs.</p><p>How does seipin function in nascent LD maturation? Our studies of the tagged endogenous protein show that seipin localizes to multimeric foci that are highly mobile within the ER, as if scanning the ER for nascent LDs. We also found that some seipin foci encountered and associated with LiveDrop puncta (nascent LDs), became relatively less mobile, and at this point iLD growth ensued. These observations are consistent with the model of seipin engaging nascent LDs and facilitating their growth, likely via transfer of additional neutral lipids, to mature iLDs.</p><p>How seipin molecularly interacts with nascent LDs to facilitate LD growth is unknown. Our data are consistent with findings in yeast that implicated a role for seipin oligomers in early stages of LD formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Binns et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cartwright et al., 2015</xref>). These studies indicated that purified seipin forms oligomers in a toroid-structure comprising approximately 8–12 seipin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Binns et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cartwright and Goodman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sim et al., 2012</xref>). However, from live-cell imaging, we estimate that the seipin foci include considerably more molecular units in cells (not shown). Possibly seipin oligomers anchored in the ER mediate specific contacts with the surface monolayer of nascent LDs and enable the transfer of lipids (such as TG) to the nascent LDs, allowing them to grow (see model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Precisely how seipin mediates this transfer is currently unknown.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16582.030</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for the role of seipin in LD formation.</title><p>Seipin oligomers localize at the contact sites between nascent iLDs and the ER, enabling transfer of lipids (such as TG) to the nascent LDs to convert nascent iLD of &lt;200 nm diameter to mature iLD of 300–500 nm diameter.

At later time points in LD biogenesis, we observed that each LD was associated with at least one seipin punctum. Our findings are consistent with several studies in yeast indicating that seipin localizes to ER-LD contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cartwright et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grippa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). We also found that small nascent LDs almost always associate with the ER, even when seipin was absent, suggesting these LDs are still connected to the ER via contact sites. Consistent with the notion of ER-LD contact sites, the electron-tomograms revealed an absence of ribosomes between the nascent iLDs and the ER membrane. The close connections of the organelles and possible contact sites suggest that other proteins might be involved in establishing ER-LD contact sites and are still present in seipin deficiency.</p><p>Our findings suggest that seipin’s function in converting nascent LDs to mature iLDs is likely its ancient, primary function. In support of this, seipin deficiency resulted in similar phenotypes of larger numbers of LiveDrop-positive foci in cells from flies, human mammary carcinoma cells, and human fibroblasts from seipin-deficient subjects. Additionally, the evolutionarily conserved transmembrane domains and luminal ER loop were sufficient for seipin’s function in LD formation. The role of the variable N-terminal domain is less clear. We found that the overexpressed N-terminus of <italic>Drosophila</italic> seipin localized to LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that this part of the protein, though not required for formation, may aid in interaction with LDs. In yeast, the N-terminus was found to be functionally important with respect to the timing of LD formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cartwright et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although our findings indicate that seipin functions in an early step in LD formation, they also potentially explain the phenotype of giant LDs found in nearly all cells with seipin deficiency. In the absence of seipin, we found that large numbers of nascent iLDs accumulate, and some of these LDs aberrantly entered the LD expansion pathway. In support of this, lipid synthesis enzymes, such as GPAT4 and CCT1, that are normally found only on late-forming eLDs were aberrantly targeted to iLDs at early time points, and this mislocalization of eLD proteins to iLDs was crucial for the development of the giant LD phenotype at later time points. Similar abnormal protein targeting to LDs was recently found in yeast lacking seipin orthologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grippa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Several other models have proposed a primary role for seipin in maintaining ER homeostasis, with associated indirect effects on LD formation. Our data do not support these models. For example, seipin was hypothesized to primarily regulate lipid metabolism in the ER, including phospholipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fei et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2011c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tian et al., 2011</xref>), and this in turn affects LD formation. We found no evidence to support this model, either in studies of glycerolipid synthesis rates or in the activities of specific enzymes (such as GPAT; not shown). We also found no evidence of accumulation of PA in membranes of seipin-deficient S2 cells, a finding that has been reported by several groups for seipin deficiency in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fei et al., 2011c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wolinski et al., 2015</xref>). We also found no evidence of seipin primarily affecting ER morphology or ER stress activation, which would normally be associated with defects in calcium homeostasis, as has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bi et al., 2014</xref>). Since seipin appears to act downstream of the budding of nascent LDs, it might be expected that ER functions are largely conserved and unaffected by seipin deficiency.</p><p>In summary, we provide evidence that seipin functions at a previously unrecognized discrete step in LD biogenesis, enabling nascent LDs to grow to mature iLDs. Cells lacking seipin can still form LDs, but these LDs have irregular size and abnormal lipid and protein composition, which likely leads to cellular dysfunction with respect to storing and reclaiming lipids for cellular needs. In support of this notion, seipin deficiency in humans leads to severe generalized lipodystrophy, with a near absence of adipose mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Magré et al., 2001</xref>). Seipin therefore is a crucial part of the cellular protein machinery that serves to organize oil emulsification for fat storage. Our findings also suggest that seipin likely works in concert with other proteins that mediate ER-LD contact to enable the growth of nascent LDs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, RNAi, and transfection</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells were kindly provided from the laboratory of Ron Vale (UCSF), SUM159 cells (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_5423">CVCL_5423</ext-link>) were from the laboratory of Tomas Kirchausen (Harvard Medical School), and human fibroblasts were from the laboratories of David Savage (Univ.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and four reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Rudolph Zechner and Joel Goodman.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We hope you will be able to submit the revised version within two months, so please let us know if you have any questions first. Given the scope of the criticisms, it may be best if you were able to respond with an action plan and time table for submission of a revised manuscript.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The laboratory of Robert Farese and Tobi Walther have been interested in the biogenesis of lipid droplets in insect cells and mammalian cells. They have been leaders in understanding the roles of triglyceride biosynthetic enzymes. In the current manuscript, they have worked to define the cell biology of seipin, an enigmatic protein that is mutated in a subset of patients with generalized lipodystrophy. In this paper, they provide evidence that seipin is involved in the maturation of small nascent lipid droplets to mature lipid droplets. This concept had already been proposed in yeast, but the manuscript by Farese and Walther elucidates the concept more clearly. They report that seipin forms discrete and dynamic foci in the ER that this molecule interacts with nascent LDs, and that this interaction is important for the growth and maturation of lipid droplets. In the absence of seipin, they propose that immature lipid droplets accumulate, and that the occasional lipid droplet that happens to grow is abnormal, in that it prematurely acquires lipid biosynthetic enzymes.</p><p>This manuscript was reviewed by four reviewers. All recognized that the topic was important; all were positive to varying degrees about the manuscript and thought that it advanced our understanding of seipin cell biology. However, two of the reviewers had reservations. One of the reviewers was disappointed by the electron microscopy studies. In considering the original manuscript, it was the hope of the reviewers that the authors would characterize LiveDrops at the EM level. Such an undertaking would presumably require APEX electron microscopy. In the revised manuscript, the authors noted the size of lipid droplets in seipin-deficient cells, but the relationship of those lipid droplets to LiveDrops or to seipin is not clear. The authors noted that there appeared to be an accumulation of 200-nm lipid droplets in the seipin-deficient cells, but the data were not convincing because it was not clear how many experiments were performed with how many cell lines-and under what conditions. Also, it was not clear whether a similar accumulation of 200-nm particles occurs in tissues of seipin-deficient mice. Also, one reviewer was not convinced by the &quot;filaments&quot; in the EM tomography studies. Were those filaments only present in the interface between the lipid droplet and the ER, or did they surround the lipid droplet? Finally, several reviewers were disappointed by quantification of findings in several of the figures.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should use electron microscopy to characterize LiveDrops, and not simply characterize the size of lipid droplets in seipin-deficient cells. Alternatively, the authors should make a far more convincing case for the accumulation of 200-nm particles in seipin-deficient cell lines. The latter approach would need to include data on whether an accumulation of 200-nm particles occurs in specific tissues of seipin-deficient mice, for example in skeletal muscle or heart.</p><p>2) The authors should include further EM tomography studies and address whether the putative &quot;filamentous structures&quot; are truly unique to the interface between the ER and the lipid droplet.</p><p>3) Explain why the GPAT4-based LiveDrop construct preferentially binds to nascent lipid droplets but that GPAT4 apparently has a preference for large lipid droplets.</p><p>4) As the authors acknowledge, several independent research groups have demonstrated PA accumulation in yeast seipin (Fld1) mutants, which was not seen in the cells studied here. However, the authors do not present a strong explanation. Is this attributable to a species difference between yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, or is there another difference in the measurements performed in the current study? It would be enlightening for the authors to compare seipin-deficient yeast cells to settle this once and for all.</p><p>5) The model proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> is not satisfying, as it does not convey new information that was uncovered in this study, and includes a component (&quot;unknown protein&quot;) that is not discussed. The figure should better represent findings presented here, such as seipin mobility and accumulation of glycerolipid biosynthetic proteins on some seipin-deficient LDs.</p><p>6) Some statements are not backed by rigorous data. For example, statistical analyses should be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8C, 8D</xref>.</p><p>7) The authors use multiple cell types, but it is not clear by reading some Figure legends which cell types are used. It would be helpful to add more transparency by referring to either &quot;S2 cells&quot; or mammalian cells at the beginning of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>.</p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work, &quot;Seipin organizes neutral lipids in the ER for initial lipid droplet formation&quot;, for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your initial submission has been assessed by Vivek Malhotra in consultation with a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors (BRE). The BRE member sent your manuscript to three internationally recognized experts in lipid metabolism for detailed review. The three external reviewers then discussed their reviews and their recommendations with Dr. Vivek and the BRE member.</p><p>Although the work deals with an extremely important topic in the cell biology of lipid droplet biogenesis, we regret to inform you that we will not be able to publish your work in <italic>eLife</italic>. All three reviewers agreed that the findings were too preliminary. Each of the reviewers had substantive concerns, and it seemed unlikely that these concerns could be resolved in a reasonable period of time. All three external reviewers were duly impressed by the morphological findings detected with the LiveDrop probe, but there was a consensus that the nature of the &quot;LiveDrop&quot; needs to be characterized at the ultrastructural level. The reviewers also thought that it would be important to demonstrate that the LiveDrop probe detects equivalent structures in wild-type cells and seipin-deficient cells. One of the reviewers was not fond of the &quot;LiveDrop&quot; nomenclature, particularly since the primordial lipid droplets have not been fully characterized at an ultrastructural level. Another concern is that the manuscript, while strong on immunofluorescence microscopy, did not reveal mechanisms of seipin activity. Finally, one of the reviewers was not satisfied with the biochemistry and thought that the conclusion that there was no direct effect of seipin on phospholipid synthesis might be premature, stating &quot;the data shows that PC levels in LDs and the incorporation of FA into LD-associated PC are decreased in seipin deficient cells, despite abundant presence of CCT on LDs. This argues for a specific defect in LD-PC synthesis due to enzyme inhibition (e.g. CPT) or choline deficiency. A more elaborate lipid analysis of LD-associated lipids and ER lipids and better characterization of the involved biochemical pathways are needed to conclude that seipin does not interfere with phospholipid metabolism. Specifically, the role of seipin in PA metabolism has not been sufficiently addressed to conclude that it plays no role in PA metabolism (as claimed by Fei et al., Tian et al. or Wolinsky et al.). Cellular concentrations of PA in cell homogenates, microsomal fractions, or LDs are extremely low. Regular lipidomic approaches may not be adequate to detect differences (e.g. Figure 7—figure supplement 1D). The authors should consider using PA specific probes such as the GFP-Spo20 reporter protein.&quot; The reviewers’ comments are pasted at the bottom of the letter.</p><p>Please note that we aim to publish articles with a single round of revision that would typically be accomplished within two months. While your observations have great potential, it seems unlikely that the necessary revisions could be completed within a few months.</p><p>We do not intend any criticism of the quality of your data. We wish you the very best of luck with your work, and we sincerely hope that you will consider <italic>eLife</italic> for future submissions.</p><p>Reviewers comments (verbatim)</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic> </p><p>Wang et al. present an interesting study to show that seipin acts early during lipid droplet (LD) formation as a &quot;triglyceride trapping&quot; agent. The authors further demonstrate that this process is important for the appropriate assembly of lipid synthesis enzymes and controlled maturation of LDs. Although the actual biochemical function of seipin remains to stay undefined, the study adds important new information to our understanding of LD formation. The experimental approach appears very robust and adequate to address challenging biology.</p><p>Only a few open points need to be addressed:</p><p>1) Wouldn't it be more appropriate to name &quot;initial LDs&quot; &quot;nascent LDs&quot;?</p><p>2) The interpretation that seipin may not interfere with phospholipid synthesis appears premature. In fact, the current study shows that PC synthesis is decreased despite abundant presence of CCT on LDs. Doesn't this argue for a potential interference of seipin deficiency with the subsequent CPT reaction? Or does seipin deficiency lead to an undersupply of choline?</p><p>3) Due to the extremely low concentrations of PA in cell homogenates and microsomal fractions, regular lipidomic approaches may not be sufficient to detect differences (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The authors should consider using PA specific probes such as GFP-Spo20 reporter protein.</p><p>4) How do the authors explain the conflicting data on the UPR in response to seipin deficiency compares to observations in previous studies?</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>Wang and colleagues use <italic>Drosophila</italic> cultured cells to study the function of Seipin, a conserved protein required for normal lipid droplets and that has disease relevance. Despite the vast literature on seipin its molecular function is not known yet. Here the authors find that depletion of seipin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> induces LD morphology defects. It is shown that abnormal droplets in seipin-deficient cells are sensitive to changes in phospholipid synthesis without affecting lipid levels, largely confirming previous work. Then, the authors use &quot;LiveDrop&quot;, presumably a very sensitive marker for LDs to interrogate early stages of LD formation. In wt cells, LiveDrop preceded BODIPY staining in nascent LDs. In contrast, dynamic LiveDrop puncta that remain BODIPY-negative were detected in seipin-depleted cells. The appearance of these puncta was diminished upon interference with TAG synthesis. These results led to the proposal that seipin organizes initial TAG lenses into nascent LDs. These are potentially the most exciting findings but in my opinion, they are strongly over interpreted and undocumented. It is speculated that LiveDrop puncta mark initial TAG lenses but it not at all clear what they are. A thorough characterization of the LiveDrop puncta is essential to support this model- this would require both biochemical and ultrastructural analysis. If small puncta in seipin deficient cells are incipient lenses too small to be detected by BODIPY, it is expected that bigger puncta should become BODIPY-positive. However this is not the case for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> – at 22min LiveDrop puncta has a diameter of almost 0.5 μm (comparable to control) but it is still BODIPY-negative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>Wang et al. report studies, mainly in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells on the function of seipin. The authors first show the generation of &quot;supersized&quot; droplets in seipin knock-down cells upon adding oleate to the medium. This is not due to any significant change in total lipid composition or amounts. Next, they generate a probe (LiveDrop) and show that it can detect very early neutral lipid (NL) aggregates. In wild type cells these are converted to droplets (BODIPY stained), but in the seipin KD the aggregates convert much less often. They show that the aggregates are highly mobile in the KD. Using CRISPR, they next show that seipin is itself mobile until it binds to an aggregate; its movement slows after that. The authors next show that GPAT4 targets to droplets much more rapidly in the KD, which can account for the supersized phenotype. They show that these supersized droplets have less phospholipid, as expected from geometry. They then do a seipin deletion analysis on CRISPR KO cells and show that the loop and TM regions of seipin are sufficient for function. Last, they show similar results in mammalian cells, including BSCL2- cells from a patient.</p><p>The overall finding is that seipin catalyzes the conversion of tiny nascent neutral lipid aggregates in the ER into nascent droplets. Our group in yeast has shown a role of seipin in droplet initiation and morphology. This work here confirms and vastly extends these results, using animal cells. They key new findings are: (1) development of a novel probe (LiveDrop) that detects tiny neutral lipid aggregates before they are visible with BODIPY as bona fide droplets; (2) a convincing demonstration that seipin blocks conversion of these aggregates to droplets. Thus, the authors have narrowed down the step in which seipin works; (3) ruling out effects on phospholipid metabolism as being important (contrary to what many in the field thought; (4) evidence that &quot;supersized&quot; droplets often seen in seipin knockout strains is due to strong targeting of GPAT 4 to droplets as well as a transient lack of phospholipids; and (5) the role of seipin in converting the lipid aggregates to droplets is shared in mammalian cells. Most of the work is based on fluorescence microscopy, which is of high quality and appropriately quantified.</p><p>So, while this work does not propose a novel mechanism for seipin function, it strongly reinforces the idea that seipin works on an early phase of droplet formation as a conserved mechanism, provides strong evidence for the lens model of droplet formation (previously only a theory), and identifies a discrete step for seipin action: conversion of the lens (seen with the use of LiveDrop) to a bona fide droplet. The work is of cutting edge quality, and there is enough here to be of interest to the general readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16582.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The laboratory of Robert Farese and Tobi Walther have been interested in the biogenesis of lipid droplets in insect cells and mammalian cells. They have been leaders in understanding the roles of triglyceride biosynthetic enzymes. In the current manuscript, they have worked to define the cell biology of seipin, an enigmatic protein that is mutated in a subset of patients with generalized lipodystrophy. In this paper, they provide evidence that seipin is involved in the maturation of small nascent lipid droplets to mature lipid droplets. This concept had already been proposed in yeast, but the manuscript by Farese and Walther elucidates the concept more clearly. They report that seipin forms discrete and dynamic foci in the ER that this molecule interacts with nascent LDs, and that this interaction is important for the growth and maturation of lipid droplets. In the absence of seipin, they propose that immature lipid droplets accumulate, and that the occasional lipid droplet that happens to grow is abnormal, in that it prematurely acquires lipid biosynthetic enzymes.</italic></p><p>We thank the editor and reviewers for their time and the critical and helpful evaluation of our manuscript. This is an excellent summary of the paper. However, we think that it is inaccurate to say that the concept of seipin helping nascent LDs in conversion to mature LDs has been proposed in yeast. The published yeast studies established that LD formation is delayed in seipin deficiency and that LD formation is affected, but did not provide data showing that seipin facilitates a specific step in LD formation. We believe our findings go considerably beyond the published yeast studies in this respect and provide new insights into the function of seipin in LD formation. Also, yeast and mammalian LDs and TG synthesis are considerably different. A key enzyme for LD formation in mammals, DGAT1, is absent in yeast and it is very much unclear to date whether the processes and seipin function are identical between systems. Thus, we feel it is justified and important to independently investigate seipin function in different model systems, in addition to yeast.</p><p><italic>This manuscript was reviewed by four reviewers. All recognized that the topic was important; all were positive to varying degrees about the manuscript and thought that it advanced our understanding of seipin cell biology. However, two of the reviewers had reservations. One of the reviewers was disappointed by the electron microscopy studies. In considering the original manuscript, it was the hope of the reviewers that the authors would characterize LiveDrops at the EM level. Such an undertaking would presumably require APEX electron microscopy. In the revised manuscript, the authors noted the size of lipid droplets in seipin-deficient cells, but the relationship of those lipid droplets to LiveDrops or to seipin is not clear. The authors noted that there appeared to be an accumulation of 200-nm lipid droplets in the seipin-deficient cells, but the data were not convincing because it was not clear how many experiments were performed with how many cell lines-and under what conditions. Also, it was not clear whether a similar accumulation of 200-nm particles occurs in tissues of seipin-deficient mice. Also, one reviewer was not convinced by the &quot;filaments&quot; in the EM tomography studies. Were those filaments only present in the interface between the lipid droplet and the ER, or did they surround the lipid droplet? Finally, several reviewers were disappointed by quantification of findings in several of the figures.</italic></p><p>We address each of these points in the comments to specific points below.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors should use electron microscopy to characterize LiveDrops, and not simply characterize the size of lipid droplets in seipin-deficient cells. Alternatively, the authors should make a far more convincing case for the accumulation of 200-nm particles in seipin-deficient cell lines. The latter approach would need to include data on whether an accumulation of 200-nm particles occurs in specific tissues of seipin-deficient mice, for example in skeletal muscle or heart.</italic></p><p>We understand the sentiment behind the comments, but we respectfully disagree about the utility of the suggested experiments. We understand that the question behind this point is whether LiveDrop is bona fide marker for Lipid Droplets. This is clearly the case because:</p><p>1) LiveDrop represents the membrane anchoring sequence of an enzyme (GPAT4) targeted to the LD surface (Wilfling et al., Dev.Cell 2013);</p><p>2) In a time course, all LiveDrop puncta acquire hallmarks of LDs, i.e. BODIPY staining, in wild-type cells;</p><p>3) LiveDrop localization to puncta is dependent on TG synthesis;</p><p>4) LiveDrop partitions to monolayer over bilayer surfaces in vitro;</p><p>5) Accumulation of LiveDrop puncta in seipin-deficient cells corresponds with the accumulation of small, nascent LDs in electron microscopy.</p><p>We could take some months to show by EM that LiveDrop localizes in part to nascent LDs, but this would not, in our minds, add to the paper. As LiveDrop co-localizes to both the ER and nascent LDs, we do not think such experiments would adequately answer the question (e.g., we would need to show accumulation of LiveDrop in LDs over ER, which is very hard to do at a quantitative level by EM).</p><p>Instead, our study shows that lipid accumulation of TG, as detected by the LiveDrop probe, are found with seipin deficiency in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, human mammary carcinoma cells, and patient cells with seipin deficiency. We elected to perform thin-section EM and electron tomography on the seipin knockout mammary carcinoma cells. We found that the TG accumulations correspond to highly abundant, nascent (&lt;200 nm diameter) LDs. We counted these in sections from at least five cells and found a mean diameter of 160 nm with very small standard deviation (~20 nm). Thus, we believe that the massive accumulation of small LDs observed by EM (we will add a gallery of cells to show the dramatic effect in overview) is the only plausible explanation for the similar, massive accumulation of LiveDrop foci observed by light microscopy.</p><p>What we can offer to do in response is to show that isolation of these nascent LDs from seipin knockout cells reveals that LiveDrop protein is localized to fractions with the nascent LDs. This will take us a week or two to complete.</p><p>We can also further quantify the numbers of nascent LDs in seipin deficient cells. We already performed EM on these cells and counted many LDs. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Although we could count more LDs, we are doubtful that more counting will alter our conclusions. Nevertheless, we can do this.</p><p>We also disagree with the utility of examining LDs in tissues of seipin-deficient mice. LD phenotypes due to <italic>seipin</italic> deficiency has been reported in a large number of model systems and studies. However, because in these systems there is no synchronized LD formation, the early and likely most direct role of seipin has been a mystery. To overcome this, we are studying the earliest stages of LD formation in cell models because cells are the best living model system to examine this problem in time course experiments. Even in this system, the late effects (i.e., &gt; 4-6 hours) are, as mentioned, the formation of large LDs due to expansion and localized TG synthesis enzymes. Any studies of tissues of the knockout mice would be hugely complicated by the late phenotype of giant LD formation. We cannot see a useful experiment to look at the earliest stages of LD formation in the knockout mouse tissues. Not to mention, such a study would require a huge experimental effort (likely in the order of a year of work) as <italic>seipin</italic> deficient mice are currently not available to us.</p><p><italic>2) The authors should include further EM tomography studies and address whether the putative &quot;filamentous structures&quot; are truly unique to the interface between the ER and the lipid droplet.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion, but we respectfully disagree. The current electron tomography studies are suggestive of a filamentous structure. We can add another example of such a LD-ER area. Further electron tomography will not clarify this, however (we can add more examples but this is limited due to the time consuming data acquisition). It will instead be necessary to identify the protein, test for its requirement, etc., which is clearly a separate project beyond the scope of the current publication.</p><p>However, since the interpretation of the current data is speculative with respect to filamentous structure, we prefer instead to remove this speculative interpretation and simply mention in the Results that the electron tomography revealed areas of density between the organelles, suggestive of a contact zone.</p><p><italic>3) Explain why the GPAT4-based LiveDrop construct preferentially binds to nascent lipid droplets but that GPAT4 apparently has a preference for large lipid droplets.</italic></p><p>This is an excellent question and one that we are currently investigating. Our preliminary data indicate that indeed LiveDrop localizes to all LDs at the time of formation whereas full-length GPAT4 localizes only to the eLD population. In contrast, in wildtype cells full length GPAT4 is excluded from nascent LDs and requires the Arf1/COPI machinery for targeting to eLDs at a later time point (Wilfling et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2014). This suggests the hypothesis that full length GPAT4 must be retained in the ER during LD formation due to properties of the rest of the protein (i.e., not the membrane hairpin domain). We are testing this hypothesis. For clarity, we will explain more explicitly the different behavior of the full-length vs. hairpin in the revised version.</p><p><italic>4) As the authors acknowledge, several independent research groups have demonstrated PA accumulation in yeast seipin (Fld1) mutants, which was not seen in the cells studied here. However, the authors do not present a strong explanation. Is this attributable to a species difference between yeast and Drosophila cells, or is there another difference in the measurements performed in the current study? It would be enlightening for the authors to compare seipin-deficient yeast cells to settle this once and for all.</italic> </p><p>We acknowledge that there are apparent differences between what is found in yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells regarding PA and seipin knockout. This likely results from species differences in lipid metabolism. Our data, however, show that the seipin knockout phenotype with respect to LD formation occurs without changes in PA in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian cell models, effectively excluding this as the cause for the formation abnormality we found in our system. We think that PA could accumulate as a consequence of seipin deficiency in yeast. We respectfully disagree on the utility of our measuring PA levels in yeast—whether we find elevations or not will not settle the issue.</p><p><italic>5) The model proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> is not satisfying, as it does not convey new information that was uncovered in this study, and includes a component (&quot;unknown protein&quot;) that is not discussed. The figure should better represent findings presented here, such as seipin mobility and accumulation of glycerolipid biosynthetic proteins on some seipin-deficient LDs.</italic></p><p>We will remove the model from the figure set.</p><p><italic>6) Some statements are not backed by rigorous data.

It would be helpful to add more transparency by referring to either &quot;S2 cells&quot; or mammalian cells at the beginning of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>.</italic></p><p>This will be clarified in the revised version.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the previous round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Although the work deals with an extremely important topic in the cell biology of lipid droplet biogenesis, we regret to inform you that we will not be able to publish your work in eLife. All three reviewers agreed that the findings were too preliminary. Each of the reviewers had substantive concerns, and it seemed unlikely that these concerns could be resolved in a reasonable period of time. All three external reviewers were duly impressed by the morphological findings detected with the LiveDrop probe, but there was a consensus that the nature of the &quot;LiveDrop&quot; needs to be characterized at the ultrastructural level. The reviewers also thought that it would be important to demonstrate that the LiveDrop probe detects equivalent structures in wild-type cells and seipin-deficient cells. One of the reviewers was not fond of the &quot;LiveDrop&quot; nomenclature, particularly since the primordial lipid droplets have not been fully characterized at an ultrastructural level. Another concern is that the manuscript, while strong on immunofluorescence microscopy, did not reveal mechanisms of seipin activity. Finally, one of the reviewers was not satisfied with the biochemistry and thought that the conclusion that there was no direct effect of seipin on phospholipid synthesis might be premature, stating &quot;the data shows that PC levels in LDs and the incorporation of FA into LD-associated PC are decreased in seipin deficient cells, despite abundant presence of CCT on LDs. This argues for a specific defect in LD-PC synthesis due to enzyme inhibition (e.g. CPT) or choline deficiency. A more elaborate lipid analysis of LD-associated lipids and ER lipids and better characterization of the involved biochemical pathways are needed to conclude that seipin does not interfere with phospholipid metabolism. Specifically, the role of seipin in PA metabolism has not been sufficiently addressed to conclude that it plays no role in PA metabolism (as claimed by Fei et al., Tian et al. or Wolinsky et al.). Cellular concentrations of PA in cell homogenates, microsomal fractions, or LDs are extremely low. Regular lipidomic approaches may not be adequate to detect differences (e.g. Figure 7—figure supplement 1D). The authors should consider using PA specific probes such as the GFP-Spo20 reporter protein.&quot; The reviewers’ comments are pasted at the bottom of the letter.</italic></p><p><italic>Please note that we aim to publish articles with a single round of revision that would typically be accomplished within two months.

Despite the vast literature on seipin its molecular function is not known yet. Here the authors find that depletion of seipin in Drosophila induces LD morphology defects. It is shown that abnormal droplets in seipin-deficient cells are sensitive to changes in phospholipid synthesis without affecting lipid levels, largely confirming previous work. Then, the authors use &quot;LiveDrop&quot;, presumably a very sensitive marker for LDs to interrogate early stages of LD formation. In wt cells, LiveDrop preceded BODIPY staining in nascent LDs. In contrast, dynamic LiveDrop puncta that remain BODIPY-negative were detected in seipin-depleted cells. The appearance of these puncta was diminished upon interference with TAG synthesis. These results led to the proposal that seipin organizes initial TAG lenses into nascent LDs. These are potentially the most exciting findings but in my opinion, they are strongly over interpreted and undocumented. It is speculated that LiveDrop puncta mark initial TAG lenses but it not at all clear what they are. A thorough characterization of the LiveDrop puncta is essential to support this model- this would require both biochemical and ultrastructural analysis. If small puncta in seipin deficient cells are incipient lenses too small to be detected by BODIPY, it is expected that bigger puncta should become BODIPY-positive. However this is not the case for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> – at 22min Livedrop puncta has a diameter of almost 0.5 μm (comparable to control) but it is still BODIPY-negative. Besides this major concern on the characterization of the &quot;LiveDrop puncta&quot; there are a number of other minor issues that it would be important to address to make this work suitable for publication.</italic></p><p>Based on the reviewer’s excellent comments, we have performed additional experiments, as well as more rigorous characterization of some reagents we use. These experiments lead us to a breakthrough in our thinking concerning seipin function. In particular added electron tomography of seipin knockout cells revealed that the accumulating intermediates are nascent LDs that remain in contact, but are separate, from the ER. With these data, we now hypothesize that seipin functions at ER-LD contact sites to enable lipid transfer to the nascent LDs, enabling their growth to mature initial LDs. This is a major advance in understanding seipin and LD formation and is reflected in many changes in the new manuscript, including the new title. In addition, we have added significant amounts of data for the characterization of LiveDrop, the probe we use to visualize nascent LDs, and we have added additional data regarding our lipid measurements. For the issue of phospholipids changes in seipin-depleted cells, we reviewed our lipidomic data and concluded that our assays are linear for detection of PA in the experiments. In addition, we performed the experiment of expressing a “PA probe” in wild-type and seipin KO SUM cells, and we did not see accumulations of this probe near the nascent LDs (as others have seen in yeast with Fld1 deletion). We agree with the reviewer that at late time points, there are LD-specific changes in phospholipids, including our finding of a relative deficiency of phospholipids to TG. However, our collective data in S2 cells and SUM cells do not indicate a direct role for seipin in phospholipid synthesis during the earliest stages of LD formation, and we continue to believe that any changes likely reflect later indirect effects of seipin deficiency. We believe that our article now is the first to clearly show that the formation and growth of initial LDs in the ER is a protein-facilitated process, and to identify seipin as an essential player in mediating a step in this process, namely the conversion of nascent iLDs to mature iLDs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
