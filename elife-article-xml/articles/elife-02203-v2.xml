Fluorescence pulse-chase analysis of an internally tagged Cse4 reveals that it is replaced with newly synthesized molecules in S phase, remaining stably associated with centromeres thereafter. In contrast, C-terminally-tagged Cse4 is functionally impaired, showing slow cell growth, cell lethality at elevated temperatures, and extra-centromeric nuclear accumulation. Recent studies using such strains gave conflicting findings regarding the centromeric abundance and cell cycle dynamics of Cse4. Our findings indicate that internally tagged Cse4 is a better reporter of the biology of this histone variant. Furthermore, the size of centromeric Cse4 clusters was precisely mapped with a new 3D-PALM method, revealing substantial compaction during anaphase. Cse4-specific chaperone Scm3 displays steady-state, stoichiometric co-localization with Cse4 at centromeres throughout the cell cycle, while undergoing exchange with a nuclear pool. These findings suggest that a stable Cse4 nucleosome is maintained by dynamic chaperone-in-residence Scm3.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02203.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02203.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02203.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When cells multiply, it is essential for each new cell to get a copy of the organism's genetic blueprint. If an error occurs during cell division, and one of the daughter cells ends up with too many or too few copies of a chromosome, the cell can die or malfunction. Errors during cell division can, for example, cause cancer.</p><p>Before a cell divides, it must create an exact copy of each of its chromosomes. The two copies of the chromosome are linked together at a region called the centromere. To separate them, structures called microtubules attach to each side of the centromere via a structure called the kinetochore. The kinetochore then sends out signals orchestrating how the microtubules should move in order to pull the chromosomes apart.</p><p>In yeast, it is known that a protein called Cse4 must be present at the centromere for cell division to be successful. However, researchers have come to conflicting conclusions about how many copies of this protein are needed and how they function as the chromosome copies are separated.</p><p>Wisniewski et al. now reveal that a 'tag' scientists use to make Cse4 more visible under a microscope may have skewed the results of some studies. Attaching a tag to the end of the protein interferes with its function, slowing down cell growth, and even killing cells at high temperatures. This could explain the disagreements about how Cse4 works.</p><p>Placing a tag inside Cse4, on the other hand, allows the protein to behave normally. Using such an internal tag, Wisniewski et al. found that, as the cell copies its chromosomes, old Cse4 is removed and replaced by new molecules. Those proteins then remain attached to the centromere throughout cell division. A second protein called Scm3 helps to hold the Cse4 in place.</p><p>By clarifying the number and behavior of various crucial components of the kinetochore, this work opens avenues to better understand the process of chromosome separation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02203.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02203.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>centromeric nucleosome</kwd><kwd>Cse4 histone variant</kwd><kwd>Scm3 chaperone</kwd><kwd>multifocus microscopy</kwd><kwd>fluorescence pulse-chase</kwd><kwd>3D-PALM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wisniewski</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name><name><surname>Hajj</surname><given-names>Bassam</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jiji</given-names></name><name><surname>Mizuguchi</surname><given-names>Gaku</given-names></name><name><surname>Dahan</surname><given-names>Maxime</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Carl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wisniewski</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name><name><surname>Mizuguchi</surname><given-names>Gaku</given-names></name><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Debbie</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Carl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Internally tagged, functional Cse4/CENP-A/CenH3 histone variant is exclusively centromeric and stable through the budding yeast cell cycle after replacement in S phase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In all eukaryotes, accurate segregation of genetic material constitutes the basis of cell division and inheritance. Chromosome segregation is controlled by a complex signalling network targeting the kinetochore—a protein superstructure of some 100 polypeptides, anchoring chromosomes to the mitotic spindle through interaction with a specialized region of the chromosome, the centromere. The chromatin structure of centromeres is distinguished from other chromosome regions by nucleosomes containing a distinct variant of histone H3, called CENP-A or CenH3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biggins, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westhorpe and Straight, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Unlike other organisms, in which centromeres encompass extended regions with tens or thousands of CENP-A nucleosomes, the centromere of the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is fully specified by a short DNA segment (<italic>CEN,</italic> ∼125 bp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaudet and Fitzgerald–Hayes, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murphy et al., 1991</xref>). This so-called ‘point’ centromere consists of a single nucleosome-like chromatin particle containing Cse4, the yeast ortholog of CENP-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stoler et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meluh et al., 1998</xref>). Classic genetic, molecular, and biochemical studies have defined three contiguous centromeric DNA elements CDEI, CDE II, and CDE III that direct assembly of a Cse4 nucleosome by sequence-specific DNA binding factors CBF1 and CBF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai and Davis, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lechner and Carbon, 1991</xref>) and Scm3, a Cse4-specific chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camahort et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mizuguchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stoler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cho and Harrison, 2011b</xref>). The singular nature of centromeric nucleosomes of budding yeast thus offers a simplified biological system for detailed study of the biogenesis, maintenance, and dynamics of centromere–kinetochore interactions.</p><p>Despite this simplicity, the architecture of Cse4 nucleosomes has become the subject of much debate. Cse4 nucleosomes have been reported to differ from the canonical nucleosome not only by the replacement of both molecules of histone H3 by the Cse4 variant, but also by the presence of chaperone Scm3 and dislocation of histones H2A-H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mizuguchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>), or by existence of a hemisome particle bearing half the histone content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dalal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Furuyama et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, live cell microscopy of GFP-tagged Cse4 have variously indicated that the number of Cse4 molecules associated with centromeres may be either several-fold greater than the two Cse4 molecules within a nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coffman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawrimore et al., 2011</xref>), or oscillate during mitosis from one to two molecules per centromeric nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shivaraju et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the fundamental composition and stability of the Cse4 nucleosome has been obfuscated by the recent microscopic studies.</p><p>To assess those claims, we have taken a direct approach to monitor the fate of Cse4 molecules throughout the cell cycle in live yeast. We utilize the photoconvertible fluorescent protein tdEos in fluorescence pulse-chase experiments to mark pre-existing Cse4 and document its complete replacement at centromeres with newly synthesized molecules early in S phase. We find that after this transient replacement, Cse4 remains stably associated with centromeres for the rest of the cell cycle, without additional Cse4 deposition in anaphase. Importantly, we show that recent discrepant claims can be attributed to reliance on GFP fusion to the C-terminus of Cse4, which causes impaired cell growth, temperature-dependent lethality, and extra-centromeric nuclear accumulation. By contrast, an insertion of GFP or tdEOS within the unstructured N-terminal tail of Cse4 avoids such deleterious phenotypes. Hence, many of the conflicting properties of C-terminally tagged Cse4 reflect the behavior of functionally impaired protein rather than native Cse4.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Internal tag reveals exclusive centromeric localization of Cse4</title><p>To analyze the localization of Cse4 in live cells, we introduced a fluorescent protein tag at an internal Xba I site (corresponding to Leu81 within the long N-terminal tail of Cse4) based on the original studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stoler et al.

These workers showed that insertions or deletions within the N-terminal tail do not impose any deleterious growth phenotype at all tested temperatures, as long as a 33-residue essential END domain, that interacts with the Ctf19-Mcm21-Okp1 kinetochore sub-complex, is preserved. Thus, as schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the flexible N-terminus of Cse4 is well suited to accommodate internal protein tags. In contrast, the extreme C-terminal residues of Cse4 (QFI, aa 227-229, located close to the structured part of the nucleosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tachiwana et al., 2011</xref>]) mediate recognition by CENP-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kato et al., 2013</xref>) and an adjoining tag is likely to impair this interaction.

For this strain, we confirm the presence of fluorescent centromeric clusters, though centromere intensity appears slightly elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The C-terminal Cse4-GFP strain exhibits slow growth in rich medium even at 24°C, and is not viable at 38°C, while none of the internal fusions have growth defects at either temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Taken together, our results demonstrate that fusion of a fluorescent protein tag to the C-terminus impairs Cse4 function. Accordingly, we only used internal tags to further explore the physiological dynamics of Cse4.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Pulse-chase shows replacement of Cse4-tdEos at entry into S phase</title><p>After synthesis and protein folding, tdEos fluorophores undergo relatively slow maturation to a green fluorescent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nienhaus et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These should not be construed to reflect the total number of Cse4 molecules present at the clusters, because incomplete maturation and the initial photobleaching prior to PALM (necessitated by paraformaldehyde-induced conversion—JW, personal communication) leave only a fraction of total fluorophores detectable as single-molecule events. Moreover, the existence of the reversible dark state of red tdEos may cause multiple detections of some fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Annibale et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Despite this, MFM-PALM localization of individual fluorophores allows estimation of the overall dimensions of centromere clusters. We find that Cse4 clusters in G1 are typically ∼450 nm across (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>), clearly indicating that their wide-field image (the sum of all individual Airy disks) would significantly exceed the diffraction limit (in this case an Airy disk with FWHM ∼225 nm). Strikingly, anaphase clusters are more compact and asymmetric, on average approximating an ellipsoid of 350 nm × 200 nm (still above the diffraction limit—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). This change corresponds to ∼threefold reduction in the volume of the cluster and thus higher spatial density of centromeres. Frequently, the shortened polar axis coincides with the direction of the mitotic spindle extending between anaphase clusters (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Such substantial dimensions of Cse4 clusters and their compaction in anaphase have important implications for photometric measurements of fluorescence intensity (see below).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02203.010</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Centromeric clusters become more compact during anaphase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An example of MFM-PALM image with nine simultaneously acquired Z-planes.

Comparison of centromeric Scm3 and Cse4 fluorescence in telophase, when the majority of tdEos fluorophores are mature, shows that their intensities closely overlap and follow similar photobleaching curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). An identical result is also obtained with the GFP tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taking into account that Cse4 remains stable after deposition and Scm3 interacts dynamically and persistently with centromeres, this indicates that near equimolar levels of both proteins coexist on centromere clusters throughout the cell cycle.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In a side-by-side comparison, we document that a C-terminal GFP tag impairs Cse4 functionality, causing severe growth defects and substantial extra-centromeric accumulation. We observed similar growth defects with a FLAG epitope tag as well (GM, unpublished data). The extreme C-terminal residues of Cse4 specify recognition by Mif2, the yeast CENP-C inner kinetochore protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kato et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, a C-terminal fusion is likely to affect such interaction, perturbing kinetochore functionality. Thus, the molecular phenotypes of C-terminally tagged Cse4-GFP reflect properties of functionally impaired Cse4, rather than the native protein. Similarly, partial loss of function was also observed for C-terminally tagged CENP-A/CenH3 in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kalitsis et al., 2003</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schuh et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Recent claims of altered cell cycle dynamics and/or substantially increased centromere localization were based on such compromised Cse4 fusions, despite their temperature-sensitive phenotype and evident extra-centromeric distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coffman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawrimore et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shivaraju et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, the very first epitope tag in Cse4 consisted of an insertion within the N-terminal tail, at codon 81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stoler et al., 1995</xref>). At this location, a GFP tag does not affect Cse4 functionality and cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2000</xref>). We find that even the insertion of tdEos tag (twice the size of GFP) at the same location is well tolerated, causing no detectable growth phenotypes, and similar findings were obtained for up to four GFP copies (R Baker, personal communication). Thus, internally tagged Cse4 fusions should be used in imaging studies as a preferred reporter of the composition and dynamics of centromeric nucleosomes.</p><p>The internal photoconvertible tdEos tag allows a direct analysis of Cse4 dynamics in live cells, minimizes autofluorescence, improves signal to noise, and enables excitation at low energies to limit phototoxicity and cell cycle perturbation. This reveals replacement of Cse4 exclusively in early S phase, linked to DNA synthesis—consistent with the timing of centromere replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCarroll and Fangman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pohl et al., 2012</xref>). Our data elaborate on the S phase deposition of Cse4 reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pearson et al. (2004)</xref>, by showing this process as a removal of pre-existing Cse4 followed by the deposition of newly synthesized molecules, without recycling of old Cse4. Subsequently, Cse4 remains stably bound to centromeres for the remainder of the cell cycle until the next S phase. Furthermore, targeted photobleaching experiments show no second wave of Cse4 deposition in anaphase. Taken together, our findings provide compelling evidence that Cse4 is replaced in S phase and remains static on centromeres for the rest of the cell cycle. In this context, budding yeast Cse4 has no epigenetic role in kinetochore inheritance, in contrast to the inheritance of CENP-A on regional centromeres of other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Rop et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The gradual increase in fluorescence intensity observed for Cse4-GFP and Cse4-tdEos after S phase deposition is a manifestation of fluorophore maturation. Accordingly, interpretation of fluorescence intensities for proteins undergoing synthesis and exchange at a highly specific moment of the cell cycle requires caution. Furthermore, in conventional microscopy, centromere clusters frequently appear more point-like in anaphase and telophase than in G1, which may give the impression of a rise in fluorescence when viewed against the increased nuclear background caused by C-terminal Cse4-GFP fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joglekar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aravamudhan et al., 2013</xref>). A new super-resolution 3D-PALM approach allowed mapping of the actual spatial distribution of individual Cse4 molecules in the centromere cluster, indicating that it should not be treated as a point source for photometric analysis, and providing resolution superior to previous results based on bulk analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haase et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, 3D-PALM directly reveals that centromere clusters contract in anaphase. This may be a consequence of the hydrodynamic drag of segregating chromosomes, and is consistent with EM tomography showing congregation of the plus ends of spindle microtubules during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O'Toole et al., 1999</xref>). Such compaction of centromere clusters leads to ∼threefold higher spatial density of centromeres, increasing the likelihood that individual Cse4 molecules on separate centromeres come into proximity sufficient for FRET. This may explain the higher FRET efficiency reported in anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shivaraju et al., 2012</xref>) as interactions between centromeres, without the need to invoke structural oscillation of the centromeric nucleosome between hemisome and octasome.</p><p>Previous biochemical and molecular genetic evidence led to a model for a single centromeric nucleosome per yeast chromosome, each containing two Cse4 molecules, located at the ∼125 bp <italic>CEN</italic> sequence common to all 16 yeast chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smith, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Furuyama and Biggins, 2007</xref>). In contrast, the use of C-terminally tagged Cse4 yielded estimates ranging from 1 to 8 Cse4 molecules per centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joglekar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coffman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawrimore et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shivaraju et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aravamudhan et al., 2013</xref>). These discrepant results can be attributed to inaccuracies in estimating spot intensity in the presence of substantial nuclear background, failure to account for the full extent of the centromere cluster (which clearly exceeds the diffraction disk, especially in interphase) in the measurement aperture, or treatment of the cluster as a point source with Gaussian intensity distribution. Interestingly, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments demonstrated that the C-terminal Cse4-GFP fusion is deposited on centromeres as a pair during S phase, and the fluorescence intensity of a ‘lagging’ centromere in a dicentric chromosome at anaphase is consistent with the presence of two Cse4-GFP molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aravamudhan et al., 2013</xref>). Our photometry measurements of internally tagged Cse4-GFP—taking into account the dimensions of centromere clusters—also support the presence of two molecules of Cse4 in the singular centromeric nucleosome.</p><p>The Scm3 chaperone persists at centromeres in every stage of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>). This steady-state centromeric occupancy is the result of continuous dynamic exchange, on a timescale of several minutes, with a large nuclear pool of free Scm3 molecules. Such exchange was also observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luconi et al. (2011)</xref> in anaphase, although authors did not reliably observe Scm3 in other stages of the cell cycle. Scm3 may dissociate stochastically, and re-associate onto centromeres through interactions with Ndc10 and AT-rich <italic>CEN</italic> DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho and Harrison, 2011a</xref>). This dynamic property explains the lack of Scm3 in biochemical purifications of kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Westermann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyoshi et al., 2009</xref>), its absence as a stable component of reconstituted Cse4 octasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dechassa et al., 2011</xref>) and fluctuations in measurements of Scm3 occupancy by ChIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luconi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mishra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shivaraju et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>). As a Cse4-specific histone chaperone, Scm3 needs not, in principle, be retained at centromeres once assembly of the centromeric nucleosome has been accomplished in S phase. Indeed, biochemical experiments document classic chaperone properties for the conserved Cse4-binding domain of Scm3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dechassa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shivaraju et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>), and NMR and crystal structures of this domain show that DNA binding by Cse4-H4 in the nucleosome is physically incompatible with continued Scm3 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cho and Harrison, 2011b</xref>). However, full-length Scm3 (containing the Ndc10 and DNA binding domains) is enriched at centromeres through all of the cell cycle stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with live cell imaging, and genetic studies suggesting the importance of Scm3 after Cse4 deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camahort et al., 2007</xref>). Steady-state occupancy with dynamic exchange has been described for other chromatin proteins, notably the heterochromatin protein HP1, which functions as a platform for assembling gene silencing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheutin et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, it is highly likely that Scm3 remains after deposition of Cse4 to safeguard the integrity of the singular centromeric nucleosome on each budding yeast chromosome.</p><p>A model showing the overall fate of Cse4 in the cell cycle is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. In G1, a stable Cse4 nucleosome is maintained by steady-state occupancy of Scm3, which would capture and redeposit Cse4-H4 if any stochastic dissociation occurs. Early in S phase, centromeric nucleosomes are disrupted, leading to removal and degradation of old Cse4, with kinetochore detachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kitamura et al., 2007</xref>). The centromeric nucleosome is then re-established in a step-wise process, most likely starting with binding of CBF1 to CDEI, and CBF3 to CDEIII with assistance of Scm3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camahort et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mizuguchi et al., 2007</xref>). Subsequently, two Scm3-Cse4-H4 heterotrimers are recruited by Ndc10, the dimeric component of CBF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho and Harrison, 2011a</xref>). Scm3 then deposits each Cse4-H4 on <italic>CEN</italic> DNA through a dimer intermediate to form a (Cse4-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetrasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20a">Dechassa et al., 2014</xref>). During this step, CDEII DNA out-competes Cse4-H4 contacts with Scm3, which nonetheless remains in close proximity through interactions with Ndc10 and AT-rich <italic>CEN</italic> DNA. Assembly of two H2A-H2B dimers is likely to follow, although their topography may be altered, as indicated by lack of formaldehyde cross-linking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mizuguchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krassovsky et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the stable state of Cse4-nucleosomes is octameric, although transient, sub-octameric intermediates may occur during assembly or disassembly. By remaining in close proximity, Scm3 serves not as a structural replacement for H2A-H2B (contrary to our initial model in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mizuguchi et al. (2007)</xref>), but rather as a persistent chaperone-in-residence to insure against catastrophic loss of the singular Cse4 nucleosome.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, Jim Manley, and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Jim Kadonaga, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The budding yeast centromeric nucleosome has been the subject of many studies from many laboratories, but there has been considerable disagreement with regard to this essential part of the centromere in an organism that has been invaluable for centromere studies. This paper by Wisniewski et al. on Cse4 (CenH3) represents an important step forward in our understanding of the yeast centromere. In this study, the authors carried out fluorescence pulse-chase experiments with internally-labeled Cse4 and found that preexisting Cse4 is replaced with newly-synthesized Cse4 during S phase in a DNA replication-dependent process. In general, the experiments were carefully performed, and the work has been presented in a lucid and logical manner.</p><p>The reviewers feel that this work is generally appropriate for publication for <italic>eLife</italic>. There is, however, one important issue that needs to be addressed by the authors. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, the levels of internally-tagged Cse4 (lanes 2 and 3) appear to be roughly two-fold lower than the level of wild-type Cse4 (lane 1). The authors should address whether or not the apparently lower levels of internally-tagged Cse4 are due to a technical issue (e.g., inefficient transfer to the membrane) or to genuinely lower levels of the tagged proteins. If the latter, the lower levels of tagged proteins need to be incorporated into the interpretation of the results. To test if it is the former, the authors might try a quantitative method such as SILAC with wild-type vs. internally-tagged strains.</p><p>In other words, the stoichiometry within the nucleosome and the number of nucleosomes have been contentious issues. Moreover, the blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), taken at face value, says that the number of Cse4 molecules in their internally-tagged versions is substantially less than in the WT strain. Hence, this is an important point because assessing the amount of Cse4 at centromeres throughout the cell cycle and counting the number of Cse4 molecules are two of the main goals in this study.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) As the authors correctly point out, the accurate counting of molecules, as distinguished from counting fluorescent emissions or “events”, is very difficult by localization microscopy. The authors emphasize the sources of error in under-counting molecules. It is probably worth noting that counting is difficult because of both under- and over-counting errors. The major over-counting error comes from the fact that a single molecule of mEOS (and I presume tdEOS) can blink multiple times, each registering as an independent event (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al, 2012</xref> PMID: 23045631).</p><p>2) We are slightly uncomfortable with the apparent precision of the photometrics results arguing for a maximum of 2 Cse4 molecules per centromere because the TetR-GFP images have such a high nuclear background and thus require major image processing to extract the array signal. This background is not unique to this work and is consistent with other reports. In retrospect, this problem might have been mitigated by using a lacO and LacI-GFP combination.

There is, however, one important issue that needs to be addressed by the authors. As seen in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1F</italic></xref><italic>, the levels of internally-tagged Cse4 (lanes 2 and 3) appear to be roughly two-fold lower than the level of wild-type Cse4 (lane 1). The authors should address whether or not the apparently lower levels of internally-tagged Cse4 are due to a technical issue (e.g. inefficient transfer to the membrane) or to genuinely lower levels of the tagged proteins. If the latter, the lower levels of tagged proteins need to be incorporated into the interpretation of the results. To test if it is the former, the authors might try a quantitative method such as SILAC with wild-type vs. internally-tagged strains</italic>.</p><p><italic>In other words, the stoichiometry within the nucleosome and the number of nucleosomes have been contentious issues. Moreover, the blot (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1F</italic></xref><italic>), taken at face value, says that the number of Cse4 molecules in their internally-tagged versions is substantially less than in the WT strain. Hence, this is an important point because assessing the amount of Cse4 at centromeres throughout the cell cycle and counting the number of Cse4 molecules are two of the main goals in this study.</italic></p><p>To address the apparently low level of internally tagged Cse4, we have constructed bacterial strains expressing His6-Cse4, His6-Cse4-GFPinternal and His6-Cse4-tdEos, purified the recombinant proteins by Ni-Sepharose chromatography, and determined protein concentration. We performed quantitative Western blotting by spiking known amounts (fmoles) of purified proteins into yeast extracts and used the Western blot signals to calculate the amount of the corresponding endogenous proteins. As noted in the revised text and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>, the levels of Cse4-GFPinternal and Cse4-tdEosinternal are comparable to WT Cse4.

The authors emphasize the sources of error in under-counting molecules. It is probably worth noting that counting is difficult because of both under- and over-counting errors. The major over-counting error comes from the fact that a single molecule of mEOS (and I presume tdEOS) can blink multiple times, each registering as an independent event (see for example</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36"><italic>Lee et al, 2012</italic></xref> <italic>PMID: 23045631)</italic>.</p><p>To address the apparently low level of internally tagged Cse4, we have constructed bacterial strains expressing His6-Cse4, His6-Cse4-GFPinternal and His6-Cse4-tdEos, purified the recombinant proteins by Ni-Sepharose chromatography, and determined protein concentration.

This background is not unique to this work and is consistent with other reports. In retrospect, this problem might have been mitigated by using a lacO and LacI-GFP combination. Nevertheless, the results are carefully documented, consistent, and reasonable, and my concern is minor</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the high nuclear background of TetR-GFP complicates intensity measurements. To reduce background, we have now expressed TetR-GFP under control of a mutant ura3 promoter under noninducing conditions. This gives comparable photometric values as before, and because the background is now lower, it is also visually apparent that the intensity values for Cse4-GFPinternal falls between the TetR-GFP signals for 14x and 21x TetO.

We base our explanation on published work (referenced in text) concerning regulation of Cse4 levels by proteolysis and resistance of GFP-type proteins to degradation. Our explanation is that cytoplasmic detections may correspond to the remnants of proteolytic processing of tagged Cse4 (in contrast to a free pool of Cse4-tdEos, unlikely in the light of pulse-chase results). However, we cannot exclude other sources of fluorescence, so the explanation provided is stated as speculative.</p><p><italic>5) The Abstract states that their “findings indicate that a stable Cse4 nucleosome is maintained by chaperone-in-residence Scm3 throughout the cell cycle”, but this manuscript appears to lack data that directly demonstrate this conclusion.

Accordingly, we have softened the sentence by substituting “indicate” with “suggest”. We do think the point deserves mention in the abstract, as it conveys an important concept that distinguishes Scm3 from conventional histone chaperones that do not persist at the site of histone deposition. This is articulated further in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
