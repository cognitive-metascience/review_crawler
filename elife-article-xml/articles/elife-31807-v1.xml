the metazoan cytoskeleton and are essential for normal cell morphology, motility, and signal transduction. Dysregulation of IFs causes a wide range of human diseases, including skin disorders, cardiomyopathies, lipodystrophy, and neuropathy. Despite this pathophysiological significance, how cells regulate IF structure, dynamics, and function remains poorly understood. Here, we show that site-specific modification of the prototypical IF protein vimentin with O-linked β-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) mediates its homotypic protein-protein interactions and is required in human cells for IF morphology and cell migration. In addition, we show that the intracellular pathogen <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, which remodels the host IF cytoskeleton during infection, requires specific vimentin glycosylation sites and O-GlcNAc transferase activity to maintain its replicative niche. Our results provide new insight into the biochemical and cell biological functions of vimentin O-GlcNAcylation, and may have broad implications for our understanding of the regulation of IF proteins in general.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31807.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Like the body's skeleton, the cytoskeleton gives shape and structure to the inside of a cell. Yet, unlike a skeleton, the cytoskeleton is ever changing. The cytoskeleton consists of many fibers each made from chains of protein molecules. One of these proteins is called vimentin and it forms intermediate filaments in the cytoskeleton. Many different types of cells contain vimentin and a lot of it is found in cancer cells that have spread beyond their original location to other sites in the body.</p><p>Cells use chemical modifications to regulate cytoskeleton proteins. For example, through a process called glycosylation, cells can reversibly attach a sugar modification called O-GlcNAc to vimentin. O-GlcNAc can be attached to several different parts of vimentin and each location may have a different effect. It is not currently clear how cells control their vimentin filaments or what role O-GlcNAc plays in this process.</p><p>Using genetic engineering, Tarbet et al. produced human cells in the laboratory with modified vimentin proteins. These altered proteins lacked some of the sites for O-GlcNAc attachment. The goal was to see whether the loss of O-GlcNAc at a specific location would affect fiber formation and cell behavior. The results showed one site where vimentin needs O-GlcNAc to form fibers. Without O-GlcNAc at this site, cells could not migrate towards chemical signals. In addition, in normal human cells, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> bacteria hijack vimentin and rearrange the filaments to form a cage around themselves for protection. However, the cells lacking O-GlcNAc on vimentin were resistant to infection by <italic>Chlamydia</italic> bacteria.</p><p>These findings highlight the importance of O-GlcNAc on vimentin in healthy cells and during infection. Vimentin’s contribution to cell migration may also help to explain its role in the spread of cancer. The importance of O-GlcNAc suggests it could be a new target for therapies. Yet, it also highlights the need for caution due to the delicate balance between the activity of vimentin in healthy and diseased cells. In addition, human cells produce about 70 other vimentin-like proteins and further work will examine if they are also affected by O-GlcNAc.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>O-GlcNAc</kwd><kwd>intermediate filaments</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>Chlamydia trachomatis</kwd><kwd>glycosylation</kwd><kwd>chemical biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000070</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41-EB002025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Brien</surname><given-names>E Timothy</given-names><suffix>III</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AI123083</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valdivia</surname><given-names>Raphael H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AI107951</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valdivia</surname><given-names>Raphael H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01GM118847-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boyce</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001447</institution-id><institution>Rita Allen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boyce</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The in vivo modification of the canonical intermediate filament protein vimentin with O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine affects its function in filament assembly, cell migration and host-pathogen interactions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intermediate filaments (IF) are a major component of the metazoan cytoskeleton, distinct from the actin and microtubule systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lowery et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Herrmann and Aebi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chernyatina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Köster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Leduc and Etienne-Manneville, 2015</xref>). Humans express over 70 IF proteins, including both cytoplasmic (e.g., vimentin, keratins, neurofilaments) and nuclear (lamins) members, many with tissue-specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Szeverenyi et al., 2008</xref>). All IF proteins comprise a central, conserved α-helical rod domain, as well as amino-terminal head and carboxy-terminal tail domains of varying lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lowery et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Herrmann and Aebi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chernyatina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Köster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Leduc and Etienne-Manneville, 2015</xref>). IF proteins homo- or heterodimerize through the parallel association of their rod domains into coiled coils, forming an elongated dimer of ~45–48 nm for cytoplasmic IFs and ~50–52 nm for nuclear lamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Quinlan et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aebi et al., 1986</xref>). These dimers laterally associate in antiparallel fashion to form tetramers, which in turn assemble into ~65 nm unit-length filaments (ULFs) composed of eight tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Herrmann and Aebi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chernyatina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Herrmann et al., 1996</xref>). Finally, ULFs associate end-to-end to assemble mature IFs, measuring ~10 nm across (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lowery et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Herrmann and Aebi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chernyatina et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Unlike actin- or microtubule-based structures, IFs are nonpolar and do not serve as tracks for molecular motors. Instead, IFs contribute to the mechanical integrity of the cell through their unique viscoelastic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lowery et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Herrmann and Aebi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chernyatina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Köster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Leduc and Etienne-Manneville, 2015</xref>). In general, the IF network is flexible under low strain but stiffens and resists breakage under an applied force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Janmey et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fudge et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Guzmán et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kreplak et al., 2005</xref>). Remarkably, individual IFs can be stretched up to 3.6-fold before rupture, demonstrating their elastic nature, as compared to actin cables or microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kreplak et al., 2005</xref>). The IF network is also highly dynamic in vivo, with IF subunits (likely tetramers) exchanging rapidly at many points along mature filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Mendez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goldman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Miller et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Vikstrom et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ho et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Martys et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Vikstrom et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Nöding et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, the IF cytoskeleton quickly reorganizes in response to numerous physiological cues, including cell cycle progression, migration, spreading, and growth factor stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lowery et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Herrmann and Aebi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chernyatina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Köster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Leduc and Etienne-Manneville, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Yoon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Helfand et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>IFs participate in many cellular processes, including maintenance of cell shape, organelle anchoring, cell motility, and signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Helfand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Ze'ev, 1984</xref>). For example, vimentin, among the most widely studied IF proteins, is required for mesenchymal cell adhesion, migration, chemotaxis, and wound healing in both cell culture and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ivaska et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yamaguchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eckes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rogel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Menko et al., 2014</xref>). Vimentin IFs also contribute to the mechanical properties of the cytoplasm, and stabilize and localize mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Nekrasova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buehler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eckes et al., 1998</xref>). Importantly, genetic lesions that dysregulate the IF cytoskeleton cause a wide range of human diseases, including skin and nail disorders (keratins), cardiomyopathies (desmin), lipodystrophy, muscular dystrophy and progeria (lamins), giant axonal neuropathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (neurofilaments), and cataracts (vimentin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Omary, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Omary et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, the ectopic expression of wild type (WT) vimentin is a hallmark of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and is widely observed in human metastatic cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Satelli and Li, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Nieto, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Craene and Berx, 2013</xref>). IFs are likely functionally important in this context, because vimentin expression levels correlate with the invasive phenotypes of breast, prostate, and other epithelial cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Satelli and Li, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wei et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Vuoriluoto et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, the IF cytoskeleton is also intimately involved in host-microbe interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Geisler and Leube, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mak and Brüggemann, 2016</xref>). For example, changes in vimentin IFs are implicated in the adhesion, invasion, and replication of a wide range of bacteria, including such important pathogens as <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Kumar and Valdivia, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jorgensen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Snavely et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bednar et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mahesh et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryant et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Icenogle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lin et al., 2015</xref>)</italic> and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Murli et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guignot and Servin, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Despite this broad pathophysiological significance, the regulation of IF cytoskeleton morphology, dynamics, and signaling functions remains incompletely understood. Several recent lines of evidence indicate that post-translational modifications (PTMs) are an important mode of IF regulation, and indeed all IFs are subject to extensive PTMs, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, acetylation, farnesylation, and glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Snider and Omary, 2014</xref>). However, in most cases, the functional impact of these PTMs on IF structure and function is poorly characterized.</p><p>To better understand the dynamic regulation of the IF cytoskeleton, we focused on O-linked β-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), an intracellular form of protein glycosylation that reversibly decorates serine and threonine residues on thousands of nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial proteins. In mammals, O-GlcNAc is added by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and removed by O-GlcNAcase (OGA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hanover et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hart, 2014</xref>). O-GlcNAc cycling controls many processes, including nutrient sensing, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hanover et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hart et al., 2011</xref>), and is essential, as genetic ablation of OGT or OGA is lethal in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Shafi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Keembiyehetty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Yang et al., 2012</xref>).

Several neurofilament proteins are also glycosylated, especially in axons, and neurofilament-M O-GlcNAcylation is reduced in both human Alzheimer’s disease patients and a rat model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, suggesting a potential role for dysregulated IF glycosylation in neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dong et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dong et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lüdemann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheung and Hart, 2008</xref>).

Nevertheless, the mechanistic and functional impacts of O-GlcNAcylation on IF proteins remain largely unexplored.</p><p>Here, we report that vimentin O-GlcNAcylation is required for the structure and function of IFs in human cells. We demonstrate that site-specific glycosylation of vimentin mediates its self-association, and is required in human cells for both IF morphology and its facilitating role in cell migration. In addition, we provide evidence that vimentin glycosylation is co-opted by an intracellular bacterial pathogen to produce a replicative niche, revealing a new connection between IF O-GlcNAcylation and microbial pathogenesis. Our results provide new insight into the physiological role of vimentin glycosylation in particular, and may have broad implications for our understanding of the dynamic regulation of the IF cytoskeleton in general.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Vimentin is O-GlcNAcylated at multiple sites in its head domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Slawson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2007</xref>), but the functional consequences of this modification are poorly understood. Like other intracellular PTMs, O-GlcNAc can exert a wide range of biochemical effects on its substrates, including conformational change, relocalization or destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hanover et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Shafi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Keembiyehetty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mondoux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bond and Hanover, 2013</xref>). Because IF proteins self-associate into homo-oligomeric complexes, we hypothesized that vimentin O-GlcNAcylation might influence its protein-protein interactions. Indeed, O-GlcNAc regulates protein-protein interactions in other contexts, including chromatin remodeling, nutrient sensing, and the interaction between keratins and Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ku et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fujiki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Tarbet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dentin et al., 2008</xref>). However, physiological O-GlcNAc-mediated interactions are often low-affinity, sub-stoichiometric, and transient, presenting a technical barrier to studying them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hanover et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Shafi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Keembiyehetty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mondoux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bond and Hanover, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Tarbet et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To address these challenges, we used a chemical biology method to capture and characterize O-GlcNAc-mediated protein-protein interactions in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). In this strategy, cells are metabolically labeled with a GlcNAc analog bearing a diazirine photocrosslinking moiety, termed ‘GlcNDAz' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). GlcNDAz is accepted by the GlcNAc salvage pathway, converted to the nucleotide-sugar UDP-GlcNDAz, and used by OGT to decorate its native substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Brief treatment of GlcNDAz-labeled live cells with UV light triggers the covalent crosslinking of O-GlcNDAz moieties to any binding partner proteins within ~2–4 Å of the sugar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Because of this short radius, GlcNDAz crosslinking occurs exclusively at sites where the glycan contributes to the interaction interface, without crosslinking to distant or nonspecific proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, GlcNDAz is a powerful tool for identifying direct, glycosylation-mediated interactions between endogenous proteins in live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether vimentin engages in O-GlcNAc-mediated protein-protein interactions, we treated human cells with GlcNDAz and UV, and analyzed lysates by immunoblot (IB). Endogenous vimentin crosslinked into distinct, high molecular weight bands that were diazirine- and UV-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that O-GlcNAc mediates protein-protein interactions between vimentin and one or more binding partners. Overexpression of OGT caused an increase in vimentin crosslinks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), whereas overexpression of OGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) or treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of OGT, abbreviated 5SGlcNAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gloster et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), reduced crosslinking, confirming that this assay reports on authentic O-GlcNAc-mediated interactions, and not a nonspecific action of the GlcNDAz probe.</p><p>We next sought to identify the O-GlcNAc-mediated binding partner(s) of vimentin detected in our crosslinking assay. We created a myc-6xHis-tagged human vimentin construct and confirmed that it crosslinked via GlcNDAz similarly to endogenous vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Then, we purified preparative amounts of vimentin crosslinks from transfected cells via tandem immunoprecipitation (IP) and immobilized metal affinity chromatography, and analyzed the crosslinks by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

This result suggested that the vimentin GlcNDAz crosslinks represent homotypic, O-GlcNAc-mediated vimentin-vimentin interactions.</p><p>In vivo, vimentin exists in a range of assembly states, from soluble tetramers and ULFs, to relatively insoluble mature IFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lowery et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Herrmann and Aebi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chernyatina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Köster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Leduc and Etienne-Manneville, 2015</xref>). To determine the assembly state of the crosslinked vimentin species, we performed a well-established differential extraction procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ridge et al., 2016</xref>) on GlcNDAz-crosslinked cells. The GlcNDAz crosslinks of endogenous vimentin extracted into a denaturing buffer but not low or high ionic strength non-denaturing buffers, indicating that the crosslinks occur within the highly assembled filament population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ridge et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, extracted crosslinks remained soluble when exchanged from denaturing into non-denaturing buffers, demonstrating that GlcNDAz crosslinking per se does not reduce vimentin solubility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). To further confirm that crosslinks occur within assembled IFs, we treated cells with β,β’-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN), which blocks vimentin assembly beyond the ULF state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Durham, 1986</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, IDPN treatment abrogated vimentin IFs and caused the accumulation of vimentin aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Durham, 1986</xref>). In the crosslinking assay, IDPN also suppressed the formation of GlcNDAz-dependent adducts, indicating that the crosslinks occur in assembly states beyond ULFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Using quantitative IBs, we detected ~10% of endogenous vimentin crosslinked into GlcNDAz-dependent adducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>), though this measurement likely significantly underestimates the fraction of vimentin that engages in O-GlcNAc-mediated interactions, since several steps in the GlcNDAz crosslinking protocol are less than 100% efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Rodriguez et al., 2015</xref>). Based on these results, we concluded that O-GlcNAc-mediated vimentin-vimentin interactions are prevalent in cells, and occur primarily within assembled IFs, but not in soluble pools of lower-order assembly states.</p><p>The Hart lab previously mapped several glycosylation sites on vimentin’s flexible head domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Slawson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). We used these results to identify vimentin O-GlcNAc sites that contribute to its homotypic, glycosylation-mediated interactions. We mutated each reported O-GlcNAcylation site to alanine and screened these constructs in the GlcNDAz crosslinking assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Mutation of several individual residues, including T33, S34, and S39, reduced vimentin crosslinking, while mutation of S49 abolished all detectable crosslinks. Because of the dramatic reduction of crosslinking in the S49A mutant, we measured the fraction of total vimentin glycosylation occurring at S49. We transfected cells with vector, WT or S49A vimentin and then labeled them with GalNAz, an azide-bearing unnatural monosaccharide that we have described previously as a metabolic reporter of O-GlcNAcylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyce et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Palaniappan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). S49A mutant vimentin exhibited ~80% the GalNAz signal of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that approximately one-fifth of vimentin glycosylation occurs on S49 under these conditions. Together, these results suggest that robust and site-specific O-GlcNAcylation in the vimentin head domain mediates homotypic protein-protein interactions within IFs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31807.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Specific glycosylation sites in the vimentin head domain are required for homotypic, O-GlcNAc-mediated interactions.</title><p>293T cells were transfected with GFP only (control) or WT or mutant vimentin-myc-6xHis constructs as indicated for 24 hr, subjected to GlcNDAz crosslinking, and analyzed by IB.

Therefore, phenotypes arising from S/T→A mutations may be due to loss of phosphorylation, glycosylation, or both.

These O-GlcNAc-mediated interactions likely occur within assembled IFs and not smaller oligomeric states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). It is well established that portions of the vimentin head domain are required for filament assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eriksson et al., 2004</xref>), and that head domain PTMs (especially phosphorylation) govern IF dynamics in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Helfand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eriksson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chou et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eriksson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sihag et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2002</xref>).

Interestingly, however, internal deletion mutations within the head domain demonstrate that S49 itself is not required for vimentin filament formation in vitro or in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Shoeman et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the phenotypes observed in the S49A vimentin mutant are caused by a loss of PTM regulation, rather than simply a requirement for serine at that site.</p><p>Given the very short crosslinking radius of the GlcNDAz reagent (~2–4 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) and our MS proteomics analysis of the crosslinked complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>), the O-GlcNAc-mediated interactions we observe are likely homotypic dimeric or trimeric vimentin adducts. The precise molecular nature of these crosslinks, and why we observe multiple discrete crosslinked complexes, remain uncertain. The high MS proteomic coverage we obtained of vimentin and the lack of other proteins in the crosslinks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) suggest that the complexes do not contain other binding partner proteins or known protein-based PTMs of vimentin, such as SUMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kaminsky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Because vimentin is multiply phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Helfand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eriksson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chou et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eriksson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sihag et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2002</xref>), the crosslinks of distinct molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) could in principle represent different phospho-forms of vimentin. However, several commercially available anti-phospho-vimentin antibodies failed to recognize the crosslinked complexes by IB (not shown), and phosphatase treatment of crosslinked adducts had no effect on their SDS-PAGE migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), arguing against differential phosphorylation as an explanation.</p><p>Instead, we postulate that the discrete bands in the GlcNDAz-induced vimentin complexes represent different crosslinking geometries of vimentin multimers. Because the O-GlcNAc-mediated interactions we detect occur primarily in assembled IFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>), an individual glycan on the vimentin head domain (e.g., at residue S49) may contact the head domain of its dimeric partner, and/or the rod domain of a vimentin molecule in an adjacent dimer, and/or another vimentin molecule within the same ULF. These different crosslinking geometries might produce migration differences in our GlcNDAz/SDS-PAGE assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Irrespective of the molecular identities of the individual adducts, the fact that we observe a highly reproducible crosslinking pattern suggests that O-GlcNAc mediates specific contacts among vimentin molecules, and not a large variety of nonspecific interactions, which would produce variable or smeared crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). This evidence of specific contacts is perhaps surprising, given the widely accepted model that the head domain of vimentin is intrinsically disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guharoy et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that, in vivo, O-GlcNAcylation mediates site-specific contacts between glycans on one vimentin molecule and discrete glycan recognition sites or domains on adjacent vimentin molecules within assembled filaments. Interestingly, several prior reports identified a GlcNAc-binding property of vimentin on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ise et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ise et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Komura et al., 2012</xref>). Although the physiological relevance of extracellular vimentin is controversial, these biochemical observations are reminiscent of our own, in that vimentin is reported to bind to GlcNAc residues in both cases. However, two mutations in vimentin that abolish extracellular GlcNAc binding, E382A and E396A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Komura et al., 2012</xref>), do not reduce intracellular GlcNDAz crosslinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, our observations are distinct from the reported glycan-binding property of cell surface vimentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ise et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ise et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Komura et al., 2012</xref>). The vimentin site(s) that bind O-GlcNAc moieties are not readily discernible from our MS studies, due to the unpredictable masses and fragmentation spectra of crosslinked adducts. However, the identification of these sites will be an important priority for future studies, because this information may elucidate the biophysical regulation of IF assembly and dynamics by O-GlcNAc.</p><p>At the cellular level, specific glycosylation sites of vimentin, including S34, S39 and especially S49, are essential for IF morphology and for facilitating serum-stimulated migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We propose that O-GlcNAcylation at one or more of these sites influences the assembly and/or disassembly of vimentin filaments, as has been described for other PTMs. Indeed, phosphorylation of several residues in the vimentin head domain promotes IF disassembly in response to multiple stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Helfand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eriksson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chou et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eriksson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sihag et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2002</xref>). O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation often compete for nearby or identical residues on specific protein substrates, giving rise to a complex functional interplay between these PTMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butkinaree et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, specific O-GlcNAc sites required for in vivo IF assembly in our work, such as S34 and S39 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), can also be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Helfand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eriksson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chou et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eriksson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sihag et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, reciprocal PTMs at certain sites may have antagonistic effects, with glycosylation of S34 or S39 promoting IF assembly, while phosphorylation at those sites induces disassembly.</p><p>In contrast, vimentin S49 is required for normal IF assembly in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and is a known glycosylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Slawson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) but is not a reported phosphorylation site. These observations suggest a functional role for O-GlcNAc, but not O-phosphate, at this residue. In support of this hypothesis, a phosphomimetic S49E mutant phenocopies an S49A mutant in IF morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and an OGT inhibitor impacts on cell migration and <italic>Chlamydia</italic> inclusion size only in the presence of WT vimentin, but not in cells expressing S49A mutant vimentin or lacking vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly indicate that (de)glycosylation of S49 is required for WT levels of cell migration and pathogen-induced IF remodeling. Although we cannot strictly rule out the possibility that S49 is phosphorylated under as-yet untested conditions, we suggest that S49 O-GlcNAcylation is required for homotypic vimentin-vimentin interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), filament assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and downstream behaviors of the vimentin IF cytoskeleton in normal and pathological contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our results indicate that O-GlcNAc-mediated vimentin IF assembly is required for <italic>Chlamydia</italic> inclusion expansion and integrity, because we observed smaller inclusions and more cytoplasmic bacteria in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected cells expressing Y117L or S49A mutants of vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). <italic>Chlamydia</italic> remodels the IF cytoskeleton to stabilize the inclusion during its replication phase, and deploys the CPAF protease to dismantle the IF cytoskeleton and promote bacterial release at late stages of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Kumar and Valdivia, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jorgensen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Snavely et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bednar et al., 2011</xref>). Our current data extend these results by demonstrating that vimentin filament remodeling by <italic>Chlamydia</italic> depends on both OGT activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>) and on the site-specific glycosylation of vimentin itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). We detected WT levels of CPAF-mediated vimentin cleavage with the S49A and Y117L mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that the phenotypes we observe are not due to differential vimentin cleavage during infection. The molecular mechanisms by which <italic>Chlamydia</italic> co-opts OGT activity and vimentin glycosylation sites (e.g., S49) to reshape the IF cytoskeleton remain to be determined, and will be an interesting focus of future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that site-specific glycosylation of vimentin mediates its homotypic protein-protein interactions, and is required in human cells for IF morphology and cell migration. In addition, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> relies on OGT activity and particular vimentin glycosylation sites to remodel the IF cytoskeleton and promote inclusion expansion and integrity. Our results provide new insight into the biochemical and cell biological functions of vimentin O-GlcNAcylation. In addition, our work may have broad implications for other IF proteins. Numerous IF proteins are dynamically glycosylated <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">King and Hounsell, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chou et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ku et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dong et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dong et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lüdemann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheung and Hart, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Slawson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Srikanth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kakade et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tao et al., 2006</xref>), and the S49 residue of vimentin is conserved both among vertebrate vimentin orthologs and in human desmin, another type III IF protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, site-specific O-GlcNAcylation may be a general mode of regulating IF dynamics and function. In the future, pharmacological modulation of O-GlcNAcylation may provide a way to manipulate filament form and function for therapeutic benefit in diseases of dysregulated IFs, ranging from neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathy to cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (HeLa)</td><td>vimentin -/-</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (293T/17)</td><td>293T vimentin -/-</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (HeLa)</td><td>HeLa</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (293T/17)</td><td>293T/UAP1</td><td>PMCID: PMC3323966</td><td/><td>Stably expressing <break/>AGX1(F383G)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-O-GlcNAc RL2</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>Santa Cruz: sc-59624</td><td>1:300</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-myc 9E10</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>Santa Cruz: sc-40</td><td>1:300</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-tubulin</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Sigma: T6074</td><td>1:10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-nucleoporin-62</td><td>BD Biosciences</td><td>BD Biosciences: 610498</td><td>1:1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-vimentin D21H3</td><td>Cell Signaling</td><td>Cell Signaling: 5741</td><td>1:1,000; 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-vimentin V9</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich: V6389</td><td>1:1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-GFP</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>ThermoFisher: A11122</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat anti-rabbit IgG</td><td>Southern Biotechnology</td><td>Southern Biotech: 4030-05</td><td>1:5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>goat anti-mouse IgG</td><td>Southern Biotechnology</td><td>Southern Biotech: 1030-05</td><td>1:5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>goat anti-mouse k light chain</td><td>Southern Biotechnology</td><td>Southern Biotech: 1050-05</td><td>1:5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) <break/>Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific: A-11012</td><td>1:5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) <break/>Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific: A-11005</td><td>1:5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) <break/>IRDye 800CW conjugate</td><td>Li-Cor</td><td>Li-Cor: 925-32211</td><td>1:5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) <break/>IRDye 800CW conjugate</td><td>Li-Cor</td><td>Li-Cor: 925-32210</td><td>1:5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>mEmerald-vimentin-N-18</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Addgene: 54301</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pLenti CMV/TO Hygro DEST</td><td/><td>Addgene plasmid: 17291</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pLenti CMV Neo DEST (705-1)</td><td/><td>Addgene plasmid: 17392</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>mEmerald-vimentin-N-18/ <break/>pLenti6 CMV Neo</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>mEmerald-vimentin-N-18/ <break/>pLenti6 CMV Hygro</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Thiamet-G</td><td>Duke Small Molecule <break/>Synthesis Facility</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Ac45SGlcNAc</td><td>Benjamin Swarts, Central <break/>Michigan University</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Advansta ECL</td><td>Advansta</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>vimentin sgRNA</td><td>Duke Functional Genomics Facility</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>vimentin sgRNA</td><td>Duke Functional Genomics Facility</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>vimentin sgRNA</td><td>Duke Functional Genomics Facility</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (virus)</td><td>Cas9 Lentivirus</td><td>Duke Functional Genomics Facility</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>pENTR Directional <break/>TOPO cloning kit</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific: K240020</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Gateway LR Clonase II Enzyme</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific:11791100</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals and enzymes</title><p>Thiamet-G was synthesized as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Yuzwa et al., 2008</xref>) by the Duke Small Molecule Synthesis Facility (DSMSF).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: John A Hanover (Reviewer #1); Chad Slawson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Although the reviewers are interested in your findings, there is some considerable concern with some aspects of the data (e.g. point 4).</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting paper documenting an approach to understand the role of O-GlcNAcylation on IF structure and function. The authors demonstrate that O-GlcNAyclation of vimentin is important for normal function of the IF protein and that S49 on vimentin is the most critical O-GlcNAc site on the molecule. The studies with Chlamydia further extend the significance of the paper. The cross-linking approach uncovers interactions normally not accessible by other techniques.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An important aspect of the conclusions made in this study related to the GlcNDAz crosslinking assay. I have several concerns that will need some testing in some cases and comments in others: i) Why is there significant variability is the relative stoichiometry of the crosslinked species vs. the vimentin monomer? ii) Related to point 1-i, do different anti-vimentin antibodies provide similar crosslinking profiles and can this potentially tell us something about the location of the crosslink (e.g., see the extent of myc vs. vimentin crosslinks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>?. iii) The crosslinking efficiency likely depends on the conformation of the involved proteins. What is the crosslinking efficiency of vimentin in the presence or absence of 5SGlnNAc or Thiamet? iv) What happens to vimentin solubility in the context of different crosslinking conditions?</p><p>2) Protein expression of the various constructs needs to be shown for at least some of the experiments where expression levels can alter the conclusion. This is particularly relevant for the cell migration effects shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Expression of vimentin clearly enhances serum induced cell migration but the phenotype of the S49A and Y117L may be related to vimentin levels and any potential effect on the mutants on cell growth,</p><p>3) If S49 glycosylation is important for baseline filament organization, one prediction is that its glycosylation stoichiometry would be expected to be high. It would be important to compare the glycosylation of vimentin WT vs. some of the other glycol-mutants shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. This can be done using in vitro galactosylation.</p><p>4) Although the Plasmid Construction section of the Materials and methods indicates that the constructs were '..miniprepped and sequenced…&quot; it would be important that the entire clones are sequenced in full (i.e., not only the inserts). May be this was done already but I am a bit surprised that all the mutants shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (except for the T33A mutant) had such a profound effect on vimentin organization.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>: the effect of 5SGlcNAc on inclusion area in HeLa cells that lack vimentin is not significant. What about the number of extra-inclusion bacteria?</p><p>6) It is not surprising that the inclusion size is smaller for the two vimentin mutants (S49A and Y117L, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Disruption of the vimentin cytoskeleton is predicted to interfere with any cellular process that involves vimentin reorganization. A previous report suggested the presence of a chlamydia-secreted protease that disrupts the keratin cytoskeleton (F Dong et al., Infect Immun 2004). It is possible that the vimentin mutations have altered susceptibility to degradation vs. WT vimentin. It would be important to tone down the importance of glycosylation in this process.</p><p>7) How conserved is the S49-containing motif among other intermediate filament proteins. If conserved, are there known mutations in this residue in other intermediate filament proteins.</p><p>8) Did the authors use OGA to cleave GlcNDAz in vitro (and see things go away) As a side note, GlcNDAz isn't turned over well in the cell and accumulates – did they note any positive/negative consequences of that in their experiments? Why cycling? Not presence of?</p><p>9) Results, ninth paragraph: do cells in which OGT/OGA are perturbed have same characteristics? This would suggest it's cycling (esp. if it's present w/ OGA perturbation) rather than the addition of OGlcNAc (and just OGT disruption).</p><p>10) “Taken together, these results indicate that O-GlcNAcylation of vimentin, especially on S49, is required for optimal serum-stimulated cell migration.” Is that the case? If so, does it get better with TMG treatment or siRNA orf OGA?</p><p>11) Results, end of eleventh paragraph: is it possible that the 5SGlcNAc influences the chlamydia itself rather than just the host cell? What if it is treated with 5SGlcNAc (even if it's not known to have OGT, it might have an effect?)</p><p>12) Results, end of last paragraph: did increased o-glcNAc improve response to chlamydia?</p><p>13) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: were <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B and C</xref> from the urea extraction method? This doesn't have to be chronological, but it seems important to note given that you only see it in that fraction…</p><p>14) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> would mutations of these expect to change the folding for any reason other than O-GlcNAcylation changes? There seems no independent analysis of vimentin abundance and stability.</p><p>15) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>: what is being compared? WT to the other samples in the t-test or just the filaments/punctae within a sample? All samples? Statistics are unclear.</p><p>16) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: here it is best to argue that residues subject to glycosylation are important for cell migration. Formally, it is difficult to tease out the role of O-GlcNAc at these sites since both the GlcNAc and the backbone is altered. It’s also hard to tell what's being noted as statistically different here. I presume it's the difference between WT and the other three when serum stimulated? This should be better described either in the main text or in the legend. (i.e., vector is the -/- cell line without being reconstituted?).</p><p>17) Were the cells +5SGlcNAc serum stimulated? Are these data the same as the samples on the left just with additional datapoints of the 5SGlcNAc? Consider just condensing to one graph or noting that. If the statistics become difficult and that's why it's split out, it should be easy to note in a table or graphically when &quot;NS&quot; is taken out.

In addition, there is some intrinsic variability in the efficiency of each of the several steps in the GlcNDAz protocol, including the biosynthesis of UDP-GlcNDAz, the competition between UDP-GlcNDAz and abundant endogenous UDP-GlcNAc, the glycosylation of vimentin by OGT, the successful activation of the O-GlcNDAz diazirine by UV irradiation, and the productive insertion of the resulting carbene to form a covalent vimentin-vimentin crosslink (as opposed to the unproductive quenching of the carbene on a small molecule in the cytoplasm, for example)<sup>1,2</sup>. Since each of these steps is less than 100% efficient and subject to stochastic variability and/or cell type dependence, the final crosslinking results also vary somewhat. Importantly, however, these factors also mean that the crosslinking we observe almost certainly represents an underestimate of the extent of O-GlcNAc-mediated interactions among vimentin molecules, underlining their prevalence. In addition, the qualitative pattern of vimentin GlcNDAz crosslinking is highly reproducible across experiments and cell types (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, Figure 1—figure supplements 1, 7), indicating that it reports on specific, conserved interactions. We have addressed these considerations in the fifth paragraph of the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Related to point 1-i, do different anti-vimentin antibodies provide similar crosslinking profiles and can this potentially tell us something about the location of the crosslink (e.g., see the extent of myc vs. vimentin crosslinks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>?</p></disp-quote><p>We have used two different commercial anti-vimentin monoclonal antibodies, D21H3 and V9, as well as the 9E10 anti-myc monoclonal antibody to detect GlcNDAz crosslinks of vimentin in several experiments (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1B, C</xref> and 7 with D21H3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1A, F</xref> with V9, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> with 9E10). In the revised manuscript, we have stated which monoclonal was used in all applicable figure legends. We do not observe obvious differences in crosslinking when different antibodies are used (e.g., compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, performed with D21H3, with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1A, F</xref>, performed with V9). We agree with the reviewer that the site(s) of the vimentin crosslinks is of great interest, because knowing the site of carbene insertion into a second vimentin molecule might reveal a specific, O-GlcNAc-interacting motif. However, because, immunoblot (IB) analysis of GlcNDAz crosslinks is uniform across all antibodies used, this assay does not provide new information on that question. We have addressed these points to the fifth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) The crosslinking efficiency likely depends on the conformation of the involved proteins. What is the crosslinking efficiency of vimentin in the presence or absence of 5SGlnNAc or Thiamet?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer’s question, we have now performed GlcNDAz crosslinking in DMSO-, 5SGlcNAc- and Thiamet-G-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As expected, 5SGlcNAc treatment reduces GlcNDAz crosslinking of vimentin. In contrast, Thiamet-G treatment has little effect on crosslinking, likely because basal levels of vimentin glycosylation are high under physiological OGT expression conditions. In addition, we agree with the reviewer that the conformation of vimentin likely affects the efficiency and molecular topology of GlcNDAz crosslinks. All glycosylation sites that we characterized lie within the vimentin head domain, which is thought to be unstructured<sup>3-8</sup>. Because we observe reproducible, discrete crosslink products (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, Figure 1—figure supplements 1, 7), our results raise the possibility that the head domain may adopt a specific conformation through O-GlcNAc-mediated interactions in intermediate filaments (IF) in vivo. We have addressed these considerations in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript (fifth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) What happens to vimentin solubility in the context of different crosslinking conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer notes, we extracted crosslinked vimentin samples into different buffers depending on the experimental need. For example, standard IBs were usually performed on crosslinked samples prepared in denaturing urea buffer (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B and 1C</xref>), whereas experiments involving immunoprecipitations (IPs) were performed with samples made in a standard, non-denaturing IP buffer (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As the reviewer anticipates, it is important to confirm that vimentin crosslinks are soluble in both buffers, because vimentin crosslinking could not be reliably detected and compared if GlcNDAz crosslinking itself renders vimentin insoluble in those buffers. To address this point, we have now performed a control experiment wherein we performed the differential extraction assay<sup>9</sup> and then exchanged the crosslinks from the denaturing urea buffer into non-denaturing buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This result demonstrates that the vimentin crosslinks are equally soluble in both cases, confirming the validity of comparing crosslink IBs performed with different buffers across experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Protein expression of the various constructs needs to be shown for at least some of the experiments where expression levels can alter the conclusion. This is particularly relevant for the cell migration effects shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Expression of vimentin clearly enhances serum induced cell migration but the phenotype of the S49A and Y117L may be related to vimentin levels and any potential effect on the mutants on cell growth.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that uniform expression of different wild type and mutant vimentin constructs in our reconstituted cells is critical. To confirm even expression, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to normalize the vimentin-mEmerald expression in all reconstituted HeLa and 293T cell lines. In the revised manuscript, we have updated the Materials and methods text to explain this fact, and have included a new figure from the flow cytometry data, demonstrating even expression of the various vimentin-mEmerald expression across these cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref>). These flow cytometry data are consistent with the microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and Figure 3—figure supplement 4A) and quantitative IB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>) data, which confirm uniform vimentin-mEmerald expression across cell lines at a level comparable to that of endogenous vimentin. Based on these controls, we believe the phenotypes we observe in our IF morphology, cell migration and <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection assays are due to differences in vimentin genotype, and not differences in vimentin expression levels. We have revised the seventh paragraph of the Results section to clarify these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) If S49 glycosylation is important for baseline filament organization, one prediction is that its glycosylation stoichiometry would be expected to be high. It would be important to compare the glycosylation of vimentin WT vs. some of the other glycol-mutants shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. This can be done using in vitro galactosylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the stoichiometry of vimentin S49 glycosylation is an interesting and important question. We attempted a galactosyltransferase assay, as the reviewer suggested, but observed poor labeling in all samples, including cell lysates and commercial positive control proteins (α-crystallin) (not shown). As an alternative approach, we performed metabolic labeling with <italic>N</italic>-azidoacetylgalactosamine (GalNAz) to quantify O-GlcNAcylation<sup>10-12</sup>. We have previously demonstrated that GalNAz labeling and subsequent bioorthogonal chemical ligation permit the detection of authentic O-GlcNAcylation in live human cells<sup>10-12</sup>. We GalNAz-labeled cells transfected with vector only or wild type or S49A vimentin constructs, ligated an alkyne-Cy5 probe to O-GlcNAz moieties, IP-ed vimentin and analyzed Cy5 signal to quantify the extent of glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In this experiment, the Cy5 signal of the S49A mutant was approximately 80% of the wild type, suggesting that S49 glycosylation accounts for about one-fifth of total vimentin glycosylation under these conditions. We believe these results are consistent with our model that significant levels of S49 glycosylation promote IF formation or stability in live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, Figure 3—figure supplement 4). These data are discussed in the sixth paragraph of the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Although the Plasmid Construction section of the Materials and methods indicates that the constructs were '..miniprepped and sequenced…&quot; it would be important that the entire clones are sequenced in full (i.e., not only the inserts). May be this was done already but I am a bit surprised that all the mutants shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (except for the T33A mutant) had such a profound effect on vimentin organization.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the IF morphology and functional phenotypes we observe in vimentin mutants are striking, supporting the importance of vimentin glycosylation in vivo. In prior e-mail correspondence with Dr. Marletta and the <italic>eLife</italic> staff, we addressed the question of sequencing our vimentin constructs raised in this comment. Briefly, we sequence-verified the entire open reading frames of all vimentin constructs used in our work to confirm their integrity and to rule out the possibility of any adventitious mutations. Importantly, site-directed mutagenesis was performed in a donor vector, and then wild type or mutant vimentin open reading frames were transferred to a destination vector via standard topoisomerase-based cloning methods. This workflow eliminates the possibility that the mutagenesis procedure introduced undetected mutations in the backbone vector, since the destination vectors were never subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. We have revised the “Plasmid Construction” subsection of the Materials and methods to explain this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>: the effect of 5SGlcNAc on inclusion area in HeLa cells that lack vimentin is not significant. What about the number of extra-inclusion bacteria?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be useful to determine the effects of 5SGlcNAc treatment on extra-inclusion <italic>Chlamydia</italic> in infected vimentin<sup>-/-</sup> HeLa cells. We performed this experiment and now show that OGT inhibition has no effect on the number of extra-inclusion bacteria in cells lacking vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, bottom panel, and Results, last paragraph). This result is consistent with our model that vimentin glycosylation sites and OGT activity are both required for IF remodeling by <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is not surprising that the inclusion size is smaller for the two vimentin mutants (S49A and Y117L, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Disruption of the vimentin cytoskeleton is predicted to interfere with any cellular process that involves vimentin reorganization. A previous report suggested the presence of a chlamydia-secreted protease that disrupts the keratin cytoskeleton (F Dong et al., Infect Immun 2004). It is possible that the vimentin mutations have altered susceptibility to degradation vs. WT vimentin. It would be important to tone down the importance of glycosylation in this process.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer notes, the <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-encoded CPAF protease cleaves host IF proteins<sup>13</sup>. Indeed, we have previously shown that vimentin in particular is a CPAF substrate during infection<sup>14-17</sup>. We agree with the reviewer that the effects of vimentin glycosylation on vimentin cleavage during infection are an important question. We now provide IBs demonstrating that the infection-dependent cleavage of vimentin is unaffected in the S49A and Y117L mutants (Figure 5—figure supplement 9). The observations that the S49A mutation does not affect vimentin cleavage by CPAF (Figure 5—figure supplement 9) but still prevents IF remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>) support the importance of vimentin glycosylation sites and OGT activity during <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection. We also agree with the reviewer that any generic disruption in the vimentin cytoskeleton could interfere with IF reorganization during infection. In this regard, as the reviewer notes, the phenotypes we observe in the Y117L mutant are not surprising, since Y117L cannot assemble beyond the unit-length filament stage<sup>18-21</sup>. This property makes the Y117L mutant an appropriate positive control for vimentin IF disruption. Our data also demonstrate that, although S49A vimentin is capable of forming filaments (albeit at reduced levels) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and Figure 3—figure supplement 4), S49 is required for the characteristic <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-induced vimentin IF remodeling during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>). We believe these results indicate a specific regulatory role for the S49 glycosylation site in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-induced IF remodeling. Indeed, two other lines of evidence indicate that the phenotypes we observe with the S49A mutant are due to the loss of S49 glycosylation, and not to generic loss of IF assembly. First, 5SGlcNAc treatment reduces <italic>Chlamydia</italic> inclusion size and extra-inclusion bacteria in cells expressing wild type vimentin, but not cells lacking vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A, B, E</xref>), strongly arguing for a requirement for <italic>both</italic> OGT activity <italic>and</italic> vimentin in inclusion architecture. Second, prior studies have demonstrated that S49 is not required for IF formation, because vimentin mutants with internal head domain deletions spanning S49 are competent to form IFs in vitro and in vivo<sup>22</sup>. We believe these data, taken together, indicate that the IF phenotypes we observe in control and <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected cells are due to a loss of vimentin assembly regulation by O-GlcNAcylation at S49, and not due to an intrinsic, essential function of S49 per se. We have revised the manuscript in the eleventh and twelfth paragraphs of the Results section and in the second paragraph of the Discussion, to better explain these results and analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) How conserved is the S49-containing motif among other intermediate filament proteins. If conserved, are there known mutations in this residue in other intermediate filament proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer anticipates, S49 is conserved among vimentin orthologs in other vertebrates, despite the lower overall conservation of the head domain compared to the rod domain (Figure 6—figure supplement 10A)<sup>3-8</sup>. Among the other human type III IF family members, S49 is conserved in desmin but not peripherin or glial fibrillary acidic protein (Figure 6—figure supplement 10B). These observations suggest that control of vimentin and perhaps desmin by O-GlcNAcylation at S49 or its cognate residue (desmin S51) could be evolutionarily conserved, an important hypothesis to test in future studies. It will also be interesting to determine whether O-GlcNAcylation exerts similar effects on other IFs, since numerous IF proteins are also glycosylated in vivo<sup>23-35</sup>. We are not aware of characterized mutations in S51 of desmin in human disease. However, mutations in the nearby S46 residue of desmin cause myofibrillar myopathy<sup>36,37</sup> and could conceivably impact on desmin glycosylation at S51 (or even S46 itself), though this idea is speculative. We have added a brief discussion of these points in the last paragraph of the Results section.</p><p><italic>8) Did the authors use OGA to cleave GlcNDAz</italic> in vitro <italic>(and see things go away) As a side note, GlcNDAz isn't turned over well in the cell and accumulates – did they note any positive/negative consequences of that in their experiments? Why cycling? Not presence of?</italic></p><p>An in vitro cleavage assay with recombinant-purified human OGA and GlcNDAz crosslinks is unlikely to succeed, since the covalent adducts formed by carbene insertion would almost certainly sterically occlude the crosslinked proteins from the OGA active site<sup>38-41</sup>. As an alternative experiment to address the reviewer’s question, we demonstrated that overexpression of human OGA in GlcNDAz-labeled cells reduces subsequent vimentin crosslink formation, whereas OGT overexpression increases it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As the reviewer notes, the Kohler lab has shown previously that the O-GlcNDAz moiety is turned over in cells more slowly than is the natural O-GlcNAc moiety<sup>42</sup>. Despite this important point, we believe our results confirm the specificity of GlcNDAz crosslinking and indicate that O-GlcNDAz cycles on vimentin, since its addition and removal can be potentiated by OGT or OGA overexpression, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For these reasons, we previously referred to O-GlcNAc “cycling,” as opposed to “presence,” in several places in the original text. We have revised the manuscript language to remove “cycling” and to be appropriately conservative in our description of the results. Finally, we note that we have used GlcNDAz as a discovery tool for examining the biochemical effects of glycosylation on vimentin, but have not deployed GlcNDAz in any cellular functional assays (e.g., migration or <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection), which might be particularly sensitive to glycan turnover kinetics. Importantly, we have not observed any obvious deleterious effects of GlcNDAz labeling (e.g., apoptosis) with the doses and incubation times used in our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Results, ninth paragraph: do cells in which OGT/OGA are perturbed have same characteristics?

As the reviewer suggests, we believe these data suggest that O-GlcNAc is cycling on vimentin, and not merely static, since manipulating OGT or OGA levels can affect the extent of O-GlcNDAz modification and subsequent crosslinking. We have revised the manuscript to provide a more conservative description of these results. We did not observe any obvious deleterious or differential phenotypic effects of OGT and OGA overexpression with the expression levels and incubation times used in our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) “Taken together, these results indicate that O-GlcNAcylation of vimentin, especially on S49, is required for optimal serum-stimulated cell migration.” Is that the case?

In cells expressing wild type vimentin, Thiamet-G treatment significantly reduced serum-induced migration, compared to vehicle alone (<italic>p</italic> = 0.006), albeit less dramatically than 5SGlcNAc did. In contrast, Thiamet-G treatment had no effect on serum-induced migration in cells expressing S49A (or Y117L) mutant vimentin. These results support our model that O-GlcNAcylation of vimentin at S49 is required for optimal serum-stimulated cell migration.

These results confirm the microscopy data from our original submission, which also reflect even expression of the wild type and mutant vimentin-mEmerald constructs across all reconstituted cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and Figure 3—figure supplement 4). To further rule out any effect of the S49A mutation on vimentin stability, we treated cells expressing wild type or S49A vimentin with vehicle only or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and analyzed cell lysates by IB (Figure 3—figure supplement 5). These results revealed no discernible difference between wild type and S49A vimentin in the presence or absence of proteasome inhibition.

We performed ANOVA analysis followed by pairwise t-tests to compare the filament data from each vimentin mutant to wild type, and to compare the puncta data from each vimentin mutant to wild type. All three vimentin mutants (S49A, Y117L, S49E) exhibited levels of puncta and filaments that were significantly different from those of wild type. These results support our model that S49 glycosylation regulates IF morphology. In addition, we performed t-tests comparing the puncta and filament levels of the S49A mutant and the phosphomimetic S49E mutant to each other. In this case, no significant difference was observed between the two mutants. This result (along with the lack of any literature reports of S49 phosphorylation) supports our conclusion that loss of glycosylation, and not loss of phosphorylation, likely explains the phenotypes of the S49A mutant in our assays.

As the reviewer suggests, we have revised both the Results and Discussion sections of the text to reflect the fact that our data demonstrate the importance of O-GlcNAcylation sites of vimentin for cell migration, a more parsimonious description of our results. Nevertheless, we believe two important lines of evidence suggest that it is likely loss of glycosylation, and not a change in amino acid sequence per se, that explains the phenotype of the S49A mutant in our cell migration assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). First, 5SGlcNAc and Thiamet-G treatment inhibit the serum-induced migration of cells expressing wild type vimentin but not cells lacking vimentin or cells expressing S49A vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These results demonstrate that the S49 residue of vimentin is required for the inhibitory effect on cell migration of OGT or OGA inhibition. Second, prior studies have demonstrated that S49 is not required for vimentin IF assembly in vitro or in vivo, arguing against an O-GlcNAc-independent role for S49 in IF structure and function<sup>22</sup>. We believe the simplest interpretation of our data, taken together, is that loss of vimentin regulation by S49 glycosylation alters IF assembly state, accounting for the phenotype of the S49A mutant in the cell migration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). With respect to the question of statistical comparisons, we apologize that this was not clear in the original text. For our cell migration data, we first performed an ANOVA, which compares all samples in a group at once to determine in which condition(s) the variance is significant. Then, given the significance indicated by the ANOVA, we performed pairwise t-tests for all combinations of data points. As the reviewer surmises, the serum-stimulated migration of wild type vimentin-expressing cells is significantly greater than the serum-stimulated migration of all three other cell types (vector, S49A and Y117L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, as noted above, 5SGlcNAc or Thiamet-G treatment significantly inhibits the serum-stimulated migration of cells expressing wild type vimentin, but not that of cells expressing any of the three mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We have revised the image and legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to clarify the most important comparisons made in our statistical analyses, without unduly cluttering the graph. In addition, we have revised the Materials and methods section to explain the statistical analysis in more detail, and have now provided source data with comprehensive statistical analyses, including all pairwise t-test results, in table format (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). To answer the final part of the reviewer’s question, “vector” refers to vimentin<sup>-/-</sup> cells stably transduced with an empty version of the backbone vector used to create the wild type and mutant vimentin-mEmerald constructs. We apologize that this was unclear in our initial submission, and we have revised the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to rectify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Were the cells +5SGlcNAc serum stimulated? Are these data the same as the samples on the left just with additional datapoints of the 5SGlcNAc? Consider just condensing to one graph or noting that. If the statistics become difficult and that's why it's split out, it should be easy to note in a table or graphically when &quot;NS&quot; is taken out. Also, for WT serum stimulated, are there error bars?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that these details of the cell migration assay were unclear. As the reviewer anticipates, the “+5SGlcNAc” data series in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> represents cells stimulated with serum and treated with 5SGlcNAc. This also applies to the cells treated with Thiamet-G, which are new data provided in the resubmitted manuscript. We have revised the figure legend to clarify this point. Also, we have adopted the reviewer’s suggestion to simplify <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> by consolidating the migration data into a single graph and by highlighting only the most important statistical comparisons. In addition, we have provided complete statistical analyses in table format as source data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Finally, there are no error bars for the wild type serum-stimulated condition, because this experimental treatment was defined as maximum migration, fixed at 100% and used to normalize all other data. We have revised the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to explain this analysis more carefully.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> legend: -/- is what is indicated I think?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this typo, which we have corrected in the revised manuscript.
