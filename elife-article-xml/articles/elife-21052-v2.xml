maintenance of all differentiated cell types, including the germline. Neoblasts, originally defined as undifferentiated cells residing in the adult parenchyma, are frequently compared to embryonic stem cells yet their developmental origin remains obscure. We investigated the provenance of neoblasts during <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> embryogenesis, and report that neoblasts arise from an anarchic, cycling <italic>piwi-1+</italic> population wholly responsible for production of all temporary and definitive organs during embryogenesis. Early embryonic <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cells are molecularly and functionally distinct from neoblasts: they express unique cohorts of early embryo enriched transcripts and behave differently than neoblasts in cell transplantation assays. Neoblast lineages arise as organogenesis begins and are required for construction of all major organ systems during embryogenesis. These subpopulations are continuously generated during adulthood, where they act as agents of tissue homeostasis and regeneration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21052.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21052.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21052.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Flatworms are masters of regeneration. If virtually any piece of a flatworm is cut off, a new fully functional individual will grow from it within two weeks. This is no simple task since flatworms contain a wide variety of organ systems, including a brain, nervous system, eyes, kidneys, gut, muscle and skin.</p><p>Flatworms owe their regenerative abilities to adult stem cells called neoblasts. Like embryonic stem cells, neoblasts can replicate themselves and they can develop into any type of cell found in an adult worm. In contrast, adult stem cells in fruit flies, zebrafish, mice and humans can only produce the type of cells found in the organ or tissue they live in.</p><p>Now, Davies et al. have tracked how and when neoblasts develop in embryos of the flatworm species <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> by documenting the distinct gene expression signatures in flatworm embryos at various stages of development. An atlas of the genes that are expressed in various embryonic tissues and in major organs as they begin to develop was also created. These tools, and the results of cell transplantation experiments, revealed that neoblasts emerge from embryonic stem cells as the major organs start to form. As the emerging neoblasts start to express the same combination of genes as adult neoblasts, they also begin to behave just like these cells. The populations of neoblasts remain present throughout the life of the flatworm, helping to maintain, repair and regenerate tissues.</p><p>In the future, work that builds on the results presented here by Davies et al. will help researchers to understand more about how stem cells are maintained and regulated. By learning more about the genetic differences between neoblasts and human adult stem cells scientists may be able to explain why humans and other mammals have a limited ability to regenerate. This information could potentially help to develop treatments that stimulate regeneration in patients with degenerative diseases or traumatic injuries.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21052.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21052.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>planaria</kwd><kwd>Schmidtea mediterranea</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>embryogenesis</kwd><kwd>anarchic cleavage</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lei</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37GM057260-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alvarado</surname><given-names>Alejandro Sánchez</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Anarchic, cycling <italic>piwi-1</italic>+ embryonic cells gives rise to neoblasts, pluripotent stemcells required for development of all organ systems during <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> embryogenesis, as well as the maintenance andregeneration of tissues during adulthood.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neoblasts are planarian adult somatic stem cells that exhibit levels of plasticity and pluripotency comparable to embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elliott and Sánchez Alvarado, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rink, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). In flies, fish, mice and humans, adult somatic stem cells are fate-restricted, sustaining production of cell lineage(s) in resident tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuchs and Segre, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wagers and Weissman, 2004</xref>). Although embryonic stem cells cultured ex vivo remain capable of producing a diversity of tissue types from different germ layers, such plasticity is typically lost from most somatic cells as development proceeds. In contrast, the planarian neoblast population is wholly responsible for the production of all differentiated cell types in these bilaterally symmetric, triploblastic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baguñà and Auladell, 1989</xref>). In fact, transplantation of a single neoblast into a stem cell deficient host was sufficient for rescue and long-term reconstitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>), confirming the pluripotency of planarian somatic stem cells. Despite longstanding discussion of the similarities between neoblasts and embryonic stem cells, a comparison explicitly stated in the original definition of the term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Randolph, 1892</xref>), the provenance of neoblasts during embryogenesis was unknown.</p><p>Neoblasts are abundant and widely distributed across the anteroposterior axis, occupying the parenchymal space surrounding the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reddien et al., 2005</xref>).

Mounting evidence suggests that the neoblast population contains pluripotent stem cells as well as cycling, lineage-primed progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reddien, 2013</xref>). Heterogeneous expression of developmental transcription factors (TFs) in neoblasts has been reported and likely reflects the diversity of lineage-primed progenitors within the compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cowles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Currie and Pearson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lapan and Reddien, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">März et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pearson and Sánchez Alvarado, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scimone et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p><italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> (<italic>Smed</italic>) freshwater flatworms are stable diploids that exist as two biotypes: asexual animals that reproduce by fission, and obligate cross-fertilizing hermaphrodites that reproduce sexually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Newmark et al., 2008</xref>). Both biotypes mount robust regeneration responses following amputation, and similarly rely on neoblasts for homeostatic maintenance and regeneration of all tissues. The asexual clonal line CIW4 (C4) has received the most scrutiny in studies examining the molecular mechanisms underlying regeneration, neoblast maintenance, pluripotency and lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2002</xref>). However, neoblasts are ever-present in C4 animals, precluding investigation of their developmental origin. Neither a normal table for <italic>Smed</italic> embryonic development nor functional studies have been reported.</p><p>Our work establishes <italic>Smed</italic> as a developmental model system and leverages the novel, unexploited context of embryogenesis to hone the molecular and operational definition of the planarian neoblast. We generated a molecular staging resource for <italic>Smed</italic> embryogenesis that associates unique gene expression signatures with chronological age, embryo morphology, representative images and written summaries of key developmental events to holistically describe and define prototypes for each stage. We also provide an atlas of molecular markers describing temporary embryonic tissue types and definitive organ system development.

Moreover, neoblasts perpetuate embryonic developmental programs during adulthood, where they are required for continued maintenance and rebuilding of tissues during homeostasis and regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A molecular staging series for <italic>Smed</italic> embryogenesis informed by single embryo RNA-Seq</title><p><italic>Smed</italic> flatworms are direct developers: newborn hatchlings grow and mature into adult worms without an intervening larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sánchez Alvarado, 2003</xref>).

As this is the first systematic characterization of <italic>Smed</italic> embryogenesis, we established an accurate and objective staging method based on unique gene expression signatures, cohorts of enriched transcripts identified through single embryo RNA-Seq , associated with chronological age and embryo morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). When appropriate, efforts were made to integrate and adapt extant staging schema from other planarian species.</p><p><italic>Smed</italic> embryos gestate for approximately two weeks at 20°C prior to hatching. We generated total RNA replicates from single <italic>Smed</italic> embryos for seven chronologically and/or morphologically distinct stages (S), S2-–S8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–I</xref>); S1 samples (zygotes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) were not queried by RNA-SSeq. Yolk (Y) replicates were prepared from egg capsules lacking developing embryos at 8 days post capsule deposition. In addition, single animal replicates were prepared from C4 and virgin sexually mature adults (SX). RNA-Seq libraries were analyzed for four biological replicates (i.e., four individuals) per stage (Materials and methods). Identification of appropriate reference(s) and normalization methods was challenging due to vast differences in sample composition and complexity among different stages. However, clustering of replicates and discrete separation of stages was seen in a multidimensional scaling plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Replicates for a given stage generally showed strong correlation among themselves despite not having controlled for differences in genetic background or embryo size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Notably the S2 and S3 replicates, generated from embryos undergoing sphere formation and nascent spheres, respectively, were intermingled in expression space, showed the greatest variability and few significant differences in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Discrete stages were retained due to apparent differences in embryo morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Similarities among S2 and S3 samples may be due to maternal RNA contribution or to difficulty detecting labile S2 embryos, such that only well-developed S2 embryos were prospected by RNA-Seq.</p><p>Two approaches were used to identify differentially expressed transcripts: pairwise comparisons of adjacent stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>)and comparisons of each stage relative to a mixed stage reference generated by averaging the read counts for the remaining replicates (Y, S2–S8) (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The goal of the pairwise comparisons was to identify transcripts with the starkest changes in expression in either direction, without constraints on transcript behavior at other points during embryogenesis. In contrast, the mixed stage reference comparisons maximized the likelihood of identifying transcripts exhibiting stage-specific expression, and only upregulated transcripts were analyzed. Stringent criteria were applied in both scenarios for flagging differentially expressed transcripts, including thresholds based on the Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value, fold-change, normalized RPKM expression level for time points, and identification of at least one open reading frame in the transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). More upregulated transcripts were identified in the mixed stage reference than in pairwise comparisons, perhaps due to increased sequencing depth of the averaged reference samples, which may enable more reliable detection of lowly expressed transcripts. Furthermore, identification of S2-enriched transcripts suggested that the whole embryo sequencing approach was sensitive enough to detect transcripts expressed in rare cell populations (i.e., blastomeres and differentiated cells making up the embryo proper). Non-redundant lists of upregulated transcripts, resulting from the union of the pairwise and mixed reference comparisons, served as molecular fingerprints for each time point for downstream analyses, including hierarchical clustering and GO analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

The ontogeny of the adult neoblast compartment can therefore be traced back to the <italic>piwi-1+</italic> zygote, which gives rise to anarchic, cycling <italic>piwi-1+</italic> blastomeres, some of which persist in the S3–S4 embryonic wall and establish pluripotent neoblasts and progenitor subpopulations during S5. The remarkable developmental plasticity of adult planarians is likely due to the singular ability of neoblasts to perpetuate and redeploy embryonic developmental programs.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21052.062</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Ontogeny of the adult neoblast compartment.</title><p>Asynchronously cycling <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cells fuel embryogenesis, giving rise to all temporary and definitive tissues.

The origin and regulation of cells that make regeneration possible are largely obscure. How similar or distinct developmental processes are during embryogenesis and regeneration remains to be determined. In fact, few experimental systems are available to study these issues systematically. Here, we lay the foundation for the formal comparison of molecular processes and gene functions during embryogenesis and regeneration in <italic>Smed,</italic> an organism uniquely suited to address the relationship between developmental plasticity and regeneration competency.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>S. mediterranea</italic>: a developmental system for comparative studies of embryogenesis and regeneration</title><p>To identify similarities and key differences between embryogenesis and regeneration, careful consideration must be given to distinctions in context, chronology, scope and type of regeneration (homeostatic or facultative), and to the ontogeny of effector cell type(s). Which aspects of embryonic development are recapitulated during regeneration, and which are context-specific? What factors influence the competency and extent of regenerative responses, and do these factors have embryonic origins? The workhorses of modern developmental biology, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. rerio</italic>, and <italic>M. musculus</italic> have limited, if any, regenerative potential during adulthood, precluding or severely limiting comparative inquiries. In contrast, <italic>Smed</italic> adults exhibit robust homeostatic and facultative regenerative potential, both neoblast-dependent phenomena that have largely been studied using a clonal, asexually reproducing strain. Neither descriptive nor functional studies of <italic>Smed</italic> embryogenesis have been reported.</p><p>We generated two foundational resources: a molecular staging series for <italic>Smed</italic> embryogenesis and an expression atlas describing temporary and definitive organ development. To investigate the embryonic origins of regeneration, we provide an ontogeny for the adult neoblast compartment. The molecular staging series facilitated the identification of embryonic predecessors of adult neoblast lineages and the developmental transition when neoblast specification occurs. Adult neoblast lineages, including pluripotent stem cells and lineage-primed progenitors, are established as definitive organogenesis begins. Neoblast lineages, required for organ formation during embryogenesis, persist into adulthood, where they are redeployed for homeostatic maintenance of all differentiated tissues, including the germline, and formation of missing tissues during regeneration. Moving forward, investigation of neoblast dynamics, particularly the regulation of self-renewal and commitment to differentiation, will be a central, unifying feature of comparative studies on organ formation, maintenance, repair and replacement.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Deciphering the origin and identity of neoblasts, agents of development, tissue homeostasis and regeneration</title><p>Unraveling the molecular mechanism of neoblast specification during embryogenesis will provide insight into the identity of adult pluripotent stem cells indispensible for homeostatic and facultative regeneration in planarians. Intensive efforts to define the term neoblast, and to characterize the presumed plurality of cell types within the asexual adult neoblast population, have generated numerous, unreconciled molecular and functional criteria. At present, gene expression signatures for neoblast subpopulations cannot be correlated with functional distinctions (should they exist) in self-renewal, pluripotency or cell fate restriction. It is not known whether hierarchical relationships exist between pluripotent cells and progenitors, whether cycling progenitors can dedifferentiate and/or interconvert, how stable subpopulations are over time, or when and how progenitors make an irreversible commitment to differentiation. Furthermore, preferred usage of <italic>Smed</italic> C4 asexual animals to classify and examine relationships among subpopulations precludes comprehensive examination of the lineage repertoire.</p><p>The expression of pluripotency factors is probably necessary, but not sufficient, for the assumption of neoblast fate. We report that many genes known to regulate adult asexual neoblast self-renewal and maintenance were expressed throughout embryogenesis, and showed that several of these genes were expressed throughout S3–S5 <italic>piwi-1+</italic> blastomeres. Functional differences between blastomeres and neoblasts were observed in heterochronic, heterotopic transplantation experiments. S4 and S5 embryonic donor cells were far less likely to persist and proliferate in stem cell deficient adult hosts than were embryonic donor cells harvested during S6 or later. Moreover, S5 embryonic donor cells did not rescue lethally irradiated hosts, whereas S6–S8 embryonic donor cells functioned like adult neoblasts and were capable of rescue. These results suggest that neoblast specification occurs during S5, and highlight the importance of cell-intrinsic changes in the blastomere to neoblast transition.</p><p>Differences in transplanted cell behavior correlated with large-scale changes in gene expression as definitive organogenesis began. EEE transcripts, uniquely expressed in blastomeres, are attractive candidates for repressors of neoblast fate, and/or effectors of molecular changes in blastomeres that are necessary for acquisition of neoblast fate. It is not known whether EEE transcript downregulation in blastomeres is necessary for neoblast specification, or whether expression of EEE transcripts and developmental TFs required for lineage specification are mutually exclusive. Further studies will determine whether and how maternal factors influence the early stages of <italic>Smed</italic> embryogenesis. Which EEE transcripts are maternally deposited, and which mechanisms effect maternal transcript degradation? When do wave(s) of zygotic genome activation occur, and how does zygotic genome activation in blastomeres relate to cell differentiation and neoblast specification? Additional factors, such as changes in chromatin state, may also correlate with or play a causative role in the blastomere to neoblast transition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The paradox of pattern formation: robustness of an anarchic, self-organizing system and its implications for understanding regeneration</title><p>Ectolecithal development and dispersed cleavage pose unique developmental challenges, making <italic>Smed</italic> embryogenesis a novel paradigm for regulative development. Herein, the collective pluripotency of an anarchic, cycling <italic>piwi-1+</italic> population generates the diversity of cell types required for the development of all temporary and definitive organ systems in these bilaterally symmetric, triploblastic animals. We showed that <italic>piwi-1+</italic> blastomeres are spatially disordered within the embryonic wall during S3–S4, and that dispersed epidermal, gut, muscle and neural progenitors arise within the blastomere population during S5. Further investigation is needed to understand how signals from differentiated tissues impact cell fate decisions within the <italic>piwi-1+</italic> blastomere compartment and effect progenitor cell migration, communication and interactions necessary to form organ rudiments.</p><p><italic>Smed</italic> embryogenesis provides a unique vantage point from which to investigate the origin, anatomical composition and signaling logic underlying the neoblast niche. During sphere formation, differentiating blastomeres must interact and self-assemble temporary embryonic tissues, providing structure to the embryo and establishing a microenvironment that promotes maintenance and expansion of <italic>piwi-1+</italic> blastomeres. In turn, blastomeres are likely to effect changes that are conducive to the establishment and/or maintenance of the neoblast population. Neoblast lineages are predicted to actively maintain their niche during the lifetime of the animal. Although the adult gastrovascular system has long been suspected of providing trophic support signals to neoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forsthoefel et al., 2012</xref>), the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Expansion of <italic>piwi-1+</italic> blastomeres correlates with that of an ill-defined embryonic gut population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s13">Figure 1—figure supplement 13A–D</xref>). Investigating gut development and gut communication with the <italic>piwi-1+</italic> population during embryogenesis may uncover key regulators of neoblast specification or regulators of neoblast dynamics that may similarly impact stem cell behavior during adulthood.</p><p>We report that many transcripts implicated in lineage commitment and classification of neoblast subclasses wereexpressed at low levels in early embryos and were dramatically upregulated as organogenesis began. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that neoblast heterogeneity is due to the presence of different subpopulations of cycling, lineage-primed progenitors within the compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reddien, 2013</xref>). It also suggests that organ formation during embryogenesis probably utilizes many of the same genetic regulatory networks and transition states elucidated during adult homeostasis and regeneration. Development of techniques to interrogate gene function during embryogenesis will enable us to identify master regulators of organogenesis for different tissues, and to address similarities and differences in their modes of action during embryogenesis and adulthood. Embryogenesis may also provide a vantage point for the identification of upstream activators for these developmental TFs, helping to address how diverse, dispersed patterns of gene activation arise in the blastomere and neoblast compartments.</p><p>The key distinction between embryogenesis and regeneration is the de novo formation of tissues in the former, and the presence of preexisting structures and signaling environments in the latter. Studies can now be performed to assess how tissues that are hypothesized to be instructive for regeneration are initially established during embryogenesis, and how the formation of these tissues relates to the acquisition of regenerative potential during development. For example, planarian body wall muscle is hypothesized to be required for the re-specification of axial identities during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Witchley et al., 2013</xref>). At present, technical limitations preclude tissue-specific knockdown experiments that would address requirements for polarity genes in muscle during regeneration. However, we can now address when and how the definitive axes are established during <italic>Smed</italic> embryogenesis, including the identification of tissues and signals that initially polarize embryos prior to the development of body wall muscle. Examining axis formation during embryogenesis, and comparing the process across different chronological and developmental contexts, may uncover roles for additional tissues and/or novel polarity regulators. Furthermore, we can address which developmental milestones and gene products are required to establish a state of regeneration competency in the embryo.</p><p>Sustained effort and continued investment in the adaptation and development of new technologies for the molecular interrogation of <italic>Smed</italic> embryogenesis will facilitate discoveries that may challenge long-held assumptions about developmental processes, including cell fate specification, pattern formation and adult stem cell regulation. Moreover, utilizing <italic>Smed</italic> for comparative studies of embryogenesis and regeneration presents an unprecedented opportunity for formal examination of the embryonic origins of regenerative potential.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Planaria culture and husbandry</title><p>Sexually reproducing <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> (<italic>Smed</italic>) stocks were descendants of animals collected in Sardinia by Dr. Maria Pala in 1999.

Reconstructed data sets were viewed in the Imaris software package, where they were cropped and masked to remove beads. Cell positions and the embryonic pharynx were marked manually using the 3D Spot Finder function, and the three-dimensional coordinates for marked cells were exported into excel for analysis of cell positions. Colocalization was determined manually on S3–S4 whole embryos, or on crop3D sections (100 µm X 200 µm X 100 µm) of S5 embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Cell position analysis on reconstructed SPIM images</title><p>Three-dimensional coordinates for <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cells or mitotic cells (<italic>piwi-1+,</italic> H3S10p+), the embryonic pharynx, and the embryo center were exported from SPIM reconstructions of S3 and S4 embryos. Spot positions collected in IMARIS were shifted and rotated in MATLAB to a coordinate system where the embryonic center was at the origin and the embryonic pharynx on the z-axis. Relative theta distribution likelihoods of the form (1-exp(-θ/θ’))*sin(θ) were calculated by assuming a θ’ and calculating the likelihood that such a distribution would produce the observed data by multiplying together the individual probabilities. The uncertainty in the best fit θ’’ was found by simulating several datasets, each with a number of cells equal to those observed in the actual data and having a dampening term of θ’’. For each dataset, the most likely θ’ was found, the standard deviation of which was taken to be the error in θ’’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Nanostring nCounter digital expression analysis</title><p>Total RNA samples from single embryos and adults (S2–S8, Y, C4 and SX; four biological replicates per sample) were prepared as described for single-animal RNA-Seq. 100 ng total RNA per sample was assayed on the Nanostring nCounter platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geiss et al., 2008</xref>) using a custom-made probe set.

Ten embryos were disrupted per cell suspension for S5, S6, S7 and S8, whereas 20–35 embryos were disrupted per S4 cell suspension. S4, S5 and S6 embryos were typically ‘eviscerated’ prior to pipetting by poking with an insect pin and gently squeezing out ingested yolk from the gut. Cell suspension volumes were adjusted to 1.0 mL before samples were filtered through 20 µm (all stages) and 10 µm (S5–S8) cell strainers (Partec CellTrics, Sysmex, 04-0042-2315 [20 µm], 04-0042-2314 [10 µm]) into low-retention microfuge tubes.

(2011</xref>). Hosts were immobilized on a cold peltier plate, ventral side up, and cells were injected into the tail stripe (i.e., the medial, post-pharyngeal parenchymal space between the two posterior branches of the intestine). Hosts were injected at 1 day post-irradiation (dpi) for rescue experiments and at 3 dpi for short-term experiments. Transplanted animals and uninjected, 6,000-Rad-irradiated hosts for rescue experiments were maintained individually in 3 cm petri dishes at 20°C in the dark, with water exchanges and visual inspection of animals performed every 2–3 days. Transplanted animals slated for fixation were reared in 10 cm petri dishes, with 10 or fewer animals per dish, with water exchanges every 2–3 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Online data repository</title><p>Original data underlying this manuscript can be accessed from the Stowers Original Data Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stowers.org/research/publications/libpb-1086">http://www.stowers.org/research/publications/libpb-1086</ext-link></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the SIMR Planaria Core Facility MS Merryman, D Baumann, C Abrams, K Evans, J Thaden, J Theis and A Vogelslang for their invaluable assistance with planarian husbandry.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Diana Laird (Reviewer #2); Peter W Reddien (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. All reviewers agree on the importance of the work and the changes asked for can be addressed by making changes to the manuscript.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Davies and colleagues investigate the developmental origins of adult pluripotent stem cells (neoblasts) in the planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic>. The authors provide a comprehensive characterization of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> embryogenesis by meticulously cataloguing (with corresponding gene expression data and expression mapping) the different stages of embryonic development. This groundwork allowed the authors to ask when neoblasts originate during embryogenesis. The authors demonstrate that neoblasts arise from anarchic, cycling <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ cells, which generate all temporary and definitive tissues/organs during embryonic development. Interestingly, early embryonic <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ cells have a distinct molecular signature from neoblasts. Unlike neoblasts, which express transcription factors (TFs) important for development, early embryonic <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ cells express &quot;early embryo enriched&quot; (EEE) transcripts. Later in embryogenesis when organogenesis initiates, EEE transcripts are downregulated while various developmental TFs are upregulated. Strikingly, in an elegant set of transplantation experiments, the authors demonstrate that <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ cells are functionally different at different embryonic stages. Similar to transplanted adult neoblasts, transplanted <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ cells from embryos undergoing organogenesis can rescue lethally irradiated planarians that are devoid of neoblasts, whereas, early EEEhi/TFlo <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ cells cannot.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Usually for minor revisions, we make a summary of the reviewers' comments, but in this case, the majority of questions raised are regarding lack of clarity in the manuscript and the complexity of data presentation. So we are including the detailed comments below. All of these can be addressed by rewriting the manuscript making it more accessible to readers. Also, below I paste an exchange between the reviewers during the post review session:</p><p>&quot; I did want to address one point raised by two other reviewers, which I think reflects the way in which the data presentation could be improved. Both raised concerns about the transplant experiments that were easy to miss because some of the key results were buried in the supplement.</p><p>The &quot;no transplant&quot; control is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>. As expected (and shown previously) no planarians survive irradiation. Figure 7—figure supplement 2 shows <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ cell counts. In panel B the authors show the percentage of transplants with <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ cells at 1 hpt (directly after transplantation), which indicates that &quot;the cell injection technique was robust and reliable&quot;. Panel C shows the number of <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ cells per transplant at 1 hpt. For example, in Figure 7—figure supplement 2, one can see that comparable numbers of <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ cells were transplanted from S5 and S6 embryos (1 hpt) but at 5 dpt, very few to zero <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ cells remain from S5 donors compared to S6 (panel E). Furthermore, irradiated hosts transplanted with S5 <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ donor cells are not rescued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The authors mention these data in the text (subsection “Embryos undergoing organogenesis contain cells with cNeoblast activity”), but it might be helpful to the reader if these data were in the main figure and not buried in the supplement. Furthermore, some of the panels can be merged (for example the 1 hpt and 5 dpt <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ cell transplants) so that it is easier for the reader to compare the data. &quot;</p><p>As you can see, the reviewers, as much as they admired the science, were confused by the presentation. So, please make the paper a bit more lucid for the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>This impressive body of work will be a valuable resource to planarian biologists. To make the manuscript accessible to a broader audience and more manageable for readers in general, here are some editing suggestions that should be addressed before publication:</p><p>1) To appeal to the broader <italic>eLife</italic> audience, the authors should provide more description/context in the main text to help non-experts understand the results presented. This includes data the authors deem not essential for the narrative of the paper and is found in Supplementary Online Material instead of the main text. For example, sphere formation (subsection “Anarchic, cycling <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ blastomeres fuel Smed embryonic development”) is not defined in the main text, but is described in the SOM as beginning during Stage 2. Furthermore, the distinction between temporary and definitive embryonic organs may not be entirely clear to non-expert readers. The authors do a better job describing this uncommon developmental phenomenon in the SOM (e.g., &quot;The embryonic pharynx degenerates during S6, as the definitive pharynx primordium develops beneath it. Embryonic pharynx markers are no longer detectable by S7&quot;).</p><p>2) Throughout the manuscript, the authors are urged to present figures in the order they are referred to in the text. Looking up figures (and multiple Supplements) that are &quot;out of order&quot; is cumbersome, especially when considering the sheer volume of data the reader must go through. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1—figure supplement 12</xref> is referred to twice in the text (Results section) before any of the other <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> supplements. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1—figure supplement 12</xref> should be designated as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> (and all other <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> supplements renumbered accordingly thereafter). Also, having two sets of differently named supplemental data (Figure X—figure supplement Y, which is per the journal's style, and Supplementary Online Figure Z, which appears not to be) makes navigating supplementary material unnecessarily difficult for the reader.</p><p>3) Introduction section: Remove the extensive discussion of results from the Introduction. This will also help shorten the overall length of the paper.</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>Davies et all provide the first comprehensive description of <italic>Smed</italic> embryos at a molecular and anatomic level. This is not trivial given that <italic>S. med</italic> broods its embryos and the authors should be congratulated for this Herculean task. They specifically ask whether neoblasts that have been well studied in the adult planarian exist during embryogenesis and conclude that a cycling <italic>piwi1</italic>+ precursor population gives rise to organs as well as neoblasts, but is distinct on a molecular level as well as functionally in transplantation assays. Although important for the field, the following issues should be addressed:</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1) Overall, the accessibility and readability for a generalist journal as this one should be increased. This can be accomplished by presuming less prior knowledge about planaria in the Results section and structuring the writing with summary statements at the end of each section in the Results. It might suggest that authors provide a succinct table with morphological criteria for embryo staging as well as key genes expression changes, accompanied with cartoons.</p><p>2) Would it be possible to resolve S2 and S3 by growing the animals at a lower temperature?</p><p>3) ISH studies need sense controls. Specifically, in later stages (S6-8), it is unclear whether some of the signal for <italic>piwi1</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> could result from probe trapping or non-specific staining in the testes and ovary ducts.</p><p>4) Subsection “Progenitors for definitive lineages arise within <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ blastomeres as organogenesis commences” refers to data presumably not shown demonstrating that ~4% of cells expressing PIWI1 by immunostaining at S5 do not harbor <italic>piwi1</italic> transcript, and suggest that the protein perdures after transcript degradation upon differentiation. Can the authors please clarify whether all <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ cells expressed PIWI1 protein in the embryos?</p><p>5) My main concern with the authors conclusions lies in the transplant studies. Can the authors please estimate how many cells were transplanted, or how many embryo equivalents. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> should show a no transplant control (which presumably will not contribute) as well as cNeoblast control from adult (which will presumably contribute more robustly than the embryos). The authors need to demonstrate that <italic>piwi</italic>+ cells and structures rescued following irradiation are donor-derived, as this will dismiss the possibility that the blastomere graft rejuvenates host cells; this can be accomplished genetically by the phenotype of regenerated structures as well as by using a marker such as PKH26 of the donor cells.</p><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>Davies et al. present a molecular, cellular, and morphological study of planarian (<italic>S. mediterranea</italic>) embryogenesis. They report a molecular resource of stage-enriched genes useful for staging embryos and for studying gene function in embryogenesis, including the discovery of embryo-enriched planarian gene expression. They show that <italic>piwi</italic>+ cells are present throughout embryogenesis, but that lineages for adult tissues only develop within this <italic>piwi</italic>+ population at a particular stage (S5). Interestingly, in transplant experiments, clonogenic (colony-forming) neoblast activity also develops at a particular stage, approximately when lineages appear. The manuscript is an impressive body of work and well written. This paper will be an important landmark in the study of embryogenesis and its comparison to regeneration in planarians.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>&quot;Neoblast subpopulations established during embryogenesis persist into adulthood&quot;</p><p>Subpopulations may not persist as subpopulations, rather continuously generated. Since the renewal capacity of subpopulations is unknown, different wording is suggested.</p><p>Results section:</p><p>&quot;seven morphologically distinct stages (S), S2-S8&quot; were selected for sequencing. Panels D-F contain embryos that look superficially similar; thus it would be helpful for the authors to further describe at this point in the text the criteria for stage separation in the sequencing experiment (I assume time of development was also a factor?).</p><p>&quot;pairwise comparisons of adjacent time points&quot;</p><p>These aren't really &quot;time points&quot;, since stages overlap in timing. Different wording is suggested.</p><p>Assessment of most statements of data in the text is difficult, because each one requires a goose chase through excel tables, main figures, figure supplements, and online-only figures. Some items called out as figure supplements are not figures but tables with titles different than their figure supplement title. Take subsection “Anarchic, cycling <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ blastomeres fuel Smed embryonic development”, for example; this single sentence refers to 4 panels in 2 main figures, 4 Figure supplements, and 3 supplementary online figures. I tried to find <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> to look at the markers for all known and restricted embryonic cell populations and eventually gave up…</p><p>Paragraph four in subsection “Anarchic, cycling <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ blastomeres fuel Smed embryonic development”. The paragraph could use a concluding sentence to clarify message.</p><p>Similarly, the point of &quot;…sample sizes, the optimal θ' was calculated to be 0.58 +/- 0.33,and was 50-fold more likely to explain the observed trend than a simple normal distribution.&quot; is not clear.</p><p>Last paragraph of the subsection: restriction of cell cycle activity to <italic>piwi</italic>+ cells in adults should reference the <italic>piwi</italic>-1 2005 paper and could also reference Wagner 2011, which had further analysis of this marker for all dividing cells.</p><p>Figure 4—figure supplement 2 Y12 data is interesting, but only S4 staining is apparent. If it is not present in <italic>piwi</italic>+ cells at earlier stages this merits display. The chromatoid body presence could also be considered for a main figure.</p><p>Subsection “Early embryo enriched transcripts expressed throughout <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ blastomeres are downregulated as organogenesis begins”. Naming clusters &quot;6&quot; &quot;5&quot; can be deciphered from examination from the figure, but is not immediately clear what these are when reading the text. i.e., individual of the multiple clusters of S2-S4-enriched txts that showed downregulation at S5 and thereafter.</p><p>The third paragraph in this section presents analysis of expression of the interesting EEE genes. However, the main messages/synthesis is hard to decipher because of the distracting links out to disparate files/figure locations. The narrative/text feels beholden to a set of files and figures as opposed to the other way around.</p><p>More discussion of the EEE genes that are expressed broadly in the embryo would be of interest. What types of genes were discovered?</p><p>Reviewer #4</p><p>This manuscript contains a large amount of information, much of it contained in supplementary materials. It is an important piece of work, because (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) it addresses the expression of genes on a genome wide scale during the development of a planarian flatworm; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2</xref>) it addresses the origin and development of neoblasts.</p><p>That being said, in its current form, the manuscript is very difficult to digest. The writing is long (section 5 of the Results alone has 6.5 pages!) and &quot;windy: (see example given for section 2 below), and there are some fundamental questions that are either not addressed, or the answers are &quot;hidden&quot; in the long narrative.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>The Introduction is long and detailed on many aspects of neoblast biology, but at the same time unclear and lacking in other aspects. Generally, I am often not sure whether the authors talk about facts known from previous studies, or are already highlighting the findings to be reported in this paper.</p><p>Suggestion: shorten the intro by at least 50%. After (in a briefer format than now) summarizing known functions and types of neoblasts in adults/regeneration, summarize literature (as far as it exists) regarding</p><p>-embryogenesis in planarians (see below; the statements about embryogenesis that are now found in section 2 of the Results should be in the Introduction)</p><p>-specifically, what is said in the literature where/when do neoblasts first appear in embryos (there will probably not be a lot of published information; one example is Ramachandra et al., 1999, on embryonic BrdU -positive presumed neoblasts in an Acoel).</p><p>-proliferation, migration, differentiation of neoblasts during embryonic period.</p><p>Results</p><p>Section 1: surveys molecular staging; stages themselves described in supplementary table and figures. This is a useful and important work of reference for the planarian developmental field.</p><p>Please highlight in the text:</p><p>-what in terms of morphogenesis and organogenesis is novel compared to the previous embryological study of <italic>Schmidtea polychroa</italic> (Cardona et al)</p><p>-how do stages utilized here (1-8) differ from the 8 previously introduced ones</p><p>-what does molecular profiling add to defining stages (clearer temporal distinction?..)</p><p>Section 2 – “Anarchic, cycling <italic>piwi</italic>-1+ blastomeres fuel Smed embryonic development”</p><p>The section describes the expression pattern of <italic>piwi</italic>, and concludes that the gene is restricted to undifferentiated cells. The text is very difficult to read. Different types of information are intermingled. For example, paragraph two summarizes a result known from the literature. Talks about general expression patterns of non-specified transcripts, documented only in the supplementary material, in differentiating cells. later in the paragraph you speak to the point: <italic>piwi</italic> is expressed in undifferentiated cells in the bodywall at the S3 stage. But how does the pan-nuclear marker EF1a-like 1 show that, since this marker appears to be expressed in all cells (including the <italic>piwi</italic>-positive ones)? The final sentences again talk about findings from the previous literature.</p><p>I suggest to remove all references to the previous literature from this (Results) section; put them in the Introduction, and in the Results focus on where exactly <italic>piwi</italic> is expressed. Specifically:</p><p>Paragraphs 1-2</p><p>-DAPI shows large number of labeled dots: are these all nuclei of blastomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, C</xref>)?</p><p>-if so, only a small subset of blastomeres expresses <italic>piwi</italic> (2A): how would one characterize distribution? Clustered, around embryonic pharynx?</p><p>-Paragraph 2: sounds like <italic>piwi</italic> is downregulated in many cells. What is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) is that from beginning, <italic>piwi</italic> is expressed in only few blastomeres (if DAPI really reflects all nuclei). Is there an earlier stage with many more <italic>piwi</italic>+ cells?</p><p>-the pattern and dynamics of <italic>piwi</italic> in undifferentiated cells (&quot;blastomeres&quot;) remains a bit vague. Is the pattern the following: stage 1, before embryonic transient cells differentiate: all cells express <italic>piwi</italic>stage 2/3: as embryonic cells differentiate, they lose <italic>piwi</italic>; ALL other cells retain it later stages: as adult cells become postmitotic, they lose <italic>piwi</italic>; ALL other cells retain it</p><p>I don't think this is what happens. But the authors do not make it clear in text and figures what exactly happens. I assume that only a small subset of undifferentiated cells express <italic>piwi</italic>. I understand that these are distributed. This information needs to be settled; it is one of the crucial pieces of data required in subsequent sections (see comments below).</p><p>Section 3 reports that genes sets known to be associated with adult neoblasts are also expressed in the embryo. This is an important finding. The main question is:</p><p>-are these genes, in the embryo (e.g., S4, S5, S6), restricted to <italic>piwi</italic>+ cells?</p><p>-are they restricted to ALL undifferentiated cells (assuming that not all undifferentiated cells are <italic>piwi</italic>+; see my questions/comments above)</p><p>-are they also expressed in cells that stop dividing and differentiate?</p><p>I was not able to find a clear answer to these questions in the text.</p><p>Section 4 Early embryonic genes (EEE)</p><p>I don't understand the message of this section. One reason for confusion arises right at the beginning:</p><p>- in the opening lines the authors talk about &quot;S2-S4 enriched transcripts expressed throughout the <italic>piwi</italic> blastomere population&quot;.</p><p>- then the authors introduce the 1048 EEE genes: are these the same as above (i.e., they are expressed in the <italic>piwi</italic> blastomere population)?</p><p>- because, if they are: why do <italic>piwi</italic> (undifferentiated) blastomeres and differentiated (transient embryonic cells) express the same set of genes? I thought from the previous sections (and on general grounds) that as cells become postmitotic and differentiate, they switch on different genetic programs.</p><p>Section 5</p><p>It is shown that gene sets associated with specific differentiated cell types are upregulated around stage 5, which is important, but expected, since it confirms the observation that cells differentiate (structurally) at this stage.</p><p>The main claim of the heading of this section (that progenitors of specific cell types arise WIHIN the <italic>piwi</italic>-positive population) needs to be demonstrated, and/or described more clearly (see questions to section 2 above)</p><p>Section 6</p><p>Cell suspensions derived from embryos at different stages (S5-S8) were injected into irradiated adults, and were able to rescue them. This is also an important experiment. A puzzling finding was that cells from S5 embryos were unable to rescue. Is it possible that S5 embryos did not have a high enough density of <italic>piwi</italic>+ cells to do the job? Is it possible to get a value for the number of <italic>piwi</italic>+ cells present in an aliquot of the cell suspension from different stage embryos?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21052.064</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic></p><p><italic>This impressive body of work will be a valuable resource to planarian biologists.

Care has been taken to eliminate unnecessary specialist vocabulary and to clearly define terms as they are introduced. We shortened the Introduction, eliminating the extensive summary of our results. In addition, we emphasized the foundational resources, key results and conceptual breakthroughs stemming from our work. We added two new paragraphs to the start of the Results section, intended to give readers a crash course in freshwater flatworm embryology. We define necessary terminology and introduce key concepts, like direct development, ectolecithal embryos, dispersed cleavage, temporary embryonic tissues and definitive tissues. We reorganized <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>, respectively) and rewrote the associated text and Figure Legends; we also rewrote much of the text accompanying <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. To aid readers, we reorganized all of the supplemental data so that items are noted chronologically in the text. Supplementary files were broken down into supplemental figures, source data and rich media files. We hope this encourages readers to delve into the wealth of data provided with our manuscript. In addition, we generated an online searchable resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://planosphere.stowers.org">https://planosphere.stowers.org</ext-link>) that houses the Molecular Staging Series and Molecular Fate Mapping Atlas. This resource, hosted by the Stowers Institute, will be freely available upon publication and will reference our published manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Throughout the manuscript, the authors are urged to present figures in the order they are referred to in the text. Looking up figures (and multiple Supplements) that are &quot;out of order&quot; is cumbersome, especially when considering the sheer volume of data the reader must go through. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1—figure supplement 12</xref> is referred to twice in the text (Results section) before any of the other <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> supplements. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1—figure supplement 12</xref> should be designated as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> (and all other <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> supplements renumbered accordingly thereafter). Also, having two sets of differently named supplemental data (Figure X —figure supplement Y, which is per the journal's style, and Supplementary Online Figure Z, which appears not to be) makes navigating supplementary material unnecessarily difficult for the reader.</italic></p><p>To make it easier for readers to navigate through the extensive amount of supplemental data associated with our manuscript, we reorganized and renamed the supplemental data files as suggested by reviewer #1. Figure supplement, source data and rich media files were renamed to reflect the order they are referred to in the text. Large excel tables are now listed as “source data” files; SPIM movies are listed as “rich media” files. In addition, the Molecular Fate Mapping Atlas, formerly the Supplementary Online Material and Supplementary Online <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>, are now labeled as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Figure 1—source data 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplements 11</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s19">19</xref>. This was done to consolidate the supplementary data, and to eliminate the confusion created by having “figure supplements” and “Supplementary Online Material.”</p><p><italic>3) Introduction section: Remove the extensive discussion of results from the Introduction.

This can be accomplished by presuming less prior knowledge about planaria in the Results section and structuring the writing with summary statements at the end of each section in the Results. It might suggest that authors provide a succinct table with morphological criteria for embryo staging as well as key genes expression changes, accompanied with cartoons.</italic></p><p>We revised the manuscript to make it more accessible to a general audience, and detailed the changes made in this regard in our response to reviewer #1. To facilitate use of this staging system by others, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://planosphere.stowers.org">http://planosphere.stowers.org</ext-link> provides cartoons, time (days post-egg capsule deposition), gene expression data (RNA-Seq and WISH), and written descriptions of embryo morphology for each of the stages queried.</p><p><italic>2) Would it be possible to resolve S2 and S3 by growing the animals at a lower temperature?</italic></p><p>Early S2 embryos undergoing sphere formation are quite fragile and are difficult to detect in live, unstained samples; it’s doubtful that simply lowering the temperature would make these samples easier to find. We are interested in performing gene expression profiling on oocytes, zygotes and early S2 embryos in the future. Laser capture microdissection, performed on fixed tissue stained with a nuclear dye, may be the best route to obtaining tissue for S2 and earlier stages. It is possible that injection of vital dye into oocytes, and/or EdU incorporation into oocytes or early blastomeres, would enable us to identify tissue for RNA-Seq in live samples, and to do lineage tracing studies. We are interested in identifying maternal RNAs contributed to oocytes, the onset of zygotic transcription – which is likely quite early (<italic>i.e.,</italic> before we started our RNA-Seq time course), and determining when the first asymmetries in gene expression occur among the blastomeres. These experiments and are future directions for us.</p><p><italic>3) ISH studies need sense controls. Specifically, in later stages (S6-8), it is unclear whether some of the signal for piwi1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> could result from probe trapping or non-specific staining in the testes and ovary ducts.</italic></p><p>Hematoxylin and eosin staining is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, not in situ hybridization data. <italic>piwi-1</italic> expression, shown first in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, always shows specific expression in parenchymal cells. It is unlikely that the <italic>piwi-1+</italic> signal is nonspecifically trapped in the reproductive system during S6-S8, since the testes, ovaries and somatic gonadal tissue are absent from S8 newborn hatchlings and arise weeks later during juvenile development. Incidentally, we detect <italic>nanos</italic> expression by WISH during S6-S8, in increasing numbers of cells with a noted dorsolateral bias and in the developing eyes (S7-S8). Our suspicion is that the dorsolaterally positioned cells are likely <italic>piwi-1+, nanos+</italic> primordial germ cells; we have not followed up on this point yet, and would need to costain with additional PGC markers as well. Consistent with our WISH results, <italic>nanos</italic> expression was undetectable by RNA-Seq until S5, and was lowly expressed in S5-S8 embryos.</p><p><italic>4) Subsection “Progenitors for definitive lineages arise within piwi-1+ blastomeres as organogenesis commences” refers to data presumably not shown demonstrating that ~4% of cells expressing PIWI1 by immunostaining at S5 do not harbor piwi1 transcript, and suggest that the protein perdures after transcript degradation upon differentiation. Can the authors please clarify whether all piwi-1+ cells expressed PIWI1 protein in the embryos?</italic></p><p>Yes, <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cells also express PIWI-1 protein (99 +/- 0.4% <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cells were double positive for PIWI-1 protein, n= 4,152 <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cells scored, n= 4 S5 embryos). We amended the text to report this result and created a new figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6 —figure supplement 1</xref>, containing representative images. The quantification you requested is present in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6 —figure supplement 1</xref> legend. The revised main manuscript text is included in our comments to reviewer #1.</p><p><italic>5) My main concern with the authors conclusions lies in the transplant studies. Can the authors please estimate how many cells were transplanted, or how many embryo equivalents. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> should show a no transplant control (which presumably will not contribute) as well as cNeoblast control from adult (which will presumably contribute more robustly than the embryos). The authors need to demonstrate that piwi+ cells and structures rescued following irradiation are donor-derived, as this will dismiss the possibility that the blastomere graft rejuvenates host cells; this can be accomplished genetically by the phenotype of regenerated structures as well as by using a marker such as PKH26 of the donor cells.</italic></p><p>We reorganized the presentation of the cell transplantation data and revised the associated text extensively to bring out some of the key points formerly house in the supplemental material. The transplantation experiments are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and 8. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, we show quantification for the number of <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cells per host at 1 hour and 5 days post-transplant. We show that comparable numbers of S5, S6, S7 and S8 cells are injected per host; an average injection generally delivers between 50-100 embryonic <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cells into the tail. We detail how the embryonic cell suspensions were prepared in the Materials and methods. We are able to get far fewer S4 embryonic cells injected per host, which was expected since far fewer <italic>piwi-1+</italic> blastomeres are present during S4 versus later stages. The S4 results represent our best efforts to concentrate as many embryo equivalents as possible while minimizing volume of the cell suspension.</p><p>We provide scoring data for “no transplant control” data in the text for both sets of transplantation experiments.</p><p>We did not run transplantation experiments using adult neoblast enriched fractions as a positive control. We concede that the side by side comparison would be nice to see, though not necessary. There were two reasons for this: 1) We strongly suspected that S8 embryonic cells would rescue since animals at this stage regenerate following amputation (our unpublished observation). The regeneration capacity, coupled with the distribution of <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cells in S8 embryos, suggested strongly to us that upon hatching juvenile worms possess neoblasts. Had we not achieved reproducible rescue results with S8 embryonic donor cells, we certainly would have pursued adult neoblast injection experiments. 2) The published cell transplantation papers used C4 asexual adult animals as donors. Differences in transplanted cell behavior using C4 animals and embryos as donors could arguably be attributed to differences in biotype. While sexually mature adult donor tissue has been shown to rescue in plug graft experiments, we presently don’t have a cell sorting protocol for neoblast isolation from sexually mature adults. Our cell sorting protocols are based on DNA content, as well as cell size and morphology; we would expect our neoblast enriched fraction to be contaminated with dividing germline stem cells and transit amplifying germ cells. This would not be insignificant, given that adults possess roughly 100 testes.</p><p>Lethally irradiated adults are capable of wound healing, mount an acute transcriptional response to wounding, and transiently reorganize expression domains of key polarity genes along the A-P axis of the fragment. However, these animals never generate a blastema or regenerate new tissue. None of the lethally irradiated, uninjected sexual adult hosts survived long-term, nor did they mount a regenerative response (e.g., head blastema formation) prior to lysing. The most parsimonious explanation for our results is that engrafted, proliferating, donor-derived <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cells contributed differentiating progeny that subsequently mounted the observed regenerative response in rescue animals. We have seen production of post-mitotic, definitive epidermal progenitors in S5 donor cell transplants (<italic>NB.21.11e+</italic> and <italic>AGAT-1+</italic> cells) at 10 dpt (13 dpi); these definitive epidermal progenitors were present in the tail parenchyma in the neighborhood of <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cells. Moreover, <italic>NB.21.11e+</italic> and <italic>AGAT-1+</italic> cells are irreversibly eliminated by lethal irradiation within 5 dpi, suggesting that the cells present in S5 transplanted hosts at 10 dpt (13 dpi) differentiated from donor-derived <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cells. Additional transplant experiments would be required to examine production of differentiating progeny for other lineages. SNPs could be assessed in donor and transplanted hosts after long-term reconstitution; however, this would require using genetically defined lines for embryonic donor cells, which we did not do for these experiments. We agree that using vital membrane dyes to track donor cells would be a good way of assessing donor versus host contribution following transplantation, and will pursue this suggestion in the future.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic></p><p><italic>[…]Abstract:</italic> </p><p><italic>&quot;Neoblast subpopulations established during embryogenesis persist into adulthood&quot;</italic> </p><p><italic>Subpopulations may not persist as subpopulations, rather continuously generated.

The rewritten text is as follows:</p><p>“To determine which cell types express EEE transcripts, and to examine spatiotemporal changes in EEE transcript expression, colorimetric WISH was performed on S2-S8 embryos and intact C4 adults (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13-data">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>). Some EEE transcripts were expressed exclusively in differentiated temporary embryonic tissues. <italic>VAL-like, MPEG1-like-1, MPEG1-like-2,</italic> and <italic>netrin-like</italic> were solely expressed in the temporary embryonic pharynx until S6, while <italic>gelsolin-like</italic> and <italic>4XLIM-like</italic> were expressed in both the primitive ectoderm and temporary embryonic pharynx during S3-S4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13-data">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1 —figure supplements 11D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">12C-G</xref>).

Some of these transcripts may be maternally deposited, albeit we cannot ascertain the relative contribution(s) of maternal and zygotic expression from our RNA-Sequencing data. Expression of these EEE transcripts diminished greatly by S5, with moderate and lowly expressed EEE transcripts becoming undetectable; specific expression of robustly expressed transcripts sometimes persisted until S6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13-data">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>). Consistent with the RNA-Seq and Nanostring nCounter results, EEE transcript expression was not detected by colorimetric WISH in S7, S8 embryos or C4 adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13-data">Figure 5 – source data 3</xref>).

Intriguingly, EEE transcript expression often decayed quicker in differentiated cells than undifferentiated blastomeres, raising the possibility that regulation of EEE transcription and/or transcript stability may vary by cell type. While robust expression of many EEE transcripts was detected in blastomeres during S3-S4, EEE transcript expression in temporary embryonic tissues was present during S3 and drastically diminished by S4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13-data">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>).</p><p>EEE transcripts expressed throughout the undifferentiated <italic>piwi-1+</italic> blastomere population in S3-S4 embryos are downregulated as definitive organogenesis begins during S5.

The EEE transcripts that were specifically expressed in temporary embryonic tissues clustered with those that showed pan-embryonic expression during S3, followed by blastomere-specific expression during S4; that may confound attempts to hypothesize much based on the annotations alone. Roughly a third of the EEE transcripts have no BLASTx hit versus the NR or Swiss-Prot databases, and are considered novel; we have done little to pursue these candidates. Of the candidates that have BLASTx-based annotations, many appear to be involved in translational control and proteostasis; these candidates superficially appear similar to the types of maternally deposited transcripts present in other organisms, but of course we cannot confirm or refute that connection at this point.

Mature gut progenitors arise at this stage, but the gastrodermal cells lining the intestinal cavity do not express these markers. While we agree that more blastomeres, and hence more mitotic cells are present during S5 than earlier stages, our analysis of the mitotic index for the blastomere compartment suggests that the S3-S5 <italic>Smed</italic> blastomeres divide at a constant rate, arguing gainst the “mitotic burst” phenomenon described in <italic>Spol</italic> references.</p><p><italic>Smed</italic> Stage 6-8/<italic>Spol</italic> Stages 6-8 (Cardona et al. 2005): these stages are superficially similar, though distinctions in timing and morphology may be present for different definitive organ systems mentioned.</p><p><italic>Smed</italic> Stage 6-7/Stage 5 (Martin-Duran et al. 2010): Elongation may occur, on average, much sooner in <italic>Spol</italic> embryos than <italic>Smed</italic> embryos.</p><p><italic>Smed</italic> Stage 7-8/Stage 7 (Martin-Duran et al. 2010): Definitive organ development and maturation may occur, on average, much sooner in <italic>Spol</italic> embryos than <italic>Smed</italic> embryos.</p><p>It would certainly be possible to conduct similar expression profiling studies in <italic>Spol</italic> and/or other freshwater planarian embryos, and/or to examine spatiotemporal changes in expression patterns during embryogenesis for homologs of the markers we present in this publication.

Our RNA-Sequencing data underscores the profound developmental transition between Stages 4 and 5, one that is not readily apparent by changes in morphology alone. We were also able to identify new classes of embryo enriched transcripts which were not anticipated from previous studies. Moreover, the gene expression signatures for each stage provide a wealth of candidates for novel tissue and/or stage specific markers and putative genetic regulators whose function(s) will be assessed in future studies.</p><p><italic>Section 2 – “Anarchic, cycling piwi-1+ blastomeres fuel Smed embryonic development”</italic> </p><p><italic>The section describes the expression pattern of piwi, and concludes that the gene is restricted to undifferentiated cells. The text is very difficult to read. Different types of information are intermingled. For example, paragraph two summarizes a result known from the literature. Talks about general expression patterns of non-specified transcripts, documented only in the supplementary material, in differentiating cells. later in the paragraph you speak to the point: piwi is expressed in undifferentiated cells in the bodywall at the S3 stage. But how does the pan-nuclear marker EF1a-like 1 show that, since this marker appears to be expressed in all cells (including the piwi-positive ones)?</italic></p><p>The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> was reorganized with <italic>EF1a-like-1</italic> expression depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-B</xref>, and <italic>piwi-1</italic> expression depicted thereafter. The text was revised to clarify some of the important points brought up by reviewers #1 and #4. The first paragraph of the section, “An anarchic, cycling <italic>piwi-1+</italic> blastomeres fuel <italic>Smed</italic> embryonic development,” describes the <italic>EF1a-like-1</italic> expression in S2 and S3 embryos, and includes detailed descriptions of embryonic cell types and architecture. <italic>EF1a-like-1</italic> is a pan-embryonic marker, meaning that it is expressed in differentiated temporary embryonic tissues (the primitive ectoderm, the temporary embryonic pharynx, the primitive gut) and the undifferentiated blastomeres located in the embryonic wall (the parenchymal space between the primitive ectoderm and endoderm) of S3 embryos. <italic>EF1a-like-1</italic> is not expressed in yolk cells. Yolk cells are present in the embryonic wall along with the blastomeres; these cells have very small, condensed sytox green+ nuclei. Ingested yolk is also present in the primitive gut cavity. Blastomere nuclei are larger, with diffuse sytox green signal (likely due to the decondensed nature of the chromatin), are easily distinguished from yolk cell nuclei in the embryonic wall. In addition, the blastomere nuclei are readily distinguished from primitive ectodermal nuclei by sytox green staining; latter are stretched and sit at the surface of the sphere. We are confident that the combination of <italic>EF1a-like-1</italic> and nuclear staining makes allows for unambiguous identification of undifferentiated blastomeres in the embryonic wall of S3 embryos. <italic>Piwi-1</italic> expression was always restricted to, and expressed throughout, the undifferentiated blastomere compartment of S3 embryos in <italic>EF1a-like-1, piwi-1</italic> costaining experiments. Quantification is provided in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> legend.</p><p><italic>The final sentences again talk about findings from the previous literature.</italic></p><p><italic>I suggest to remove all references to the previous literature from this (Results) section; put them in the Introduction, and in the Results focus on where exactly piwi is expressed. Specifically:</italic></p><p><italic>Paragraphs 1-2</italic></p><p><italic>-DAPI shows large number of labeled dots: are these all nuclei of blastomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, C</xref>)?</italic></p><p><italic>-if so, only a small subset of blastomeres expresses piwi (2A): how would one characterize distribution?

At present we cannot comment on the distribution of the blastomeres during S2 as the embryos undergo sphere formation; that would require costaining with additional markers specific for the temporary embryonic tissues.</p><p><italic>-Paragraph 2: sounds like piwi is downregulated in many cells. What is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) is that from beginning, piwi is expressed in only few blastomeres (if DAPI really reflects all nuclei). Is there an earlier stage with many more piwi+ cells?</italic></p><p><italic>-the pattern and dynamics of piwi in undifferentiated cells (&quot;blastomeres&quot;) remains a bit vague. Is the pattern the following: stage 1, before embryonic transient cells differentiate: all cells express piwistage 2/3: as embryonic cells differentiate, they lose piwi; ALL other cells retain itlater stages: as adult cells become postmitotic, they lose piwi; ALL other cells retain it</italic> </p><p><italic>I don't think this is what happens. But the authors do not make it clear in text and figures what exactly happens. I assume that only a small subset of undifferentiated cells express piwi. I understand that these are distributed. This information needs to be settled; it is one of the crucial pieces of data required in subsequent sections (see comments below).</italic></p><p>We show that <italic>piwi-1</italic> mRNA is maternally deposited in oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, revised manuscript), and that <italic>piwi-1+</italic> blastomeres undergo dispersed cleavage during S2, prior to sphere formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, revised manuscript). As noted previously, nuclear dyes mark both blastomere and yolk cell nuclei. Our data suggests that <italic>piwi-1</italic> is expressed in the zygote and its descendants, the blastomeres, during S2. During sphere formation, asymmetries in the <italic>piwi-1+</italic> blastomere population become evident: some blastomeres differentiate into temporary embryonic tissues, and these cells down-regulate <italic>piwi-1</italic> and exit the cell cycle. We do not know when asymmetries within the <italic>piwi-1+</italic> blastomeres develop during S2 and would like to explore this in the future. However, we never detect expression of <italic>piwi-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, revised manuscript) or the cell cycle markers <italic>PCNA</italic> or <italic>RNRM2-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-B</xref>, revised manuscript) in differentiated tissues of S2 or S3 embryos (compare to the expression pattern for <italic>EF1a-like-1</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-B</xref>, revised manuscript). During S3 and thereafter, <italic>piwi-1</italic> expression is restricted to undifferentiated cells. We agree with reviewer #4 that clear communication of these points is critical, and revised the text associated with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-G</xref> (revised manuscript) as follows:</p><p><italic>“piwi-1+</italic> cells were present throughout embryogenesis. <italic>piwi-1</italic> expression was detected in oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that zygotes contain <italic>piwi-1</italic> mRNA.

During S3-S5, <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cell number clearly increased, effectively blanketing the sphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). As definitive gut development proceeded during S6-S8, <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cells occupied the parenchyma between the developing gut branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Notably, <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cells were not detected in the definitive pharynx, and the compartment receded from the anterior margin as head structures developed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

The staining patterns are coincident at these stages, meaning that all <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cells express these markers (and vice versa). These data suggest that all undifferentiated cells express a similar complement of nuage genes in S3-S5 embryos: they are pan-blastomere markers at early stages, just as they are expressed throughout the neoblast population in adulthood. The numbers in the lower right corner of the merged images display the percent colocalization with respect to both populations scored (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F-I</xref> legend); very few single positive cells were observed. We have not performed colocalization analysis and quantification on S6 and older embryos, but would predict to see virtually all <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cells at later stages expressing these markers, as do adult neoblasts.</p><p>Some differentiating and/or terminally differentiated cells may retain expression of some of these markers. For example, <italic>bruli-1</italic> expression was detected in the four neurons innervating the temporary embryonic pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and may be expressed in the brain and potentially other neural tissues in late stage embryos, as in adults. Similarly, <italic>piwi-2</italic> expression was frequently seen in the S3 temporary embryonic pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and may also be expressed in neural tissues in late stage embryos, as seen in adults. In the future, RNA-Seq on cycling cells versus differentiated cells or whole embryos (WT or irradiated) may yield a global view of how enriched or exclusive expression of these genes are to the blastomere/neoblast compartment.</p><p><italic>Section 4 Early embryonic genes (EEE)</italic></p><p><italic>I don't understand the message of this section.

Maternal deposition of some EEE transcripts may explain why undifferentiated blastomeres and differentiated temporary embryonic cell types in S3 embryos co-express some EEE transcripts. However, we note that expression of these EEE transcript diminishes quicker in the temporary embryonic tissues than in the blastomeres. Differential transcript stability, relative contributions of maternal load and zygotic transcription, and different modes of maternal mRNA degradation may all be at play and could be investigated in the future. We also note that some EEE transcripts do appear to be expressed exclusively in differentiated cell types, like the temporary embryonic pharynx and the primitive ectoderm. This is consistent with the idea that cells turn on different genetic programs as they differentiate, and suggests that these EEE transcripts are transcribed zygotically, during or after the cell fate decision to downreguate piwi-1, exit the cell cycle and differentiate.</p><p><italic>Section 5</italic></p><p><italic>It is shown that gene sets associated with specific differentiated cell types are upregulated around stage 5, which is important, but expected, since it confirms the observation that cells differentiate (structurally) at this stage.</italic></p><p><italic>The main claim of the heading of this section (that progenitors of specific cell types arise WIHIN the piwi-positive population) needs to be demonstrated, and/or described more clearly (see questions to section 2 above)</italic></p><p>Great care was taken to articulate each point critical to our model of how the diversity of lineages required for organogenesis are born during <italic>Smed</italic> embryogenesis.

While many details remain to be worked out in the future, we are energized by paradigm-challenging ramifications of our work.
