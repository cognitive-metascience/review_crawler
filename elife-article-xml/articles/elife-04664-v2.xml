However, the inceptive mechanisms imposing the symmetry-breaking are incompletely understood. In <italic>Paracentrotus lividus</italic>, the Hbox12 homeodomain-containing repressor is expressed by prospective dorsal cells, spatially facing and preceding the onset of <italic>nodal</italic> transcription. We report that Hbox12 misexpression provokes DV abnormalities, attenuating <italic>nodal</italic> and <italic>nodal</italic>-dependent transcription. Reciprocally, impairing <italic>hbox12</italic> function disrupts DV polarity by allowing ectopic expression of <italic>nodal</italic>. Clonal loss-of-function, inflicted by blastomere transplantation or gene-transfer assays, highlights that DV polarization requires Hbox12 action in dorsal cells. Remarkably, the localized knock-down of <italic>nodal</italic> restores DV polarity of embryos lacking <italic>hbox12</italic> function. Finally, we show that <italic>hbox12</italic> is a dorsal-specific negative modulator of the p38-MAPK activity, which is required for <italic>nodal</italic> expression. Altogether, our results suggest that Hbox12 function is essential for proper positioning of the DV organizer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04664.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04664.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04664.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Embryos begin as a collection of identical cells. As the embryo develops further, the cells in different regions must take on different structures and roles in order to form the complex tissues and organs seen in the fully developed organism. Therefore, a key task in early development is to inform cells where they are in a developing embryo. Signaling proteins released by special groups of organizing cells are responsible for providing the information about where a cell is located. Networks of genes controlled by these proteins then inform embryonic cells of where they are and what they should, or should not, become.</p><p>One such signaling protein is called Nodal, and is needed to perform a number of tasks in the developing embryo, including helping to form the basic tissues of the organism. Many animals depend on Nodal to develop correctly—from mice and humans, to zebrafish and sea urchins.</p><p>During sea urchin development, Nodal establishes where the mouth of a larva forms, setting up what is called the dorsal/ventral axis of the embryo; this separates the front and back of the embryo. To do so, the Nodal protein is mostly produced at the front of the embryo. Although much is already known about the network of genes that the Nodal protein controls, the genes and proteins that ensure that the initial source of Nodal is present at the right time and place are largely unknown.</p><p>Another protein called Hbox12 was also thought to be important for setting up the dorsal/ventral axis. Now, Cavalieri and Spinelli reveal that Hbox12 regulates Nodal during the development of a sea urchin embryo. In the early developing sea urchin, the gene that produces Hbox12 is activated in the region of the embryo that will become its back, directly opposite where Nodal is present. This activation normally occurs just before the gene that produces Nodal is turned on. If the <italic>hbox12</italic> gene function is impaired, the Nodal protein is produced in both the front and the back sections of the embryo. Conversely, if Hbox12 is introduced into regions where Nodal is present, the amount of Nodal decreases. Furthermore, disrupting Hbox12 prevents any signs of the dorsal/ventral axis forming.</p><p>Cavalieri and Spinelli propose that Hbox12 inhibits the production of Nodal by briefly inactivating another protein that is required to activate the <italic>nodal</italic> gene. By doing so, Hbox12 sets up the dorsal/ventral axis by restricting Nodal to the cells that will make up the front half of the embryo.</p><p>Most complex organisms have asymmetric bodies, and failure to establish these body asymmetries can result in disease and other disorders in humans. Deciphering how the dorsal/ventral asymmetry in the sea urchin embryo is established should improve our understanding of how the mechanisms that form body shapes have evolved.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04664.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04664.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>dorsal/ventral polarity</kwd><kwd>symmetry breaking</kwd><kwd>homeodomain repressor</kwd><kwd>nodal</kwd><kwd>p38 MAPK</kwd><kwd>sea urchin embryo</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004913</institution-id><institution>Università degli Studi di Palermo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STEMBIO award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cavalieri</surname><given-names>Vincenzo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004913</institution-id><institution>Università degli Studi di Palermo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ex60%</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cavalieri</surname><given-names>Vincenzo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002737</institution-id><institution>Assessorato Regionale della Salute, Regione Siciliana</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PO FESR 4.1.1.1, RIMEDRI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cavalieri</surname><given-names>Vincenzo</given-names></name><name><surname>Spinelli</surname><given-names>Giovanni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During early embryogenesis of the sea urchin, asymmetrical positioning of the dorsal/ventral organizer relies upon the suppression of organizer activities in dorsal blastomeres by the Hbox12 homeodomain-containing repressor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Patterning of the embryonic ectoderm along the dorsal/ventral (DV) axis, also known as oral/aboral axis, has been extensively studied in various species of sea urchins. DV polarity is not firmly established in the unfertilized egg, but rather relies on a combination of inherited maternal information and inductive interactions among early blastomeres, becoming morphologically recognizable from the gastrula stage onward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandhorst and Klein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angerer and Angerer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Molina et al., 2013</xref>). The ectoderm of the pluteus larva is noticeably partitioned into four main domains: (1) the oral/ventral ectoderm, a thickened epithelium surrounding the mouth, (2) the aboral/dorsal ectoderm, a squamous epithelium that covers most of the rest of the larval body, (3) the ciliary band, a belt of ciliated cells positioned at the border between oral and aboral ectoderm, and (4) the apical neurogenic domain.</p><p>The genetic landmark of polarization along the secondary axis is the zygotic expression of the TGF-β superfamily member Nodal on the future oral side, which behaves as an organizing centre imposing DV polarity in all three germ layers of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Duboc et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Flowers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Duboc et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Materna et al., 2013</xref>). Targets of Nodal signaling within the oral ectoderm include genes encoding the TGF-β pathway extracellular components Lefty, BMP2/4 and Chordin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angerer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Duboc et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lapraz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yaguchi et al., 2010</xref>). Although they are expressed by the same cells, Lefty is thought to diffuse more rapidly than Nodal, thus acting as a long-range Nodal inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolouri and Davidson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Duboc et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2008</xref>). The BMP2/4 ligand acts instead as a relay to specify the aboral ectoderm, to which its signaling activity is confined, due to inhibition of BMP2/4 reception by Chordin within the oral ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angerer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Duboc et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lapraz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The amount of details available on molecular circuits that govern DV patterning downstream of <italic>nodal</italic> expression is growing rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Su, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saudemont et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yaguchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2013</xref>). As opposite, only fuzzy clues are known as to the early steps that trigger the DV gene regulatory network. According to the current models, at the early blastula stage a maternally related anisotropy in redox gradient would transiently inactivate the p38 kinase in the future dorsal ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradham and McClay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coffman, 2009</xref>), somehow leading to activation of the maternal bZIP and Oct1/2 factors on the ventral side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Range et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Range and Lepage, 2011</xref>). The <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory apparatus of <italic>nodal</italic> responds to these factors, as well as to the maternal positive inputs of SoxB1 and Univin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Range et al., 2007</xref>), directing the expression of the gene within a discrete sector of the ectoderm that corresponds to the presumptive oral ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Duboc et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Flowers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saudemont et al., 2010</xref>). Such a spatial expression profile is then consolidated by a positive feedback mechanism related to the Nodal signal transduction system, and by the concurrent Nodal-dependent production of the Nodal antagonist Lefty.</p><p>It should be noted that all of the known positive inputs converging on the <italic>nodal cis</italic>-regulatory apparatus are broadly distributed in the embryo as early as <italic>nodal</italic> transcription occurs, raising the question of whether additional negative regulators are involved in the initial repression of <italic>nodal</italic> in all but the oral territories. In strict accordance with this possibility, it has been shown that the transcription repressor FoxQ2 contributes, together with Lefty, to suppress <italic>nodal</italic> expression in the apical neurogenic ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yaguchi et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, a similar negative function acting on <italic>nodal</italic> within the presumptive dorsal ectoderm cells has not yet been uncovered. An extremely interesting candidate for this role is the zygotically-expressed <italic>hbox12</italic> homeobox-containing gene. In <italic>Paracentrotus lividus</italic>, <italic>hbox12</italic> expression precedes the onset of <italic>nodal</italic> transcription, then declines after the 60-cell stage and is no longer detectable by hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Di Bernardo et al., 1995</xref>; this paper). Intriguingly, <italic>hbox12</italic> transcripts are asymmetrically distributed along the DV axis, being confined in cells that become aboral ectoderm, as revealed by <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavalieri et al., 2008</xref>). The observed pattern of expression is so far unique in sea urchin development, and suggests that the Hbox12 transcription factor could act as a precocious input within the gene regulatory network that directs DV patterning. In agreement with this hypothesis, we have previously shown that disrupting the function of the Otx activator, a driver of <italic>hbox12</italic>, downregulates <italic>hbox12</italic> transcription and dramatically affects embryo polarization along the DV axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavalieri et al., 2008</xref>). Here we extend these findings providing more direct evidence indicating that <italic>hbox12</italic> is a key upstream gene in the symmetry-breaking sequence of events, functioning to prevent the ectopic activation of <italic>nodal</italic> transcription within the prospective dorsal side of the early sea urchin embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ectopic expression of the hbox12 repressor disrupts morphogenesis and affects nodal transcription</title><p>The timing and spatial expression profile of <italic>hbox12</italic> described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Di Bernardo et al., 1995</xref>) led us to initially hypothesize an involvement of such a gene in the negative control of <italic>nodal</italic> expression. This is further supported by directly comparing the dynamic temporal and spatial patterns of <italic>hbox12</italic> and <italic>nodal</italic> transcription during very early development. As expected, <italic>hbox12</italic> expression begins at least two cell divisions earlier with respect to that of <italic>nodal</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Double-labeling whole mount in situ hybridization (WMISH) at the early blastula stage showed that the spatial domains of expression of the two genes occupy opposite sectors of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results, coupled with those of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory analysis reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavalieri et al., 2008</xref>), lead us to definitively conclude that <italic>hbox12</italic> is expressed in the prospective dorsal ectoderm of the early embryo. Thus, <italic>hbox12</italic> is expressed at the right time and in the right place to regulate <italic>nodal</italic> expression.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04664.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of <italic>hbox12</italic> and <italic>nodal</italic> genes during early embryogenesis of <italic>P. lividus</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Temporal expression profiles examined by qPCR.

It follows that Hbox12 normally function as a transcriptional repressor in the early embryo.</p><p>Altogether, the phenotypes showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are broadly similar to those obtained by the knock-down of <italic>nodal</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Duboc et al., 2004</xref>), again suggesting a potential negative effect of the Hbox12 transcription factor on <italic>nodal</italic> expression. Indeed, microinjection of equal amounts of either <italic>hbox12</italic> or <italic>hd-En</italic> mRNA caused a dose-dependent attenuation in the level of <italic>nodal</italic> transcript at a very similar extent, as revealed by qPCR analysis from <italic>hbox12</italic>-injected embryos at morula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Expression of the additional oral ectoderm marker <italic>goosecoid</italic> (<italic>gsc</italic>) as well as the aboral ectoderm marker <italic>tbx2/3</italic> was also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), as expected from the perturbed expression of <italic>nodal</italic> normally necessary for the establishment of the entire DV axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Duboc et al., 2004</xref>). The variations in transcript abundance shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref> could appear somewhat modest, although they are of the same order of magnitude as those reported by other authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agca et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergeron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Coffman et al., 2004</xref>). A possible explanation is that the qPCR data refer to the whole embryo population, affected and not affected. In fact, in our experiments only about half of the <italic>hbox12</italic>-injected embryos developed as aberrant larvae that, unfortunately, could not be isolated at early stages because they were virtually indistinguishable from the unaffected ones. In addition, the phenotype exhibited by the affected embryos was broadly similar but not perfectly identical to that obtained following knock down of <italic>nodal</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Duboc et al., 2004</xref>), leading us to speculate that <italic>nodal</italic> expression was decreased to some extent in the overtly affected embryos. In close agreement with this hypothesis, WMISH showed that the expression of <italic>nodal</italic>, <italic>gsc</italic>, and <italic>tbx2/3</italic> genes was apparently reduced (n = 36/93; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E–G</xref>) or even nullified (n = 8/93; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2I–K</xref>) in roughly 47% (n = 93) of <italic>hbox12</italic>-injected embryos. Although we were not able to quantify subtle differences, if any, in gene expression between control- and <italic>hbox12</italic>-injected embryos by a mere analysis of Dig-probe staining, the overall fraction of embryos showing defective expression of <italic>nodal</italic>, <italic>gsc</italic>, and <italic>tbx2/3</italic> was somewhat consistent with that of embryos that ultimately displayed unambiguous loss of DV polarization at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). These findings substantially override the lack of significance in of qPCR expression data, that although showed less than threefold difference, are strengthened by the WMISH results. Altogether, our findings indicate that ectopic expression of <italic>hbox12</italic> disrupted the patterning of the ectodermal domains along the DV axis.</p><p>By WMISH with the PMC-specific marker <italic>msp130</italic> we also confirmed that in the <italic>hbox12</italic>-injected embryos the complement of PMCs was quite congruent with that of control embryos at the same stage but, in most embryos (70%, n = 250), the distribution of PMCs into the blastocoel was disorganized (compare panels J and K of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This finding indicates that defects in PMC arrangement are due to a failure in the ectoderm to provide adequate patterning information.

Therefore, to disrupt the <italic>hbox12</italic> function we expressed a truncated form of the protein, referred to as HD, which sequence ends just after the homeodomain.

By contrast, embryos injected with <italic>hd</italic> mRNA exhibited a failure of the DV axial patterning. At the gastrula stage, when controls exhibited a correctly partitioned ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Aa</xref>), the vast majority of the <italic>hd</italic>-injected embryos (80%, n &gt; 1200) appeared to be constituted by a uniformly thickened epithelium and no discernable ciliary band was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ac</xref>).

At the pluteus stage, HD-expressing embryos exhibited a range of phenotypes that could be ranked in order of severity.

By WMISH, we first examined the expression of <italic>nodal</italic> and <italic>gsc</italic>, which are expressed exclusively in ventral ectoderm cells of control mesenchyme blastulae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ba,4Bb</xref>). In sharp contrast, we found that HD expression in embryos at the same stage caused broadened ectodermic transcription of both genes in approximately 70% (n &gt; 80) of the resulting embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Be,4Bf</xref>). The mRNA abundance of <italic>nodal</italic> and <italic>gsc</italic> was examined by qPCR and, as expected, upregulation was detected for both genes during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>The precise mechanisms that dictate the physiological function and target range of individual homeodomain proteins are in general either unknown or incompletely delineated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Svingen and Tonissen, 2006</xref>). As the DNA-binding properties of the homeodomains could not be, by themselves, sufficiently discriminating to distinguish between different sets of target genes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoey and Levine, 1988</xref>), to assess the specificity of HD on <italic>nodal</italic> and <italic>gsc</italic> gene transcription, we injected an equal amount of <italic>otp-hd</italic>, a synthetic mRNA coding for the closely related homeodomain of Orthopedia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Di Bernardo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cavalieri et al., 2003</xref>). Otp and Hbox12 homeodomains belong both to the Q50 class and show a very similar helix-III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, all the early developing embryos expressing such an isolated DNA-binding domain did not display perceptible phenotypic aberration with respect to control injected embryos at the same stage. Most important, the transcript abundance of both <italic>nodal</italic> and <italic>gsc</italic> did not change significantly in embryos expressing the <italic>otp-hd</italic>. Altogether, these findings imply that impairing Hbox12 function through expression of HD specifically biased DV patterning toward ventralization.</p><p>We also noted that the mRNA abundance of the dorsal specific gene <italic>tbx2/3</italic> did fluctuate following a peculiar trend during development of <italic>hd</italic>-injected embryos. Although it was dramatically increased at early blastula stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), it appeared significantly down-regulated at mesenchyme blastula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bg</xref>, n = 34/42, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and almost completely abolished at late gastrula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). It should be emphasized that <italic>tbx2/3</italic> is expressed at a very low level during early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Tabou de-Leon et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, the simplest interpretation of the qPCR results is that the initial rise in <italic>tbx2/3</italic> transcription level could be due to an early pulse of BMP2/4 before the HD-induced overexpression of Nodal swamps the system. In close agreement, it has been shown in <italic>P. lividus</italic> that injection of <italic>nodal</italic> mRNA abrogates the expression of <italic>tbx2/3</italic> across the gastrula-stage embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Duboc et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saudemont et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Consistently with the derepression of <italic>nodal</italic>, the expression of four ventro-lateral ectoderm specific markers, <italic>strim1</italic>, <italic>fgf</italic>, <italic>otp</italic> and <italic>pax2/5/8</italic>, was robustly down-regulated in <italic>hd</italic>-injected gastrulae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), strongly supporting the hypothesis that ectoderm patterning was impaired in these embryos.</p><p>As described, an adjunctive defect characterizing most of the <italic>hd</italic>-injected embryos consisted in the lack of pigment cells. Known to be a cohort of secondary mesenchyme cells which expresses the specific marker <italic>gcm</italic>, the pigment cell precursors occupy a dorsal sector of the vegetal plate at the late mesenchyme blastula stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ransick et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Röttinger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Duboc et al., 2010</xref>). At this stage, <italic>hd</italic>-injected embryos had downregulated <italic>gcm</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). It is known that Nodal signaling antagonizes the specification of pigment cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Duboc et al., 2010</xref>), and our result is perfectly congruent with the reported loss of <italic>gcm</italic> expression, and the albino phenotype, provoked by the ectopic expression of <italic>nodal</italic> across the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Duboc et al., 2010</xref>). On this basis, we plausibly assume that the HD-induced overexpression of <italic>nodal</italic> similarly affected the specification of pigment cells in HD-expressing embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Hbox12 function is necessary in presumptive aboral ectoderm cells to ensure DV polarization</title><p><italic>Hd</italic> transcript was injected into zygotes along with the TRCD-fluorescent tracer and then, at the 16-cell stage, animal and vegetal halves from these embryos were separated and recombined with their complementary halves derived from uninjected embryos.

As an additional clue, the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase has higher activity in the presumptive ventral side of the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Czihak, 1963</xref>), probably due to a local enrichment in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Coffman et al., 2004</xref>). A possible link between the redox gradient and the initiation of <italic>nodal</italic> transcription is represented by the stress activated kinase p38, which is responsive to reactive-oxygen-species in the sea urchin embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coffman et al., 2009</xref>) and is required for <italic>nodal</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradham and McClay, 2006</xref>). In agreement with this hypothesis, we show that Hbox12 is functionally upstream of p38. This conclusion is firstly supported by the fact that impairing Hbox12 function, by injection of the <italic>hd</italic> RNA, efficiently supplanted the anisotropic inactivation of a GFP-tagged p38 in the prospective dorsal side of the 60-cell stage embryo. By contrast, and in accordance with the previous result, either the ectopic or clonal expression of the <italic>hbox12</italic> mRNA specifically prevents p38-GFP nuclear translocation.

The mechanism by which Hbox12 suppresses p38 function remains an open question. As the functional status of p38 depends upon the balance between specific kinase and phosphatase activities, Hbox12 might switch such a balance in dorsal cells. For instance, this could be accomplished by suppressing locally the expression of the kinase involved in p38 activation. In a distinct scenario, Hbox12 might work in a regulatory tandem together with a downstream repressor, constituting a so-called double-negative gate which in turn would allow the dorsal-restricted expression of the phosphatase acting on p38. Such an exclusion effect is not uncommon, especially during early embryogenesis, and numerous examples have been described across metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oliveri and Davidson, 2007</xref>). Another fascinating possibility will require learning whether p38 directly interacts with the Hbox12 regulator as it does with other homeodomain-containing transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Houde et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>).

Our results rather suggest an involvement of Hbox12 at the top of the regulatory hierarchy implicated in the polarization of the embryo along the DV axis.</p><p>Noteworthy, multiple copies of both <italic>hbox12</italic> and <italic>pmar1/micro1</italic> genes are clustered in <italic>P. lividus</italic> and <italic>S. purpuratus/H. pulcherrimus</italic> genomes respectively, suggesting that numerous rounds of duplication have occurred at these loci during evolution. From this and aforementioned considerations, we suppose that <italic>hbox12</italic> and <italic>pmar1</italic> could be paralogs, rather than orthologs. Considering that the time point for the split between the Strongylocentrotid species and the more recent Parechinid <italic>P. lividus</italic> species is estimated to be about 35–50 Myr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith, 1988</xref>), in such a speculative scenario <italic>hbox12</italic> may have arisen by a <italic>P. lividus</italic> lineage-specific duplication from a common ancestor with <italic>pmar1</italic>.</p><p>In this regard, of interest is the sobering clue that the two cited sea urchin species differ in aspects of DV axis determination. For instance, in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> the DV axis passes through a plane about 45° clockwise from the first cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cameron et al., 1989</xref>), indicating that secondary axis specification is initiated between fertilization and first cleavage, which is consistent with the asymmetric distribution of mitochondria within eggs and early embryos of this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Coffman et al., 2004</xref>). Classical studies in <italic>P. lividus</italic> embryos instead demonstrate that DV axis is randomly oriented with respect to the first cleavage plane, and that it is established between the fifth and eighth cleavage stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Horstadius and Wolsky, 1936</xref>), which broadly corresponds to the peak of <italic>hbox12</italic> expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Microinjection, embryo manipulation and imaging</title><p>Microinjection was conducted as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cavalieri et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2009a</xref>). Synthetic mRNAs were resuspended in 30% glycerol and, in selected experiments, TRCD (Molecular Probes, Italy) was added at 5%. For overexpression experiments, capped mRNAs were synthesized from the linearized pCS2 constructs using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Italy). Approximately 1–2 pl of the purified RNAs were then injected at the following concentrations: <italic>hbox12</italic> and <italic>strim1</italic> out-of-frame, 0.01–0.4 pg/pl; <italic>hd</italic>, <italic>hd-GFP</italic>, and <italic>otp-hd</italic>, 0.4 pg/pl. Mo-<italic>nodal</italic> was instead injected at 0.5 mM along with RDLX. For DNA constructs, approximately 5000 molecules of the linearized <italic>phbox12</italic>-HD-GFP or the control <italic>phbox12</italic>-GFP transgenes were injected per zygote. The <italic>phbox12</italic>-GFP transgene corresponds to the construct initially referred to as 1.45GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavalieri et al., 2008</xref>). Such a construct contains a genomic fragment including 1.45 kb of the promoter sequence of <italic>hbox12</italic>, abutting at the 3′ end the ATG start codon fused in frame with the GFP coding sequence (further details are provided in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavalieri et al., 2008</xref>). For all experiments, several hundreds of injected embryos were observed and each experiment was repeated at least three times with different batches of eggs.</p><p>Recombination of animal and vegetal halves were carried out as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cavalieri et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, control or injected <italic>P. lividus</italic> embryos at the 16-cell stage were transferred into a modified Kiehart chamber in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free sea water and manipulated with fine glass needles under a Leica M165FC stereomicroscope equipped with micromanipulators (Narishige, UK). After surgery, the embryos were returned to regular sea water and reared until the desired stage.</p><p>Transplanted and non-chimeric injected embryos at the desired stage were harvested, mounted on glass slides and examined under a Leica DM-4500B upright fluorescent microscope. Digital images were captured and processed using Adobe Photoshop CS6.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Quantitative PCR and whole mount in situ hybridization</title><p>Reverse-transcription and qPCR analysis were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cavalieri et al., 2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2013</xref>). Briefly, total RNA from batches of unfertilized eggs and embryos grown at the desired stage was extracted by using the Power SYBR Green Cells-to-CT kit (Ambion, Italy) and reverse transcribed following the manufacturer's recommendations. The resulting cDNA sample was further diluted and the equivalent amount corresponding to one embryo was used as template for qPCR analysis, using the oligonucleotide primers indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>. qPCR experiments were performed from two distinct batches and all reactions were run in triplicate on a 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Italy) using SYBR Green detection chemistry. ROX was used as a measure of background fluorescence and, at the end of the amplification reactions, a ‘melting-curve analysis’ was run to confirm the homogeneity of all amplicons. Calculations from qPCR raw data were performed by the RQ Study software version 1.2.3 (Applied Biosystems, Italy), using the comparative Ct method. Primer efficiencies (i.e., the amplification factors for each cycle) were found to exceed 1.9. In every experiment, a no-template control was included for each primers set. A <italic>cytochrome oxidase</italic> or the <italic>mbf1</italic> mRNA, which are known to be expressed at a constant level during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavalieri et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2009b</xref>), were used to normalize all data, in order to account for fluctuations among different preparations.</p><p>For developmental expression analysis of <italic>hbox12</italic> and <italic>nodal</italic>, the number of transcripts per embryo at the 60-cell stage was estimated assuming a reference standard number of 1000 copies/embryo of the <italic>z12</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Materna et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Chromogenic whole mount in situ hybridization procedure was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cavalieri et al., 2011</xref>), with Digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes and staged embryos. For the simultaneous detection of <italic>hbox12</italic> and <italic>nodal</italic> transcripts we followed the double two-color WMISH procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cavalieri et al., 2011</xref>). In this experiment, embryos were co-hybridized with a Digoxigenin-labeled <italic>hbox12</italic> probe along with a Fluorescein-labeled <italic>nodal</italic> probe. Probes were then sequentially revealed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody with NBT/BCIP (for the dig-probe) or BCIP (for the fluo-probe) as chromogenic

This manuscript presents generally compelling experimental evidence that the sea urchin Hbox12 gene encodes a transcriptional repressor whose early expression in the dorsal animal domain of the embryo is required for the proper dorsal-ventral patterning of the embryo by restricting Nodal to the ventral domain. The work contributes to our understanding of early symmetry breaking events in embryonic development and because Nodal has an important role in patterning of other deuterostome embryos this study should be of interest to the broader research community. However there are several important points which need to be addressed in a revised version of the paper before making a final decision on acceptance for publication.</p><p>1) The morphological evidence presented strongly supports the conclusions. The analysis of gene expression is somewhat less compelling. It is stated “microinjection of equal amounts of either <italic>hbox12</italic> or <italic>hd-En</italic> mRNA caused a dose-dependent attenuation in the level of nodal transcript at a very similar extent”. However, as mentioned in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> (but not in the Results or Discussion), the reduction in nodal transcript was actually less than significant in the quantitative PCR assay used. The authors reasonably point out that this may be because many of the embryos injected with these mRNAs ultimately did not show loss of dorsal-ventral patterning. This lack of consistency in injected embryos is of some concern and somewhat unusual. The lack of significance (and marginal significance of other qPCR data) should be made clear in the text (and in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> which mentions the gray area but not the lack of significance).</p><p>2) It is stated ”We conclude that in the double hd-GFP and Mo-nodal injected embryos, clonal knock-down of nodal was able to restore the asymmetrical production of the Nodal ligand, which in turn sufficed to resume the entire DV axis.” While this is a reasonable interpretation, no direct evidence was presented for the abundance or localization of the Nodal (or nodal mRNA) in this experiment, so the statement is conjectural and should be modified.</p><p>3) The <italic>hbox12</italic> gene is annotated in the <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> genome as <italic>pmar1</italic> and has been extensively characterized by Oliveri and Davidson. Pmar1 is expressed in micromeres and functions as a critical component of an endomesodermal specification regulatory network. This paper is essentially proposing that there is a radical difference in the function of this gene in two closely related species of urchin. The authors need to make an attempt to provide a reasonable explanation for what many would consider a contradiction. Hence, address a rationale for what appear to be differences in fundamental molecular patterning mechanisms in closely related species.</p><p>4) There is a need to see clear data on the localization of the expression of <italic>hbox12</italic>. An underlying assumption of this paper is that expression is restricted to presumptive dorsal ectoderm. The cis-regulatory DNA drives mosaic expression of GFP in dorsal ectoderm, as previously reported, but a conventional in situ hybridization or antibody staining would be reassuring to clearly demonstrate that there is a sound basis for the assumed localization of transcription.</p><p>5) General point, it is difficult to come to the conclusions that the authors report without analyzing the distribution of the tissue specific genes that have only been quantified by qPCR; it is essential to have both. Conventional loss of function experiments are not provided data, presumably because there are multiple genes. The RNA overexpression only partly overcomes this problem and the overexpression phenotype is not fully described. For instance, there is a description in the text, and a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), but the only substantiation of changes in tissue distribution is a low quality in situ RNA hybridization for a mesenchyme gene. If the contention is that there is a change in the distribution of ectodermal domains, this really should be substantiated with tissue specific gene or antibody localizations with specific markers.</p><p>6) Specific expression analysis this would help other parts of the paper as well, for instance in the Results section, the defects are not clearly dorsal-ventral polarity and tissue specific markers should be used to establish this. Similarly the authors assert a dorsal-ventral defect without demonstrating alterations in the distribution of tissue markers.</p><p>7) A minor point, a curious outcome of the experiments is the effects on the pigment cell lineage. As this lineage arises from mesoderm, the effect is not fully explained. A clear demonstration that the early commitment of macromere derived cells is the proximal effect by using tissue specific gene probes; the standard in the field would be valuable. The loss of pigment and the suppression of GCM could come about in several ways: one cannot assume it is at the level of specification.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04664.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The morphological evidence presented strongly supports the conclusions.

Rather, it is the criterion proposed by Davidson (reviewed in Davidson et al., 2002, Science 295, 1669-78) and widely adopted by the rest of the sea urchin community. However, less than 3-fold difference could be significant when strengthened by WMISH results, and this is exactly our case.</p><p>Since only about half of the <italic>hbox12</italic>-injected embryos developed as aberrant larvae (virtually indistinguishable from the unaffected ones at early stages), we predicted that the qPCR data on <italic>nodal</italic>, <italic>gsc</italic> and <italic>tbx2/3</italic> expression would refer to an heterogeneous population of embryos (affected and not affected).</p><p>Thus, we performed WMISH on control- and <italic>hbox12</italic>- injected embryos at the mesenchyme blastula stage, in which DV polarity is not yet morphologically noticeable. In close agreement with our hypothesis, a significant fraction (∼47%) of <italic>hbox12</italic>-injected embryos showed reduced expression of the mentioned genes. Most importantly, such a fraction was reasonably congruent with that of embryos that ultimately displayed unambiguous defects in DV polarization at later stages.</p><p>These results were included in the current version of the manuscript (in the Results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure2–figure supplement 2</xref>), and a detailed explanation concerning the suspected lack of significance of qPCR data was given both in the main text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> legend, as requested.</p><p><italic>2) It is stated “We conclude that in the double hd-GFP and Mo-nodal injected embryos, clonal knock-down of nodal was able to restore the asymmetrical production of the Nodal ligand, which in turn sufficed to resume the entire DV axis.” While this is a reasonable interpretation, no direct evidence was presented for the abundance or localization of the Nodal (or nodal mRNA) in this experiment, so the statement is conjectural and should be modified</italic>.</p><p>As suggested, the statement has been modified.</p><p><italic>3) The</italic> hbox12 <italic>gene is annotated in the</italic> S. purpuratus <italic>genome as</italic> pmar1 <italic>and has been extensively characterized by Oliveri and Davidson.

In fact, we believe that <italic>hbox12</italic> and <italic>pmar1</italic> are indeed distinct genes playing distinct roles in two evolutionary distant species of sea urchins. To meet the Referee’s request, we have included a paragraph in the Discussion section to explain this point.</p><p><italic>4) There is a need to see clear data on the localization of the expression of</italic> hbox12<italic>.

The cis-regulatory DNA drives mosaic expression of GFP in dorsal ectoderm, as previously reported, but a conventional in situ hybridization or antibody staining would be reassuring to clearly demonstrate that there is a sound basis for the assumed localization of transcription</italic>.</p><p>The dorsal-specific expression of <italic>hbox12</italic> was not arbitrarily assumed, but rather derived from previous results based on in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Di Bernardo et al., 1995</xref>, <italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.</italic> 92, 8180-8184.) and <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavalieri et al., 2008</xref>, <italic>Dev.

As clearly shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the spatial domains of expression of the two genes occupy opposite sectors of the embryo at the early blastula stage.</p><p><italic>5) General point, it is difficult to come to the conclusions that the authors report without analyzing the distribution of the tissue specific genes that have only been quantified by qPCR; it is essential to have both.

Similarly the authors assert a dorsal-ventral defect without demonstrating alterations in the distribution of tissue markers</italic>.</p><p>This point refers to the results derived from the transplanted chimeric embryos. We are well aware that the suggested additional analysis of tissue markers in chimeras would improve our paper but, unfortunately, we face two types of difficulties that make these experiments quite unfeasible, at least in this period of the year. This is because currently we are not in the spawning season. In Sicily, the <italic>P. lividus</italic> reproductive cycle starts with the New Year but eggs are not suitable for microinjection and/or micromanipulation before the end of March. This would delay the publication of our paper quite a lot.</p><p>In addition, there is also a severe adverse technical limitation related to the fact that several tens of micro-injection/manipulation sessions would be required in order to obtain relevant numbers of chimeras to be processed for in situ hybridization with various probes. This would introduce a high extent of variability due to mixing different batches of embryos (in our hands the number of chimeric embryos is about ten for each experiment), that might hinder the interpretation of the results.</p><p>On the other hand, we would like to underlie that, in our opinion, the morphological evidence presented fit well with all the other results and support our conclusions.</p><p><italic>7) A minor point, a curious outcome of the experiments is the effects on the pigment cell lineage. As this lineage arises from mesoderm, the effect is not fully explained. A clear demonstration that the early commitment of macromere derived cells is the proximal effect by using tissue specific gene probes; the standard in the field would be valuable. The loss of pigment and the suppression of GCM could come about in several ways: one cannot assume it is at the level of specification</italic>.</p><p>We fully agree with the concept that loss of pigment and <italic>gcm</italic> suppression in HD-expressing embryos may not necessarily reflect a failure in the specification of secondary mesenchyme cells. However, this appear to us the most plausible explanation essentially because <italic>hd</italic>-injected embryos are subjected to overexpression of <italic>nodal</italic>, and it is commonly accepted that Nodal signaling antagonizes the specification of pigment cells in unperturbed embryos. In agreement to this notion, it has been demonstrated by other authors that ubiquitous expression of <italic>nodal</italic> mRNA provokes loss of <italic>gcm</italic> transcription in the resulting albino embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Duboc et al., 2010</xref>, <italic>Development</italic> 137, 223-235). A circumstantiated explanation has been included in the Results section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
