Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is a mainstay of treatment, but once therapy is stopped or drug resistance develops, viral rebound occurs within weeks and CD4 +T cell counts decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holkmann Olsen et al., 2007</xref>). A small population of HIV-infected individuals termed elite controllers (ECs) and viremic controllers (VCs), however, are able to control viral replication (plasma viral load, VL &lt;50 [ECs] or 50 &lt; VL &lt; 2000 [VCs] for at least 6–12 months) in the absence of ART by a mechanism that is not fully elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deeks and Walker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzalo-Gil et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lambotte et al., 2005</xref>). EC/VCs are considered examples of ‘functional’ cures, in which virus is not fully eradicated and yet for the most part the patient does not develop immune dysfunction over time. The clinical status of most EC/VCs cannot be explained by defective HIV particles or genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blankson et al., 2007</xref>). Rather, these individuals appear to have an intrinsic ability to control HIV infection, perhaps because of host genetic determinants. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified certain human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-B and HLA-C alleles that are associated with viral control in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pereyra et al., 2010</xref>). However, these protective alleles only accounted for ~20% of the effect, suggesting that there are other mechanisms responsible for the suppressed viral loads in EC/VCs. Identifying novel mechanisms involved in HIV control is paramount to HIV research and the cure agenda.</p><p>C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) serve as co-receptor for X4-tropic and R5-tropic HIV-1 entry into CD4 +T cells, respectively, and CCR5 is essential for sexual transmission of HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 1996</xref>). The presence of the <italic>CCR5</italic> delta 32 (Δ32<italic>CCR5</italic>) allele confers protection against seroconversion, with homozygotes being completely resistant to infection via mucosal routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Samson et al., 1996</xref>). There is, however, no evidence that Δ32<italic>CCR5 ±</italic> is associated with EC/VC phenotype. Conflicting results have been obtained regarding the susceptibility of EC/VC CD4 +T cells to HIV infection in vitro. Activated CD4 +T cells from EC/VCs have been shown to be susceptible to both R5- and X4-tropic HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blankson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lamine et al., 2007</xref>) but opposite results have also been reported, with CD4 +T cells of EC/VCs being resistant to HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sáez-Cirión et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Julg et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Previously we had observed that three of roughly a dozen ECs tested had CD4 +T cells with intrinsic resistance to R5 virus, due to increased chemokine gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walker et al., 2015</xref>). To extend those findings and to determine whether R5 resistance is a consequence of a transcriptional mechanism and if there is a hereditary basis associated with the phenotype, we analyzed the in vitro susceptibility to HIV of purified CD4 +T cells from 131 EC/VCs, along with normal, healthy donors. Here we report that a subset of EC/VCs have resistance to HIV, specific to R5-tropic virus. For these subjects, however, the resistance phenotype was due to lower levels of CCR5, at both the RNA and protein levels, and was likely due to reduced active transcription of <italic>ccr5</italic>, despite highly accessible chromatin. The fact that CD4 +T cells from multiple family members of an index VC had a similar phenotype and also down-regulation of <italic>ccr5</italic> suggests that the phenotype is hereditary in nature.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Clinical characteristics of EC/VC cohort</title><p>The total number of EC/VCs studied was 131, with a majority coming from the UCSF SCOPE cohort.

The year of initial HIV diagnosis or likely exposure ranged from 1980 to 2014, and subjects were 48 ± 12 years old (mean ±SD, range of 19 to 79 years), the majority being men (78.62%).

Although occasional viral blips were observed, none of the EC/VCs ever lost virologic control necessitating ART. A number of subjects (54/125) had documented protective HLA alleles, being 32.06% HLA-B*57:03, 25.95% HLA-B*57:01, 22.9% Cw*08:02, 10.69% B*14:02, 4.58% HLA-B*27:05, and 3.05% B*52:01.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>In vitro CD4 +T cell intrinsic resistance specifically to R5-tropic virus in a subset of HIV +EC/VCs</title><p>To determine whether T cells of EC/VCs were resistant to X4- or R5-tropic virus in vitro, we activated CD4 +T cells from 131 EC/VC and 35 Ctrl, and then infected them overnight using single cycle HIV encoding YFP and pseudotyped with either X4, R5, or VSV G glycoprotein and analyzed cells by flow cytometry 72 hr later. We observed relative resistance to R5-tropic HIV in CD4 +T cells from EC/VCs (% cells eYFP+: EC/VC 0.99 ± 0.79) compared to Ctrl (1.22 ± 0.66; p=0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, left panel). In contrast, we saw equal susceptibility to X4-tropic HIV (Ctrl 3.08 ± 1.32; EC/VCs 3.33 ± 1.91) and VSV G pseudoviral particles among the groups (Ctrl 34.8 ± 9.36; EC/VCs 30.66 ± 11.22; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Post-hoc analysis identified 16% of EC/VCs (21 of 131 analyzed, termed ECr/VCr) with resistance specific to R5-tropic HIV, compared to remaining EC/VC subjects and healthy Ctrl, with no resistance observed (% cells YFP+: Ctrl 1.22 ± 0.66; EC/VC 1.2 ± 0.77; ECr/VCr 0.2 ± 0.07; p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, right panel), pointing to an early block of infection in a subset of EC/VCs. These data confirmed that the phenotype was specific to EC/VC, not observed in Ctrl. To confirm the R5 resistance phenotype, we then selected ECr/VCr samples for further study, based upon % eYFP +cells being lower than any value in Ctrl group. We retested these ECr/VCr samples prospectively in at least triplicate, using two R5-tropic envelopes, in comparison to a subset of EC/VC (n = 38, selected based upon sample availability and representativeness of the population from the initial test) and Ctrl (n = 35). Our results redemonstrated R5 resistance, as manifested as a 5-fold reduction in CD4 +T cell susceptibility to YU2-pseudotyped virus, on average, in ECr/VCr compared to remaining EC/VC and Ctrl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, % cells eYFP+: Ctrl 1.05 ± 0.81; EC/VC 1.09 ± 0.75; ECr/VCr 0.20 ± 0.16; p&lt;0.0001). Similar results were observed using ADA-pseudotyped virus (% cells YFP+: Ctrl 1.27 ± 0.5; EC/VC 1.13 ± 0.75; ECr/VCr 0.34 ± 0.16; p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similar to the post-hoc analysis, in this prospective testing we observed equal susceptibility to X4-tropic and VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV particles in activated CD4 +T cells from ECr/VCr compared to EC/VC without the phenotype and Ctrl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In multiple cases, based upon sample and subject availability, we retested ECr/VCr CD4 +T cells isolated from independent, separate blood draws and observed consistent results (i.e., R5 resistance was seen repeatedly, not just on a single blood draw). Taken together, these data identify a subset of EC/VCs with intrinsic, reproducible resistance specific to R5-tropic virus in T cells, a phenotype only observed in EC/VC.

Additionally, we performed media transfer experiments to explore whether other factors elaborated by activated CD4 +T cells were responsible to the resistance phenotype in this ECr/VCr subset. Our results revealed comparable T cell susceptibility to infection in ECr/VCr and EC/VCs without the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that the culture supernatants did not contain soluble factors that could confer resistance to R5-tropic virus in the ECr/VCrs.</p><p>Previous reports have suggested that expression of HLA-B*27/HLA-B*57 and other specific HLA alleles can account for some of the controller phenotype. We examined whether the presence of protective HLA alleles was associated with viral control in ECr/VCr subset. Of the 16% of ECr/VCr with the R5 resistance phenotype, only five individuals (5/19 or 26.3%) had documented protective alleles, with four of them being HLA-B*57 positive and only one HLA-B*27. Analyzing the remaining EC/VC, the percentage was higher, with 46% (49/106) of them having protective HLA alleles. Although this difference in frequency of protective alleles was not significant (p=0.086) due to the low number of ECr/VCr, these data confirm that protective alleles were not more frequent in ECr/VCr.</p><p>We next investigated whether the ECr/VCr CD4 +T cells were also relatively resistant to replication-competent virus. Activated CD4 +T cells from EC/VC, ECr/VCr (based upon prior experiments) and Ctrl (n = 2 per group, tested in triplicate, selected based upon cell availability) were infected with X4- and R5-tropic viruses, at low MOI. Viruses were prepared in 293 T cells by co-transfection with VSV G expression plasmid to facilitate the first round of replication. Replication of NL4-3 (X4) and BaL (R5) was quantified using TZMbl cells as a reporter, measuring firefly luciferase activity over a period of 3 weeks. We observed significantly reduced replication of BaL in ECr/VCr, compared to EC/VC and Ctrl over the 21 days analyzed (Mean ±SD Area Under Curve [AUC] R5: Ctrl 177828 ± 53736; EC/VC 125548 ± 31577; ECr/VCr 62006 ± 4179; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>, right panel). The absence of differences in viral replication at day three post-infection may be explained by the addition of VSV G as described above. Infection using NL4-3 also showed significant resistance in all EC/VC (AUCs: Ctrl 19679 ± 12897; EC/VC 5880 ± 1319; ECr/VCr 2125 ± 60.1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>, left panel). The fact that EC/VC (with or without the R5-resistance phenotype) had reduced infectivity, with virtual absence of X4 replication in ECr/VCr, suggests a more complex mechanism of virologic resistance that should be further explored.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>RNA-Seq identifies several genes down-regulated in EC/VC with R5-tropic resistance</title><p>To further investigate the mechanism of R5-tropic resistance in early infection, we next performed RNA-Seq to identify genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated in activated CD4 +T cells from ECr/VCr compared to Ctrl.

Other groups have demonstrated that anti-CD3-activated CD4 +T cells from ECs were resistant to HIV infection, independent of co-receptor usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sáez-Cirión et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paxton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saha et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu and Lichterfeld, 2011</xref>). Only one prior report, from our group, observed T cell resistance specific to R5-tropic virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walker et al., 2015</xref>), and the current results are consistent with those data. Our prior study, however, suggested the mechanism was mediated by increased chemokine produced and secreted by activated CD4 +T cells, which would then confer resistance by sterically interfering with Env binding to co-receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saha et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>In the experiments here, performed on a much larger scale compared to our initial report, chemokine RNA and protein levels were actually decreased in CD4 +T cells of EC/VCs with the R5 resistance phenotype, suggesting that another mechanism was operational. It should be pointed out that there was some overlap in subjects between the two studies. Despite repeated testing, we did not confirm increased chemokine expression in EC11, but instead down-regulation of both <italic>ccr2</italic> and <italic>ccr5</italic> RNA. Of note, this sample was obtained at a later time point, perhaps explaining the observed differences. We also included VCs in the current report, and they were excluded from the previous study. Prior investigations have suggested that CD4 +T cells from ECs retain the ability to proliferate and produce IL-2 in response to HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Emu et al., 2005</xref>) and are highly activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bello et al., 2009</xref>). EC/VCs with the R5-tropic resistant phenotype expressed significantly lower levels of the early activation marker CD69. There were no differences, however, in levels of the late activation marker CD25, which is when the T cells were infected. In addition, those T cells remained fully susceptible to VSV G- and X4 Env-pseudotyped HIV, thus the significance of the subtly lower CD69 levels in the T cells of the ECr/VCr subset is not known.</p><p>Of interest was the fact that we observed the R5 resistance phenotype only in activated CD4 +T cells and not MDMs. The observed phenotype correlates with <italic>ccr2/ccr5</italic> RNA down-regulation in CD4 +T cells, whereas in MDMs there was no down-regulation of those two co-receptor genes, demonstrating a strong correlation between resistance to R5 tropic viruses and down-regulation of <italic>ccr2/ccr5</italic>. It is known that there are large differences in the transcriptional profiles between T cells and MDMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Woelk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xue et al., 2014</xref>), and even in T cells different activation protocols result in altered gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marrack et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it is quite conceivable that non-specific T cell stimulation leads to production of transcription factors not present after co-stimulation, resulting in altered RNA and cell-surface levels of CCR5.</p><p>The presence of the homozygous <italic>CCR5Δ32</italic> mutation confers protection against mucosal HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Samson et al., 1996</xref>), and heterozygotes have slower disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rappaport et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rodés et al., 2004</xref>). That the frequency of <italic>CCR5Δ32 ± </italic>was significantly higher in EC/VCs with the R5-resistance phenotype compared to other ECs suggests heterozygosity could contribute in part to the R5 resistance phenotype, likely by inactivating one <italic>ccr5</italic> allele and decreasing cell surface expression. Here, we also observed that both <italic>ccr2</italic> and <italic>CCR5</italic> mRNA and cell surface protein levels were down-regulated in ECr/VCrs, supporting the idea that the R5 resistance phenotype is mediated by a transcriptional mechanism. It is unlikely that <italic>CCR5Δ</italic>32 affects mRNA levels since nonsense-mediated decay of RNA is not operational if the stop codon is present in the last exon, as it is here. In addition, several lines of evidence presented here favor a transcriptional mechanism for the RNA down-regulation of <italic>ccr2/ccr5</italic>. There was no difference in the half-lives of these RNAs in activated T cells, and ChIP-qPCR data using anti-Rpb1 demonstrated decreased levels of active transcription on <italic>ccr2/ccr5</italic> in ECr/VCrs. Rpb1 is the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II and its presence on DNA correlates strongly with active transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brookes and Pombo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Phatnani and Greenleaf, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Two decades ago, the cis- and trans-acting sequences and factors influencing <italic>ccr5</italic> transcription were studied, and a promoter upstream of <italic>ccr5</italic> was localized and dissected by functional assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mummidi et al., 1997</xref>). Given the lack of upstream sequence conservation and distance of &gt;10 kb, it is highly unlikely that those DNA sequences and transcription factors would also modulate <italic>ccr2</italic> expression. In addition, we observed decreased RNA levels of multiple genes spanning ~500 kb of 3p21, both centromeric and telomeric to <italic>ccr2</italic>/<italic>ccr5</italic>, consistent with a more global and coordinate down-regulation of multiple chemokines and their receptors in the activated CD4 +T cells from ECr/VCr.</p><p>ATAC-Seq is an established method for quantifying chromatin accessibility in different cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corces et al., 2016</xref>). Previous reports have suggested that histone modifications upstream of coding regions play a role in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2002</xref>). In general, H3K4Me3 is associated with open chromatin, specifically marking the promoters of active genes, and correlates with higher levels of transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heintzman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>). In our study, however, we observe CD4 +T cells from ECr/VCr have more open chromatin over ~500 Kb region in chr3, including <italic>ccr2</italic> and <italic>ccr5</italic>, which surprisingly was associated with lower transcription of both genes. It had also been shown that levels of DNA methylation in the <italic>ccr5</italic> locus correlated inversely with CCR5 levels on T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gornalusse et al., 2015</xref>), which is also a typical transcriptional control mechanism. The fact that CD4 +T cells of ECr/VCr have decreased transcriptional initiation/transcript levels of <italic>ccr2/ccr5</italic> and yet more open chromatin suggests that there is a dissociation between chromatin access and transcription of these genes, for inapparent reasons.</p><p>Interestingly, two of the three family members of an Index VCr had CD4 +T cells with a similar R5 resistance phenotype, with associated down regulation of CCR<italic>5</italic> RNA and protein levels. The fact that it was multi-generational and in both sexes is highly suggestive but is not definitive evidence that the phenotype is autosomal dominant. Additional family studies will be necessary to determine whether the R5 tropic resistance phenotype has hereditary dominance. Autosomal dominant inheritance would be consistent with altered cell signaling or DNA binding factor, acting in a trans-dominant fashion and negatively influencing transcription of both <italic>ccr2/ccr5</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 1998</xref>). Precedents include naturally-occurring dominantly suppressive variants of human <italic>stat5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crotti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamashita et al., 2003</xref>), those of human <italic>stat6</italic> that are amino terminus truncated for the SH2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mikita et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patel et al., 1998</xref>), or an alternatively spliced form of human <italic>stat3</italic> that functioned as a dominant negative regulator of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zammarchi et al., 2011</xref>).

Our results revealed a down-regulation in <italic>loc102724291</italic> RNA levels in activated T cells in ECr/VCr, with no correlation between <italic>ccr2</italic> and <italic>ccr5</italic> gene expression, making it unlikely that it is modulating the expression of those genes. Without invoking a more global mechanism of transcriptional control, it is difficult to understand how <italic>loc102724291</italic> would be capable of inhibiting transcription of other genes in that chromosome region. Instead, it appears that lncRNA may be similarly down-regulated to other genes in the region.</p><p>In conclusion, our data suggest that the R5-tropic resistance phenotype seen in a subset of EC/VCs is associated with transcriptional down-regulation of <italic>ccr5</italic>, which appears to be heritable, across multiple generations. That the chromatin of this region of 3p21 appears to be more accessible yet multiple genes are down-regulated implies a complex but coordinate mode of transcriptional regulation. Because these ECs are able to persistently suppress viral replication, further investigation into the mechanisms underlying these findings should inform the HIV cure effort.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CD3 mouse Monoclonal Antibody (OKT3), PerCP-Cyanine5.5</td><td>eBioscience</td><td>Cat # 45-0037-42;

The reasons for this are incompletely understood and most likely complex. In the present study, the authors analyzed a large group of 131 HIV-1 controllers. Major finds are: (i) CD4 T cells from a subset of ECs/VCs are relatively resistant to R5-tropic HIV infection in vitro, compared to those from other ECs/VCs or uninfected controls; (ii) the resistance phenotype is associated with lower levels of CCR5, likely due to reduced active transcription of CCR5; (iii) CD4+ T cells from ECr/VCr have highly accessible chromatin over ~500Kb region around CCR2 and CCR5, which does not seem to fit with decreased transcription of these genes and (iv) evidence from one VCr that the resistance phenotype is heritable.</p><p>Genetic determinants of effective control of HIV-1 are of significant interest. In the present study a large number of HIV-1 controllers was examined technologies to study an important question about heterogeneous mechanisms of natural virologic control. Altogether, the data are well presented and for most part convincing. However, as appreciated by the authors the study has some limitations; e.g. that no viremic group of HIV-1-infected individuals was analyzed for comparison. The results are of significant interest but several issues should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One concern is the initial selection approach. Substantial variation is also observed for CXCR4- and VSV-G-mediated HIV-1 infection of cells from different donors (Figure 1B). If this phenotype is stable (as confirmed for CCR5), selection of the most X4 and/or VSV-G resistant subgroup of individuals would also result in significant differences to other groups in subsequent analyses. Thus, the results clearly support that CD4+ T cells of some EC/VCs express relatively low levels of CCR5. Whether this occurs more frequently than in viremic individuals and was causative for control is difficult to assess and should be critically discussed.</p><p>2) A potential reason for the ECr/VCr phenotype not explored in the manuscript is that circulating CD4 T cells from ECr/VCr might be low in effector memory (EM) cells. Among CD3+CD4+ cells, the EM population can be defined by a CD45RO+/CD27- phenotype, with the CD45RO+/CD27+ population defined as central memory (CM). In blood, most CCR5+ cells (as well as MIP-1a- and -1b-producing cells) show an EM phenotype. EM cells may be more easily infected by R5-tropic viruses than are CM cells, and may also be more likely to express the virus genes when infected. If the ECr/VCr phenotype correlated with low frequencies of EM cells among total CD4 T cells, this could mean that the phenotype is not due to atypical gene transcription on a region of 3p21 in all CD4 T cells, but instead to an atypical pattern of memory CD4 T cell differentiation in which the most susceptible target cells arise less frequently. If samples are available, additional FACS analyses should be performed, incorporating the CD27 marker in their flow panel to distinguish effector memory and central memory T cells. This will also help to better assess whether T cell differentiation rather than transcription might be different. In either case, it seems that only CD45RO/RA was determined to define &quot;effector memory&quot; cells in the Results section; the term &quot;memory&quot; seems more appropriate here since effector memory represent the CD27- subset within the RA-RO+ population.</p><p>3) Susceptibility to HIV-1 was only tested and confirmed using single-round infection assays and Envs of two macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains. The resistance of CD4+ T cells (and PBMCs) from some representative individuals should be confirmed using primary CCR5-tropic HIV-1 strains (and X4 controls) in a spreading infection.</p><p>4) As ATAC-seq and Rpb1-ChIP results suggest more accessible chromatin structure and more RNA polymerase occupancy around CCR2 and CCR5 in ECr/VCr donors, the down-regulation of CCR2/CCR5 mRNA is unexpected. Can the authors provide additional information or speculation to help the reader understand these seemingly conflicting findings? Would it be useful to check repressive chromatin markers like H3K27me3 or H3K9me3 to confirm that these levels decrease the ~500 Kb region around CCR2 and CCR5? Either additional experiments or simply additional explanation may be sufficient to address this issue before publication.</p><p>5) Figure 1. The authors should plot the infectivity for each of the 21 samples showing infection with VSV-G, R5 and X4 in the same plot (X4, R5, and VSV-G normalized viruses for p24). The group data looks fine, but the reader cannot appreciate the differences of infectivity when comparing VSV-G (that enters T cells) and R5 tropic viruses. This will also allow the investigator to detect the more extreme cases where the difference between VSV-G and R5 infection are the greatest and illustrate this difference in the wild type samples. The reader would like to know the magnitude of resistance for each of the 21 samples.</p><p>6) One question is whether HIV-1-YU2, HIV-ADA, and HIV-1-VSV-G were normalized for p24 before infection. This is important to understand the magnitude of the differences among samples.</p><p>7) Figure 3. This figure showed one of the most important findings of the paper and should be plotted per sample showing the variability in control cells (no EC/VC). CCR2 and CCR5 for each sample like in Figure 3C should be shown. Again, this could help to identify the strongest phenotypes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44360.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One concern is the initial selection approach.

However, this variability is observed in all groups (Figure 1B), including Controls (Ctrl), EC/VC, and ECr/VCr, those with the resistant phenotype to R5-tropic viruses. Based upon the results observed in the first experiment (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and 1B), where we initially selected R5-tropic resistant samples, we did not observe samples with both R5-tropic and X4-tropic resistance (none of the% infected cells in EC/VC group were lower than the% infected cells in Ctrl for the X4-tropic virus used). Only UCSF-56 (see Figure 1—figure supplement 2A) showed resistance to R5-tropic with relative resistance to X4-tropic virus. To investigate whether individuals with R5-tropic resistance also had lower susceptibility to either X4-tropic or VSV G-pseudotyped virus, we correlated T cell susceptibility to R5-virus to that of X4 and also R5-virus to that of VSVG (see Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). The absence of a statistically significant correlation between R5 and X4 or R5 and VSVG infectivity suggest that activated T cells of these ECr/VCr are specifically resistant to R5-tropic virus, and susceptible to X4-tropic virus. Most importantly, these ECr/VCr T cells that are resistant to R5-tropic virus are susceptible to VSVG, used as a pan-tropic control, indicating that the R5-tropic resistance is not due to a lower ability of those T cells to be infected, rather that resistance is specific to R5-tropic virus. This information is now included in Results section and in a figure legend (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Additional evidence that these 21 T cell samples (ECr/VCr) are only resistant to R5-tropic, but susceptible to X4-tropic, virus is the fact that ccr2 and ccr5 mRNA levels were down-regulated in this group compared to Ctrl and remaining EC/VCs, with cxcr4 mRNA levels comparable between groups (Figure 2A). The fact that ccr5 mRNA levels positively correlated with the percentage of infected cells using R5-tropic virus (Figure 2B), coupled with the absence of correlation between ccr5 and cxcr4 mRNA levels, clearly support the idea that these ECr/VCr T cells were resistant only to R5-tropic and susceptible to X4-tropic and pan-tropic virus.</p><p>It is true that we cannot prove definitively that this R5-resistance phenotype is more prevalent in EC/VC compared to viremic individuals. There are three major reasons why we are unable to study HIV+ individuals who are viremic: (i) they are now quite rare in the U.S. and very difficult to recruit, especially prior to initiating therapy, (ii) it would be unethical for us to withhold ART in order to study them longitudinally (and longitudinal study is critical here to demonstrate stability and reproducibility of the phenotype, and (iii) it is very difficult to recover sufficient quantities of T cells from viremic individuals for these sorts of studies. We were able, however, to recruit 10 HIV+ progressors (Prog) on anti-retroviral therapy. Our results show that R5-resistance was only observed in a subset of EC/VC CD4+ T cells and not in those of Prog or Ctrl. We observed relative resistance to R5-tropic HIV in CD4+ T cells from ECr/VCr compared to remaining EC/VC, Ctrl, and Prog (Ctrl 1.05 ± 0.81%; Prog 0.87 ± 0.36%; EC/VC 1.09 ± 0.75%; ECr/VCr 0.20 ± 0.16%; P&lt;0.0001). However, our results showed equal susceptibility to X4-tropic HIV (Ctrl 3.07 ± 1.32%; Prog 2.79 ± 1.62%; EC/VCs 3.64 ± 1.78%; ECr/VCr 2.96 ± 2.01%) and VSV G pseudoviral particles among the groups (Ctrl 34.8 ± 9.35%; Prog 37.7 ± 6.4%; EC/VCs 29.32 ± 11.71%; ECr/VCr 32.87 ± 10.08%; data not shown). We readily admit, however, that these experiments were performed in a small scale with only 10 Prog, and additional experiments should be performed to confirm these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A potential reason for the ECr/VCr phenotype not explored in the manuscript is that circulating CD4 T cells from ECr/VCr might be low in effector memory (EM) cells. Among CD3+CD4+ cells, the EM population can be defined by a CD45RO+/CD27- phenotype, with the CD45RO+/CD27+ population defined as central memory (CM). In blood, most CCR5+ cells (as well as MIP-1a- and -1b-producing cells) show an EM phenotype. EM cells may be more easily infected by R5-tropic viruses than are CM cells, and may also be more likely to express the virus genes when infected. If the ECr/VCr phenotype correlated with low frequencies of EM cells among total CD4 T cells, this could mean that the phenotype is not due to atypical gene transcription on a region of 3p21 in all CD4 T cells, but instead to an atypical pattern of memory CD4 T cell differentiation in which the most susceptible target cells arise less frequently. If samples are available, additional FACS analyses should be performed, incorporating the CD27 marker in their flow panel to distinguish effector memory and central memory T cells. This will also help to better assess whether T cell differentiation rather than transcription might be different. In either case, it seems that only CD45RO/RA was determined to define &quot;effector memory&quot; cells in the Results section; the term &quot;memory&quot; seems more appropriate here since effector memory represent the CD27- subset within the RA-RO+ population.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we analyzed additional T cell samples from a subset of Ctrl, EC/VC, and ECr/VCr to quantify the percentage of circulating Effector Memory (EM) vs Central Memory (CM) T cells and corresponding levels of CCR5 in both populations. These results are now included in Figure 3D (see also Figure 3 legend), in the Results section, and in the Materials and methods section. Overall, the percentage of EM (CD45RO+CD27-) cells in ECr/VCr was higher than in Ctrls and EC/VCs, and CM (CD45RO+CD27+) cells being relatively lower in ECr/VCr than the other two groups (but these differences were not significant). In general, and as we expected, the percentage of EM cells and CCR5+ cells with EM phenotype were higher than that of CM cells. More interestingly, the percentages of CCR5+ cells were reduced in both EM and CM cells in ECr/VCr compared to the other two groups (Ctrl and remaining EC/VC), indicating that CCR5 levels were lower in ECr/VCr not only in EM cells, the cells that are more susceptible in general to R5-tropic virus, but also in CM cells, T cells that are typically less susceptible to R5-tropic infection. Taken together, these data suggest a transcriptional mechanism of ccr5 down-regulation associated with R5-tropic resistance in a subset of EC/VC, not a difference in EM and CM T cell populations in ECr/VCr.</p><p>In addition, the term “effector memory” has been changed to “memory” accordingly (Results section and Figure 3 legend).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Susceptibility to HIV-1 was only tested and confirmed using single-round infection assays and Envs of two macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains. The resistance of CD4+ T cells (and PBMCs) from some representative individuals should be confirmed using primary CCR5-tropic HIV-1 strains (and X4 controls) in a spreading infection.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is of interest to quantify viral kinetics using replication-competent virus. We have now included experiments with replication-competent virus using R5-tropic pNL-BaL and X4-tropic HIV-NL4-3ΔR1, showing replication curves in CD4+ T cells from representative Ctrl, EC/VC, and ECr/VCr (n=2 per group tested in triplicate, see Figure 1—figure supplement 2C). This figure demonstrates relative resistance to and reduced replication of X4- and R5-tropic virus in CD4+ T cells of ECr/VCr, compared to those of EC/VC and Ctrl, over the 21 days analyzed (see quantitation of AUC, or area under the curve). Most interestingly, infection using X4-tropic viruses demonstrated reduced infection in all EC/VC (with or without the R5-resistance phenotype by single-cycle assay), with virtual absence of replication in ECr/VCr. Importantly, this lack of replication was not associated with any cytotoxicity, as all CD4+ T cells at the end of the 3-week period were very healthy and viable, with no cell death evident. We wish to point out that the absence of differences in replication at day 3 post-infection can be explained by the fact that in the initial transfection of 293T cells to produce virus we included VSV G expression plasmid together with plasmids encoding full-length X4- or R5-tropic virus. Inclusion of the VSV G plasmid was necessary to initiate infection of the CD4+ T cells with multicycle virus (otherwise, the T cells were extremely poorly infected, at least in our hands). These data suggest relative resistance to X4-tropic virus in activated CD4+ T cells of EC/VC and suggest a more complex mechanism for ECr/VCr, other than simply down-regulation of CCR5. That single cycle X4 infectivity is normal in ECr/VCr T cells suggests an additional late block to viral replication, which is the subject of ongoing investigation. A paragraph has been included in the Results section and in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Primary viral isolates (e.g., transmitted/founder strains) were not tested here. There is no evidence in the literature that these viruses use a co-receptor other than ccr5, and the more important conclusion of our paper is that the reason that ECr/VCr T cells are relatively resistant to R5 virus is due to RNA down-regulation of ccr5 (and not CD4), which appears to be genetic in nature. Testing PBMCs would only muddy the waters since it is a mixed cell population (especially since inhibitory CD8+ T cells will be present); we performed all single cycle experiments using highly purified CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, for most of these subjects CD4+ T cells and not PBMCs were available; thus, we performed the experiments with replication-competent virus using activated CD4+ T cells instead of PBMCs. Parenthetically, if one treats PBMCs with anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence of IL2 after a few days the cell population typically ends up being mostly CD4+/CD8+ T cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As ATAC-seq and Rpb1-ChIP results suggest more accessible chromatin structure and more RNA polymerase occupancy around CCR2 and CCR5 in ECr/VCr donors, the down-regulation of CCR2/CCR5 mRNA is unexpected. Can the authors provide additional information or speculation to help the reader understand these seemingly conflicting findings? Would it be useful to check repressive chromatin markers like H3K27me3 or H3K9me3 to confirm that these levels decrease the ~500 Kb region around CCR2 and CCR5? Either additional experiments or simply additional explanation may be sufficient to address this issue before publication.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned, it is very intriguing that the observed down-regulation of ccr2 and ccr5 and lower active transcription as measured by ccr5 and ccr2 levels after immunoprecipitation using anti-Rpb1 is associated with more accessible chromatin in ECr/VCr T cells compared to that of Ctrl and remaining EC/VC. Since our results performed using anti-H3K4me3 suggest more activated chromatin markers in ECr/VCr compared to other two groups, it would be interesting to analyze repressive chromatin markers such as H3K9me3 or H3K27me3. Unfortunately, the samples were very limiting, and this could not be performed. ChIP qPCR experiments require at least 2 million CD4+ T cells and it would be necessary to perform the experiment multiple times with enough numbers of subjects per group to be confident in the results. As mentioned in the Discussion section, H3K4Me3 has been previously associated with open chromatin, correlating with higher levels of transcripts (Heintzman et al., 2007, Bernstein et el., 2005). Since our results suggest that more open chromatin over ~500Kb region on chr3, including surrounding ccr2 and ccr5, is associated with lower transcription of both genes in ECr/VCr, it is expected that repressive chromatin markers would also be decreased, despite the down-regulation of multiple genes on 3p21. We can only speculate why this is so, but one possibility is that ECr/VCr CD4+ T cells express a dominant negative transcription factor (i.e., a DN STAT, as intimated in the Discussion section), such that the cell overcompensates for reduced transcription in this region by somehow attempting to keep the chromatin even more open. This would also explain the 5-10 fold RNA down-regulation (presumably affecting alleles or genes on both chromosomes) and the fact that the R5-resistance phenotype appears to be autosomal dominant in inheritance pattern. Despite some investigation, we do not have any direct evidence for a DN transcription factor—this is also the subject of future work—and thus are loathe to include this degree of speculation in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 1. The authors should plot the infectivity for each of the 21 samples showing infection with VSV-G, R5 and X4 in the same plot (X4, R5, and VSV-G normalized viruses for p24). The group data looks fine, but the reader cannot appreciate the differences of infectivity when comparing VSV-G (that enters T cells) and R5 tropic viruses. This will also allow the investigator to detect the more extreme cases where the difference between VSV-G and R5 infection are the greatest and illustrate this difference in the wild type samples. The reader would like to know the magnitude of resistance for each of the 21 samples.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have now included plots showing single-cycle infectivity for all 21 ECr/VCr against X4, R5, and VSVG pseudotyped viruses in the same plot (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). Also, a figure showing the correlation between R5 and X4 and R5 and VSVG for all 21 ECr/VCr is also now included (see Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). A sentence has been added in the Results section. The absence of a statistically significant correlation between R5 and X4 and R5 and VSVG susceptibility suggest that these ECr/VCr are specifically resistant to R5-tropic virus, being susceptible to X4-tropic virus (note that only UCSF56 showed relative lower percentages of infectivity against R5 and X4-tropic viruses—we would like to study that subject further but have been unable to obtain more PBMCs). And, as stated above, these ECr/VCr T cells are resistant to R5-tropic viruses independent of VSVG susceptibility, indicating that the R5-tropic resistance is not due to a lower ability to be infected, due to poor cell viability or activation status, for example.</p><p>For normalization of the amount of virus used, we used infectivity on GHOST cell derivatives by performing a titration of each virus using GHOST.HI5 (for R5-tropic virus) or GHOST.X4 (for X4-tropic and VSVG pan-tropic virus) cells. Based upon the end-point titration by flow cytometry, we determined the Infectious Units per ml (IU/ml) for each lot of virus and the same quantity of IU was used to infect CD4+ T cells of the subjects (Ctrl, EC/VC, and ECr/VCr). Critically, the same volumes and tissue culture plate format were also used for the infectivity assays. With regards to normalization of the multicycle virus, this was performed on TZMbls, and the same quantity of virus was used for each of the cell samples. A paragraph has been included in the Materials and methods section to clarify how the normalization was performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) One question is whether HIV-1-YU2, HIV-ADA, and HIV-1-VSV-G were normalized for p24 before infection.

This figure showed one of the most important findings of the paper and should be plotted per sample showing the variability in control cells (no EC/VC). CCR2 and CCR5 for each sample like in Figure 3C should be shown. Again, this could help to identify the strongest phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have included individual plots for all 21 EC/VC with the resistance phenotype for CCR2 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) and CCR5 expression (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), as well as individual plots for Ctrls (normal healthy donors) for comparison. This information has been included in the Results section. Also, a graph showing the positive correlation between% ccr2 and% ccr5 has been also included (see Figure 3F) and the corresponding information has been included in the Results section and in Figure 3 legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
