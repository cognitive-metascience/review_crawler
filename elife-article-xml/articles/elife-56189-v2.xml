populations during developmental and adult stages but little is known about how developmental progenitors differ from adult progenitors. Here, we investigate the role of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) in the divergent regulation of the two different adipose progenitor cells (APCs). Using in vivo adipose lineage tracking and deletion mouse models, we found that developmental PDGFRα+ cells are adipogenic and differentiated into mature adipocytes, and the deletion of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> in developmental adipose lineage disrupted white adipose tissue (WAT) formation. Interestingly, adult PDGFRα+ cells do not significantly contribute to adult adipogenesis, and deleting <italic>Pdgfra</italic> in adult adipose lineage did not affect WAT homeostasis. Mechanistically, embryonic APCs require PDGFRα for fate maintenance, and without PDGFRα, they underwent fate change from adipogenic to fibrotic lineage. Collectively, our findings indicate that PDGFRα+ cells and <italic>Pdgfra</italic> gene itself are differentially required for WAT development and adult WAT homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PDGFRα</kwd><kwd>adipose progenitor cells</kwd><kwd>adipose tissue development</kwd><kwd>adipose tissue homeostasis</kwd><kwd>adipogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01 DK111771</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yuwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007800</institution-id><institution>Chicago Diabetes Research and Training Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30DK020595</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yuwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01 DK109027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berry</surname><given-names>Daniel C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combined fate mapping and genetic deletion studies reveal that PDGFRα+ cells and PDGFRα gene itself are required for adipose tissue development but not for adult tissue homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>White adipose tissue (WAT) is a dynamic endocrine organ that controls important physiological processes and mediates various metabolic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kershaw and Flier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spiegelman and Flier, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trayhurn and Beattie, 2001</xref>). However, the development of WAT is not well understood. Adipocytes are constantly replenished with new adipocytes derived from the stem cell pool, a process named adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cawthorn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sebo and Rodeheffer, 2019</xref>). In young adult mice, the rate of adipogenesis has been estimated at 10–15% per month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rigamonti et al., 2011</xref>), and retrospective human studies also indicate a high turnover rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spalding et al., 2008</xref>). Under homeostatic conditions, the process is relatively constant, but it is sensitive to pharmacologic, physiologic, and dietary stimuli. For instance, adipose tissues can expand from 2–3% to 60–70% of body weight in response to a positive energy balance through both hyperplasia and hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ginsberg-Fellner, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirsch and Batchelor, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hirsch and Knittle, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knittle et al., 1979</xref>). Notably, the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of diabetes treatments increases de novo adipogenesis by stimulating stem cell compartment self-renew and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang et al., 2011</xref>). Both childhood and adult obesity are caused by uncontrolled expansion of WAT and excessive lipid accumulation, which elevate the risk of metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berry et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hajer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smorlesi et al., 2012</xref>). However, the underlying differences between these two types of obesity are not clear yet. Therefore, there is a clear clinical need to investigate how WAT is developed, maintained, and expanded during developmental and adult stages.</p><p>Recently, multiple genetic fate-mapping and lineage-marking studies have been conducted to understand when and where adipose progenitor cells (APCs), which are capable to proliferate and differentiate into new adipocytes, are specified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cattaneo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanchez-Gurmaches and Guertin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sanchez-Gurmaches et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sebo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tran et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vishvanath et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). For example, it was reported that adult adipocytes, but not developmental adipocytes, are differentiated from perivascular smooth muscle actin (SMA, encoded by <italic>Acta2</italic> gene) mural cell source to reside along the blood vessel walls within WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). The following study identified that platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ) mediates the interaction and communication between adult SMA+ APC and niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2017b</xref>). Lineage tracing studies reveal that adipose mural PDGFRβ+ cells do not contribute to adult homeostasis but contribute to adipose remodeling in obese or cold exposed adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vishvanath et al., 2016</xref>). These findings reveal that adipocytes arise from diverse lineages and that there are at least two different adipose progenitor populations, including developmental progenitors used for adipose tissue organogenesis and adult progenitors used for adipose tissue homeostasis. However, the origin and identity of the developmental progenitors remain to be determined. Also, it is not clear whether developmental and adult progenitors utilize different regulatory mechanisms to give rise to functionally different adipocytes. Recent studies suggest that, even within a single adipose depot, there appear to be multiple subpopulations of adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) is a membrane-bound tyrosine kinase receptor expressed in perivascular stromal cells within a variety of tissues. PDGFRα has been commonly used as a cell surface marker for adipose progenitor identification, and multiple studies have reported that PDGFRα+ cells generate adipocytes in response to adipogenic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry and Rodeheffer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cattaneo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rivera-Gonzalez et al., 2016</xref>). For example, using <italic>Pdgfra<sup>Cre</sup>; Rosa26R<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic> mice, PDGFRα marks adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry and Rodeheffer, 2013</xref>). Also, WAT-resident PDGFRα+ cells can develop into brown-like adipocytes in response to β3-adrenergic agonist or white adipocytes in response to high-fat diet feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Recent studies have shown that there are two subsets of PDGFRα+ cells in adipose tissues delineated by CD9 expression. Whereas CD9-high PDGFRα+ cells are pro-fibrogenic and drive adipose tissue fibrosis, CD9-low PDGFRα+ cells are pro-adipogenic and make adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marcelin et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, increased PDGFRα activity drives adipose tissue fibrosis during both adult homeostasis and adipose tissue organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iwayama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). However, due to the complexity and nonspecificity of the mouse lines, our understanding of the role of PDGFRα+ cells in vivo has been limited. Further clarification of PDGFRα+ cell fate by lineage tracing studies at different time points is still needed. In addition, loss-of-function models generated in the developmental or adult adipose lineage are required to definitively determine the physiological functions of PDGFRα in different stages.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to understand the role of PDGFRα+ cells and the gene itself in different stages of adipose tissue (postnatal development and adult maintenance of WAT) using in vivo adipose lineage tracking and gene deletion systems. We found that PDGFRα+ cells are a progenitor source for postnatal WAT development but not adult WAT homeostasis. Consistently, <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expression in APCs is not essential for adult WAT homeostasis but required for postnatal WAT development. The deletion of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> in adult APCs did not disrupt adult WAT maintenance and cold-induced beige adipocyte formation. However, the deletion of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> in developmental APCs led to a significant fat reduction associated with smaller fat depots. Mechanistically, embryonic PDGFRα-deficient APCs were unable to differentiate into mature adipocytes and underwent fate change from adipogenic to fibrotic lineage. Together, our findings unraveled a dynamic requirement for PDGFRα+ cells and the <italic>Pdgfra</italic> gene itself in controlling WAT development and WAT homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Developmental adipocytes derive from a PDGFRα+ cell source</title><p>Our previous work demonstrated that adult but not developmental adipocytes emanate from a vascular smooth cell expressing smooth muscle actin (SMA) and other mural markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). However, the specific origins of developmental APCs remain unknown. We proposed to test the possibility of using PDGFRα as a fate marker for the developmental APCs. PDGFRα is a membrane-bound tyrosine kinase receptor that has been used as a cell surface marker for adipose progenitor identification. Moreover, multiple studies using several <italic>Pdgfra</italic> genetic tools have shown that PDGFRα+ cells can mark the adipose lineage and generate adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry and Rodeheffer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). We hypothesized that PDGFRα+ cells mark the developmental APCs but not adult APCs, and contribute to adipose tissue organogenesis and development.</p><p>To investigate the fate mapping of PDGFRα+ cells, we marked and monitored PDGFRα+ cells using <italic>Pdgfra<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup>; Rosa26R<sup>RFP</sup></italic> (PDGFRα-RFP) mice. Using this model, we previously reported <italic>Pdgfra<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup></italic> dependent RFP reporter expression faithfully labels adipose tissue-resident PDGFRα+ cells and their descendants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). To avoid potential off-target effects of tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ye et al., 2015</xref>) and to induce <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-dependent recombination, we provided one dose of tamoxifen at P10 (adipose tissue organogenesis) or P60 (established depots for adipocyte turnover and maintenance), and examined reporter expression at pulse (P13 or P63; pulse) or after a 2-month chase (P60 or P120). Both whole-mount staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies indicated that, at pulse (P13 or P63), PDGFRα-dependent RFP expression was restricted to the perivasculature in subcutaneous inguinal WAT (IGW), perigonadal WAT (PGW), and brown adipose tissue (BAT). As expected, mature adipocytes were not labeled as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry and Rodeheffer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, P10 to P60 chase revealed the elaboration of RFP expression into adipocytes in both male and female IGW and BAT but not in PGW suggesting the creation of new adipocytes from a PDGFRα+ source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Of note, there was strong RFP+ labeling in the male epididymis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Surprisingly, during the P60 to P120 chase, we observed minimal RFP-adipocyte labeling in IGW, PGW, and BAT depots (connected with interscapular WAT) based on whole-mount images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Consistent with the results from whole-mount imaging, there were RFP+ adipocytes in IGW and BAT depots but not PGW depots from P10-P60 chow-fed male mice (IGW 20–30%; PGW 0%; BAT 30–35%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast to developmental labeling, we observed significantly less RFP+ (roughly 2%) adipocyte labeling of WAT and BAT depots from male mice. Rather our IHC studies demonstrated the presence of PDGFRα-RFP+ cells residing in perivascular positions, similar to pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In a separate study, PDGFRα-reporter mice were administered tamoxifen at P60 and chased to P180. Again, we observed very few adipocytes labeled by PDGFRα-RFP+ cells rather these cells appeared to be restricted to the vasculature of both WAT and BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, it appears, under our conditions, that PDGFRα+ cells give rise to developmental adipocytes but not a major APCs for adult adipocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Developmental, but not adult, PDGFRα+ cells are a cellular origin of adipogenesis associated with high-fat diet and TZD feeding</title><p>It has been reported that PDGFRα+ cells contribute to adipose tissue expansion in response to high-fat diet (HFD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>).

To our surprise but in agreement with our fate-mapping studies above, we found very few PDGFRα-RFP+ generated adipocytes during the P60-120 HFD challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>).

Quantification indicated that ~90% of IGW and ~95% of brown adipocytes were RFP+ whereas only ~5% PGW adipocytes were labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The low labeling of PGW could reflect the developmental specification of this depot, as this depot has been shown to be specificed beyond P10. Together, our fate-mapping data suggest that P10 but not P60 labeled PDGFRα+ stromal vascular (SV) cells are adipogenic.

Distinct populations of APCs have been identified, but their relationship and the relevance to physiological and pathological adipose expansion remains unknown. We previously reported that there are two distinct adipose progenitor compartments, developmental and adult, which are utilized for adipose organogenesis and adipose homeostasis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). We have demonstrated that these two different progenitor pools have different microanatomical, functional, morphological, genetic, and molecular profiles. Notably, adult progenitors fate map from a SMA+ mural cell lineage while developmental progenitors do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). However, the identity of developmental APCs and the regulatory mechanisms governing WAT development and homeostasis were unclear. In the current study, we attempted to disentangle these two APC populations by using a PDGFRα tamoxifen-inducible lineage-tracing system. We found that PDGFRα+ cells generate adipocytes during development but not during adult WAT homeostasis. Further, we show that the role of PDGFRα is differentially required. For example, during development, PDGFRα signaling is important for APCs to generate mature adipocytes. On the other hand, during WAT homeostasis, PDGFRα signaling in SMA+ adult APCs is dispensable for both white and cold-induced beige adipocyte formation. Our results implicate PDGFRα as a regulator of developmental APC lineage specification and adipogenesis in turn promoting WAT organ development.</p><p>Our study provides fate-mapping and genetic evidence that PDGFRα is differentially required for adipogenesis at different times of lifespan, revealing the distinct regulatory mechanisms governing adipose tissue development versus adult adipose tissue homeostasis in vivo. Other studies also suggest the existence of distinct regulatory mechanisms for WAT development and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). It has been reported that CEBPA (CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein Alpha), a critical transcription factor expressed during adipogenesis, is not required for WAT development and maintenance during the fetal and early postnatal stage, but it is essential for the obesogenic expansion of WAT induced by HFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). ZFP423 (zinc finger protein 423), expressed in committed preadipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>), is shown to regulate adipocyte differentiation during fetal adipose development; however, in adult mice, it controls a white-to-beige phenotypic switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shao et al., 2017</xref>). Also, <italic>Adipoq</italic> driven Cre is more actively expressed at an earlier stage of the adipocyte life cycle during fetal WAT development compared to adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shao et al., 2017</xref>). AKT2 (Serine/Threonine Kinase 2) is dispensable for adipose tissue development but required for CD24+ adipose progenitor cell proliferation in postal animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeffery et al., 2015</xref>). These studies consistently indicate that developmental and adult APCs utilize distinct regulatory mechanisms to respond to developmental and nutritional cues. The findings may also hint that adipocytes generated during developmental and adult stages have distinct functions.</p><p>Our data suggest that PDGFRα signaling, specifically in SMA+ APCs, does not play a significant role in SMA+ progenitors’ differentiation into adipocytes under physiological condition. It is unclear at this point whether PDGFRα signaling in adult APCs has other important functions under pathological conditions. For example, PDGFRα signaling might be essential for the obesogenic expansion and fibrotic response of WAT induced by HFD. This hypothesis, while speculative, is consistent with several studies reported that overexpressing PDGFRα inhibits adipogenesis and promotes fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hepler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iwayama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marcelin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). A more specific study showed that a subset of PDGFRα+ cells with high CD9 expression, induced by obesity, originates pro-fibrotic cells, while those with low CD9 expression are committed to adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iwayama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). HFD feeding triggers the recruitment of PDGFRα+ cells and obesity induces CD9 expression in PDGFRα+ cells, which become fibrotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marcelin et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we cannot completely rule out the roles of PDGFRα signaling in adult APCs unless a proadipogenic and a fibrogenic challenge is done in the mice and fibrosis is assessed. It will be interesting to challenge SMA-PDGFRα-KO mice with HFD feeding and then test if PDGFRα in adult APCs plays a role in obesogenic WAT expansion.</p><p>Several groups have now reported that adipose stromal cells express PDGFRα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hepler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iwayama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marcelin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, fate-mapping studies using inducible <italic>Pdgfra-Cre</italic> have been performed in multiple labs. However, the results are strikingly different. For example, a more recent study using <italic>Pdgfra-MerCreMer</italic> lineage traced animals found that PDGFRα+ fibroblasts gave rise to brown, beige, and white adipocytes during adult homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cattaneo et al., 2020</xref>). Another study suggests that PDGFRα+ cells are bi-potential to produce both beige and HFD-induced white adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, another study suggests the balance between PDGFRα/PDGFRβ signaling determines progenitor commitment to beige or white adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). Multiple factors may account for this discrepancy. One possible explanation lies in the use of different inducible <italic>Cre</italic> models of <italic>Pdgfra</italic>. The <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-MerCreMer was produced by knocking in the inducible <italic>Cre</italic> cassette into the endogenous <italic>Pdgfra</italic> locus, which represents native <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expression; yet, it may disrupt <italic>Pdgfra</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, our <italic>Pdgfra</italic><sup>Cre-ERT2</sup> line was generated using BAC transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rivers et al., 2008</xref>), which did not affect endogenous expression but may not fully recapitulate the endogenous <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expression. Another potential factor in the difference is the <italic>Cre-loxP</italic> recombination efficiency and cell-type specificity. In a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2017a</xref>), we have characterized the <italic>Pdgfra</italic><sup>Cre-ERT2</sup> model and showed that PDGFRα-RFP<italic>+</italic> cells were 100% positive for PDGFRα antibody staining, indicating this system can specifically label the cell types of interest, which is PDGFRα+. In the current study, our FACS analysis showed less PDGFRα-RFP labeling at P60 compared to P10 WAT labeling. From our studies, it is unclear why there is less labeling; however, one notion we support is an overall total reduction in PDGFRα expressing cells within WATs. An additional exploration into this hypothesis would be critical for evaluating PDGFRα expression and function in future studies. We also noted, at P10, RFP- cells have about a third of the mRNA of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> than RFP+ cells, indicating not all of the PDGFRα+ cells underwent DNA recombination under our experimental conditions and labeling efficiency. This low labeling is consistent with a previous study by Jeffery et al, who reported that two different inducible lines of <italic>Pdgfra</italic><sup>Cre-ERT2</sup> marked adipose lineage with variable efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jeffery et al., 2014</xref>). In alignment, Rodeheffer and colleagues demonstrated the lack of significant fate mapping of PDGFRα+ cells to de novo adult WAT adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jeffery et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, our fate-mapping data using this <italic>Pdgfra</italic><sup>Cre-ERT2</sup> transgenic line suggest a previously unanticipated differential labeling and contribution of PDGFRα in WAT development and homeostasis. A likely reason we postulate for the differential contribution of PDGFRα is possibly due to the dynamic expression of PDGFRα between developmental and adult APCs.</p><p>A limitation of our studies is that our developmental fate-mapping data did not allow us to discriminate whether functionally distinct PDGFRα+ cells exist to give rise to white and brown adipocytes, or if there is a common progenitor for all adipocytes in different depots. Recent studies using single-cell RNA-sequencing reveal that distinct subpopulations of APCs in the stromal vascular fraction of WAT are present in both mouse and human adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hepler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merrick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schwalie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). It will be of future interest to perform single-cell RNA-sequencing or clonal lineage tracing to examine the heterogeneity PDGFRα+ cells and their relationship to other APCs within a single depot.</p><p>In summary, our study suggests that PDGFRα signaling plays a key role in adipose tissue development by determining adipose progenitor cell fate and in the regulation of progenitor cell dynamics under the HFD challenge. This study expands the current knowledge regarding independent adipose progenitor compartments for WAT formation and maintenance. These data highlight the key roles of the distinct APC and their different regulatory mechanism governing WAT organogenesis and homeostasis. Our results may help to discover the new therapeutic targets for treatment and prevention of both childhood and adult obesity, and the subsequent metabolic dysregulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animals were maintained under the guidelines of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Animal Care and Use Committee.

Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript presents a very interesting and high-quality body of work in a relevant topic for the field that should be published. The mouse models used, and the experiments performed are elegant and imaginative.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The authors say that adult APC don't express PDGFRα. This is mainly based on the lack of activation of an inducible cre driver by tamoxifen in &gt;P60 animals (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and related Figure F and B (there are almost no cells labelled)). It was reported previously by Jeffery et al., 2014 that two PDGFRα-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup> models (distinct from the one used here, as far as I can tell based on the Materials and methods section) didn't label APC. This paper is not mentioned in the reference list. Regarding the references that the authors use for validation of using PDGFRα cre drivers (subsection “Developmental adipocytes derive from a PDGFRα+ cell source”, second paragraph): Berry et al., 2013 don't use inducible drivers, and the Lee at al., 2012a paper uses a distinct inducible cre driver. Besides this, the authors don't directly compare the levels of expression (by RNA or protein (flow or other)) of PDGFRα between young and adult APC. Also, when the authors delete PDGFRα in adult APC with SMA-CreERT2 there is a quiet important decrease in PDGFRα mRNA in an unidentified tissue (it is not mentioned in the figure legend) suggesting that adult APC do express PDGFRα that can be deleted. Also, in Figure 2D, even the RFP- cells have as much as a third of the mRNA of PDGFRα than RFP+ cells in young animals. Also, a paper cited by the authors uses a MerCreMer approach for inducible labelling of PDGFRα expressing cells (Cattaneo et al., 2020) and the results contradict the ones in this manuscript. May all be a problem with the PDGFRα-CRE<sup>ERT2</sup> model? May it not get enough Cre activity when the mice are old by the normal tamoxifen treatments? The authors should comment more in their Discussion about these caveats and if possible, directly compare young and adult APC in these regards.</p><p>2) The authors suggest that PDGFRα signaling have no function in adult APC. The results fall short for this affirmation as the authors already point out in the Discussion because we cannot be sure of this unless a proadipogenic and a fibrogenic challenge is done in the mice and fibrosis is actually assessed. I consider that shifting their conclusion and figure legend title to directly reflect their very interesting results would be a good idea.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>3) Do PPARγtTA; TRE-Cre; TRE-H2B-GFP; PDGFRα<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice recover normal fat mass by P120 as the model put forward suggests?</p><p>4) The experiment in Figure 3C is definitive. Do the authors want to mention why there is not a more thorough analysis of these mice?</p><p>5) Figure 5 needs additional analysis of the browning status of the available tissues to fulfil the conclusion. As of now we don't know if both genotypes have same levels of UCP1 in white and brown fats.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56189.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The authors say that adult APC don't express PDGFRα.

The reason we did not do the experiments is because the levels of Pdgfrα expression between developmental and adult APCs have been reported in our previous publication Jiang et al., 2014, Figure 4K and Supplementary Figure 4B), using Pparγ-tTA; TRE-H2B-GFP AdipoTrak system. We have reported that FACS-isolated developmental APCs had lower levels of Pdgfrα expression at mRNA level (Figure 4K) compared to their adult counterpart, and flow analysis showed that the number of Pdgfrα positive cells were similar in developmental and adult PPARγ+ expressing APCs (Supplementary Figure 4B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, when the authors delete PDGFRα in adult APC with SMA-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup> there is a quiet important decrease in PDGFRα mRNA in an unidentified tissue (it is not mentioned in the figure legend) suggesting that adult APC do express PDGFRα that can be deleted.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that there is some PDGFRα expression in SMA+ cells, which has been reported in our previous published studies Jiang et al., 2014, Figure 3G and H). Flow analysis indicated that about half of the RFP labeled SMA+ cells expressed PDGFRα. In addition, quantitative PCR analysis showed that Pdgfrα expression was ~10-fold enriched in RFP labeled SMA+ cells. Therefore, we would expect that our SMA-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>; Pdgfrα<sup>fl/fl</sup> deletion model reduces Pdgfrα mRNA significantly. The tissue used for Figure 4—figure supplement 1C analyses have been added to the figure legend (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C) and text (subsection “PDGFRα in adult SMA+ APCs is not required for adult white or beige adipogenesis under physiological conditions”). Together, these data suggest that only a subset of SMA+ cells resemble APCs and the ones co-express SMA and PDGFRα may not behave as APCs. We have included this previous data in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, in Figure 2D, even the RFP- cells have as much as a third of the mRNA of PDGFRα than RFP+ cells in young animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their careful attention to this issue. Indeed, we notice the RFP- cells still have Pdgfrα expression. We think this is highly likely due to the incomplete labeling of the Cre-loxP system. Under our experimental condition (with one dose of tamoxifen at low concentration), Cre does not completely induce genetic recombination. Therefore, a subset of PDGFRα+ expressing cells are not efficiently labeled with RFP+. We have added this discussion (Discussion, fourth paragraph). The reason that we prefer to use lower dose of tamoxifen is because there are associated drawbacks using high doses of tamoxifen reported by Ye et al., 2015, (included in the second paragraph of the subsection “Developmental adipocytes derive from a PDGFRα+ cell source”), which may confound our current lineage tracing studies. We have used the method for many other inducible drivers and found that they are able to generate recombination in majority of the expected cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, a paper cited by the authors uses a MerCreMer approach for inducible labelling of PDGFRα expressing cells (Cattaneo et al., 2020) and the results contradict the ones in this manuscript. May all be a problem with the PDGFRα-CRE<sup>ERT2</sup> model? May it not get enough Cre activity when the mice are old by the normal tamoxifen treatments? The authors should comment more in their Discussion about these caveats and if possible, directly compare young and adult APC in these regards.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have discussed this discrepancy in detail in our revised manuscript. We believe that this discrepancy is likely due to multiple factors. Cre activity at different ages may contribute to the labeling efficiency and therefore lead to different lineage tracing. In addition, as pointed out in this new study Cattaneo et al., 2020, Pdgfrα-MerCreMer was produced by knocking in the inducible Cre cassette into the PDGFRα locus, which may closely represent endogenous expression but also disrupted the endogenous transcript, which may confound the findings (Ding et al., 2013). Our Pdgfrα-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup> was generated using BAC transgenic mice, which did not affect endogenous expression but may not fully recapitulate the endogenous Pdgfrα expression. Therefore, we had carefully characterized the Pdgfrα-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup> model in our previously paper Jiang et al., 2017a, (Figure 3A-E). We observed that PDGFRα-RFP+ cells were 100% positive for PDGFRα antibody staining, indicating that a high correspondence between reporter and endogenous Pdgfrα expression. In addition, we found that the recombination efficiency was high (70%). The only difference compared to this study was that we reduced the tamoxifen injection just for one day instead of 2 days. In this new version, we have expanded our discussion about these different systems used (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors suggest that PDGFRα signaling have no function in adult APC. The results fall short for this affirmation as the authors already point out in the Discussion because we cannot be sure of this unless a proadipogenic and a fibrogenic challenge is done in the mice and fibrosis is actually assessed. I consider that shifting their conclusion and figure legend title to directly reflect their very interesting results would be a good idea.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that our data show that PDGFRα signaling specifically in SMA+ cells does not play a significant role in SMA+ progenitors’ differentiation into adipocytes under physiological condition. It is unclear at this point whether PDGFRα signaling in adult APCs has other important functions under pathological conditions. For example, PDGFRα signaling might be essential for the obesogenic expansion and fibrotic response of WAT induced by HFD. This hypothesis, while speculative, is consistent with our developmental fate-mapping data under HFD condition. Further study is required to address the question of obesogenic expansion cellular source and regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, we would like to soft-pedal some of these statements and have shifted our conclusions (Abstract), text (Introduction, last paragraph, subsection “Developmental and adult PDGFRα+ cells have distinct molecular and functional signatures”, last paragraph) and figure legend of (Figure 4 and Figure 5), and discussed this in detail in the revised manuscript Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>3) Do PPARγtTA; TRE-Cre; TRE-H2B-GFP; PDGFRα<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice recover normal fat mass by P120 as the model put forward suggests?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is an important question to ask, which we have not addressed in the manuscript. If these mice recover normal fat mass by P120, just like the Pdgfrα-Cre; Pparγ<sup>f/f</sup>, the data will further support our model. However, if we do not see the mice regain fat mass, we still cannot rule out our model. This is because adult APCs may need the precise environment to function, such as the extant structure and establishment of developmental depot. One way to circumvent this limitation is to use the Dox-off system, Dox will be added before conception and throughout embryogenesis until P60. That is; Pdgfrα will be conditionally deleted in adult intact WAT at P60 therefore avoiding developmental WAT defects. In the future studies, we will perform both experiments: 1) without Dox treatment, analyze the mice at P120; 2) with Dox on until P60 and then off Dox from P60-P120, then analyze the mice at P120.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The experiment in Figure 3C is definitive. Do the authors want to mention why there is not a more thorough analysis of these mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that our Pdgfrα-Cre; Pparγ<sup>f/f</sup> experiments were only focused on adipose tissue size and morphology. And we observed these mice had a severe loss of WAT tissue at P60 but regained WAT size when we analyzed the tissues at P120. However, these mice were recently generated and we have not fully characterized other phenotypes of these mice in detail. Therefore, we would remove the data from this manuscript if the reviewers agree. We will expand these mice and further analyze their adiposity and metabolic phenotypes together with our Pdgfrα-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>-DTA (cell ablating model) in the near future when we have more litters and the Covid-19 pandemic subdues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5 needs additional analysis of the browning status of the available tissues to fulfil the conclusion.
