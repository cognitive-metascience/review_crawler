fully understood. Conserved fission yeast NDR (Nuclear Dbf2-Related) kinase Orb6 governs cell morphogenesis in part by spatially controlling Cdc42 GTPase. Here we describe a novel, independent function for Orb6 kinase in negatively regulating the recruitment of RNA-binding protein Sts5 into RNPs to promote polarized cell growth. We find that Orb6 kinase inhibits Sts5 recruitment into granules, its association with processing (P) bodies, and degradation of Sts5-bound mRNAs by promoting Sts5 interaction with 14-3-3 protein Rad24. Many Sts5-bound mRNAs encode essential factors for polarized cell growth, and Orb6 kinase spatially and temporally controls the extent of Sts5 granule formation. Disruption of this control system affects cell morphology and alters the pattern of polarized cell growth, revealing a role for Orb6 kinase in the spatial control of translational repression that enables normal cell morphogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14216.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14216.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14216.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells can grow to adopt a range of different shapes. For example, fission yeast cells maintain their rod-like shape by growing from their ends and then splitting in the middle to produce two new cells of an equal size. Like many other cells, fission yeast often responds to shortages of nutrients or other environmental stressors by growing more slowly or stopping its growth altogether. One way that this stress response is achieved is by preventing certain growth-promoting proteins from being made by storing or degrading the RNA molecules that are needed to make these proteins.</p><p>Fission yeast uses an enzyme called Orb6 to control its growth and its overall shape. This enzyme is a kinase, meaning that it adds phosphate groups on to other proteins. Orb6 controls cell growth in part by defining the scope of action of an important growth control factor, Cdc42. This is done by preventing the localization of a molecule that activates Cdc42 at the wrong places of the cell membrane, such as, for example, the cell sides.</p><p>Now, Nuñez et al. show that the Orb6 enzyme also controls growth via a completely separate mechanism. Orb6 prevents an RNA-binding protein called Sts5 from being recruited into clusters of RNA molecules and proteins called granules, and directs Sts5 to interact with another protein called Rad24 instead.</p><p>Since the RNA molecules in the granules tend to end up being degraded, preventing Sts5 from being recruited to the granules protects the RNA molecules that bind to Sts5. Many Sts5-bound RNAs encode proteins required for cell growth, and in this manner Orb6 promotes the production of these Sts5-controlled proteins to encourage normal cell growth.</p><p>In the future, Nuñez et al. would like to determine how Orb6 recognizes and responds to environmental signals to control cell growth. Further studies could also explore how Sts5 and Orb6 kinase affect the assembly of RNA-protein particles that have been implicated in diseases in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14216.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14216.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>polarized growth</kwd><kwd>NDR kinase</kwd><kwd>translational repression</kwd><kwd>P-body</kwd><kwd>RNP granule assembly</kwd><kwd>14-3-3 protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM095867</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rodriguez Pino</surname><given-names>Marbelys</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiley</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>Maitreyi E</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Chuan</given-names></name><name><surname>Verde</surname><given-names>Fulvia</given-names></name><name><surname>Nuñez</surname><given-names>Illyce</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0745129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>Maitreyi E</given-names></name><name><surname>Verde</surname><given-names>Fulvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H02503</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Toda</surname><given-names>Takashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16K14672</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Toda</surname><given-names>Takashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Toda</surname><given-names>Takashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NDR kinase Orb6 prevents RNP granule assembly and translational repression by promoting Sts5 association with 14-3-3 protein Rad24 to spatially control polarized cell growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many cellular processes, such as cell morphogenesis, migration, and asymmetric cell division, require eukaryotic cells to alter polarity and growth patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lalli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tahirovic and Bradke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Woodham and Machesky, 2014;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Knoblich, 2008</xref>).

The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> is an excellent model system to study cell morphogenesis and growth because cells have a defined cylindrical shape that enables straightforward evaluation of changes in growth and polarity. Under exponential growth conditions, fission yeast cells display a paradigmatic pattern of cell growth, growing in a monopolar fashion during early interphase and activating bipolar growth at the new cell tip once a minimal cell length has been achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mitchison and Nurse, 1985</xref>). Further, <italic>S. pombe</italic> displays a distinct morphological response to nutrient deprivation, which causes cells to divide at a shorter cell length and grow in a monopolar fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Su et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Yanagida, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yanagida et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The NDR (Nuclear Dbf2-Related) kinase family with roles in cell morphogenesis, cell growth and proliferation, mitosis, and development, is highly conserved in cells ranging from yeast to mammalian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Verde et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Verde et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zinn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hergovich et al., 2006</xref>). In humans, this subset of the AGC kinase group comprises NDR1 and NDR2 and the closely related kinases LATS1 (large tumor suppressor 1) and LATS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hergovich et al., 2006</xref>), which function downstream of the MST/Hippo kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Meng et al., 2016</xref>). While LATS1 and LATS2 kinases are central to the Hippo pathway that plays a role in organ size and tumor suppression, dysregulation of NDR kinases has been implicated in cancers such as progressive ductal cell carcinoma, melanoma, non–small-cell lung cancer, and T-cell lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adeyinka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Millward et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hauschild et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ross et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cornils et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to their link to cancer, NDR kinases function also in neuronal growth and differentiation, dendritic branching, and dendritic tiling, and have been implicated in memory and fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Emoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zallen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koike-Kumagai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stork et al., 2004</xref>). Recent work has shown that mammalian NDR1 and NDR2 promote polarity in neurons upstream of the polarity protein Par3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which NDR kinases control cell growth and polarity are not fully understood. The fission yeast NDR kinase Orb6 is a central component of the conserved morphogenesis (MOR) regulatory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hergovich et al., 2006</xref>). We previously showed that NDR kinase Orb6 has a role in the establishment of cell polarity and the control of polarized cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Verde et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Verde et al., 1998</xref>). Orb6 kinase regulates cell polarity, in part, by spatially controlling conserved GTPase Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das et al., 2009</xref>), via inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc42 guanine exchange factor (GEF) Gef1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe a novel role for Orb6 kinase, genetically separable from its control of the Cdc42 pathway, in promoting polarized cell growth by inhibiting translational repression. Translational repression, carried out in part by the assembly of cytoplasmic granules of ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), is a quick and reversible cellular strategy for inhibiting cell growth in response to stress, such as nutritional deprivation, oxidative stress, or osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Decker and Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kedersha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jud et al., 2008</xref>). P-bodies, stress granules, and other RNPs such as neuronal transport granules and germ granules play important roles in mRNA regulation with implications for human diseases such as ALS, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ramaswami et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chahar et al., 2013</xref>). P-bodies in particular contain mRNA decay machinery and serve as sites of storage or degradation for mRNAs during times of cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Decker and Parker, 2012</xref>). In this work, we describe a novel mechanism whereby NDR kinase Orb6 negatively regulates the recruitment of mRNA-binding protein Sts5 into RNP particles and Sts5 localization to P-bodies at least in part by promoting Sts5 interaction with 14-3-3 protein Rad24. This mechanism of control prevents the degradation of mRNAs encoding proteins important for polarized cell growth and cell morphogenesis during exponential cell growth, and promotes morphological adaptation during nutritional stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of RNA-binding protein Sts5 suppresses the cell viability defects of <italic>orb6</italic> mutants</title><p>We observed that loss of Orb6 kinase activity by chemical inhibition of analog-sensitive Orb6-as2 kinase by the ATP analogue 1-NA-PP1 leads to cell separation defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,c; B</xref>) and slow growth, in addition to polarity defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das et al., 2015</xref>).

This mechanism controls the levels of mRNAs encoding proteins important for polarized cell growth and cell separation. During interphase, Orb6 inhibits Sts5 recruitment in a manner that is biased towards the old end in small cells, thus promoting normal cell morphogenesis and partially constraining extensile growth at the second, newer cell tip. Extensive Sts5 recruitment into smaller puncta during mitosis and into larger RNP granules during nutritional stress may allow proper septum deposition and modulates morphological adaptation to limiting nutrient availability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this article, we define a novel mechanism that spatially regulates polarized cell growth and cell morphology in fission yeast during exponential cell proliferation and in response to environmental stressors, such as increased temperature or cell density. Under exponential growth conditions, fission yeast grow in a monopolar fashion during early interphase and activate growth at the new cell tip once a minimal cell length has been achieved.

We have previously shown that NDR kinase Orb6 promotes cell polarity and regulates bipolar growth by spatially restricting the activation of Cdc42 GTPase, a key morphology control factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das et al., 2009</xref>). We recently showed that Orb6 negatively regulates Cdc42 activation by promoting the association of Cdc42 Guanine Exchange Factor (GEF) Gef1 with 14-3-3 protein Rad24, and thus limiting Gef1 activity at the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das et al., 2015</xref>). This function has the effect of spatially regulating Cdc42 activation, thus promoting the emergence of cell polarity.</p><p>In this article, we describe a genetically separable role for Orb6 kinase in the control of polarized cell growth and cell separation. We report that Orb6 kinase regulates the association of mRNA-binding protein Sts5, another Orb6 substrate target, with 14-3-3 protein Rad24. This association prevents the recruitment of Sts5 into cytoplasmic puncta (see hypothetical model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Orb6 localization varies during the cell cycle, increasing at the cell tips during interphase and at the cell septum during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Verde et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wiley et al., 2003</xref>). In small cells that have not yet undergone NETO, or in the monopolar <italic>tea1Δ</italic> mutant cells, Orb6 is enriched at the one growing cell tip. Consistent with a role for Orb6 in inhibiting Sts5 assembly into puncta, we have observed that Sts5-3xGFP puncta are spatially anti-correlated with Orb6 kinase activity and are preferentially localized near non-growing cell tips, which are depleted of Orb6 kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Because Orb6 kinase is enriched at growing cell tips, this method of Sts5 regulation might promote the availability of Sts5-targeted mRNAs for translation near sites of polarized growth, while partially constraining growth at the non-growing, newer cell tip. Consistent with this idea, an increased percentage of <italic>sts5Δ</italic> cells exhibit a bipolar pattern of growth, as compared to control cells of similar length.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14216.027</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>A model of spatial control of translational repression and polarized growth by Orb6 kinase and mRNA binding protein Sts5.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Orb6 kinase prevents Sts5 recruitment into larger RNP granules by promoting the association between Sts5 and the 14-3-3 protein Rad24.

(<bold>B</bold>) In small monopolar cells Orb6 kinase is localized at the growing old end. Sts5 recruitment in larger granules is observed at the new end, lacking Orb6 kinase activity. In larger bipolar cells Orb6 kinase is localized at both cell tips, and Sts5 recruitment is reduced at both cell ends and throughout the cell. During mitosis, Orb6 kinase is inactivated by the SIN pathway, which allows Sts5 recruitment into larger RNP granules and translational repression. Once cell separation is complete, Orb6 kinase activity resumes, promoting Sts5 disassembly, translational derepression, and cell separation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14216.027">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14216.027</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-14216-fig10-v2"/></fig></p><p>By microarray and qPCR analysis we found that several transcripts, previously implicated in bipolar growth activation, accumulate in <italic>sts5Δ</italic> cells. These transcripts encode the putative CAMK kinase Cmk2, CAMKK kinase Ssp1, LAMMER kinase Lkh1, pseudokinase Tea5/Ppk2, and PDK1 kinase Ksg1, which promote bipolar growth activation in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koyano et al., 2010</xref>), as well as the Ras1 GEF Efc25, which affects Cdc42 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Papadaki et al., 2002</xref>). In higher eukaryotes, the homologues of these Sts5-regulated transcripts are also implicated in cell growth and morphology. CAMK signaling regulates cytoskeletal organization, plays a role in neuronal development and dendritic spine morphology, and has been shown to be increased in mouse models of cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Penzes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Passier et al., 2000</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> LAMMER kinase Doa inhibits proliferation of germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Also, Ras signaling has conserved roles in cytoskeletal organization with implications for cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shields et al., 2000</xref>). Activation of PI3K signaling via PDK1 kinase has been implicated in cancer, and PDK1 has been found to regulate cell growth, proliferation, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mora et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with Orb6 kinase inhibiting the extent of Sts5 recruitment during exponential growth, Sts5-containing cytoplasmic puncta assemble during the later stages of mitosis when Orb6 kinase activity is blocked by the SIN pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Vaggi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gupta et al., 2014</xref>). Sts5 recruitment during cytokinesis may function to prevent inappropriate translation of proteins involved in septum degradation while the septum is still forming. Indeed, <italic>sts5∆</italic> cells lyse at the cell septum, in particular upon stress. Once cytokinesis is complete and Orb6 kinase is once again active, Sts5 localization is again diffuse in the cytoplasm, perhaps to allow expression of hydrolases required for cell separation. Consistent with this idea, <italic>orb6</italic> mutants delay cell separation. We did not find obvious induction of P-body formation during mitosis or interphase, likely preventing the degradation of Sts5-regulated transcripts that will eventually be needed for cell separation and polarized cell growth. This result suggests that P-body independent, Sts5-containing RNPs are formed during mitosis and that additional stress signals are required for Sts5 to seed P-body formation under nutritional limitation conditions.</p><p>Sts5 bears closest homology to RNA exonucleases such as fission yeast Dis3L2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Malecki et al., 2013</xref>). In humans, hDis3L2 is of particular interest because it has been implicated in the congenital Perlman syndrome, which confers fetal overgrowth and susceptibility to Wilms tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Astuti et al., 2012</xref>). Whereas Sts5 lacks crucial amino acids required for exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Malecki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Uesono et al., 1997</xref>), our work shows that Sts5 promotes mRNA degradation likely by promoting the interaction of Sts5-associated transcripts with P-body components. Similar to Sts5, Dis3L2 also localizes to P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Malecki et al., 2013</xref>), as well as the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> homologue of Sts5, Ssd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jansen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kurischko et al., 2011</xref>). These findings suggest that, differently from the related exonuclease Dis3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>), this group of RNA-binding proteins employs a mechanism of mRNA degradation that does not involve interaction with the exosome. However, it is likely that Sts5 and Dis3L2 have different roles in P-body assembly and/or recruitment of mRNAs to P-bodies. Indeed, deletion of the <italic>sts5</italic> homologue <italic>dis3L2</italic> does not suppress the growth defect observed upon Orb6-as2 kinase inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

We have not observed enrichment of Sts5 at the sites of polarized growth in <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells, which may employ a different strategy for ensuring adequate mRNA localization in daughter cells.</p><p>Our work indicates that Sts5 may function as a seed for P-body formation under stress and upon Orb6 kinase inhibition. P-bodies and similar RNPs have been shown to have liquid properties and their formation has been described as condensation by a phase-separation mechanism once P-body components reach critical concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brangwynne, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker and Gitler, 2015</xref>). It has been proposed that mRNA-binding proteins may play a role in the aggregation of mRNPs into larger structures, especially proteins containing intrinsically disordered domains, which have the potential to promote phase separation by forming multiple weak protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Malinovska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Toretsky and Wright, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, Sts5 may have the ability to function in mRNP granule formation through interactions with other P-body proteins, and one function of Orb6 phosphorylation may be to limit Sts5 recuitment to prevent inappropriate seeding of P-bodies. Consistent with this idea, Sts5 displays a predicted disordered domain at the N-terminus, which is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kettenbach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carpy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wilson-Grady et al., 2008</xref>). Future experiments will address how phosphorylation of this domain modulates the function of Sts5 and affects its properties <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>We found that Sts5 has a role in the morphological response to nutritional stress. Wild type <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells mount characteristic morphological responses to changing environmental conditions: increased temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mitchison and Nurse, 1985</xref>), decreased nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costello et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Su et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Yanagida, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yanagida et al., 2011</xref>), and hyper-osmotic stress decrease the incidence of bipolar growth activation and alter overall cell dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rupes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Robertson and Hagan, 2008</xref>). The mechanisms that modulate cell morphogenesis and polarized cell growth in response to varying growth and environmental conditions are still poorly understood. We find that <italic>sts5Δ</italic> mutants delay the adaptation to starvation conditions, maintaining bipolar growth and a longer cell length as cell density increases and the medium becomes depleted of nutrients. This effect appears to be further exacerbated at higher temperatures (36°C), where <italic>sts5Δ</italic> cells become enlarged and bloated, with increased protein levels of the CAMKK Ssp1. Our findings indicate that <italic>sts5Δ</italic> mutants have defects in adapting to nutrient deprivation or temperature increase, and fail to manifest the appropriate morphological response to varying extracellular conditions. Thus Sts5 may integrate diverse nutritional and environmental signals to coordinate changes to the pattern of cell growth.</p><p>In summary, our results support a role for NDR kinases in the spatial control of polarized cell growth, during cell proliferation and in response to the nutritional environment by mediating the translational availability of specific mRNAs. Future research will seek to identify nutrient-sensitive signaling pathways upstream of Orb6 and define the specific roles of Orb6 kinase and Sts5 in the control of P-body assembly. Due to the conservation of these factors, this work has the potential to open new avenues of research linking nutrient-sensitive signaling and P-body regulation with implications for studies of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and cell culture</title><p><italic>S. pombe</italic> strains used in this study are listed in the supplement in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Custom Stellaris DNA probes targeted against <italic>ssp1</italic> mRNA were coupled to Quasar 705 (BioSearch Technologies). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and washed with buffer B (1.2 M sorbitol, 100 mM KHPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.5) Cell walls were digested for 30 min in spheroplast buffer (1.2 M sorbitol, 100 mM KHPO<sub>4</sub> at pH 7.5, 20mM vanadyl ribonucleoside complex, 20 μM β-mercaptoethanol) containing 5% Zymolyase 20T at room temperature. Cells were pelleted (taking care to spin cells at ≤500 rpm for 3–5 min between washes in steps after the Zymolyase digestion) then washed in buffer B. Cells were then incubated in 1 mL of -80°C methanol, stored overnight at -20°C, incubated in 1 mL of acetone for 1 min, and then washed twice in 1 mL of 2X SSC (0.3 M NaCl, 30 mM sodium citrate). Cells were preincubated at 37°C in 50 μl of hybridization buffer, consisting of a 1:1 ratio of Buffer F (20% formamide, 10 mM NaHPO4 at pH 7.0) and Buffer H (4X SSC, 4 mg/ml,1 purified BSA and 20mM vanadyl ribonuclease complex) and 2 μl of 10-mg/ml salmon-sperm DNA (which was boiled for 3 min at 95°C). After 1 hr of prehybridization, 0.5 μl of 12.5 μM Quasar 705-conjugated <italic>ssp1</italic> probe was added, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 5 hr. Cells were washed two times with 2X SSC and resuspended in 2X SSC buffer. Object-based colocalization analysis (based on the distance between centers of mass) was performed using the ImageJ plugin JACoP (Just Another Colocalization Plugin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>). For threshold selection, we adapted a method similar to one previously described for image threshold selection of RNA FISH images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Raj et al., 2008</xref>). Specifically, we applied a Laplacian of Gaussian filter to reduce noise and highlight areas of rapid change in each cell and chose the threshold where the histogram reached a plateau, indicating a region where above-background pixels can be clearly detected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Glucose depletion in Orb6 overexpressing cells</title><p>pREP3X-Orb6- and pREP3X-carrying cells expressing Sts5-3xGFP and Dcp1p-mCherry were grown in absence of thiamine for 18 hr at 32°C. Cells were then washed once in minimal medium minus glucose and resuspended in minimal medium containing 2% or 0% glucose and the required supplements. Cultures were incubated at 32°C for 1 hr before visualizing the localization of Sts5-3xGFP and Dcp1-mCherry using fluorescence microscopy.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Juan Rodriguez for technical support and Dr. Seth Schwartz for help with statistical data analysis.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Aaron Gitler, and the evaluation has been overseen by J. Paul Taylor as Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that the current submission of your work cannot be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, at least in its current form.</p><p>Please be aware that the Senior Editor, the Reviewing Editor and the 3 additional referees deliberated extensively over this submission. The mechanism described – phosphorylation-dependent control of RNA-binding protein assembly with P-bodies, with consequential spatial and temporal regulation of the expression of a subset of mRNAs – is of great interest to us. The major weakness is insufficient characterization of mRNA interactions with Sts5, demonstration of spatial redistribution of these mRNAs to P-bodies, and correlation with changes in mRNA stability. These concerns, in addition to those elaborated by the reviewers below, would require more extensive additional work than we typically allow for in a revision. We request that revised manuscripts be returned within 2 months. That said, if you are able to address these concerns fully, we would encourage submitting a new manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Non membrane-delimited subcellular compartments play critical cellular functions essential for life. These include P-bodies and stress granules (SGs), which are composed of RNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Many of the protein constituents of SGs and P-bodies contain domains resembling yeast prions (called prion-like domains or low-complexity domains). These domains afford the protein a remarkable ability to undergo phase transitions. There has been an emergence of interest in this phenomenon since it has broad implications on gene regulation and many other facets of biology.</p><p>This new manuscript by Verde and colleagues presents a very exciting discovery showing how a similar phenomenon can be used to regulate polarized cell growth. They show that the fission yeast protein Sts5 forms RNA granule like accumulations during mitosis and this is negatively regulated by a kinase, Orb6. Remarkably, the aggregation of Sts5 serves to sequester certain key polarized growth protein encoding mRNAs. This is a novel example of how regulated aggregation can be harnessed by cell biology to regulate a fundamental biological process.</p><p>The authors have combined high quality imaging, biochemistry, and mRNA analyses to provide compelling evidence to support this novel cellular function for Orb6 and Sts5. In a broader way, they have opened up the possibility that similar phase separations can be harnessed in biology to regulate many other fundamental processes.</p><p>In my opinion, this manuscript will be of interest to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic> and will make an important conceptual advance. There is only one area that I suggest the authors consider:</p><p>Several recent studies have demonstrated that some RNA-binding proteins, such as hnRNPA1 and FUS can undergo liquid-liquid demixing <italic>in vitro</italic> (e.g., Patel et al., Cell 2015; Molliex et al., Cell 2015; Lin et al., Mol Cell 2015). I suggest the authors perform experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> to see if Sts5 can form similar liquid compartments and, if so, if the phosphorylation by Orb6 alters these properties. One part of this story that seems less well developed is the precise role of Orb6 in negatively regulating Sts5 aggregation. The <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with defined components might help to better define this mechanism.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript presents a novel (to my knowledge) study into links between polarized growth and mRNA regulation in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. The authors provide both genetic and biochemical evidence for negative regulation of the RNA-binding protein, Sts5, by the NDR kinase, Orb6. Orb6 inhibits Sts5 assembly into puncta, the association with P-bodies, and degradation of Sts5 target mRNAs. They show that Orb6 acts through regulating Sts5's interaction with Rad24.</p><p>This work describes a new role for Orb6 kinase in the control of polarized growth independent of Cdc42 pathways. The broad interest and novelty of the work are related to the molecular regulation of RNP body assembly and function by a conserved kinase and the ability to see this regulation highly spatially controlled in the cytoplasm. Below are suggested experiments that could solidify the links in the model but overall I am in favor of publishing this manuscript.</p><p>1) The evidence of translational control is limited to a single protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The authors present evidence that Orb6 inhibits Sts5-association with P-bodies. This in turn promotes stability and perhaps translation of Sts5 bound mRNAs encoding polarity factors. Confidence in the generality of this mechanism would be increased levels of other putative proteins were measured and if Ssp1 was more deeply analyzed. Are Ssp1 protein levels changing in a different mutant that cannot form P-bodies? Do Ssp1 levels change during cell stress and cell division when Sts5 is clearly forming cytoplasmic puncta?</p><p>2) Are the mRNAs identified by microarray as controlled by Sts5 changing localization consistent with the model of spatial control of repression/degradation/translation? It would be good to have some other validation of mRNA regulation beyond just the microarrays. Would it be possible to try single molecular RNA FISH and see how distribution changes from clustered as would be if in large RNPs or distributed throughout cytosol? This tool would allow the visualization of local changes in localization of Sts5 mRNA targets in response to Orb6 inhibition or cellular stress and help distinguish, potentially, between the functions of the mitotic Sts5 puncta and P-bodies.</p><p>3) Is Sts5 an in vivo target of Orb6 in cells? The results suggest that Orb6-dependent phosphorylation of Sts5 regulates its association with P-bodies or Rad24. Although the authors present an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay result to demonstrate that Orb6 can phosphorylate Sts5, further evidence of Sts5 as a direct substrate in vivo would be more convincing. This in turn would allow the generation of mutants that are not phosphorylatable to actually demonstrate that phosphorylation is the trigger of disassembly of cytoplasmic puncta. Alternatively, does Sst5 form &quot;aggregates&quot; <italic>in vitro</italic> and are these disassembled by Orb6 kinase?</p><p>4) Does Orb6 overexpression cause an inability of the cell to react properly to stress?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors show that the lethality of the NDR kinase Orb6 can be suppressed by loss of function in the RNA-binding protein Sts5. They show that Sts5 is phosphorylated by Orb6 kinase, which promotes its association with 14-3-3; forms aggregates upon starvation or upon loss of Orb6 activity; and associates with several mRNAs, including <italic>ssp1</italic> mRNA. Sts5 loss of function leads to increased levels of these and other mRNAs, indicating Ssp5 promotes mRNA degradation. They propose that Orb6 phosphorylation of Sts5 promotes its association of 14-3-3 to antagonize its association with P-bodies, thus preventing the degradation of key mRNA for polarized growth. They further propose that this regulation is spatially regulated, with Sts5 aggregates forming preferentially at the non-growing cell end of monopolar cells; and temporally regulated, with Orb6-mediated inhibition taking place during mitosis and cytokinesis but being relieved upon contractile ring closure.</p><p>The ideas put forward by this study are interesting and largely novel. However, I find that several parts of the model are not well supported by the data shown, with some inconsistencies. Several key points are overstated in the text relative to the data shown, which in aggregate fail to convince me of the whole narrative. These are detailed below.</p><p>Genetic interaction of <italic>sts5</italic> and <italic>orb6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>):</p><p>The authors identify <italic>sts5</italic> loss-of-function as suppressor of <italic>orb6</italic> mutation lethality and show some evidence that this suppression is separable from the role of Orb6 in regulating Cdc42 activity. The suppression data is convincing, but the separation of function is less so. In the growth assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, single colonies cannot be seen in the higher dilutions and the <italic>gef1∆</italic> single mutant strain appears very sick. From this assay, one could argue that the <italic>gef1∆ orb6-as</italic> double mutant actually grows better than the single mutant. This should be clarified. In addition, if the <italic>orb6-sts5</italic> control of growth is really genetically separable from the spatial control of Cdc42, this would predict that Sts5 loss of function does not correct the round shape of <italic>orb6</italic> mutants (at permissive temperature) because of Cdc42 activity presence on cell sides, i.e. <italic>sts5-276 orb6-as</italic> double mutant treated with PP1 inhibitor at 25°C should be round. Is this the case?</p><p>I am not sure I understand exactly what is quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, it is shown that 60% of <italic>orb6-as2</italic> cells are septated. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, only non-septated cells are shown with CRIB signal on cell sides, with quantification that amounts to 80%. Clearly 60+80&gt;100, so I am not sure how to reconcile these numbers. If only a subset of cells is quantified, this should be specified. Also, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the authors indicate a standard deviation from only n=2 experiments, which cannot be derived.</p><p>Formation of Sts5 punctae, association with P-bodies, mRNA degradation and regulation by Orb6:</p><p>The authors show that starvation or Orb6 kinase inhibition leads to formation of Sts5 punctae that colocalize with P-body marker Dcp1. Sts5 loss of function also leads to a reduction in the number of P-bodies after Orb6 inhibition, implicating Sts5 in the formation of P-bodies. However, they do not examine the role of Sts5 in P-body formation upon starvation, when P-body structures are much more prominent. Does Sts5 also play a role in the formation of P-bodies upon starvation? During N-starvation, it looks like there is only a partial colocalization of Sts5 with Dcp1. This should be stated in the text.</p><p>Regarding mRNA levels, the data on <italic>ssp1</italic> mRNA level regulation is convincing, with epistasis of Sts5 over Orb6, indicating that Orb6 prevents Sts5-mediated degradation of Ssp1 mRNA. However, epistasis is not shown for any of the other transcripts examined. This would be required for the authors to make their claim of a general finding.</p><p>The link between aggregate formation, P-bodies and mRNA degradation is also not clear. The authors state, in the Results section, subsection “Orb6 kinase inhibits Sts5 aggregation and Sts5 localization to P-bodies”, that &quot;Orb6 kinase prevents [...] Sts5 localization to P-bodies, with the effect of preventing the degradation of specific mRNAs&quot; and, in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion section, that &quot;Sts5 promotes mRNA degradation likely by recruiting transcripts to processing (P) bodies&quot;. However, the observed increased level of several mRNAs in the <italic>sts5∆</italic> strain does not correlate with the colocalization of Sts5 with P-bodies: the latter is shown upon starvation, whereas the mRNA levels are examined in normal growth conditions. Similarly, in <italic>rad24∆</italic> where there is no obvious colocalization of Sts5 with P-body markers, the authors claim Ssp1 levels are reduced (whether this is actually the case is also an issue – see below). From this, it appears that formation of aggregates and mRNA level regulation are not causally linked. It is equally possible that aggregation is a consequence of the <italic>sts5</italic> interaction with/degradation of mRNAs or that the two effects or not directly causally related.</p><p>The kinase assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> lacks a negative control to state that Orb6 kinase phosphorylates Sts5. What is shown is that a Mob2-associated kinase phosphorylates Sts5. This may indeed be Orb6, but should be accurately described in the text.</p><p>Kinase assay and 14-3-3 role:</p><p>This part is not very convincing with text and figures showing a number of inconsistencies and over-interpretations.</p><p>The authors state (Results section, subsection “14-3-3 protein Rad24 negatively regulates Sts5 aggregation”) that &quot;<italic>ssp1</italic> mRNA levels are consistently reduced in <italic>rad24∆</italic> mutants&quot;, but the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> does not state a statistically significant difference between wt and <italic>rad24∆</italic> strains. The fact that the levels are significantly reduced in <italic>rad24∆</italic> compared to <italic>sts5∆</italic> or <italic>sts5∆ rad24∆</italic> double mutants does not indicate anything about the possible role of Rad24, simply that Sts5 promotes Ssp1 degradation.</p><p>Similarly, the authors propose on later in the Results section that &quot;Orb6 inhibits [...] Sts5 localization to P-bodies by promoting its interaction with 14-3-3 protein Rad24.&quot; However, the data shows that Sts5 forms aggregates in <italic>rad24∆</italic> cells, but I do not see evidence that they contain Dcp1 P-body marker (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The authors indeed actually write that P-body formation is not strongly induced in <italic>rad24∆</italic>.</p><p>Temporal regulation:</p><p>The proposed anti-correlation of Ssp5 aggregates with Orb6 activity during cell division is interesting, but is poorly supported. Previous work had shown that Orb6 activity is inhibited by SIN signaling until closure of the contractile ring. Here, the authors rely solely on this published evidence to propose a causal link between Ssp5 aggregate dissipation during septation and Orb6 activity. They should at least precisely quantify the number of aggregates over time during cytokinesis. For this a timelapse acquisition of Sts5-3xGFP would be best, relative to a cytokinesis marker to time the progression of ring constriction. They should also show that any disappearance of Sts5 aggregates is indeed due to Orb6 activity, using either of their <italic>orb6-as</italic> or <italic>orb6</italic> ts alleles.</p><p>The localization of Orb6-GFP during cell division, claimed to be shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 2C, is not shown. That figure legend is also present at the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>The cell lysis phenotype of <italic>sts5∆</italic> cells should be quantified.</p><p>Spatial regulation:</p><p>In general, the spatial regulation of this mRNA stabilization control is not very convincing. The asymmetry in the aggregates of Sts5 is rather difficult to see. It is well documented in <italic>tea1∆</italic> cells, but less so in wt cells. Could the authors provide more examples to show the Sts5 asymmetric localization in monopolar wt cells? The authors propose the existence of an Sts5 phosphorylation gradient. This is an interesting idea, with conceptual similarity to gradients of MEX-5 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that contribute to the dissolution of P-granules, but is it actually possible at the small scale of a yeast cell? Diffusion rates in the cytosol, if Sts5 diffuses unimpeded, makes this unlikely, but it could be constrained through aggregate formation. Examination of the motility of Sts5 aggregates would help to resolve this point.</p><p>I am also not convinced that Sts5 has a direct role in regulating bipolar growth. As the <italic>sts5∆</italic> mutant cells are longer at all densities examined, the increased proportion of bipolar cells could simply be a result of the longer cell length. It is well established that fission yeast cells have a cell size-dependent regulation of bipolarity. The authors instead seem to argue that the increased length is a consequence of increased bipolarity, but I do not see evidence for this. For cells of equal initial length, are the <italic>sts5∆</italic> mutant cells growing faster? Are cells of same length more bipolar if <italic>sts5∆</italic>?</p><p>Allele nomenclature and temperature sensitivity:</p><p>The nomenclature of the alleles used is confusing. It should be clearly stated in the text that <italic>orb4</italic> and <italic>sts5</italic> are two names for the same gene (and as much as possible use a single gene name throughout the manuscript), and that the alleles used are both early stop codons. The authors also use a deletion of the gene, but it is not very clear which strain is used in which experiment, and why different strains were used. For instance, in second paragraph of Results section, the authors say they &quot;examined whether <italic>sts5</italic> deletion also suppresses the loss of polarity observed upon Orb6 kinase inhibition&quot;, but the figure referred to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>) states use of <italic>orb4-A9</italic> allele.</p><p>More generally, I do not understand the use of different &quot;permissive&quot;, &quot;semi-permissive&quot; and &quot;restrictive&quot; temperatures to examine the phenotype of <italic>sts5</italic> loss of function. In what way are the alleles used conditional if these are either early stop codons or deletions? This should be clearly stated and discussed. For instance, the increased levels of Ssp1-HA in <italic>sts5</italic> mutants is only shown to happen at 36°C, but the text states that the increased levels are &quot;exaggerated&quot; at 36°C (Results section, subsection “Loss of Sts5 leads to increased levels of mRNAs involved in growth control and bipolar growth activation”), which implies it is also the case at lower temperature.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Spatial control of translation repression and polarized growth by conserved NDR kinase Orb6 and RNA-binding protein Sts5&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors present genetic and biochemical evidence indicating that NDR kinase Orb6 negatively regulates the RNA-binding protein Sts5. Orb6 activity alters an interaction of Sts5 with 14-3-3, regulating the ability of Sts5 to assemble into cytoplasmic P-bodies, which sequester and influence the stability of Sts5 target mRNAs. There was consensus among the reviewers that the additional data and analyses provided in the revised manuscript addressed most of the concerns from the original review, but several issues remain that must be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Aaron Gitler, and the evaluation has been overseen by J. Paul Taylor as Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that the current submission of your work cannot be considered further for publication in eLife, at least in its current form.</italic></p><p> <italic>Please be aware that the Senior Editor, the Reviewing Editor and the 3 additional referees deliberated extensively over this submission. The mechanism described – phosphorylation-dependent control of RNA-binding protein assembly with P-bodies, with consequential spatial and temporal regulation of the expression of a subset of mRNAs – is of great interest to us. The major weakness is insufficient characterization of mRNA interactions with Sts5, demonstration of spatial redistribution of these mRNAs to P-bodies, and correlation with changes in mRNA stability. These concerns, in addition to those elaborated by the reviewers below, would require more extensive additional work than we typically allow for in a revision. We request that revised manuscripts be returned within 2 months. That said, if you are able to address these concerns fully, we would encourage submitting a new manuscript to eLife.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] In my opinion, this manuscript will be of interest to the readers of eLife and will make an important conceptual advance. There is only one area that I suggest the authors consider:</italic> </p><p> <italic>Several recent studies have demonstrated that some RNA-binding proteins, such as hnRNPA1 and FUS can undergo liquid-liquid demixing</italic> in vitro <italic>(e.g., Patel et al., Cell 2015; Molliex et al., Cell 2015; Lin et al., Mol Cell 2015). I suggest the authors perform experiments</italic> in vitro <italic>to see if Sts5 can form similar liquid compartments and, if so, if the phosphorylation by Orb6 alters these properties. One part of this story that seems less well developed is the precise role of Orb6 in negatively regulating Sts5 aggregation. The</italic> in vitro <italic>experiments with defined components might help to better define this mechanism.</italic> </p><p>Sts5 protein contains a predicted unstructured N terminal domain in the first 301 amino acids. We have included this finding in the current version of the paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The role of unstructured domains in the formation of liquid compartments and cytoplasmic phase transition is a biological problem of fundamental importance, and we plan to devote substantial effort in the future to reconstitute the behavior of Sts5 in vitro. At the moment however, we feel these experiments are beyond the scope of this paper, and it would require an entire additional manuscript to present them completely and well controlled. Also, the phosphorylation studies are complicated by the existence of other phosphorylated sites in the Sts5 molecule by which other kinases may contribute to its regulation (results of proteomic analysis: Wilson-Grady et al., 2008; Koch et al., 2011; Carpy et al., 2014; Kettenbach et al., 2015), and that may, at this time, confound the in vitro experiments.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p> <italic>[…] This work describes a new role for Orb6 kinase in the control of polarized growth independent of Cdc42 pathways. The broad interest and novelty of the work are related to the molecular regulation of RNP body assembly and function by a conserved kinase and the ability to see this regulation highly spatially controlled in the cytoplasm. Below are suggested experiments that could solidify the links in the model but overall I am in favor of publishing this manuscript.</italic></p><p> <italic>1) The evidence of translational control is limited to a single protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The authors present evidence that Orb6 inhibits Sts5-association with P-bodies. This in turn promotes stability and perhaps translation of Sts5 bound mRNAs encoding polarity factors. Confidence in the generality of this mechanism would be increased levels of other putative proteins were measured and if Ssp1 was more deeply analyzed. Are Ssp1 protein levels changing in a different mutant that cannot form P-bodies? Do Ssp1 levels change during cell stress and cell division when Sts5 is clearly forming cytoplasmic puncta?</italic> </p><p>We further characterized Efc25, the protein encoded by Sts5-bound <italic>efc25</italic> mRNA, whose levels increase in <italic>sts5Δ</italic> cells and decrease in <italic>orb6</italic> mutant cells. We found that Efc25 protein levels increase in <italic>sts5Δ</italic> cells and decrease in <italic>orb6</italic> mutants, similarly to Ssp1 protein (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1; Figure 5—figure supplement 1E).</p><p>As far as Ssp1 protein levels in mutants that cannot form P-bodies areconcerned, we have tested Ssp1 levels in <italic>pdc1Δ</italic> and <italic>edc3Δ</italic> mutant cells that encode Pbody components that regulate mRNA decapping. We found that Ssp1 protein levels are increased in the <italic>pdc1Δ</italic> and <italic>edc3Δ</italic> backgrounds (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 E and F</xref>).</p><p> <italic>2) Are the mRNAs identified by microarray as controlled by Sts5 changing localization consistent with the model of spatial control of repression/degradation/translation? It would be good to have some other validation of mRNA regulation beyond just the microarrays. Would it be possible to try single molecular RNA FISH and see how distribution changes from clustered as would be if in large RNPs or distributed throughout cytosol? This tool would allow the visualization of local changes in localization of Sts5 mRNA targets in response to Orb6 inhibition or cellular stress and help distinguish, potentially, between the functions of the mitotic Sts5 puncta and P-bodies.</italic> </p><p>Consistent with Sts5 controlling the localization of <italic>ssp1</italic> mRNA, we found that <italic>ssp1</italic> fluorescent RNA FISH probes (Stellaris) colocalize with a subset of Sts5-GFP and Dcp1- mCherry containing punta in glucose-starved cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 D). Our results are consistent with experiments published by other investigators, for example by the laboratory of Roy Parker, whose protocol we adapted (Brengues and Parker, 2007).</p><p> <italic>3) Is Sts5 an</italic> in vivo <italic>target of Orb6 in cells? The results suggest that Orb6-dependent phosphorylation of Sts5 regulates its association with P-bodies or Rad24. Although the authors present an</italic> in vitro <italic>kinase assay result to demonstrate that Orb6 can phosphorylate Sts5, further evidence of Sts5 as a direct substrate</italic> in vivo <italic>would be more convincing. This in turn would allow the generation of mutants that are not phosphorylatable to actually demonstrate that phosphorylation is the trigger of disassembly of cytoplasmic puncta. Alternatively, does Sst5 form &quot;aggregates&quot;</italic> in vitro <italic>and are these disassembled by Orb6 kinase?</italic> </p><p>Sts5 protein contains an unstructured N-terminal domain comprising the first 301 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However it is not recruited into RNPs in the absence of the mRNA-binding domain. The Sts5 sequence presents several canonical Orb6 consensus sites and other lower affinity Orb6 consensus sites that may also need to be modified to ensure maximal response. Also, the phosphorylation studies are complicated by the existence of other phosphorylated sites by other kinases in different domains of the Sts5 molecule that may contribute to its regulation (results of proteomic analysis (Wilson-Grady et al., 2007; Koch et al., 2011; Carpy et al., 2014; Kettenbach et al., 2015), and that may confound in vitro experiments. These are interesting experiments however, and are going to be the subject of extensive efforts in the lab in the future.</p><p> <italic>4) Does Orb6 overexpression cause an inability of the cell to react properly to stress?</italic> </p><p>Nutritional stress induces Sts5 recruitment to RNPs and P-body formation. Thus, we used Sts5 recruitment to RNPs and P-body formation as a read-out of stress. We have over-expressed Orb6 kinase and monitored P-body formation and Sts5 recruitment to RNPs upon glucose deprivation. We found that Orb6 overexpression significantly decreases the intensity of Sts5 puncta and P-bodies (see Figure 5— figure supplement 2A).</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p> <italic>In this manuscript, the authors show that the lethality of the NDR kinase Orb6 can be suppressed by loss of function in the RNA-binding protein Sts5. They show that Sts5 is phosphorylated by Orb6 kinase, which promotes its association with 14-3-3; forms aggregates upon starvation or upon loss of Orb6 activity; and associates with several mRNAs, including ssp1 mRNA. Sts5 loss of function leads to increased levels of these and other mRNAs, indicating Ssp5 promotes mRNA degradation. They propose that Orb6 phosphorylation of Sts5 promotes its association of 14-3-3 to antagonize its association with P-bodies, thus preventing the degradation of key mRNA for polarized growth. They further propose that this regulation is spatially regulated, with Sts5 aggregates forming preferentially at the non-growing cell end of monopolar cells; and temporally regulated, with Orb6-mediated inhibition taking place during mitosis and cytokinesis but being relieved upon contractile ring closure.</italic> </p><p> <italic>The ideas put forward by this study are interesting and largely novel. However, I find that several parts of the model are not well supported by the data shown, with some inconsistencies. Several key points are overstated in the text relative to the data shown, which in aggregate fail to convince me of the whole narrative. These are detailed below.</italic> </p><p> <italic>Genetic interaction of sts5 and orb6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>):</italic> </p><p> <italic>The authors identify sts5 loss-of-function as suppressor of orb6 mutation lethality and show some evidence that this suppression is separable from the role of Orb6 in regulating Cdc42 activity. The suppression data is convincing, but the separation of function is less so. In the growth assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, single colonies cannot be seen in the higher dilutions and the gef1∆ single mutant strain appears very sick. From this assay, one could argue that the gef1∆ orb6-as double mutant actually grows better than the single mutant. This should be clarified.</italic></p><p>The growth delay of the <italic>gef1Δ</italic> strain observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, as compared to <italic>gef1Δ orb6-as2</italic>, in the control DMSO condition, was due to a difference in the background of the strains. The <italic>gef1Δ</italic> strain was burdened by <italic>ura4Δ</italic> and <italic>leu1-32</italic> auxotrophic markers, which produced a growth difference even in the presence of exogenously added supplements. We have repeated these experiments with a different <italic>gef1Δ</italic> strain that does not contain these mutations, and found no difference in growth between <italic>gef1Δ</italic> and <italic>gef1Δ orb6-as2</italic> in DMSO. (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>)</p><p><italic>In addition, if the orb6-sts5 control of growth is really genetically separable from the spatial control of Cdc42, this would predict that Sts5 loss of function does not correct the round shape of orb6 mutants (at permissive temperature) because of Cdc42 activity presence on cell sides, i.e. sts5-276 orb6-as double mutant treated with PP1 inhibitor at 25</italic>°<italic>C should be round. Is this the case?</italic> </p><p>Indeed, we have analyzed <italic>sts5Δ orb6-as2</italic> double mutant cells, treated with 1- Na-PP1 inhibitor at 25°C for 5 hours, and found them to be round. We show this experiment in the current version of the paper (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>)</p><p> <italic>I am not sure I understand exactly what is quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, it is shown that 60% of orb6-as2 cells are septated. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, only non-septated cells are shown with CRIB signal on cell sides, with quantification that amounts to 80%. Clearly 60+80&gt;100, so I am not sure how to reconcile these numbers. If only a subset of cells is quantified, this should be specified.</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> we quantified the extent of CRIB-GFP mis-localization only in non-septating cells (cells that do not contain a septum, which indeed is a subset). We have clarified this in the corresponding legend of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>. Also, ectopic localization of CRIB-GFP is a rapid response that can be observed as early as 15 minutes after Orb6-as2 inhibition with 1-NA-PP1 (Das et al., 2009). Thus, the experimental conditions in the experiment depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> and 1D are different than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, in which we quantified septation index after prolonged Orb6- as2 inhibition (2 hours) and the proportion of septated cells was different in the two experiments.</p><p><italic>Also, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the authors indicate a standard deviation from only n=2 experiments, which cannot be derived.</italic> </p><p>As also mentioned below, we counted almost 400 cells for each condition, giving us confidence in our conclusion. The reviewer, however, is correct to point out the issue with the standard deviation. In the revised version, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> an entirely different set of three experiments using the <italic>sts5Δ</italic> strain, instead of the <italic>orb4-A9</italic> allele. This was done in response to point 6 of this reviewer, to simplify the use of different alleles. The results are entirely consistent with the previous experiment, and the 6 experiments were performed three times (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p> <italic>Formation of Sts5 punctae, association with P-bodies, mRNA degradation and regulation by Orb6:</italic> </p><p> <italic>The authors show that starvation or Orb6 kinase inhibition leads to formation of Sts5 punctae that colocalize with P-body marker Dcp1. Sts5 loss of function also leads to a reduction in the number of P-bodies after Orb6 inhibition, implicating Sts5 in the formation of P-bodies. However, they do not examine the role of Sts5 in P-body formation upon starvation, when P-body structures are much more prominent. Does Sts5 also play a role in the formation of P-bodies upon starvation?</italic> </p><p>As mentioned above, to address the role of Sts5 during nutritional stress we have performed additional experiments that were not included in the original version of the paper. In the current version, we show that loss of <italic>sts5 (sts5Δ</italic>) significantly decreases the intensity of P-bodies formed following glucose depletion. We added these experiments to the supplement section of the paper (Figure 5—figure supplement 2 B-D).</p><p><italic>During N-starvation, it looks like there is only a partial colocalization of Sts5 with Dcp1. This should be stated in the text.</italic> </p><p>We have mentioned this fact in the text (Results section, subsection “Sts5 proteins are recruited into cytoplasmic puncta during mitosis and during nutritional starvation”).</p><p> <italic>Regarding mRNA levels, the data on ssp1 mRNA level regulation is convincing, with epistasis of Sts5 over Orb6, indicating that Orb6 prevents Sts5-mediated degradation of Ssp1 mRNA. However, epistasis is not shown for any of the other transcripts examined. This would be required for the authors to make their claim of a general finding.</italic> </p><p>As mentioned above, we now characterize also <italic>efc25</italic>, another mRNA that copurifies with Sts5 protein, whose levels increase in <italic>sts5Δ</italic> cells and decrease in <italic>orb6</italic> mutant cells. Similarly to Ssp1 protein, Efc25 protein levels increase in <italic>sts5Δ</italic> cells and decrease in <italic>orb6</italic> mutants (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1; Figure 5—figure supplement 1, E).</p><p> <italic>The link between aggregate formation, P-bodies and mRNA degradation is also not clear. The authors state, in the Results section, subsection “Orb6 kinase inhibits Sts5 aggregation and Sts5 localization to P-bodies”, that &quot;Orb6 kinase prevents [...] Sts5 localization to P-bodies, with the effect of preventing the degradation of specific mRNAs&quot; and, in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion section, that &quot;Sts5 promotes mRNA degradation likely by recruiting transcripts to processing (P) bodies&quot;. However, the observed increased level of several mRNAs in the sts5∆ strain does not correlate with the colocalization of Sts5 with P-bodies: the latter is shown upon starvation, whereas the mRNA levels are examined in normal growth conditions. Similarly, in rad24∆ where there is no obvious colocalization of Sts5 with P-body markers, the authors claim Ssp1 levels are reduced (whether this is actually the case is also an issue – see below). From this, it appears that formation of aggregates and mRNA level regulation are not causally linked. It is equally possible that aggregation is a consequence of the sts5 interaction with/degradation of mRNAs or that the two effects or not directly causally related.</italic></p><p>Indeed, our data indicates that in the absence of Sts5, levels of certain Sts5- associated mRNAs are increased even in the absence of extensive or visible P-body formation. Previous findings in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> indicate that mRNA degradation proceeds to a certain extent even in the absence of substantial P-body formation. Processes such as mRNA decay and RNA-mediated gene silencing (Eulalio et al., 2007) and mRNA 7 decapping and translational repression (Decker et al., 2007) are functional in cells lacking detectable microscopic P-bodies indicating that even though P-body components play crucial roles in mRNA silencing and decay, localization of mRNAs into large P-bodies is not necessary for function. Consistent with this idea, we find that loss of P-body components Pdc1 and Edc3 leads to a significant increase in Ssp1 protein levels, even in the absence of stress, when P-bodies are not visible (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>).</p><p>As the reviewer mentions, our data also show that Sts5 recruitment into large RNPs in the <italic>rad24Δ</italic> strain does not trigger a substantial decrease in <italic>ssp1</italic> mRNA levels. Ssp1 mRNA levels, however, are decreased upon Orb6 kinase inhibition, which induces both P-body formation and Sts5 protein recruitment, in addition to other effects, such as Cdc42 activation. Thus, our data suggest that additional yet unknown signals, dependent on Orb6 kinase, are required for inducing mRNA degradation. We have clarified our conclusions in the current version of the paper (e.g. Results section, subsection “14-3-3 protein Rad24 negatively regulates Sts5 recruitment into cytoplasmic puncta”; fourth paragraph of Discussion section).</p><p> <italic>The kinase assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> lacks a negative control to state that Orb6 kinase phosphorylates Sts5. What is shown is that a Mob2-associated kinase phosphorylates Sts5. This may indeed be Orb6, but should be accurately described in the text.</italic> </p><p>We have changed the text to reflect this caveat (Results section, subsection “14-3-3 protein Rad24 negatively regulates Sts5 recruitment into cytoplasmic puncta”).</p><p> <italic>Kinase assay and 14-3-3 role:</italic></p><p> <italic>This part is not very convincing with text and figures showing a number of inconsistencies and over-interpretations.</italic> </p><p> <italic>The authors state (Results section, subsection “14-3-3 protein Rad24 negatively regulates Sts5 aggregation”) that &quot;ssp1 mRNA levels are consistently reduced in rad24∆ mutants&quot;, but the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> does not state a statistically significant difference between wt and rad24∆ strains. The fact that the levels are significantly reduced in rad24∆ compared to sts5∆ or sts5∆ rad24∆ double mutants does not indicate anything about the possible role of Rad24, simply that Sts5 promotes Ssp1 degradation.</italic> </p><p> <italic>Similarly, the authors propose on later in the Results section that &quot;Orb6 inhibits.… Sts5 localization to P-bodies by promoting its interaction with 14-3-3 protein Rad24.&quot; However, the data shows that Sts5 forms aggregates in rad24∆ cells, but I do not see evidence that they contain Dcp1 P-body marker (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The authors indeed actually write that P-body formation is not strongly induced in rad24∆.</italic> </p><p>Our conclusion from experiments detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> is that one of the roles of Orb6 kinase is to regulate association of Sts5 with Rad24 and prevent Sts5 recruitment into RNPs. Our experiments with <italic>rad24Δ</italic> mutant cells indeed show that Sts5 recruitment into RNPs occurs independently of substantial P-body formation, since these cells are not starved. We tried to be clearer in the current version of the paper. We speculate from our findings and propose that Sts5 protein regulation by Orb6 kinase is part of a mechanism ultimately regulating mRNA association with the P-bodies, since we see P-body formation upon Orb6 kinase inhibition. We also rephrased this part.</p><p> <italic>Temporal regulation:</italic></p><p> <italic>The proposed anti-correlation of Ssp5 aggregates with Orb6 activity during cell division is interesting, but is poorly supported. Previous work had shown that Orb6 activity is inhibited by SIN signaling until closure of the contractile ring. Here, the authors rely solely on this published evidence to propose a causal link between Ssp5 aggregate dissipation during septation and Orb6 activity. They should at least precisely quantify the number of aggregates over time during cytokinesis. For this a timelapse acquisition of Sts5-3xGFP would be best, relative to a cytokinesis marker to time the progression of ring constriction. They should also show that any disappearance of Sts5 aggregates is indeed due to Orb6 activity, using either of their orb6-as or orb6 ts alleles.</italic> </p><p>We have quantified the number of Sts5 puncta during cytokinesis in the presence or absence of Orb6 kinase. As a marker for cytokinesis we used Rlc1, in addition to calcofluor. Rlc1, myosin II regulatory light chain (Le Goff et al., 2000) (Wu et al., 2006), disappears from the site of division when the actomyosin ring has fully contracted and the septum is closed (Wei, 2016). We found that Sts5 puncta are present as long as Rlc1 is present at the site of division (a sign that septum closure in not complete) but disappear in cells where Rlc1 has left the site of division, after septum closure. Indicating that disappearance of Sts5 puncta is indeed due to Orb6 activity, we find that Sts5 puncta are still visible in cells that have completed septum closure (and where Rlc1 has left the site of division), when Orb6 activity is inhibited. We show these experiments in the current version of the paper (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>; Figure 7—figure supplement 2).</p><p> <italic>The localization of Orb6-GFP during cell division, claimed to be shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 2, is not shown. That figure legend is also present at the bottom of Figure —figure supplement 1.</italic> </p><p>We indeed showed the localization of Orb6-GFP at the septum in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref> (c), as the reviewer mentions. Figure 7—figure supplement 2C was a single typo, for which we apologize, as it should have read <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref> (c). We corrected this typo in the text.</p><p> <italic>The cell lysis phenotype of sts5∆ cells should be quantified.</italic> </p><p>We quantified the lysis phenotype of <italic>sts5Δ</italic> in triplicate experiments, and found that, under our experimental conditions, 43% of septating <italic>sts5Δ</italic> cells lyse at 36<italic>°</italic> C, as compared to 8% septating control cells. We added this information in the corresponding legend (see Figure 7—figure supplement 2).</p><p> <italic>Spatial regulation:</italic></p><p> <italic>In general, the spatial regulation of this mRNA stabilization control is not very convincing. The asymmetry in the aggregates of Sts5 is rather difficult to see. It is well documented in tea1∆ cells, but less so in wt cells. Could the authors provide more examples to show the Sts5 asymmetric localization in monopolar wt cells? The authors propose the existence of an Sts5 phosphorylation gradient. This is an interesting idea, with conceptual similarity to gradients of MEX-5 in C.elegans that contribute to the dissolution of P-granules, but is it actually possible at the small scale of a yeast cell? Diffusion rates in the cytosol, if Sts5 diffuses unimpeded, makes this unlikely, but it could be constrained through aggregate formation. Examination of the motility of Sts5 aggregates would help to resolve this point.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, to verify the observation of asymmetric Sts5 puncta in small monopolar cells, first observed in wild-type cells, we used <italic>tea1Δ</italic> cells since they are 9 longer, stay monopolar, and localize Orb6-GFP at only one tip. We have added more examples of small wild-type cells that reflect the average representative localization under conditions of active cell growth (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,D,E and F</xref>). To avoid confusion or overstatements, we removed the word “gradient” that was originally proposed in the discussion.</p><p> <italic>I am also not convinced that Sts5 has a direct role in regulating bipolar growth. As the sts5∆ mutant cells are longer at all densities examined, the increased proportion of bipolar cells could simply be a result of the longer cell length. It is well established that fission yeast cells have a cell size-dependent regulation of bipolarity. The authors instead seem to argue that the increased length is a consequence of increased bipolarity, but I do not see evidence for this. For cells of equal initial length, are the sts5∆ mutant cells growing faster? Are cells of same length more bipolar if sts5∆?</italic> </p><p>In response to this reviewer’s comments, we have performed two additional sets of experiments. We show that <italic>sts5Δ</italic> cells display increased bipolarity even during exponential cell growth, when <italic>sts5Δ</italic> cells display the same size (average cell length at division; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). As this reviewer suggested, we measured the percentage of bipolar cells in cells of similar length (less than 10 micrometers; from 10 to 12; more than 12), and found that <italic>sts5Δ</italic> cells display an increased percentage of bipolar cells as compared to controls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1, A</xref>) even if <italic>sts5Δ</italic> cells display the same growth rate as control <italic>sts5</italic>+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p> <italic>Allele nomenclature and temperature sensitivity:</italic></p><p> <italic>The nomenclature of the alleles used is confusing. It should be clearly stated in the text that orb4 and sts5 are two names for the same gene (and as much as possible use a single gene name throughout the manuscript), and that the alleles used are both early stop codons. The authors also use a deletion of the gene, but it is not very clear which strain is used in which experiment, and why different strains were used. For instance, in second paragraph of Results section, the authors say they &quot;examined whether sts5 deletion also suppresses the loss of polarity observed upon Orb6 kinase inhibition&quot;, but the figure referred to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>) states use of orb4-A9 allele.</italic> </p><p>We have redone the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, using the <italic>sts5Δ</italic> allele, and obtained identical results to the <italic>orb4-A9</italic> allele. Aside from growth suppression experiments detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> (done some time ago with the <italic>sts5-276</italic> allele by our collaborators at Hiroshima University) and one control experiment with CRIB-GFP (which was part of the initial screening with <italic>orb4-A9</italic> allele; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), all other experiments were performed using the <italic>sts5Δ</italic> allele. As the reviewer mentions, these are all early stop codons, and we never found the corresponding mutants to behave differently from the <italic>sts5Δ</italic> deletion mutant cells. We mentioned this aspect in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p> <italic>More generally, I do not understand the use of different &quot;permissive&quot;, &quot;semi-permissive&quot; and &quot;restrictive&quot; temperatures to examine the phenotype of sts5 loss of function. In what way are the alleles used conditional if these are either early stop codons or deletions? This should be clearly stated and discussed. For instance, the increased levels of Ssp1-HA in sts5 mutants is only shown to happen at 36°C, but the text states that the increased levels are &quot;exaggerated&quot; at 36°C (Results section, subsection “Loss of Sts5 leads to increased levels of mRNAs involved in growth control and bipolar growth activation”), which implies it is also the case at lower temperature.</italic> </p><p>In the current version of the paper, for clarity, we decided not use “restrictive” or “permissive” definitions and just state the temperature at which experiments are performed. The use of “restrictive” or “permissive” temperature refers to conditional, temperature-sensitive phenotypes, and thus it is a functional definition. Indeed <italic>sts5Δ</italic> displays a morphological phenotype that is temperature-sensitive: it is cylindrical in shape (albeit with an increase in the extent of cell growth at the new end) at 25<italic>°</italic>C, while it is enlarged and round at 36<italic>°</italic>C. These phenotypes likely reflect a decreased ability for <italic>sts5Δ</italic> cells to adapt to higher temperatures. We changed the wording in seventh paragraph, Results section.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Spatial control of translation repression and polarized growth by conserved NDR kinase Orb6 and RNA-binding protein Sts5&quot; for consideration by eLife.

The authors present genetic and biochemical evidence indicating that NDR kinase Orb6 negatively regulates the RNA-binding protein Sts5. Orb6 activity alters an interaction of Sts5 with 14-3-3, regulating the ability of Sts5 to assemble into cytoplasmic P-bodies, which sequester and influence the stability of Sts5 target mRNAs. There was consensus among the reviewers that the additional data and analyses provided in the revised manuscript addressed most of the concerns from the original review, but several issues remain that must be addressed.</italic> </p><p> <italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1. The FISH experiment showing colocalization of ssp1 mRNA with Sts5 (and Dcp1) granules is a nice addition. However, in addition to showing representative images the extent of colocalization should quantified.</italic> </p><p>We have quantified the co-localization of <italic>ssp1</italic> mRNA and Sts5 (and Dcp1) granules, and added these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>. We used the ImageJ plugin JACoP (Just Another Colocalization Plugin) to perform object-based quantification based on the distance between centers of mass of puncta (Bolte and Cordelieres, 2006). We measured, respectively, the proportion of <italic>ssp1</italic> puncta colocalizing with Sts5-3xGFP or Dcp1-mCh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>), and the proportion of Sts5-3xGFP or Dcp1-mCh puncta colocalizing with <italic>ssp1</italic> puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>), in three independent experiments, in the presence or absence of glucose.</p><p> <italic>2. Similarly, the analysis of Efc25 protein levels is a nice addition, though it needs to be quantified. An epistasis experiment to test whether deletion of sts5 abrogates the reduction in Efc25 levels observed in orb6 mutant (as shown for Ssp1) would further support the conclusion.</italic> </p><p>We have performed additional experiments, and showed that Efc25 levels decrease in inhibitor sensitive <italic>orb6-as2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We also found that <italic>sts5</italic> deletion abolishes the reduction of Efc25 levels in <italic>orb6-as2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We have quantified the results of three independent experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>, right panel.</p><p> <italic>3. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, the statistical comparisons should be done between rad24∆ and wt, not between rad24∆ and sts5∆.</italic></p><p>We have changed the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> in the current manuscript)appropriately to reflect the message of the experiment, that there is not a significant difference in <italic>ssp1</italic> mRNA levels between <italic>rad24∆</italic> and <italic>wt.</italic> P values were determined using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with SPSS statistics package 22.0, followed by Games-Howell post-hoc test. We also removed the double mutant <italic>sts5∆ rad24∆</italic>, because as stated by the reviewers, it wasn’t adding to the point of the figure.</p></body></sub-article></article>
