We used thermography to examine how kissing-bugs <italic>Rhodnius prolixus</italic> actively protect themselves from overheating. During feeding, these bugs sequester and dissipate the excess heat in their heads while maintaining an abdominal temperature close to ambient. We employed a functional-morphological approach, combining histology, µCT and X-ray-synchrotron imaging to shed light on the way these insects manage the flow of heat across their bodies. The close alignment of the circulatory and ingestion systems, as well as other morphological characteristics, support the existence of a countercurrent heat exchanger in the head of <italic>R. prolixus</italic>, which decreases the temperature of the ingested blood before it reaches the abdomen. This kind of system has never been described before in the head of an insect. For the first time, we show that countercurrent heat exchange is associated to thermoregulation during blood-feeding.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26107.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many insect species have adopted the blood of birds and mammals as their main or even only food. Yet, blood is not freely available in nature, but it circulates inside vessels hidden under the skin of animals much bigger than the insect and capable of defending themselves from getting bitten. To succeed in getting a meal, blood-sucking insects must be able to feed quickly and take in as much blood as possible. Each time that they do this, a huge amount of warm fluid enters their body in just a few minutes. The blood temperature can be up to 20° or 25°C warmer than the insect itself. Moreover, an insect called a kissing bug may ingest up to 10 times its own weight in only fifteen minutes. The consequence is overheating and potentially harmful thermal stress.</p><p>Kissing bugs do not seem to suffer any harmful consequence of taking massive meals from warm-blooded animals. But why? The answer was unexpected: they simply do not warm up when they take a blood meal. However, it was not known how they manage to cool down the ingested blood.</p><p>By combining classical methods of studying anatomy with state of the art technologies, Lahondère et al. discovered that kissing bugs possess a sophisticated heat exchanger inside their heads. It works by transferring the heat associated with the ingested blood to the haemolymph (insect blood); these fluids circulate in opposite directions inside ducts that are close to each other in the head.</p><p>The discovery of a new system used by insects to cope with thermal stress expands our knowledge of insect physiology and opens new lines of research. The kissing bug heat exchanger could also serve as inspiration for equivalent technological systems. Last but not least, kissing bugs spread the parasites that cause Chagas disease in the Americas. Finding ways to disrupt the heat exchanger could prevent kissing bugs from feeding on blood, and so help to control the spread of disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>thermoregulation</kwd><kwd>haematophagy</kwd><kwd>vector biology</kwd><kwd>functional morphology</kwd><kwd>insect physiology</kwd><kwd><italic>Rhodnius prolixus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007526</institution-id><institution>Université François-Rabelais</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lahondère</surname><given-names>Chloé</given-names></name><name><surname>Lazzari</surname><given-names>Claudio R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paim</surname><given-names>Rafaela MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Pereira</surname><given-names>Marcos H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paim</surname><given-names>Rafaela MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Pereira</surname><given-names>Marcos H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004901</institution-id><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paim</surname><given-names>Rafaela MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Pereira</surname><given-names>Marcos H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery operating grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ianowski</surname><given-names>Juan P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-08-MIE-007 EcoEpi</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lazzari</surname><given-names>Claudio R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lazzari</surname><given-names>Claudio R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel thermoregulatory mechanism in blood-sucking insects, vectors of human disease, is described using a functional-morphological approach.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The entire life of insects highly depends on the environmental temperature (<italic>T<sub>a</sub></italic>) that impacts their body temperature (<italic>T<sub>b</sub></italic>), thus influencing their behaviour and physiology. Each species possesses a temperature range within which individuals can remain active; but within that range, their performance (e.g. food seeking or mating) is still temperature-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huey and Stevenson, 1979</xref>). At temperatures below or above the activity range, insects can potentially experience thermal stress causing drastic physiological effects and even death. Nevertheless, different traits have evolved to avoid or minimise the effect of thermal stress due to extreme temperatures. In poikilotherms (i.e. <italic>T<sub>b</sub></italic> = <italic>T<sub>a</sub></italic>), these strategies include behavioural (e.g. postural control of exposition to solar radiation), biochemical [e.g. <italic>heat-shock proteins</italic> (HSPs) synthesis], and physiological (e.g. diapause) adjustments. However, some of them exhibit morpho-physiological adaptations that allow them regulating their own <italic>T<sub>b</sub></italic> independently of <italic>T<sub>a</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heinrich, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">May, 1979</xref>).</p><p>If many insect species can avoid thermal stress simply by changing their posture or hide from sun exposure, some others, such as haematophagous (blood-feeding) insects, must expose themselves to high temperatures and their deleterious effects during blood-feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lahondère and Lazzari, 2012</xref>). Indeed, most of them feed on endothermic vertebrates (e.g. birds) whose blood temperature can be as high as 40°C. On the other hand, in order to escape the defensive reactions of hosts against biting, they must ingest as much blood as possible, as fast as they can. Thus, they must cope with the rapid entry of a large volume of warm fluid, which temperature (<italic>T<sub>blood</sub></italic>) can greatly exceeds their own body temperature. This potentially generates thermal stress, and some species respond by synthesising HSPs, a cellular protective mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benoit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paim et al., 2016</xref>). Other blood-feeding insects use thermoregulatory processes to protect themselves from overheating. For instance, <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes decrease their abdominal temperature by using evaporative cooling. They emit through the anus and then keep at the tip of their abdomen a droplet of fluid composed of urine and fresh blood, which evaporates cooling the abdomen, thus reducing the thermal shock and the associated stress caused by the blood-meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lahondère and Lazzari, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Haematophagous Diptera such as mosquitoes and tsetse flies can obtain a full blood-meal in less than 2 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lehane, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lahondère and Lazzari, 2015</xref>). The duration of their exposure to excessive heat is thus much shorter than kissing bugs, for example, that need between 15 and 20 min to feed to repletion. Moreover, kissing bugs can take blood meals that can attain up to 10 times their own unfed weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lehane, 2005</xref>). So, the heat gain at each feeding event is much higher in bugs than in mosquitoes or flies. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that heating is deleterious for the physiology of kissing bugs. When they are exposed to a sub-lethal temperature of 30°C, bugs show delayed moulting, sterility and changes in their respiratory metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Okasha, 1968a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Okasha, 1968b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Okasha, 1968c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Okasha, 1968d</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Okasha et al., 1970</xref>). Feeding on hot blood induces the synthesis of HSPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paim et al., 2016</xref>), but the increase in their expression level is relatively low compared to other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benoit et al., 2011</xref>)</p><p>In the present work, we studied how the major Chagas disease vector <italic>Rhodnius prolixus</italic> copes with the excess of heat associated to blood-feeding. We performed real-time thermography and measured HSP expression, to analyse the extent to which these bugs are exposed to heat stress during feeding. Based on these results, we then performed a morpho-functional analysis of the <italic>R. prolixus</italic> head to gain insights on its structural organisation and how it could be implicated in heat management. Finally, we used synchrotron-based high-resolution X-ray imaging to see how the ingestion pumps work and to assess their role in blood displacement inside the insect. Based on the results obtained during this study, we propose a 3-D (three-dimensional) model of the <italic>R. prolixus</italic> head, as well as the existence of a countercurrent heat exchange mechanism through which this species can protect itself against heat stress during blood-feeding.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Real-time infrared thermography during feeding</title><p>To understand how <italic>R. prolixus</italic> manages the heat flow associated with the ingestion of a blood-meal, we first performed a real-time thermographic analysis of the dynamics of body warming during the entire feeding process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; SI <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Before the blood intake, <italic>T<sub>b</sub></italic> = <italic>T<sub>a</sub></italic> for all body parts of the insect. But once the insect started to feed, the different parts of its body did not exhibit the same temperature (i.e. heterothermy) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Indeed, while the temperature of the proboscis (<italic>T<sub>p</sub></italic>) was high and close to the temperature of the blood, that of the abdomen (<italic>T<sub>abd</sub></italic>) was close to the ambient temperature, whereas the temperature of the head (<italic>T<sub>h</sub></italic>) and that of the thorax (<italic>T<sub>th</sub></italic>) remained intermediate. Thus, a marked thermal gradient was established along the insect body: <italic>T<sub>p</sub></italic> &gt;<italic>T<sub>h</sub></italic> &gt; <italic><sub>Tth</sub></italic>&gt;<italic>T<sub>abd</sub></italic>. Interestingly, <italic>T<sub>p</sub></italic> and <italic>T<sub>h</sub></italic> oscillated during feeding, certainly in concordance with the variations in the activity of the ingestion pumps, while <italic>T<sub>th</sub></italic> and <italic>T<sub>ab</sub></italic> did not, remaining stable during the entire blood intake.

The haemolymph is pumped by the heart and flows throughout the aorta, until it reaches the head. At this level, the haemolymph warms up by conduction due to the close contact between the aorta and the oesophagus containing the ingested blood, which circulates in the opposite direction (anterior-posterior) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Muscular activity of the cibarial and pharyngeal pumps</title><p>To better understand the flow of the ingested blood inside the alimentary channel, we analysed the muscular activity of the cibarial and pharyngeal pumps using synchrotron-based X-ray imaging and computed tomography (SI <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).

The synthesis of heat shock proteins after a blood meal confirms heat stress during feeding, even though the increase in the HSP expression is lower than other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benoit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paim et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we have shown that <italic>R. prolixus</italic> also possesses anatomical specificities and adaptations that allow this species to minimize the heat transfer to its abdomen, thus reducing the heat shock associated with feeding. While the head is the most exposed to heat, the amount of heat reaching the thorax and the abdomen is dramatically reduced.</p><p>Based on our integrative study combining real-time infrared thermography with functional morphology methods, such as classical histology, X-ray in vivo-imaging and µCT, and molecular biology, we have been able to get a functional picture of the way kissing bugs quickly get rid of the excess of heat entering their body when they feed on an endothermic host. For a better perception, we built a 3-D representation of the head, thus revealing the spatial arrangement of the different structures and their relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Anatomically, the structures conform to a countercurrent heat exchanger between the alimentary canal and the circulatory system. The countercurrent is characterised by two currents of fluids circulating in opposite directions inside closely associated and parallel structures. The warmest fluid loses heat by conduction transferring it to the coolest one. In the area where the aorta is in close contact with the oesophagus, cool haemolymph coming from the end of the abdomen withdraws heat from the just ingested blood that is flowing into the alimentary canal in the opposite direction. Then, the haemolymph flows in the semi-open space (i.e. haemolymphatic sinus) and bathes the warm muscles of the ingestion pump. Finally, in the anterior part of the head, the haemolymph is conducted to project through the haemocoel, thus circulating in close contact with the body wall, releasing heat towards the environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The continuous flow of both fluids is required for an efficient heat exchange. This appears to be assured by the coordinate action of the two ingestion pumps, that iscibarial and pharyngeal, which contraction on opposite phase results in a continuous flow of warm blood to the gut, resembling the Windkessel effect of the vertebrate aorta (See SI <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). On the other hand, the peristaltic contracting waves of the dorsal vessel do the same with the cool haemolymph, but in the opposite direction. The close contact between the aorta and the oesophagus facilitates the exchange of heat, which returns to the head. Consequently, only a relatively small amount of heat leaves the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In this way, by sequestering the heat in the head, this countercurrent heat exchanger allows the insect to minimise heat transfer to the thorax and the abdomen, thus maintaining a regional heterothermy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our proposed model for the countercurrent exchanger here is based on both anatomical and experimental evidence.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26107.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The countercurrent heat-exchanger in the head of kissing bugs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sagittal section of the head of <italic>Rhodnius prolixus</italic> (scale bar, 100 µm).

In <italic>Cuculiinae</italic> winter moths, two heat exchangers are localised in the thorax and at the junction between the thorax and the abdomen. These exchangers enable these insects to fly at very low <italic>T<sub>a</sub></italic> by sequestering heat in their thorax. Air sacs also help to restrain heat propagation to the abdomen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heinrich, 1987</xref>). In bumblebees, the exchanger is located in the narrow passage of the petiole and helps them to exchange heat via the haemolymph between the thorax and the abdomen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Heinrich, 1976</xref>). As in previous examples, <italic>Xylocopa</italic> carpenter bees produce endogenous heat during flight. The countercurrent exchanger occurs in the petiole area where the aorta presents many loops thus facilitating heat dissipation via the abdomen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heinrich and Buchmann, 1986</xref>). Robber flies (Diptera: Asilidae) also use their abdomen as a heat dissipater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Morgan and Shelly, 1988</xref>). All these anatomical particularities help these insect species to maintain a regional heterothermy, and has been speculated that this could protect critical organs (e.g. gonads) from an eventual thermal stress due to extreme temperature, keeping others (e.g. muscles) at optimal higher temperatures. The heat-exchange system of <italic>R. prolixus</italic> is unique, in the sense that it is located in the head and that it is involved in the management of the heat flow derived from the food intake.</p><p>Countercurrent heat exchangers are not restricted to invertebrates, they also occur in vertebrates such as birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arad et al., 1989</xref>), fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carey et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stevens et al., 1974</xref>), and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Scholander and Schevill, 1955</xref>). In these animals, heat transfer occurs between arteries reaching zones of potential heat loss (e.g. appendices) and veins carrying cold blood, in order to recuperate heat back to the body core (e.g. artic birds and mammals) or to active muscles (e.g. fishes).</p><p>The heat exchanger found in the head of <italic>R. prolixus</italic> is associated to other features that facilitate heat dissipation during feeding, as the elongated form of the head, which increases the surface/volume ratio and the relatively glabrous cuticle, typical of hemipterans. For instance, bumblebees show a regional difference in depth of insulation: the regions where heat needs to be stored are densely piled (thorax, dorsal part of the abdomen) whereas the ventral part of the abdomen, which serves as a thermal radiator, is completely free on hair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Heinrich, 1976</xref>). In some syrphid flies that produce heat endothermically with thoracic muscles, the removal of hair from the thorax leads to an increase of the cooling rate of about 30% compared to hairy flies of the same species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heinrich, 1987</xref>). Winter moths that need to keep heat to be able to fly in the cold maintain a high thoracic temperature and minimise heat loss by means of a thick insulated pile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heinrich, 1987</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, the heart of <italic>R. prolixus</italic> is unusual in that all eight <italic>ostia</italic> are grouped in a short section at the very end of the abdomen (segment VII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiang et al., 1990</xref>), where the temperature of the haemolymph is the coolest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) inside the insect body. In other Hemiptera species, ostia are grouped at the posterior region of the abdomen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hinks, 1966</xref>). In the case of the haematophagous bugs <italic>R. prolixus</italic> and <italic>Triatoma infestans</italic>, they are located further in the terminal part abdomen, grouped in the VII and VIII abdominal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hinks, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barth, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiang et al., 1990</xref>). This is not the case for all blood-sucking insects. For instance, <italic>Stomoxys calcitrans</italic> has three pairs of ostia which spanned five abdominal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cook and Meola, 1988</xref>) and in <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> hemolymph enters the heart through six pairs of incurrent abdominal ostia and one pair of ostia located at the thoracic-abdominal junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Glenn et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>It is worth mentioning also that, as mosquitoes, bugs eliminate drops of urine during feeding (SI <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Although the size and the time that these drops remain attached to the tip of the abdomen are both reduced, and evaporative cooling is hardly probable to occur as in <italic>Anopheles</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lahondère and Lazzari, 2012</xref>), these drops may reduce the temperature of the terminal part of the abdomen, precisely in the area where the haemolymph enters the heart to be pulsed forwards.</p><p>The aorta is open on its dorsal part in the cephalic portion and goes through the cibarial pump muscles. The warmed haemolymph is thus poured around these muscles that are also warmed by both contractions and direct contact with the alimentary canal which contains the circulating warm blood. The wide sinus, in which the insect haemolymph circulates in contact with the insect integument, probably facilitates heat loss by convection and radiation. Finally, two tracheas extend along the head, next to both the pharyngeal pump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>) and the alimentary canal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>, SI <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref> and SI <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramírez-Pérez, 1969</xref>). These tracheas may also help decrease the temperature of the head by circulating air and by internal evaporative cooling. Internal evaporative cooling is a common strategy in species, such as plant juice feeders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Prange, 1996</xref>), which can obtain water easily. In the tsetse fly <italic>Glossina morsitans</italic>, a decrease of 2°C of the <italic>T<sub>b</sub></italic> occurs when the <italic>T<sub>a</sub></italic> exceeds the thermal upper limit of tolerance thanks to evaporation via the spiracles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edney and Barrass, 1962</xref>). The process of evaporative cooling via the ventilatory system is also documented in grasshoppers and beetles with a decrease of the <italic>T<sub>b</sub></italic> up to 8°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prange, 1990</xref>). In <italic>R. prolixus</italic> during feeding, there is an increase in the rate of exchange of CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and water vapour: this is thought to be linked with spiracle opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leis et al., 2016</xref>). If the hypothesis of heat loss via the trachea is true in <italic>R. prolixus</italic>, it could resemble to respiratory countercurrent mechanisms found in the nose of mammals, birds, and reptiles.

The experiments were done 25.5 m from the source.</p><p>Starved fifth-instar <italic>R. prolixus</italic> were presented with warm, defibrinated rabbit blood (Cederlane, Ontario, Canada) labelled with organic iodide (Optiray 240, Tyco Healthcare, New Jersey) making the blood opaque to X-rays. Blood was placed in an artificial feeder and covered with a thin latex membrane that allowed the insects to pierce and feed. Insects were placed in a plastic holder that allowed them to move freely. One end of the holder was open and in direct contact with the latex membrane of the artificial feeder. The artificial feeder and the animal holder were placed on a motorised stage so we could remotely control the insect’s position in the X-ray beam. The images were captured using a high-resolution X-ray beam monitor (AA-40 Hamamatsu Photonics) optically coupled to a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector (C9300-124 Hamamatsu Photonics). The effective pixel size of the beam monitor- CCD camera combination is 4.3 × 4.3 μm. The X-rays were converted to visible light by a 10 μm-thick powder scintillator P43 (Gd2O2S:Tb). The monochromatic X-ray flux at BMIT-BM line is not high enough to collect data with a speed of at least 6–10 fps (frames per second). For that reason, we opted for using filtered white beam. The preliminary experiments showed that insects were feeling the presence of the X-ray beam when the dose rate was too high. They stopped feeding within 10 to 30 s after the beginning of the X-ray exposure and were moving to the sides of the holder trying to get out of the X-ray beam. The animals exposed to the highest dose rates that the X-ray detector could generate, died after a few minutes of continuous exposure to the beam. In order to avoid the effects described above we changed the average energy and the flux of the X-ray arriving at the sample location by proper selection of the metal filters inserted in the beam (0.055 mm Cu and 5 mm Al). As a result of that, the dose rate became much smaller and the animals did not react to the presence of the X-ray beam. The filtration of the beam limited the speed at which the data could be collected to about 6.5 fps. For the period of time when insects initiated feeding, the X-rays were blocked by fast (20 ms actuation time) mechanical shutter. After an insect had fed for 1 to 3 min (i.e. when it has finished probing and began feeding), the shutter was opened and the animal was imaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sena et al., 2014</xref>).

A total of 1800 images were collected over 180 degrees’ rotation, keeping the angular increment constant (0.1 deg).

After 2 hr, insects were dissected to collect their midguts for individual RNA extraction using the Nucleospin RNA II Kit (Macherey-Nagel). RNA was treated with DNase according to the manufacturer’s instructions and eluted in 20 µL of ultra-pure RNase-free water. Then, purified RNA was quantified by measuring 260 nm wavelength absorbance and 0.5 µg was used for cDNA synthesis with 0.5 µg of random hexamers (Promega) using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase system (Promega) in a final volume of 25 µL. The cDNA was used in qPCR assays, using the StepOne Plus real time quantitative PCR system (Applied Biosystems) to evaluate HSP70 and HSP90 expression. Each reaction was run in duplicate and contained 20 ng of cDNA, specific primers for HSP70 (forward: 5’-gaaatcgtactggttggtgga-3’, reverse: 5’-cgccataggctacagcttca-3’) or HSP90 (forward: 5’-ggacccatcaagactggaga−3’, reverse: 5’- agcaatggttcccagattgt - 3’) at a final concentration of 300 nM each and 5 µL of 2x Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 10 µL.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior Editor) and four reviewers, one of whom, Joshua B Benoit (Reviewer #1), served as Guest Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: David Denlinger (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>The reviewers consider this is an interesting paper with elegant experiments that presents convincing results of structural evidence for a counter-current heat exchange, which creates a heat gradient from the head to abdomen. Addition of the dorsal vessel severing provides further evidence for this cooling system. From these studies, the authors conclude that this allows for the bloodmeal to be rapidly cooled and protects from heat stress. The general consensus from the reviewers is that this is likely important and may be critical to the biology of kissing bugs. However, the concern is that results do not provide evidence that this system would be protective. Specifically, kissing bugs usually feed while standing on the warm host, which means the data for kissing bugs held at 31C is most ecologically relevant. Under this treatment, the exchange system would only account for a 2-4C change in temperature, which may not cause physiological or molecular changes. The inclusion of direct evidence, such as gene expression changes following impairment of this system, would solidify the conclusions of this study. Overall, the study is important by demonstrating an interesting cooling system that may protect kissing bugs from blood-induced heat stress.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although the set-up and experimental work is highly appreciated, the presented data, in the view of the reviewers, does not yet fully support the conclusion that this system will protect the kissing bugs from feeding induced heat.</p><p>1) The study would be strongly improved by experimental evidence that this heat exchange system does protect kissing bugs from heat stress at either the molecular and physiological levels. This issue could be alleviated by the following:</p><p>a) Measure heat shock protein expression in the gut of kissing bugs with and without dorsal vessel severing to verify increased heat stress due to a lack of the counter-current heat exchange.</p><p>b) This should be done with ecologically relevant levels (31C experiments) that mostly likely mimic the natural feeding state of this insect.</p><p>2) The reviewers are concerned with the small sample size, suggesting the statistics are not robust and non-parametric methods should be used.</p><p>3) The entire manuscript needs to be edited to remove &quot;casual&quot; language.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Countercurrent heat exchange and thermoregulation during blood-feeding in kissing bugs&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

This new version includes novel experiments testing the protective role against thermal stress (HSP expression). We verified a significant increase in HSP70 in bugs with severed dorsal vessels, as compared to sham individuals. Just for information, since not included in this manuscript, we have also found that bugs which body temperature is some degrees above the environment are bitten by starved conspecific, which perform cleptohaematophagy and cleptohaemolymphophagy. So, the protective role of the cooling system seems go beyond protection against thermal stress in this gregarious species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The study would be strongly improved by experimental evidence that this heat exchange system does protect kissing bugs from heat stress at either the molecular and physiological levels. This issue could be alleviated by the following:</p><p>a) Measure heat shock protein expression in the gut of kissing bugs with and without dorsal vessel severing to verify increased heat stress due to a lack of the counter-current heat exchange.</p><p>b) This should be done with ecologically relevant levels (31C experiments) that mostly likely mimic the natural feeding state of this insect.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the advice of reviewers, we measured the expression of HSP70 and HSP90 in bugs which dorsal vessel was severed and sham individuals. The results integrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and in the subsection “2. HSP expression and thermal stress”. For this, we requested the assistance of two colleagues with recognised experience on <italic>Rhodnius</italic> HSPs, Marcos Pereira (Prof.) and Dr. Rafaela Paim (post-doc), with whom we collaborate regularly and already published together on a related subject. They kindly accepted our invitation, performed the experiments under the requested conditions, evaluated the expression of HSP70 and HSP90 on the two groups and analysed the data. For this reason, the rest of the authors consider that their contribution is substantial enough for including them as co-authors. Marcos and Rafaela accepted co-signing the paper and they are, of course, aware of the content of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers are concerned with the small sample size, suggesting the statistics are not robust and non-parametric methods should be used.</p></disp-quote><p>The small sample size is due to the complexity in performing the experiments in exactly the same way. Nevertheless, in all cases, before applying parametric statistics, normality, skewness and homoscedasticity were verified to avoid any bias.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The entire manuscript needs to be edited to remove &quot;casual&quot; language.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the comment. We have revised the English, in order to render the text less casual.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The HSP70 does indeed indicate that there is likely a protective effect, which is a major improvement.

Yet, we prefer keeping it apart for different reasons. First, this parallel study contains a body of information in terms of methodology, results and conclusions that will require rewriting the whole manuscript in order to not disperse the attention of the reader; second, it would mean a whole new submission that will probably require a new round of evaluation by additional reviewer, delaying publication (an issue for some of the authors) and last, but not least, additional authors should be added, with the consequent discussion about authorship order.</p></body></sub-article></article>
