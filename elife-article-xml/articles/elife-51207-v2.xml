psychiatric disorders such as phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, we present a new behavioral approach in rats that robustly attenuates aversive memories. This method consists of ‘deconditioning’ animals previously trained to associate a tone with a strong footshock by replacing it with a much weaker one during memory retrieval. Our results indicate that deconditioning-update is more effective than traditional extinction in reducing fear responses; moreover, such effects are long lasting and resistant to renewal and spontaneous recovery. Remarkably, this strategy overcame important boundary conditions for memory updating, such as remote or very strong traumatic memories. The same beneficial effect was found in other types of fear-related memories. Deconditioning was mediated by L-type voltage-gated calcium channels and is consistent with computational accounts of mismatch-induced memory updating. Our results suggest that shifting from fear to safety through deconditioning-update is a promising approach to attenuate traumatic memories.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Memory</kwd><kwd>updating</kwd><kwd>reconsolidation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Universal 2018 - 405100/2018-3)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alvares</surname><given-names>Lucas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Popik</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deconditioning is a safe and efficient new approach to updating traumatic memories, in which fear memory is rewritten to a very low level in a long-lasting way.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Memory is a dynamic process that allows for adaptation to the demands of a continuously changing environment. The ability to update old memories in accordance with new experiences is crucial for maintaining their relevance over time. Particularly, it has been shown that after retrieval (or reactivation), memories may undergo a cycle of labilization and restabilization commonly known as reconsolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nader et al., 2000</xref>). The labile state induced by this process can thus allow changes in memory strength and/or content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Oliveira Alvares et al., 2013</xref>). This has been most extensively studied in aversive conditioning paradigms in rodents and humans and is of potential relevance to the management of psychiatric disorders involving dysfunctional memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Monfils and Holmes, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Repeated exposure to a conditioned stimulus (CS) in the absence of an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) also leads to a progressive reduction in fear responses, commonly known as extinction. However, extinction is thought not to erase the original memory; instead, it induces new learning that transiently inhibits fear expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouton, 2002</xref>). Therefore, the fear memory typically reemerges with the passage of time (spontaneous recovery), exposure to the US (reinstatement), or when the CS is presented independently of the extinction context (renewal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rescorla and Heth, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archbold et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouton et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, behavioral strategies that can weaken traumatic memories and reduce memory recovery can be relevant for improving the effectiveness of extinction.</p><p>Reconsolidation has been described in several experimental paradigms and species, from invertebrates to humans, suggesting that it might be a fundamental property of memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nader and Einarsson, 2010</xref>). Beyond its biological role in memory updating, it opens a window of opportunity as a potential therapeutic strategy to modify pathological memories. Several studies in the last decades have attempted to pharmacologically or behaviorally disrupt the reconsolidation of traumatic memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckers and Kindt, 2017</xref>), as at least in some situations, this strategy can be less susceptible to spontaneous or induced recovery than traditional extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duvarci and Nader, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Monfils et al., 2009</xref>). However, most treatments that interfere with memory reconsolidation are toxic and cannot be readily administered to humans. Thus, in spite of almost two decades of research on memory reconsolidation, the evidence for the efficacy of reconsolidation-blocking treatments in clinical settings is still limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Monfils and Holmes, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Research on reconsolidation-extinction boundaries suggests that the transition from one process to the other depends on the degree of mismatch between the original memory and the reactivation experience. Many studies have suggested that some degree of mismatch or prediction error is necessary for reconsolidation to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernández et al., 2016</xref>); however, if prediction error is too high, extinction may occur instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sevenster et al., 2014</xref>). Computational models suggest that, in models in which prediction error is low, memory updating/reconsolidation mechanisms are preferentially engaged, as the new experience is recognized as a new instance of the former one; however, as mismatch increases, the chances of it being attributed to a new latent cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gershman et al., 2017</xref>) or forming a new attractor in a neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Osan et al., 2011</xref>) increases.</p><p>This framework suggests that lowering the degree of mismatch between learning and reexposure might conceivably potentiate memory updating during extinction. This has been the rationale behind so-called retrieval-extinction procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Monfils et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kredlow et al., 2016</xref>) and has also been explored in short-term extinction protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gershman et al., 2013</xref>). In this work, we propose a novel approach for long-term attenuation of traumatic memories that we term ‘deconditioning-update’. This strategy consists in weakening fear memories by updating the aversive information, substituting the original US by a mildly aversive stimulus during the plastic state induced by reactivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In order to approach our hypothesis, male Wistar rats were trained in auditory fear conditioning, where they received five conditioning trial tones (CS) that co-terminated with a 0.5-mA, 1-s footshock (US). On days 3 to 6 (reactivation), animals received 3 CSs during a 400-s daily session in a different context. In the no-footshock group, CSs were presented in the absence of shock, while in the deconditioning-update group, each tone co-terminated with a 0.1-mA footshock. A third group remained in the homecage (control group). On day 7, both groups were tested in the reactivation context with 3 CSs.

Animals in the deconditioning-update group also had lower freezing responses in the renewal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and spontaneous recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) tests, although it should be noted that memory recovery was not observed in the no-footshock group either, perhaps due to a ceiling effect caused by insufficient extinction (for complete statistics, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Pre-CS freezing varied between 37% and 69% in both groups throughout the extinction sessions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp12">Supplementary file 12</xref>), suggesting some degree of generalization between both contexts.</p><p>When performing the same experiment, but with each tone co-terminating with a 0.3-mA footshock in the reactivations, no fear reduction occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>); on the contrary, the footshock group presented higher levels of freezing than the no-footshock group throughout the reactivation sessions, as well as in the test. This result is in accordance with a recent study showing that fear memory may be strengthened by reactivation with a 0.3-mA footshock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferrara et al., 2019a</xref>). It also rules out that the suppression of freezing during reactivations by deconditioning-update may be due to inhibition of delay (i.e. animals learning to freeze only at the end of the CS with extended practice). When using a single reactivation session with 0.1mA, no difference was found in the test in comparison to the no-footshock group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that deconditioning-update requires several sessions to take place.</p><p>One could argue that the exposure to weak footshocks could simply lead to habituation and consequent devaluation of the US, without altering the conditioned association itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rescorla, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rescorla and Heth, 1975</xref>). In order to test this alternative interpretation, rats were conditioned as described above and the same 3 0.1-mA weak footshocks were given in another context without being paired with the tones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In this case, no fear reduction was found in comparison to homecage controls. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). To further rule out the devaluation hypothesis, another set of animals was submitted to reinstatement after deconditioning, in order to test whether restoring the original footshock valence outside of the extinction context might lead to memory recovery. We found that the deconditioning group expressed a lower fear level when compared with the no-footshock group in the test even after reinstatement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>), suggesting that the deconditioning-update effect is not due to US devaluation, but rather to updating of the CS-US association.</p><p>In an additional experiment, we investigated whether the stress induced by weak footshocks during reactivation could be enhancing extinction by itself. Animals underwent either the deconditioning-update protocol described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, or a similar protocol in which both tones and footshocks were applied during the reactivation sessions, but with no pairing between them. We found that this non-contingent tone-footshock protocol did not attenuate fear expression, leading to higher freezing than deconditioning-update during reactivations and in the test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked whether the deconditioning-update effect would also be efficient in reducing fear in female rats. As observed in males, females from the deconditioning-update group showed lower freezing levels throughout the reactivation sessions, as well as in the test session, when compared with the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The same pattern was maintained in the renewal and spontaneous recovery tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>, respectively). As a further way to test for persistence of the original memory, we performed a retraining session in the original context with 3 0.5-mA CS-US pairings 24 hr after the spontaneous recovery test to assess savings. The deconditioning-update group had lower freezing compared with the other groups in a subsequent test session in the extinction context, suggesting that our protocol also lowers the rate of reacquisition of an aversive memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).</p><p>Boundary conditions such as training intensity and memory age have been reported to prevent fear memories from being modified. Protocols with high training intensity make memory less prone to interference by pharmacological agents in the reconsolidation window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frankland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), while older memories are also less susceptible to modification than recent ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Milekic and Alberini, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frankland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bustos et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, our next experiments investigated whether deconditioning-update could attenuate fear expression in these cases. First, we trained the animals in the same protocol described above, but starting reactivations 40 days after conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Fear reduction was limited and largely similar across groups in the extinction session and in the subsequent tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), albeit with slightly lower renewal in the deconditioning-update group, suggesting that the pairing of the CS with a weak footshock is not as effective in accelerating single-session extinction. In order to further explore this possibility, we subjected animals to a 24-tone single-session extinction protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This led to robust fear reduction both within the extinction session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and in a subsequent test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) in the no-footshock group, while freezing remained largely unchanged in the footshock group.

This effect was sensitive to blockade of the mismatch-induced degradation term – the model equivalent of blocking memory destabilization mechanisms such as LVGCCs with a drug like nimodipine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This occurs because the ‘minor footshock’ pattern leads to recovery of the original memory as the outcome of the initial sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), causing mismatch-induced updating of the weights supporting these memories and weakening of the mutual connections between shock and context neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). On the other hand, no-footshock extinction leads to immediate formation of a new attractor, leaving the connection weights related to the shock memory unaltered throughout the extinction process.</p><p>Because of this, deconditioning-update was sensitive to blockade of mismatch-induced degradation, while no-footshock extinction – which depends basically on new learning – was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Blocking the Hebbian plasticity term, on the other hand, led to blockade of no-footshock extinction, as well as reconsolidation blockade in low-mismatch conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, blocking Hebbian plasticity during deconditioning-update led to greater freezing decrease after the first reactivation session, suggesting that the procedure could be modulated by pharmacological agents such as protein synthesis inhibition; on the long run, however, the same manipulation decreased extinction due to interference with new learning.</p><p>A caveat here is that, unlike in the model, nimodipine did affect regular extinction in the experimental results. This suggests that the mechanistic distinction between deconditioning-update and classic extinction is not so clear-cut, and that these two processes might share common mechanisms, as has been proposed for reconsolidation and extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almeida-Corrêa and Amaral, 2014</xref>). Capturing these subtleties, as well as other features of the data such as distinctions between single- and multiple-session extinction, likely requires model implementations that are more complex than this simple adaptation of the classic Hopfield formulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Taken as a whole, our findings demonstrate that presenting a tone followed by a weak footshock (deconditioning-update) was more effective in reducing fear memory than presenting a tone in the absence of shock (extinction training). Attenuation of fear responses following deconditioning-update was robust, long-lasting, and less sensitive to renewal and spontaneous recovery. Remarkably, this strategy was also effective in reducing fear within boundary conditions in which memories have been described to be less sensitive to modification (e.g., very strong training protocols and remote memories). The same effect was found in other types of fear-related memory (contextual fear conditioning and inhibitory avoidance tasks), and was sensitive to pharmacological blockade of LVGCCs. We suggest that the CS–US association is weakened during the deconditioning-update approach, leading to lower fear expression. Considering that (i) fear reduction is long-lasting, without spontaneous recovery, renewal and savings, (ii) weak-footshock pairings do not have the same effect in single-session extinction protocols or when stronger footshocks are applied, and (iii) this effect is prevented by LVGCC antagonism, we suggest that deconditioning-update is mediated by the memory destabilization effects commonly associated with reconsolidation.</p><p>These results are in line with predictions from a neural network model previously built to account for transitions between reconsolidation and extinction with increasing reexposure time in contextual fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Osan et al., 2011</xref>). In this model, modification of existing connection weights is triggered by a protein synthesis-independent set of processes when there is mismatch between the memory pattern retrieved by the network (based on previously learned experiences) and the currently experienced sensory state, as when the prediction of a strong footshock is offset by a mild one. However, if mismatch is too extensive, as during extinction in the absence of a footshock, a new attractor is formed in the network at the first reexposure session already, preventing mismatch-induced weakening of the original memory.</p><p>Although the model is quite reductionist in its implementation, both due to the absence of realistic topology and to the non-spiking, continuous nature of neuronal activity, it is nevertheless able to account for transitions between simple retrieval, reconsolidation and extinction with increasing reexposure time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>) or number of non-reinforced CSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sevenster et al., 2014</xref>), as assessed by the effects of pharmacological agents such as protein synthesis inhibitors, NMDA antagonists and β-blockers. The model also helps to explain why, unlike pharmacological reconsolidation blockade, deconditioning-update takes several sessions to occur, as the impact of memory labilization mechanisms on a stored memory is much more pronounced when Hebbian mechanisms are blocked concomitantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Osan et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although we have not tested this explicitly, our results also appear compatible with the Bayesian inference framework proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gershman et al. (2017)</xref>, in which the probability that an experience is attributed to a new latent cause increases in proportion to the degree of prediction error generated by previous experience. This can explain why a lower degree of mismatch, such as that caused by reactivation followed by a weak footshock, can lead to a greater probability of memory updating and decrease the recovery of fear. If this is the case, the rationale for the greater effectiveness of deconditioning-update in reducing fear might be similar to that observed in so-called retrieval extinction paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Monfils et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kredlow et al., 2016</xref>). In this case, the first retrieval trial, usually consisting of a single CS, is thought to induce retrieval-induced destabilization of the original memory, as the prediction error generated by this reexposure is not sufficient to form an extinction memory. Nevertheless, following this initial retrieval session with an extinction procedure leads to lower fear recovery than when extinction is performed without it, although this effect has been observed rather inconsistently across studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kredlow et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, deconditioning-update only occurred when reactivation sessions were spaced across multiple days. When a massed extinction procedure with 24 non-reinforced CSs was performed within a single extinction session, on the other hand, a mild footshock at the end of the tones actually prevented within-session extinction, and increased freezing in a test performed on the following day. This seems to reinforce the notion that computations linking the degree of prediction error with memory destabilization occur only at the end of reexposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Perez-Cuesta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Osan et al., 2011</xref>). It is also in line with the idea that within- and between-session extinction are distinct processes, with different dynamics and molecular requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plendl and Wotjak, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida-Corrêa et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>An important limitation of our computational framework, however, is that time is not explicitly modeled – thus, one cannot distinguish between massed and spaced extinction protocols in order to investigate the different results found in the two settings. An interesting challenge for future theoretical models, thus, would be to study whether and how within-session extinction relates mechanistically to mismatch-induced updating and between-session extinction. In this line, it is interesting to note that the model by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gershman et al. (2017)</xref> postulates that the probability that an experience is attributed to a new latent cause increases with time between initial learning and reactivation. This could plausibly account for why fear reduction with deconditioning-update is only observed in spaced sessions, in which new structural learning is more likely to take place in the absence of shocks (and thus prevent the original memory from updating in standard extinction conditions).</p><p>Nevertheless, in contrast to our work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gershman et al. (2013)</xref> did find an effect of reducing mismatch at the start of a single 24-CS extinction session by pairing some of the initial tones with full-strength footshocks. That said, their effect was only observed in spontaneous recovery sessions and post-reinstatement sessions, and not within the extinction session itself. Moreover, the approach to induce lower degrees of mismatch in their experiment – gradually reducing the frequency of regular footshocks – was different from ours, in which this was achieved by providing a low-intensity shock at the end of every tone. Studying whether both approaches could be combined – by gradually decreasing footshock intensity, for example – could be an interesting topic for further investigation of the deconditioning-update effect. Another topic for future studies is whether mismatch between the training and reactivation context in auditory conditioning protocols also contributes to the deconditioning-update effect, as recently reported for reconsolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferrara et al., 2019b</xref>). In our study, animals showed relatively high pre-CS freezing levels, suggesting some degree of generalization between contexts, although the presence of renewal suggests that animals were also capable of differentiating them. It is thus an open question whether generalization might be important for deconditioning-update to occur.</p><p>Psychiatric disorders associated with pathological memories are prevalent, cause important social and economic burden, and approaches to translate basic knowledge of fear conditioning for potentiation of exposure therapy have met limited success so far in clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Monfils and Holmes, 2018</xref>). We believe that exploring the principles of deconditioning-update – that is, the notion that there is an ideal window of prediction error to potentiate reexposure effects – is a promising therapeutic avenue that could be explored in more depth in the setting of trauma-focused psychotherapy. The high efficacy, long-lasting effects, and drug-free nature of this approach make it particularly appealing for translation to human memory-related disorders, such as trauma, phobias and drug abuse.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A total of 323 male and female Wistar rats (2–3 months old, weighing between 300 and 400 g) from CREAL at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) were used for the experiments.

In the deconditioning update group, the aversive shock cluster received an input <italic>I<sub>i</sub></italic> of −2.31, while non-shock neurons received 2.31 [corresponding to t = 6 in the transformation used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Osan et al. (2011)</xref> to create intermediate patterns]. For reconsolidation, these inputs were 3.80 and −3.80, respectively, corresponding to t = 3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Osan et al. (2011)</xref>. In the retrieval cue, each targeted neuron had an input <italic>I<sub>j</sub></italic> = 1.5 and 0 for other neurons.</p><p>One hundred simulations of each experiment were performed, with different initial conditions determined by Gaussian noise in the initial weight matrices (with a normal distribution on [−0.05, 0.05]) and in the neuronal activation at the start of every session (with a normal distribution on [0, 0.1]). For each simulation, 100 retrieval trials were run in each session to determine freezing percentage. All results are displayed as the mean ± S.E.M of these 100 simulations.

In deconditioning, rats are re-exposed to Pavlovian fear conditioning trials with a much weaker shock over 4 consecutive days. Subsequent fear expression is dramatically reduced compared to box- and extinction-controls – presumably via a reconsolidation/memory updating process that alters the underlying CS-US association. Unlike extinction, this reduction is resistant to renewal and spontaneous recovery. Deconditioning also works with context fear conditioning and inhibitory avoidance, and it does not appear to be constrained by known reconsolidation boundary conditions (i.e. very strong or old memories are still susceptible). The authors also demonstrate that L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blockers – which have been shown to be necessary for extinction and memory destabilization – prevent deconditioning. This is an interesting and important addition to the reconsolidation/memory updating literature that reports an innovative approach for modifying fear memories. The manuscript is well-written. The basic effect is replicated several times for both males and female subjects. The paper is strengthened by behavioral pharmacology and modeling data.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Shifting from fear to safety through deconditioning-update: a novel approach to attenuate fear memories&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor (Kate Wassum), a Reviewing Editor (Alex Shackman), and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher Cain (Reviewer #1); Travis D. Goode (Reviewer #2); Marie H Monfils (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers and the Reviewing Editor have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) If the authors wish to keep the Nimodipine experiment in the manuscript, it's essential that they add a state-dependent control group. The nimodipine experiments lack an important control group that is necessary to conclude that the drug blocks deconsolidation. See Figure 4F-J. With systemic drugs it is essential to demonstrate that memory impairments persist when the animals are tested in the drugged-condition, in case the drug state becomes part of the memory and is a necessary stimulus condition for retrieval. This is not just theoretical Bouton and others have shown apparent extinction impairments (e.g. with benzos) that go away if the subjects are tested in the drugged condition.</p><p>2) One of the reviewers questioned whether arousal is a confounding factor, and wondered whether it would be useful to test whether animals exposed to non-contingent shocks show deconditioning effects: &quot;A critical finding in the manuscript is that these effects of deconditioning appear dependent on multiple short reactivation sessions (as opposed to a single massed session where such a deconditioning procedure actually impedes extinction; Figure 4—figure supplement 1 shows similar weak effects). As such (and given the high levels of freezing in footshock animals undergoing massed extinction) I'm wondering if stress/arousal levels (instead of, or in addition to, mismatch signals) may be a dominant factor here (given that animals are nevertheless receiving shocks). In other words, weak (but aversive) footshock presentations (in addition to the fear-eliciting CS) may enhance stress responding (norepinephrine-release, for example) which may facilitate consolidation/reconsolidation of the forming extinction memory (perhaps to a greater extent than in the no footshock groups). In the case of the massed extinction, this stress responding may not be optimal to facilitate extinction given the mass of trials (and perhaps new sensitization/conditioning). To this end, a critical experiment may be to add a group of animals to receive non-contingent presentations of the low-level shocks (perhaps randomly in the inter-CS intervals) to see whether the same &quot;deconditioning&quot;-like effects can be induced by shock-induced arousal that is concomitant with CS-elicited arousal and reactivation/extinction (but not linked to mismatch per se since it does not occur at the end of the tone).

In deconditioning, rats are re-exposed to Pavlovian fear conditioning trials with a much weaker shock over 4 consecutive days. Subsequent fear expression is dramatically reduced compared to box- and extinction-controls – presumably via a reconsolidation/memory updating process that alters the underlying CS-US association. Unlike extinction, this reduction is resistant to renewal and spontaneous recovery. Deconditioning also works with context fear conditioning and inhibitory avoidance, and it does not appear to be constrained by known reconsolidation boundary conditions (i.e. very strong or old memories are still susceptible). Authors also demonstrate that L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blockers – which have been shown to be necessary for extinction and memory destabilization – prevent deconditioning. This is an interesting and important addition to the reconsolidation/memory updating literature that reports an innovative approach for modifying fear memories. The manuscript is well-written. The basic effect is replicated several times for both males and female subjects. The paper is strengthened by behavioral pharmacology and modeling data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) If the authors wish to keep the Nimodipine experiment in the manuscript, it's essential that they add a state-dependent control group. The nimodipine experiments lack an important control group that is necessary to conclude that the drug blocks deconsolidation. See Figure 4F-J. With systemic drugs it is essential to demonstrate that memory impairments persist when the animals are tested in the drugged-condition, in case the drug state becomes part of the memory and is a necessary stimulus condition for retrieval. This is not just theoretical Bouton and others have shown apparent extinction impairments (e.g. with benzos) that go away if the subjects are tested in the drugged condition.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing this important point to our attention. As suggested, we performed an additional experiment in order to address this issue. We trained 20 animals and divided them in two groups. The treated group received nimodipine 30 minutes before each reactivation, while the control group received vehicle. In the test, animals in the treated group received either vehicle or nimodipine. If the nimodipine treatment was making this memory state-dependent, then we would expect that drug injection before the test would decrease the freezing response. Our results show that nimodipine injection during reactivation does not induce a state-dependent memory, since the performance in the test with or without nimodipine is the same. We thus suggest that the nimodipine treatment before reactivation is acting primarily on the memory destabilization, preventing deconditioning-update.</p><p>We now refer to this experiment in the Results section and present the results in Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One of the reviewers questioned whether arousal is a confounding factor, and wondered whether it would be useful to test whether animals exposed to non-contingent shocks show deconditioning effects: &quot;A critical finding in the manuscript is that these effects of deconditioning appear dependent on multiple short reactivation sessions (as opposed to a single massed session where such a deconditioning procedure actually impedes extinction; Figure 4—figure supplement 1 shows similar weak effects). As such (and given the high levels of freezing in footshock animals undergoing massed extinction) I'm wondering if stress/arousal levels (instead of, or in addition to, mismatch signals) may be a dominant factor here (given that animals are nevertheless receiving shocks). In other words, weak (but aversive) footshock presentations (in addition to the fear-eliciting CS) may enhance stress responding (norepinephrine-release, for example) which may facilitate consolidation/reconsolidation of the forming extinction memory (perhaps to a greater extent than in the no footshock groups). In the case of the massed extinction, this stress responding may not be optimal to facilitate extinction given the mass of trials (and perhaps new sensitization/conditioning). To this end, a critical experiment may be to add a group of animals to receive non-contingent presentations of the low-level shocks (perhaps randomly in the inter-CS intervals) to see whether the same &quot;deconditioning&quot;-like effects can be induced by shock-induced arousal that is concomitant with CS-elicited arousal and reactivation/extinction (but not linked to mismatch per se since it does not occur at the end of the tone). If similar deconditioning effects are seen with unpaired shocks, then these effects may mirror post-training stress-/arousal-dependent facilitation of learning seen in other tasks. If this fails to produce the deconditioning-like effects, then this would further support the extinction-promoting effects of graded prediction error/mismatch.&quot;</p><p>There was some discussion among reviewers on this point, and they agreed that they are comfortable letting the authors address this concern either through revisions to the text or through a new experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is an important point to be explored and have thus performed a new experiment in order to test this possible confounding factor. We conditioned animals as described in the Figure 1A, but in the reactivation sessions, the CS and the US were presented in an unpaired manner. We found that if the weak US is not presented contingent with the CS, there is no fear reduction in the test, leading to significantly greater freezing than in the deconditioning-update group.</p><p>We refer to this experiment in the Results section and show its results in Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been greatly improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) In the Materials and methods section, indicate that pre-CS freezing was also scored and describe how (e.g., for an equivalent duration as the CS or the whole acclimation period).</p></disp-quote><p>Pre-CS freezing was measured for the 30 seconds immediately preceding the first tone (i.e. a duration equivalent to that of the tone).

Nevertheless, we note that switching the animals back to context A after extinction (i.e. retrieval) does lead to increased freezing levels – thus, at least some degree of differentiation between contexts is maintained. We agree with the reviewer that this issue should be discussed in the main text, and we now address it in the Discussion section, along with its implications for the deconditioning-update effect.</p><p>We also thought about including pre-CS freezing in the figures, but it would be rather complicated to do so, as each session would require its own pre-CS value. Thus, we agree with the reviewer that it would probably cause unnecessary confusion and hamper understanding the main effects (e.g. the differences in freezing in response to the tone) and have chosen not to do it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Authors state that &quot;Lower mismatch accelerates extinction and decreases renewal in a neural network model.&quot; A reviewer noted that they remain unconvinced that the data support that claim, nothing that, &quot;I don't believe extinction is tested directly in the referenced experiment, since it is assessed across days.

We have thus changed the statement “accelerate extinction” to “accelerates fear reduction” both in the Discussion section and in the legend of Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Monfils et al., 2009 should still appear in the introduction, since it was one of the first to employ a reconsolidation &quot;updating&quot; manipulation and, hence, is quite relevant to the present work.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and we have inserted this reference twice in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Clarify how the effect size was estimated for the power analyses. How did the authors arrive at 90% power?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not clearly understand what is meant by ‘estimated’, as effect sizes used for power calculations are usually chosen based on biological significance (e.g. a minimum effect size of interest) rather than through estimation of the effect size will actually be (although pilot data or other studies can be used for these means). We considered a 30% decrease in absolute freezing as a meaningful difference between reactivation procedures – on a range of that between the 1h retrieval-extinction groups with the mean of those outside the reconsolidation window in Monfils et al., 2009, for example.</p><p>Calculations were originally performed using the parameters mentioned in the manuscript (i.e. a 30% difference in freezing time, a standard deviation of 15%, α = 0.05, sample sizes between 6 and 10) for a 2-tailed t test using G*Power 3.1). Power in this case ranges from 90% in the worst-case scenario in our article (comparisons between groups with n = 6 and 7, respectively) to 99% in the best-case scenario (comparisons between groups with n = 10).</p><p>Nevertheless, in revising the calculations we have noticed that using 15% may have been an underestimation of the standard deviation in our experiments, as our variation was on average slightly higher. For Figure 1, for example, the average standard deviation in the Footshock and No-Footshock groups was around 18% for all sessions and 20% for the test sessions (i.e. excluding the reactivation ones, which begin with very low standard deviations).</p><p>We have thus chosen to revise the calculation included in the manuscript to account for a 20% standard deviation. This leads power to range between 69% in the worst-case scenario and 89% in the best-case one. The Materials and methods section has been revised accordingly, including a reference to Monfils et al., 2009 for the effect size used.</p></body></sub-article></article>
