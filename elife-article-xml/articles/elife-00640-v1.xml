One of the pheromones produced by male flies, for example, is a chemical called 11-cis-vaccenyl-acetate (cVA), which is an aphrodisiac for female flies and an anti-aphrodisiac for males.</p><p>The production of the correct pheromones in each sex is genetically controlled using a process called splicing that allows a single gene to be expressed as two or more different proteins. A variety of proteins called splicing factors ensures that splicing results in the production of the correct pheromones for each sex. Sometimes, however, the process by which sex genes are expressed as proteins can be ‘leaky’, which results in the wrong proteins being produced for one or both sexes.</p><p>Small RNA molecules called microRNAs act in some genetic pathways to limit the leaky expression of genes, and a microRNA called <italic>miR-124</italic> carries out this function in the developing brain <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

These behaviors are modulated in part by chemical cues, pheromones, used for intraspecific communication. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the courtship and aggressive behaviors exhibited by male flies are influenced by a cocktail of pheromones produced by males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jallon, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang and Anderson, 2010</xref>). Detection of pheromones is mediated by specific receptors that detect compounds spread by volatile diffusion and transferred during physical contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kurtovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vosshall, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stowers and Logan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thistle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Toda et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Pheromones in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> are strikingly sexually dimorphic in expression and in their effects on male and female behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jallon, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferveur and Sureau, 1996</xref>). Long-chained hydrocarbons present on the cuticular surface of the abdomen constitute a major class of <italic>Drosophila</italic> sex pheromones. The hydrocarbons are synthesized by specialized cells called oenocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Billeter et al., 2009</xref>). Female pheromones are largely comprised of <italic>cis, cis</italic>-7, 11-heptacosadiene and <italic>cis, cis</italic>-7, 11-nonacosadiene, both of which are known to serve as aphrodisiacs for males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antony et al., 1985</xref>). Males primarily produce hydrocarbons bearing a single double bond (e.g., <italic>cis</italic>-7-tricosene, <italic>cis</italic>-7-pentacosene and <italic>cis</italic>-9-pentacosene), although these compounds are also produced by females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jallon and David, 1987</xref>). The male-predominant <italic>cis</italic>-7-tricosene acts as an aphrodisiac for females but an anti-aphrodisiac for males. Members of the oenocyte-produced pentacosene family can also act as male aphrodisiacs, when present at high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scott and Richmond, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Siwicki et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> males also produce a different class of pheromones in the ejaculatory bulb, which are transferred during mating and mediate chemical communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guiraudie-Capraz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yew et al., 2009</xref>). 11-cis-Vaccenyl-Acetate (cVA), an oxygenated lipid, is thought to have an aphrodisiac effect on females, stimulating receptivity towards copulation, and acting as an anti-aphrodisiac for males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jallon, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cobb, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kurtovic et al., 2007</xref>). CH503 (3-acetoxy-11,19-octacosadien-1-ol), a second lipid made in the male ejaculatory bulb, also acts as an anti-aphrodisiac for males after being transferred to the female during mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yew et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Sexually dimorphic behavior and chemical communication are under the control of the sex determination pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burtis and Baker, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ryner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kimura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Villella et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vrontou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Siwicki and Kravitz, 2009</xref>). Expression of the splicing factor Sex-lethal (Sxl) in genetically female animals promotes sex specific splicing of the sexually dimorphic <italic>transformer</italic> transcript to produce the female splice form (Tra<sup>F</sup>). Tra<sup>F</sup> in turn promotes splicing to produce the female form of Doublesex (Dsx<sup>F</sup>). In the absence of Tra<sup>F</sup>, the default male form of Dsx (Dsx<sup>M</sup>) is produced, along with the male form of Fruitless (Fru<sup>M</sup>). Dsx proteins direct male vs female sexual differentiation, including pheromone production, as well as sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Waterbury et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rideout et al., 2010</xref>), whereas Fru<sup>M</sup> controls male sexual behavior but not pheromone production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demir and Dickson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Manoli et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>MicroRNAs have previously been implicated in the control of gene expression noise, acting as a backup mechanism to minimize the consequences of leaky expression of transcripts whose primary regulation is under transcriptional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stark et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bushati et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shkumatava et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weng and Cohen, 2012</xref>), reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herranz and Cohen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ebert and Sharp, 2012</xref>). miRNAs are also well suited to buffer the effects of inappropriate splicing. For example, <italic>miR-1</italic> can limit expression of the cytoplasmic splice form of tropomyosin, while sparing muscle specific splice forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stark et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>miR-124</italic> is abundantly expressed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, where it has been shown to limit leaky expression of an inhibitor of neuronal stem cell proliferation during larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weng and Cohen, 2012</xref>). Here we present evidence that <italic>miR-124</italic> acts to limit the impact of leaky regulation of splicing in the sexual differentiation pathway. <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant males showed reduced mating success when paired with female flies, and elicited courtship by normal males.

Initiation latency, the time taken by the male to recognize the female and begin courtship, was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Males use a courtship song produced by wing vibration to elicit receptivity in female flies. If a defect in courtship song is responsible for the poor mating success of <italic>mir-124</italic> mutant males, removal of the wings should eliminate the observed difference in receptivity of females to courtship. Under these conditions, <italic>miR-124</italic> mutants were also less successful in mating than control males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, courtship song does not appear to be an important contributor to the difference between control and mutant males.</p><p>Progression from courtship to copulation involves behavioral input from female flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rezaval et al., 2012</xref>). To remove female behavioral response from the assay, we tested decapitated target flies. We did not observe a reduction in the level of courtship activity by mutant males compared to that of control males under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus the failure to achieve copulation is unlikely due to reduced activity of the mutant male. Reduced copulation therefore likely reflects rejection of the <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant male’s advances by the female. This defect was rescued when <italic>miR-124</italic> expression was restored in the miRNA expressing cells of the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>miR-124</italic> mutant males induce aberrant behavior in other males</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> males normally pay little sexual attention to other sexually mature males. Males with altered sexual orientation elicit a behavior called chaining, in which groups of males follow each other while attempting courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall, 1978</xref>). We observed chaining among groups of <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant males. Male–male courtship could result from altered sexual orientation or from a change in the expression of inhibitory or stimulatory cues, or from an inability to recognize inhibitory courtship cues. To distinguish among these possibilities, we quantified the courtship behavior of mutant and control males when placed with mutant or control male targets. There was no difference in the amount of time that <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant or CS control males devoted to courtship of CS target males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant targets elicited more courtship activity from both CS control and <italic>miR-124</italic> males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, **p&lt;0.01). This effect was suppressed when <italic>miR-124</italic> expression was restored in its endogenous domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, **p&lt;0.01). Next, a courtship choice assay was performed in which test males were presented with a choice of decapitated control or <italic>miR-124</italic> target males.

Mutant males perfumed with cVA showed a significant improvement in their ability to achieve copulation with control females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, *p&lt;0.05). We also examined the effects of perfuming on male courtship behavior. Decapitated <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant males were perfumed with cVA and used as targets in the male–male courtship assay. There was no significant difference between courtship of targets perfumed with cVA or with the hexane solvent alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; the perfuming protocol restored cVA to &lt;50% the level on control flies, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The cVA-perfumed <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant target males also have elevated levels of the pentacosene pheromones. Thus, the perfumed mutant males are expected to give mixed excitatory and inhibitory courtship signals. In this context, the level of cVA reached by perfuming may be insufficient to fully rescue male–male courtship, while being sufficient to restore male–female courtship. However, we do not exclude the possibility that cVA might be more effective at inhibiting male courtship if presented at a higher local concentration. cVA is normally concentrated on the tip of the male ejaculatory apparatus. The perfuming experiment distributes cVA over the entire body.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Consequences of aberrant pheromone production</title><p>Although <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant males showed less mating success in the courtship assay, they are fertile in laboratory conditions.

determination pathway acts in a binary fashion, with particular spliced forms of the pathway being turned on or off, depending on the genetic sex of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cline and Meyer, 1996</xref>). The Sxl splicing factor is produced in genetic females and competes with U2AF, an essential splicing factor, for binding to a splice site in the <italic>tra</italic> primary transcript. In the presence of sufficient Sxl, U2AF binds to a lower affinity site and promotes splicing to produce the female-specific <italic>tra</italic><sup><italic>F</italic></sup> transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Valcarcel et al., 1993</xref>). Nonetheless, low-levels of the female-specific <italic>Sxl</italic> and <italic>tra</italic><sup><italic>F</italic></sup> transcripts have been observed in males (this report; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tarone et al., 2005</xref>). In the case of <italic>tra</italic><sup><italic>F</italic></sup>, this might reflect a low-level of U2AF binding to the low affinity site, even in the absence of Sxl. Leaky low-level expression of Sxl in males could be another contributing factor. Under normal conditions, the level of <italic>traF</italic> transcript found in males appears to be innocuous.</p><p>Inappropriate splicing to produce <italic>tra</italic><sup><italic>F</italic></sup> transcript in males is expected to increase production of <italic>dsx</italic><sup><italic>F</italic></sup> at the expense of <italic>dsx</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup>. Interestingly, the modest increase in the level of <italic>tra</italic><sup><italic>F</italic></sup> in <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant males led to reduced splicing of <italic>dsx</italic> to produce <italic>dsx</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup>, but we did not observe a corresponding increase in the production of the female splice form <italic>dsx</italic><sup><italic>F</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Production of <italic>dsx</italic><sup><italic>F</italic></sup> requires the assembly of a complex containing Tra<sup>F</sup> protein along with Tra2 and SR proteins at a series of sites that comprise the female-specific splice enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lynch and Maniatis, 1996</xref>). Our findings suggest that a modest increase in the level of Tra<sup>F</sup> protein can interfere with production of <italic>dsx</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup> without leading to production of <italic>dsx</italic><sup><italic>F</italic></sup>. If low levels of Tra<sup>F</sup> protein can lead to assembly of non-functional complexes, it is possible that their binding to the female-specific splice enhancer, might compromise male splicing without effectively promoting female splicing.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00640.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Transcript level of <italic>dsx</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup>, but not <italic>dsx</italic><sup><italic>F</italic></sup>, is affected by <italic>miR-124</italic> loss-of-function.</title><p>Expression of <italic>dsx</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup> (<bold>A</bold>) <italic>dsx</italic><sup><italic>F</italic></sup> (<bold>B</bold>) transcripts measured by quantitative real-time PCR using RNA isolated from male flies of the indicated genotypes. <italic>actin 42A</italic> was used as an internal control for normalization.

Genetic experiments have demonstrated the role of the Dsx protein in the regulation of male and female specific pheromone profiles. In females, Dsx<sup>F</sup> ensures the production of female-specific hydrocarbons while suppressing the production of male-specific hydrocarbons and other male-specific pheromones such as cVA. The presence of Dsx<sup>M</sup> protein in males ensures that synthesis of female-specific hydrocarbons are suppressed in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker and Belote, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Waterbury et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>In animals lacking <italic>miR-124</italic>, the level of <italic>tra</italic> transcripts increases. The presence of Tra<sup>F</sup> is expected to affect sexual differentiation in males. Gal4-directed expression of Dsx<sup>F</sup> in an otherwise wild-type male (also expressing Dsx<sup>M</sup>) has been reported to reduce cVA levels, whereas Dsx<sup>F</sup> expression in <italic>dsx</italic> mutant males abolished cVA production completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Waterbury et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Ectopic expression of Dsx<sup>F</sup> in XY males has also been shown to cause production in female-specific diene-hydrocarbons such as <italic>cis, cis</italic>-7, 11-heptacosadiene and <italic>cis, cis</italic>-7, 11-nonacosadiene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Waterbury et al., 1999</xref>). We did not detect these compounds in cuticular extracts from <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant males. The difference is likely due to the absence of <italic>miR-124</italic> expression in the oenocytes where the Tra<sup>F</sup>–Dsx<sup>F</sup> cascade is thought to exert its effect on female hydrocarbon production.</p><p>Regulation of male-specific hydrocarbons is probably more complex and is likely to involve modulation from the nervous system. Many of the characteristic male compounds are also synthesized by the oenocytes, since genetic ablation of these cells abolished all male hydrocarbon production, but does not affect levels of cVA, produced in the ejaculatory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Billeter et al., 2009</xref>). However, feminization of the nervous system in XY males led to significant elevation of characteristic male hydrocarbons such as cis-7-tricosene and cis-9-pentacosene, although no gain of female hydrocarbons was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandez et al., 2010</xref>). Brain specific depletion of <italic>desat1,</italic> which encodes a desaturase enzyme involved in pheromone biosynthesis, was shown to alter pheromone production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bousquet et al., 2012</xref>).

The percentage of females that accepted copulation by CS males was recorded for each genotype.</p><p>Male–male courtship assays: on the day of the experiment, target males were briefly anesthetized on ice and decapitated with a razor blade before being introduced into courtship chambers. Individual intact test males were gently aspirated into the chamber containing a decapitated target and the behavior of the test males was recorded for 45 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Female choice assays</title><p>Round chambers of 10 mm diameter and 4 mm height were used for the mating competition assay. Mutants and wild-type male flies were collected at late pupal stage and isolated in standard food vials. On the fourth day post eclosion, mutants and controls were anaesthetized briefly and marked with acrylic paint at the back of the thorax. On the fifth day, a mutant and a wild-type with different colors were introduced into a courtship chamber containing a Canton-S virgin female and were videotaped for 70 min. The percentage of copulation success for both mutants and controls was measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Aggression assay</title><p>The fighting chamber was 16 mm in diameter and 9 mm in height. A food patch was introduced by pipetting 50 μl of melted standard fly food in the center of the chamber. Pairs of socially naïve 5 day-old male flies were aspirated gently into the fighting chamber. Behavior was recorded for 45 min. Experimental and control groups were videotaped simultaneously. Fighting latency measures the number of encounters until the first antagonistic encounter between the pair. Frequency reports the number of incidents, including lunging and fencing, observed in 30 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Locomotion assay</title><p>5-day-old socially naïve CS or <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant males were individually aspirated into the courtship chamber used for the male–female courtship assay as described above. The activity of the fly was videotaped for 15 min by a Sony Camcorder and analyzed by ImageJ. The velocity of the fly in the first 10 min of observation was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cuticular hydrocarbon extraction</title><p>Flies were reared as for the behavior assays and aged in groups of 15–20 flies per vial. Six replicates of fifteen 5-day-old male flies were anaesthetized on ice and placed into 1.8 ml glass microvials with Teflon caps (s/n 224740; Wheaton, Millville, NJ). 120 µl of hexane (Fisher Chemicals, Pittsburgh, PA) containing 10 μg/ml of hexacosane (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) standard was added into each vial and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. 100 μl of solvent was transferred into a new vial and evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen. Extract was stored at −20°C until analysis. At least three biological replicates were prepared per genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis</title><p>Extracts were re-dissolved in 60 µl of hexane and transferred into GC-MS vials (Supelco). Analysis was run in a 5% phenyl-methylpolysiloxane (DB-5, 30 m length, 0.32 i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) column and GCMS QP2010 system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with an initial column temperature of 50°C for 2 min and increment to 300°C at a rate of 15 °C/min in splitless mode. The relative signal intensity for each hydrocarbon species was calculated by dividing the area under the chromatography peak by the total area under all of the peaks. The values from 3–6 replicate measurements were averaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Pheromone perfuming</title><p>For application of synthetic compounds to target flies, 9 μg of synthetic cVA (Cayman Chemical Company Ann Arbor, MI) was diluted in 200 μl of hexane and introduced into a 1.8-ml glass microvial. The hexane was evaporated under a gentle flow of nitrogen, leaving the compound as a residue coating the bottom of the vial. Flies were briefly anaesthetized on ice, transferred to coated vials in groups of seven, and subjected to three vortex pulses lasting 20 s each, with 10 s pauses between each pulse. The perfumed flies were allowed to recover for about 1 hr in fresh vials with standard food. Six flies from each group were used for behavioral tests and the remaining fly was subjected to hydrocarbon analysis by Direct Analysis in Real Time mass spectrometry to monitor effective transfer of the test compound to the flies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of perfumed insects using Direct Analysis in Real Time mass spectrometry (DART MS)</title><p>The atmospheric pressure ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (AccuTOF-DART, JEOL USA, Inc.) was equipped with a DART interface and operated in positive-ion mode at a resolving power of 6000 (FWHM definition). Mass accuracy is within ±15 ppm. The DART interface was operated using the following settings: the gas heater was set to 200°C, the glow discharge needle was set at 3.5 kV. Electrode 1 was set to +150 V and electrode 2 was set to +250 V. He<sub>2</sub> gas flow was set to 2.5 l/min. Under these conditions, mostly protonated ([M + H]<sup>+</sup>) molecules are observed. Using clean forceps, an anaesthetized fly was picked up by both wings, making sure not to damage the fly. The fly was placed in a stream of charged helium gas until peaks of triacylglycerides start to appear. All fly samples were placed approximately in the same location in the DART source for the same amount of time in order to obtain reproducible spectra. Six flies from each genotype were measured. Polyethylene glycol (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as calibrant. Relative quantification of compound abundance was performed by normalizing the areas under the signal corresponding to cVA ([M + H]<sup>+</sup> 311.29) to the tricosene signal ([M + H]<sup>+</sup> 323.36). DART MS is unable to differentiate isoforms of tricosene therefore the tricosene signal represents the summed signal intensity from 5, 7, and 9-Tricosene. Tricosene was selected as the normalization peak due to the unaltered levels in mutants compared to CS controls in GC-MS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis for behavior assays and hydrocarbon quantification was done using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). For behavior data, a nonparametric Mann–Whitney test was used to compare two samples. Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post-test was used to compare multiple samples. For hydrocarbon analysis, multi-way ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD post-test was performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Transfection and luciferase assays</title><p>S2 cells were transfected in 24-well plates with 250 ng of miRNA expression plasmid or empty vector, 25 ng of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, and 25 ng of Renilla luciferase DNA as a transfection control. Transfections were performed in triplicate in at least three independent experiments. 60 hr after transfection, dual luciferase assays (Promega, Madison, WI) were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Bruce Baker, Stephen Goodwin and Barry Dickson for fly strains and reagents, Kah-Junn Tan for technical support and D Foronda, H Herranz, J Varghese, LC Foo, J-M Kugler and WC Ng for helpful discussion.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, of whom, Mani Ramaswami, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript describes male-specific behavioral defects in <italic>miR-124</italic> mutants, nicely demonstrating that <italic>miR-124</italic> is required for the development/expression of male-specific courtship and aggressive behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These behavioral defects of <italic>miR-124</italic> mutants, as well as associated changes in production of the pheromone cVA, are linked to increased expression of transformer (<italic>tra</italic>), a splicing factor that regulates the male-specific splicing of its downstream targets, <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic>. Several lines of evidence show <italic>tra</italic> to be a target of <italic>miR-124</italic>, and reduction of <italic>tra</italic> is shown to suppress <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant phenotypes. As cVA is a cuticular hydrocarbon of males flies that mediates male–female attraction, as well as male–male repulsion, several of the behavioral defects of <italic>miR-124</italic> are proposed to be explained by the dysregulation of one downstream target, <italic>tra</italic>, and its role in the production of sex-specific pheromones. Together, this supports a model in which endogenous <italic>miR-124</italic> (and therefore potentially other miRNAs) act to suppress phenotypes that may result from the leaky regulation of tissue and sex-specific mRNA splicing.</p><p>In terms of novelty and interest, this is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, several additional experiments and substantive revisions are required to strengthen some key conclusions. The most important of which are essential to convincingly explain the links between altered <italic>tra</italic> expression, altered pheromone production, and behavior.</p><p>1) As <italic>tra</italic> function in sex determination is mediated through its effects on <italic>fru</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic>, and a major hypothesis here is that increased levels of <italic>tra</italic> would result in leaky regulation of sex-specific splicing, it would be valuable to assess how the expression of these transcripts downstream of <italic>tra</italic> is affected <italic>miR-124</italic> mutants. Leaky <italic>tra</italic><sup><italic>F</italic></sup> would suggest the male makes less <italic>Fru</italic>, less <italic>Dsx</italic><sup><italic>M</italic></sup>, and some <italic>Dsx</italic><sup><italic>F</italic></sup>.</p><p>2) It is necessary to establish the cell type in which <italic>miR-124</italic> repression of <italic>tra</italic> occurs, as relevant to the production of cVA. Is <italic>miR-124</italic> expressed in oenocytes? Is reduction of <italic>tra</italic> in <italic>miR-124</italic> oenocytes sufficient to suppress <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant phenotypes? Is reduction of <italic>tra</italic> in the nervous system sufficient (if so, then this should be explained), or not, to suppress <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant phenotypes?</p><p>3) An alternative hypothesis for <italic>miR-124</italic> behavioral phenotypes is that increased levels of <italic>tra</italic> in <italic>miR-124</italic> mutants results in altered development/morphology of sex-specific neural circuitry. An analysis of the anatomy of <italic>fru</italic> or <italic>dsx</italic> expressing neurons in brains of <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant and <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant flies with reduced <italic>tra</italic> levels will allow a deeper understanding of the link between elevated <italic>tra</italic> expression in <italic>miR-124</italic> mutants and associated behavioral phenotypes.</p><p>4) Throughout the text and figure legends the authors should be explicit about which genotypes have been used, particularly for <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant males. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, what is the deficiency used? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, what is the <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant male genotype?

Male–female courtship values seem to show an unacceptably large distribution. It is not clear from these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) whether or not <italic>miR-124</italic> affects male–female courtship.</p><p>6) The origins, details, and properties of the <italic>miR-124</italic> mutant, rescuing transgene, sponge and <italic>miR-124-Gal4</italic> should be provided in the Materials and methods.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00640.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) As</italic> tra <italic>function in sex determination is mediated through its effects on</italic> fru <italic>and</italic> dsx<italic>, and a major hypothesis here is that increased levels of</italic> tra <italic>would result in leaky regulation of sex-specific splicing, it would be valuable to assess how the expression of these transcripts downstream of</italic> tra <italic>is affected</italic> miR-124 <italic>mutants.
