Splicing removes the introns and joins the exons together to form a molecule of ‘messenger RNA’, which is translated into a protein.</p><p>Over the course of evolution, many groups—or families—of proteins have expanded and diversified their roles.

In this way, a single gene can produce a number of different proteins. These closely related proteins are known as isoforms.</p><p>The brain contains billions of neurons that communicate with one another across connections known as synapses. A family of proteins called neurexins helps neurons to form these synapses. Humans have three neurexin genes, which undergo extensive alternative splicing to produce thousands of protein isoforms. However, it is not known whether all of these isoforms are produced in neurons, as existing experimental techniques were not sensitive enough to easily distinguish one isoform from another.</p><p>A technique known as ‘selected reaction monitoring’ (or SRM for short) has recently emerged as a promising way to identify proteins.

Schreiner, Simicevic et al. have now developed SRM further and show that this technique can detect the identity and amount of the neurexin isoforms present at synapses, including those that are only produced in very small quantities. Using SRM, Schreiner, Simicevic et al. demonstrate that neurexin isoforms differ in how they interact with synaptic receptors.

Major advances in transcriptomics have enabled the identification of gene regulatory programs and mRNA targets that underlie specification of neuronal cell types and their plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hobert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ebert and Greenberg, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Molyneaux et al., 2015</xref>). For example, specific transcriptional programs direct the neurotransmitter phenotypes of neuronal populations, the targeting of axonal projections, or the modification of synapse numbers in response to neuronal activity. In addition, transcript-based studies have uncovered gene families with substantial molecular complexity that may encode neuronal recognition events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zipursky and Sanes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schreiner et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>What remains a major challenge is the exploration of such molecular programs and their function at the protein level. mRNA and protein turnover rates as well as mRNA translation rates exhibit a significant dynamic range. Thus, transcript abundance cannot easily be extrapolated to provide quantitative assessments of the proteome or insights into the stoichiometry of protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Helbig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schwanhausser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogel and Marcotte, 2012</xref>). Notably, such post-transcriptional forms of gene regulation are particularly prevalent in the central nervous system highlighting the need for quantitative approaches that enable targeted dissection of the neuronal proteome. Additionally, many neurons possess long-distance projections. The localization of presynaptic proteins in many cases differs from the anatomical place of their mRNA expression. Thus, the possibility to detect and quantify isoforms at the protein level provides an important advantage in order to understand the functional role of these proteins.</p><p>New developments in proteomics have driven major advances in understanding the cell biological mechanisms of neuronal development and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayes and Grant, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Craft et al., 2013</xref>). These led to the delineation of the composition of purified synaptic vesicles, postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor complexes, or models of presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shanks et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwenk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilhelm et al., 2014</xref>). Most of these studies employed semi-quantitative ‘shotgun’ mass spectrometry approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Venable et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neilson et al., 2011</xref>) that are based on the random sampling of peptide fragments detected in a sample. In this regard, the complexity of neuronal tissues and the molecular diversity of some neuronal receptor families pose significant limitations. First, many proteins are present in only a fraction of the cells or structures analyzed reducing the chance of detecting peptide levels required for adequate quantification. Second, over the past years alternative splicing has emerged as a key mechanism for the regulation of neuronal recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takahashi and Craig, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iijima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lah et al., 2014</xref>). Alternative splicing programs can generate families of tens, hundreds, or even thousands of closely related protein isoforms frequently distinguished by only a single peptide. Thus, when applying random sampling (‘shotgun’) approaches it is challenging to obtain sufficient coverage for isoform detection and quantification. Additionally, the protein inference problem, i.e., presence of the same peptide sequence in multiple different proteins or protein isoforms limits applicability of ‘shotgun’ approaches for detection and quantification of protein families with high sequence homologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nesvizhskii and Aebersold, 2005</xref>).</p><p>One possibility to circumvent these problems is the application of targeted proteomic approaches, such as selected reaction monitoring (SRM; also referred to as MRM for ‘multiple reaction monitoring’). While originally developed for characterization of chemical compounds this method has recently emerged as promising technique for the quantitative analysis of protein species in biological samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Phanstiel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Picotti and Aebersold, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carr et al., 2014</xref>). Instead of sampling a random portion of the proteome, SRM assays use optimized separation and detection parameters for a set of pre-selected peptides (termed proteotypic peptides or PTPs) that are specific to a protein or isoform of interest. PTPs are detected based on their chromatographic retention time and mass to charge ratio (rather than by sequencing as in shotgun proteomics). For each PTP, an isotopically labeled reference peptide is added to the sample which then is used as standard for quantification. This strategy greatly reduces experimental variability and significantly increases sensitivity in the detection and quantification of selected peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2014</xref>). To date, significant contributions in advancing our knowledge in biology have been made by applying SRM-based approaches, in particular to profile cellular pathways and metabolic states, thereby quantifying low abundance proteins within complex mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Picotti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simicevic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>). SRM assays have also been applied successfully to detect and quantify neuronal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Craft et al., 2013</xref>). However, the applicability for the dissection of highly diversified protein families in complex tissues remains to be explored.</p><p>In this study, we developed an array of SRM-based assays for the detection and quantification of highly diversified neuronal receptors. As a case study we focused on neurexins, a class of synaptic adhesion molecules which are widely expressed in the CNS and play an important role in synapse formation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dean et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Missler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graf et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chih et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Taniguchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uemura et al., 2010</xref>). In mammals, three neurexin genes (<italic>Nrxn</italic>1, 2, 3) are transcribed from two alternative promoters giving rise to long alpha-neurexin and short beta-neurexin transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reissner et al., 2013</xref>). Alternative splicing at six alternatively spliced segments (AS1-6) generates &gt;1000 unique isoforms which can be detected in the adult brain at the transcript level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baudouin and Scheiffele, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schreiner et al., 2014b</xref>). Importantly, insertion or skipping of alternative exons at two of the alternatively spliced segments (AS2 and AS4) was reported to regulate binding of neurexins to a number of different interaction partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ichtchenko et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sugita et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chih et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koehnke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siddiqui et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uemura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reissner et al., 2013</xref>). This raises the possibility that neurexin molecular diversity—and in particular its regulation by alternative splicing—may serve synaptic recognition events that control neuronal wiring and function.</p><p>The challenge with exploring isoform-specific functions is the lack of suitable tools to detect or quantify endogenous neurexin protein variants. Thus, even fundamental questions have remained unanswered: are neurexins abundant synaptic components? What is the relative contribution of the individual neurexin isoforms (NRX1, 2, 3 alpha and beta forms) to the total neurexin repertoire? Are proteins produced from all of the detected alternative transcripts, in particular transcripts encoding rare splice insertions? And does alternative splicing at all sites modify receptor–ligand interactions? Lastly, any studies on selective receptor–ligand interactions have relied on overexpressed or recombinant proteins as no assays are available to specifically probe or detect the endogenous protein isoforms.</p><p>In this study, we developed, validated, and applied a targeted proteomics workflow for the analysis of neurexin protein variants in the mouse brain using SRM-based assays. We provide a detailed protein expression map of neurexin alternative splice insertions, their absolute quantification, and uncover novel alternative splicing-dependent regulation of neurexin–ligand interactions. This workflow can be highly multiplexed and applied to virtually any protein family and tissue. Thus, it provides important new directions for the dissection of molecular diversity in cellular recognition and pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and characterization of peptide library and sample preparation</title><p>We established an array of targeted proteomic assays that allow for detection and quantitative determination of neurexin variants in complex samples.

Since neurexins are known to be glycosylated we examined peptides for the presence of consensus sequences for carbohydrate modifications and excluded peptides with potential post-translational modification from our assays. To evaluate the suitability of the selected peptides for MS detection, chemically synthesized peptides were analyzed on a triple-quadrupole LC-MS instrument. For each peptide, we determined retention times, fragmentation patterns and optimized collision energies in order to devise highly sensitive and specific SRM assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2 fig1s3 fig1s4 fig1s5 fig1s6 fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–7</xref>, see ‘Materials and methods’ for details).</p><p>Peptide identification in SRM is based on the chromatographic properties, mass, and charge of proteotypic peptides but lacks the sequencing capabilities of shotgun approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carr et al., 2014</xref>).

Note that several of the isoform-specific peptides differ in only a single amino acid residue between the NRX1, NRX2, and NRX3 isoforms making MS-based approaches the method of choice to specifically detect them.

For all three neurexins, the alpha-isoforms represented the major protein variants, whereas beta variants were 2- to 4-fold less abundant (NRX1beta: 0.87 ± 0.36 fmol/μg, NRX1-alpha: 3.86 ± 0.46 fmol/μg, NRX2-beta: 1.39 ± 0.49 fmol/μg, NRX2-alpha: 2.19 ± 0.83, NRX3-beta: 1.97 ± 1.6 fmol/μg, NRX3-alpha: 4.18 ± 0.45 fmol/μg, n = 4, ±SD). Importantly, independent measurements with in vitro translated alpha and beta standard proteins for each primary NRX isoform (each quantified based on different PTPs) yielded highly similar results for pan-NRX amounts as well as the contents of alpha and beta isoforms.

Based on the normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zybailov et al., 2006</xref>) of proteins identified by shotgun analysis, neurexins were amongst the most abundant proteins associated with the receptor proteins.

Interestingly, LRRTM2 beads led to a more robust isolation of NRX2-derived peptides as compared to NL1B and NL3A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Quantification by spectral counts provides a good estimate of total protein isoforms derived from the individual <italic>Nrxn</italic> genes but enables only limited detection of isoforms identified by short unique sequence elements, such as beta isoforms or specific splice variants (e.g., average spectral counts for NRX-beta isoforms were ≤3 in three independent pull-down experiments). By contrast, SRM analysis revealed highly significant differential recovery of specific neurexin isoforms on the postsynaptic ligands. Comparison of neurexin isoforms associated with NL1B and NL3A2 matrices revealed preferential binding of NRX1 and 2 alpha forms to NL3A2 over NL1B. The selectivity of interactions was even more significant when comparing binding to LRRTM2 vs NL1B or NL3A2. LRRTM2 showed higher recovery of NRX1alpha and 2 alpha isoforms and lower recovery of NRX1beta and 2beta isoforms. Most importantly, NRX1alpha variants containing AS3 and AS6 insertions were significantly de-enriched in LRRTM2 pull-downs as compared to NL1B and NL3A2.

Thus, the regulation of LRRTM2 binding to laminin-G domain 6 might involve a modification of the flexibility positioning laminin-G domains 1-5 vs the EGF domain 3 and laminin-G domain 6 in the NRX1alpha structure. Moreover, modeling studies predict that NRX1alpha AS3 is positioned in close proximity to an interaction surface with neuroligins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>). This might underlie the modulation of NRX1alpha-NL3A2 interactions by AS3 insertions observed in our assays.</p><p>Based on our absolute quantification experiments, we come to two important conclusions. First, within individual brain regions, neurexin-alpha isoforms are significantly more abundant than beta isoforms. In fact, many previous studies with exogenously expressed neurexins focused on NRX1beta isoforms but our quantitative analysis demonstrates that these forms are the least abundant of all neurexins in vivo. Considering that neurexin-alpha and beta forms differ in their interactions with receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boucard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chih et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siddiqui et al., 2010</xref>), this has important functional implications. Second, comparison of absolute levels of neurexins with other synaptic proteins demonstrates that neurexins are rather abundant synaptic proteins. For example, the total amount of all neurexin proteins is similar to that of N-cadherin, a highly abundant synaptic protein and about one third of the amount of PSD95, one of the most abundant proteins in glutamatergic synapses.</p><p>During the development of our study, we evaluated the use of AQUA synthetic peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerber et al., 2003</xref>) for quantification of brain protein repertoires. We observed that several different synthetic AQUA peptides reporting on the same neurexin isoform often yielded divergent results, making a reliable quantification difficult (data not shown). This is most likely due to the variability in tryptic digests of endogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arsene et al., 2008</xref>). To circumvent these problems, we utilized an in vitro recombinant protein expression system, to use surrogate protein-constructs as standards for quantification. This approach is not only more robust and more accurate, but is also cost-effective, can be multiplexed by using multiple different tags in the isotopically labeled function proteins (in addition to GFP) and can be scaled to screen large numbers of different proteins and isoforms. Thus, the experimental pipeline established here is readily transferable to any protein class of interest.</p><p>Finally, our SRM approach provides an attractive alternative to isotope labeling-based massspectrometry approaches such as SILAC. Notably, SILAC labeling has been most frequently applied to cell culture or microorganisms. This powerful technique has been extended to higher organisms, by using labeled cell lines as an internal standard for quantitation or raising rodents for multiple generations on a diet with heavy isotope-labeled amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kruger et al., 2008</xref>). While methods are well suited to assess overall proteome modifications it remains challenging to measure proteins of low abundance or protein isoforms in a consistent manner and across large sample numbers with reasonable throughput, due to fact that neuronal tissues are complex and heterogeneous. In most instances, the SRM-assays developed and validated here for mouse tissues can be directly transferred to assessing protein levels in small amounts of biopsy material from human patients or postmortem brain tissue. This is particularly interesting for the <italic>Nrxn</italic> gene family as <italic>Nrxn</italic>1 mutations are associated with autism and schizophrenia in the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reichelt et al., 2012</xref>). Given the complexity and size of the mammalian neurexin genes it is difficult to predict the impact of such mutations on the expression and function of the neurexin proteins. In the future, the approach established here can be readily applied to iPSC-derived human neurons, biopsy or postmortem tissue and enables exploration of the impact of such mutations on the neurexin isoform repertoires.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>Brain regions were dissected, weighed, and homogenized in a glass-Teflon homogenizer in 1:20 wt/vol of solution A (0.32M sucrose 1 mM MgCl2 0.5 mM CaCl2 1 mM NaHCO3 complemented with Roche ‘Complete’ protease inhibitors).

The MASCOT search criteria were set as follows: 10 ppm precursor ion mass tolerance, 0.6 Da fragment ion mass tolerance, full tryptic specificity was required (cleavage after lysine or arginine residues unless followed by proline), up to 2 missed cleavages were allowed, carbamidomethylation (C), were set as fixed modification and oxidation (M) as a variable modification. Next, the database search results were imported to the Scaffold software (version 4.3.2, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) and the protein false identification rate was set to 1% based on the number of decoy hits. Specifically, peptide identifications were accepted if they could achieve an FDR less than 1.0% by the scaffold local FDR algorithm. Protein identifications were accepted if they could achieve an FDR less than 1.0% and contained at least 1 identified peptide.

Your Tools and Resources article has been favorably evaluated by Aviv Regev (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three peer reviewers.</p><p>All three reviewers are highly enthusiastic about publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer 1 said that: “This is a very nice, clear, and crisp paper with a few very interesting insights on a very interesting protein family. The SRM workflow established by the authors looks powerful and will be interesting to a wide spectrum of potential users. The key data on the relative and absolute abundance of different Nrxns and their different association with ligands are very interesting and will also be received with substantial interest.”</p><p>Reviewer 2 stated: “While technical in scope, this work provides novel insights into receptor isoform expression and splicing-dependent recognition for synaptic ligands. The proteomics components of this work are very strong and represent a significant amount of work. Especially the absolute quantification experiments using accurately quantified GFP and GFP fusions generated in vitro was quite clever and could be easily extended to similar biological questions. Obtained results are systematically analyzed and initial validations performed that will guide future in-depth mechanistic investigations. Overall, I felt this work presented a substantial amount of work and a benchmark of how to use target proteomics strategies to obtain novel insights into isoform-specific biology. I am quite positive to support publication of this work in <italic>eLife</italic>.”</p><p>Reviewer 3: “In this manuscript titled ‘Quantitative Isoform-Profiling of Highly Diversified Recognition Molecules’, Schreiner and colleagues report a mass spectroscopy based method that permits quantitative measurement of different splice variants and isoforms of the highly diverse neurexin cell adhesion protein family. They do so by developing a workflow for targeted mass spectroscopy that is based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) signatures of individual variants. Their results provide quantitative measurement of neurexins from different regions of mouse brain and reveal the relative abundance of certain isoforms. In general the experiments are well executed and the strategy is elegant. The possibility of extending this type of analyses to other protein families is very attractive.”</p><p>However, we request the following textual and figure revisions before acceptance.</p><p>1) The Introduction is not accessible to a broad audience. It is full of jargon and does not provide the important background on the targeted mass spectroscopy. Having an informative and general Introduction is critical for the readers to understand the technical aspects of this method. Instead of the sections that review other approaches on mass spectroscopy in extensive detail, the authors should explain with better clarity the reasoning behind developing the SRM approach.</p><p>2) The authors have prepared TX-100 insoluble membrane fractions for their analysis. They have a supplemental figure showing the workflow, however no data is provided to display what this fractionation step selects for. Are NRXs and other synaptic proteins enriched in these membranes? Are these presynaptic and/or postsynaptic fractions? Do these fractions include all types of synapses (excitatory and inhibitory) or this method only enriches for one type over the other? These are important distinctions to make otherwise the data that is provided may not reflect the endogenous levels of NRX variants in the brain, but just in these detergent insoluble fractions.</p><p>3) NRXs are thought to be primarily presynaptic. So the NRX species in a brain region may be originating from the innervations from another region. This is not mentioned in the paper and is an important point to make.</p><p>4) It was not completely clear how many of the &gt;1000 isoforms (see Introduction) are actually amendable to SRM development. Do all of these isoforms generate peptides that could be used in SRM-MS, based on common restrictions of usable peptides? Please comment?</p><p>5) In the subsection headed “Profiling recognition specificity of Neurexin receptors”, why are the authors using spectral counting in their binding studies since SRM assays have already been developed?</p><p>6) It was interesting to see that AQUA peptides resulted in poor quantitative data, while the in vitro recombinant protein expression system was able to overcome these issues. Could the authors comment if any of the neurexin receptors are PTM modified in vivo and how this could affect quantification in their assay?</p><p>7) In the subsection entitled “In vitro-expressed synaptic protein identification”, it is not completely clear how the database for the mascot searched was generated. Was this a combination of SwissProtein plus NRX sequences based on the authors RNA-seq data?</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A/B</xref>: The relative quantification compared to the OB samples was based on all peptides shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>?</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>: Why are there no error bars on these figures?</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>: were the two technical replicates averaged?

Having an informative and general Introduction is critical for the readers to understand the technical aspects of this method. Instead of the sections that review other approaches on mass spectroscopy in extensive detail, the authors should explain with better clarity the reasoning behind developing the SRM approach</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate this concern. We have now significantly reworked this section. We eliminated the general description of other mass-spec approaches and provide a more focused introduction to targeted proteomics.</p><p><italic>2) The authors have prepared TX-100 insoluble membrane fractions for their analysis.

We apologize that it may not have been highlighted appropriately and may have been missed in the review.</p><p>To validate the use of Triton-resistant membranes in this analysis all fractions were analyzed by shotgun proteomics and the SRM approach. The data from this analysis is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>. Using hierarchical clustering analysis of protein abundance determined based on spectral counts we find that at the global level enrichment/ de-enrichment is very similar in the “conventional” postsynaptic density fraction and the Triton X-100 resistant membranes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We further examined enrichment of neurexin isoforms, excitatory and inhibitory markers, as well as pre- and postsynaptic proteins to explore whether the method may enrich one specific fraction over another. These comparisons are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>In brief, we find that enrichment of neurexin 1,2,3 alpha and beta forms is very similar in “conventional” postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction and the Triton X-100 resistant membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>We find that the enrichment of pre- and postsynaptic markers is somewhat reduced in the Triton X-100 resistant membranes as compared to PSD preparations but there is no differential enrichment with respect to pre- vs postsynaptic markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Finally, by surveying a panel of inhibitory (mostly GABAergic) and excitatory (glutamatergic) markers we do not observe differential enrichment for synaptic proteins associated with synapses of either neurotransmitter phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>This data is summarized in the subsection “Generation and characterization of peptide library and sample preparation” of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) NRXs are thought to be primarily presynaptic. So the NRX species in a brain region may be originating from the innervations from another region. This is not mentioned in the paper and is an important point to make</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this remark. We agree that due to the long-distance neuronal projections neurexin expression at mRNA level and the protein localization might differ significantly with respect to brain regions. Since this issue applies to most synaptic proteins we added this important point in the Introduction.</p><p><italic>4) It was not completely clear how many of the &gt;1000 isoforms (see Introduction) are actually amendable to SRM development. Do all of these isoforms generate peptides that could be used in SRM-MS, based on common restrictions of usable peptides? Please comment</italic>?</p><p>We now included the coverage of alternatively spliced segments assessed in this study in the Discussion. Moreover, we did highlight the possibility of extending our approach to the analysis of all alternatively spliced segments in neurexins using a combination of proteolytic enzymes (in addition to trypsin which was used in the analysis described in this manuscript).</p><p><italic>5) In the subsection headed “Profiling recognition specificity of Neurexin receptors”</italic>, <italic>why are the authors using spectral counting in their binding studies since SRM assays have already been developed</italic>?</p><p>The main reason to also include spectral count data derived from shotgun analysis was to compare the two methods. This comparison highlights the benefits of implementation of targeted-SRM for quantitative mass spectrometric analysis.</p><p><italic>6) It was interesting to see that AQUA peptides resulted in poor quantitative data, while the</italic> in vitro <italic>recombinant protein expression system was able to overcome these issues</italic>. <italic>Could the authors comment if any of the neurexin receptors are PTM modified</italic> in vivo <italic>and how this could affect quantification in their assay</italic>?</p><p>We now provide further information on the potential impact of post-translational modifications in the Results section of the manuscript. Please note that the in vitro translated protein standards used for quantification also lack posttranslational modifications (they are generated in a cell-free transcription-translation system). Thus, the poor quantitative data observed for AQUA peptides arises primarily from inefficient digest of endogenous proteins most probably due to the amino acid sequences surrounding the tryptic cleavage sites. Producing the proteotypic peptide from the digest of in vitro expressed protein circumvents this problem to a significant extend.</p><p><italic>7) In the subsection entitled “In vitro-expressed synaptic protein identification”, it is not completely clear how the database for the mascot searched was generated.
