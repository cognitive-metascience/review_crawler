The requirements for these signals, however, vary from dispensable to essential in different infections. We examined the underlying mechanisms of this differential T cell costimulation dependence and found that the viral context determined the dependence on CD28/B7-mediated costimulation for expansion of naive and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, indicating that the requirement for costimulatory signals is not imprinted. Notably, related to the high-level costimulatory molecule expression induced by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), CD28/B7-mediated costimulation was dispensable for accumulation of LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells because of redundancy with the costimulatory pathways induced by TNF receptor family members (i.e., CD27, OX40, and 4-1BB). Type I IFN signaling in viral-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is slightly redundant with costimulatory signals. These results highlight that pathogen-specific conditions differentially and uniquely dictate the utilization of costimulatory pathways allowing shaping of effector and memory antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07486.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07486.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07486.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When the immune system detects a virus in the body it mounts a response to eliminate it. Immune cells called CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells detect fragments of virus proteins that are presented on the surface of other immune cells. The CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells then rapidly divide to form populations that roam the body to kill cells that are infected with the virus. Afterwards, some of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells become ‘memory T cells’, which allow the immune system to respond more rapidly if the virus returns. This means that a subsequent infection of the same virus is usually stopped before it can become severe enough for an individual to feel unwell.</p><p>Vaccines take advantage of the activities of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to enable a person to become ‘immune’ to a virus without having to experience the disease. Vaccines contain dead or weakened viruses that can't spread in the body, but are able to activate the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, a vaccine may not be as effective in activating the T cells as the live virus, perhaps because it fails to trigger the production of other molecules in the host that promote T cell activation. There are many of these ‘co-stimulatory molecules’ in the body, but it is not clear exactly how they work.</p><p>Now, Welten et al. show that the role of co-stimulatory molecules in the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells depends on the type of virus and how it affects cells. Mice that were genetically engineered to lack two co-stimulatory molecules called CD80 and CD86 failed to accumulate active CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to infection with a herpes-like virus. However, if these mice were infected with a different virus called LCMV—which causes swelling of the brain and spinal cord—they produced many active CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to fight the infection.</p><p>Welten et al. found that other co-stimulatory molecules are able to compensate for the loss of CD80 and CD86 to boost the activation of T cells in response to LCMV, but not the herpes-like virus. Further experiments showed that LCMV triggers a lot more inflammation in infected cells than the other virus. This leads to the production of many different types of co-stimulatory molecules, which ensures that if one fails to boost the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, another molecule can do so instead. Better understanding of how these co-stimulatory molecules work could help scientists to develop more effective vaccines in future.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07486.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07486.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>t cell</kwd><kwd>costimulation</kwd><kwd>viral infection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005039</institution-id><institution>Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gisela Thier</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arens</surname><given-names>Ramon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Redundancy in the costimulatory signals that drive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion is dictated by pathogen-specific cues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are critical for elimination of various intracellular pathogens. By incorporating differences in TCR signal strength and duration (signal 1), the spatiotemporal availability of costimulatory molecules (signal 2) and defined cytokines in the inflammatory environment (signal 3), CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are differentially programmed for expansion and effector cell formation resulting in considerable plasticity of the response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Williams and Bevan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arens and Schoenberger, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Costimulatory molecules augment TCR triggering but also qualitatively contribute to achieve optimal T cell expansion and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Croft, 2003</xref>). CD28 is considered as the most prominent costimulatory receptor for T cells, but signals provided by members of the TNF receptor (TNFR) super family such as CD27, OX40 (CD134) and 4-1BB (CD137) are known to provide crucial signals as well. T cell responses seem to be differentially and contextually dependent on costimulatory interactions but the underlying mechanisms are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeBenedette et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Welten et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wortzman et al., 2013</xref>). For example, the pathogen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response during vesicular stomatitis virus and vaccinia virus (VV) infection is highly driven by interactions between CD28 and the B7 molecules B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sigal et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bertram et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fuse et al., 2008</xref>), while in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection the viral-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells seem to bypass the requirements of the CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway for primary effector T cell expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shahinian et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kundig et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andreasen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grujic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eberlein et al., 2012</xref>). Even within a single infection distinct requirements for costimulatory signals can be observed. In mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV), the classical (non-inflationary) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses are more dependent on the CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway than the so-called inflationary CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which gradually accumulate at high frequencies in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arens et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">O'Hara et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here we examined the mechanisms of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell costimulation dependency. We found that the pathogen-induced environment and not the characteristics of the viral epitopes determined the requirements of naive and of memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells for CD28/B7-mediated costimulation. Remarkably, related to the induction of high costimulatory ligand expression, LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion can operate in a CD28/B7 independent fashion because of redundancy with the costimulatory members of the TNFR superfamily. Furthermore, direct type I IFN signaling in viral-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is slightly redundant with CD28/B7 and CD27/CD70-mediated costimulation. These findings demonstrate that the inflammatory environment dictates the characteristics of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses by allowing a differential utilization of stimulatory pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Differential requirements for CD28/B7-mediated costimulation in driving CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion</title><p>Effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell formation during LCMV infection seems not to be driven by the main costimulatory CD28/B7 pathway because wild-type (WT) mice and mice deficient in both B7.1 and B7.2 (<italic>Cd80/86</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) mount similar antigen-specific responses in magnitude, and this phenomenon is apparent after both high and low viral inoculum dosages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Therefore, the co-inhibitory receptor CTLA-4 that binds to B7.1 and B7.2 was blocked with antibodies during infection, which increases the availability of the B7 molecules to stimulate CD28. Remarkably, CTLA-4 blockade during LCMV infection had no effect on T cell expansion, indicating that LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are rather indifferent to enhanced B7-mediated signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). However, CTLA-4 blockade during MCMV infection augmented MCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses ∼threefold in a B7-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Thus, additional triggering of the CD28/B7 pathway is beneficial in settings in which T cell expansion is dependent on this pathway, while the enhancement of CD28/B7-mediated costimulation had no effect in conditions in which the B7 costimulatory molecules are not essential for initial T cell expansion.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07486.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CTLA-4 blockade impacts B7-driven CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CTLA-4 blocking antibodies were administrated during infection with 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> PFU LCMV Armstrong in WT mice.

Therefore, recombinant MCMVs were generated in which the GP33 epitope was expressed within the immediate early 2 (IE2) protein (MCMV-IE2-GP33) or the M45 protein (MCMV-M45-GP33). The in vitro replication kinetics of MCMV-IE2-GP33 and MCMV-M45-GP33 were similar as WT virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Correspondingly, in vivo infection with MCMV-IE2-GP33 induced a GP33-specific response with inflationary characteristics, as specified by a gradual increasing GP33-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response in time with an effector memory phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). As determined by intracellular IFN-γ staining after restimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>) or direct staining with MHC class I tetramers (data not shown), the GP33-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response elicited by both MCMV-IE2-GP33 and MCMV-M45-GP33 was dependent on B7-mediated costimulation, albeit to a higher degree when the GP33 epitope was inserted within the M45 protein. Infection with an MCMV containing the model epitope OVA<sub>257-264</sub> (SIINFEKL) inserted in the M45 protein (MCMV-M45-SIINFEKL) resulted also in an antigen-specific T cell response that depended on B7-mediated costimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that non-viral epitopes elicit similar costimulation dependent responses. Furthermore, LM expressing the LCMV GP33 epitope (LM-GP33) induced GP33-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses that were highly dependent on B7-mediated costimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Also, upon vaccination with a synthetic long peptide (SLP) containing the GP33 epitope, <italic>Cd80/86</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice mounted a defective GP33-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response in comparison with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). To exclude possible effects related to differences in the TCR repertoire selection, TCR transgenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells recognizing the LCMV GP33 epitope (referred hereafter as P14 cells) were used in different pathogenic contexts. Similar as observed for the endogenous LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion, B7-mediated costimulation was dispensable for P14 cell expansion in LCMV infection. Importantly, for the expansion of P14 cells in MCMV-IE2-GP33 and LM-GP33 infection, B7-mediated signals were highly required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), which corroborates that the inflammatory environment is predominantly determining the costimulatory requirements.

Next, we examined if the B7-dependent MCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response can be boosted via supplementary triggering of the type I IFN pathway. We used recombinant IFNα2 that was functional both in vitro, as determined by a cytopathic effect inhibition assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and in vivo as evidenced by increased expression of CD69 on lymphocytes at 18 hr upon i.p. administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

To determine if OX40L and 4-1BBL-mediated interactions impact LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, blocking antibodies were administrated. No significant differences were found when OX40L and 4-1BBL were blocked, however, when both pathways were abrogated the magnitude of the LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response was significantly diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Strikingly, LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses were drastically decreased when OX40L/4-1BBL blockade was performed in mice lacking CD70 and B7-mediated costimulation. This diminished response was not due to defective induction of type I IFN, as IFNα levels in the serum of these mice were not substantially altered compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We further delineated the redundancy between different costimulatory molecules by additionally blocking OX40L- and/or 4-1BBL-mediated interactions in <italic>Cd70</italic> and <italic>Cd80/86</italic> deficient mice. Dual blockade of OX40L and 4-1BBL in <italic>Cd80/86</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, and OX40L blockade in <italic>Cd70/80/86</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice showed comparable responses to mice in which all costimulatory pathways were abrogated, indicating that the most pronounced effects on LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion are found when both B7 and OX40L-mediated interactions are abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Together, these data indicate that virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses during LCMV infection critically depend on a plethora of costimulatory signals that are individually dispensable because they function in a highly redundant manner.</p><p>To determine if costimulatory molecules were similarly working in a redundant manner in MCMV infection, WT and costimulation deficient mice were infected with MCMV.

Similar results were obtained for GP33-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses using MCMV-IE2-GP33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Abrogation of OX40L or 4-1BBL-mediated signals upon MCMV infection has been shown to minimally impact the initial expansion of MCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Humphreys et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2010</xref>). Moreover, we found that upon dual blockade of OX40L and 4-1BBL-mediated interactions MCMV-specific T cell responses were not affected as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Thus, type I IFNs have a slight stimulating activity for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in MCMV infection, which is more pronounced in the absence of CD70 and B7-mediated signaling, indicating that also during MCMV infection partial redundancy of type I IFN signaling with costimulation during CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion occurs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Determining the critical components required for T cell expansion in a given situation is of utmost importance for understanding resistance to virus infections and improving vaccination strategies. Using different viral models we show that the pathogen-induced environment dictates the utilization of costimulatory signals that drive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion.</p><p>Primary LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses have long been considered to be costimulation independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shahinian et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kundig et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andreasen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grujic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eberlein et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, the development of LCMV-specific memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell formation is hampered during <italic>Cd28</italic> or <italic>Cd80/86</italic> deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grujic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eberlein et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that CD28/B7-mediated costimulation occurs during LCMV infection, which is in agreement with our study. We also found that the CD27/CD70 pathway has negligible costimulatory effects for LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion when solely this pathway is abrogated. This has been observed by others as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schildknecht et al., 2007</xref>), but recent reports suggested that blockade of the CD27/CD70 pathway can to some extend impair CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses during acute LCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Penaloza-Macmaster et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Munitic et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, here we show that LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses are in fact critically dependent on costimulatory signals, but these signals operate in a highly redundant manner in which both members of the costimulatory CD28/B7 family and TNFR/TNF family take part.</p><p>The overall expression of costimulatory ligands in the LCMV milieu exceeded the expression levels found upon an MCMV or VV infection. In this respect, it is of interest to note that abrogation of exclusively the CD28/B7 or the CD27/CD70 pathway severely hampers MCMV- and VV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arens et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salek-Ardakani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Welten et al., 2013b</xref>), indicating that in these infections the costimulatory molecule levels are likely limited leading to non-redundant roles of costimulatory molecules. Unhampered LCMV-specific responses are observed upon dual 4-1BBL and CD28 abrogation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeBenedette et al., 1999</xref>) and this is consistent with our data showing that multiple pathways than these have to be abrogated to observe diminished LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses virus-specific responses. The higher expression levels of costimulatory ligands within the LCMV environment is likely causing the redundancy amongst CD28/B7 and TNFR/TNF family members in driving LCMV-specific T cell expansion. Of interest is that even further improvement of B7-mediated signaling due to CTLA-4 blockade did not advance LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion, suggesting that the observed higher expression of costimulatory molecules is at a maximal level with respect to stimulating T cells.</p><p>Strong replicating VV-strains employ more costimulatory receptors as compared to weak replicating VV-strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salek-Ardakani et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, 4-1BBL-mediated interactions are critical during severe influenza virus infections but dispensable upon a mild influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that the strength of the inflammatory environment dictates the employment of different costimulatory receptors. Given the higher costimulatory molecule expression, one could argue that LCMV infection elicits an elevated inflammatory milieu as compared to most other infections. Consistent with this notion is that in LCMV infection very high levels of type I IFNs are induced, which are partly responsible for the high costimulatory ligand expression. An elevated expression of costimulatory molecules in LCMV infection might also be related to a lack of immunomodulatory effects that dampen costimulatory molecule expression. During MCMV infection for example, the B7.1 and B7.2 expression in virus-infected cells is downmodulated by the virus by sophisticated immune evasion mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loewendorf et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mintern et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arens et al., 2011a</xref>). Perhaps related to this, is that the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response to MCMV is predominantly mediated by cross-priming APCs, which are by definition not directly infected by the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Torti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Busche et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Shared signaling pathways might underlie the observed redundancy among members of the costimulatory TNFR family and CD28 family. TNFR family members are known to signal via TRAF molecules, which are coupled to the activation of the NF-κB pathway via both the canonical and the non-canonical routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Croft, 2009</xref>). CD28 is also able to signal via the NF-κB route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boomer and Green, 2010</xref>). Another shared signaling pathway of CD28 and TNFR family members might be the c-Jun kinase pathway, which is coupled to proliferation as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gravestein et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Skanland et al., 2014</xref>). We found redundancy between CD28 and CD27 signaling on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion in MCMV and LCMV infection, and this has been found in influenza virus infection as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hendriks et al., 2003</xref>). However, besides redundancy between CD28/B7 and TNFR/TNF families also redundancy among costimulatory TNFR family members likely happened as the response was most compromised in settings where multiple TNFR family members were targeted. The latter is consistent with observations in the influenza virus infection model, where virus-specific T cells that accumulate in the lung but not in the spleen were collectively dependent on signals mediated via a variety of TNFR family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hendriks et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>We found a prominent role for the pathogenic milieu in directing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses and dictating the requirements for certain costimulatory signals. The fact that even upon LCMV and MCMV co-infection the costimulatory requirements for T cell expansion are not altered, suggest that this instruction occurs locally, likely at the level of APC-T cell interaction. The majority of the MCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is activated via cross-priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Torti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Busche et al., 2013</xref>), and whether both direct and cross-priming occur during LCMV infection is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Freigang et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless CD11c<sup>+</sup> APCs are critical for LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Probst and van den Broek, 2005</xref>). Moreover, because of different tropisms it is unlikely that MCMV and LCMV co-infect the very same cells and that the viral epitopes are presented by the same APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matloubian et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexandre et al., 2014</xref>). Since APCs need to be directly activated for adequate T cell priming rather than by environmental inflammatory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kratky, 2011</xref>), our data are consistent with a scenario where the two viruses activate APCs in a different manner resulting in differential provision of costimulatory signals. The enhanced costimulation during LCMV infection may besides due to stronger and distinctive (local) inflammation also be a consequence of longer and/or stronger antigen-presentation as compared to other viral infections. However, LCMV and MCMV are both natural mouse pathogens and infection with these viruses results in virus levels that peak around day 4 post-infection in the spleen and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buchmeier et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cicin-Sain et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, differential kinetics of antigen-presentation of the viral epitopes is possible.</p><p>Perhaps related to our results are the observations that the pathogen-specific inflammatory environment dictates the fate of responding CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells allowing shaping of effector and memory T cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Obar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keppler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Plumlee et al., 2013</xref>). This may be connected with pathogen-specific tuning of the antigen-sensitivity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by enhancing TCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Richer et al., 2013</xref>), the induction of distinct inflammatory cytokine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>) and/or by instructing the costimulatory pathway usage (our results). Although in vitro the requirements for CD28/B7-mediated costimulation can differ for primary and memory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flynn and Mullbacher, 1996</xref>), we found in vivo that CD28/B7-mediated costimulation was important for the expansion of both naive and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in MCMV infection. This is consistent with models of influenza virus, VV and murine γ-herpesvirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borowski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fuse et al., 2008</xref>) that require B7-mediated signals for primary and secondary expansion of virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, the APCs that prime memory vs naive T cells might differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belz et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Type I IFNs are not required for the expansion of human memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hervas-Stubbs et al., 2010</xref>). In experimental in vivo models, however, the inflammatory environment determines the signal 3 (i.e., type I IFN and IL-12 signaling) dependency upon secondary infection independent of the context of priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keppler and Aichele, 2011</xref>). Correspondingly, we observed that the milieu of the infectious pathogen during the recall response determines the requirements for costimulatory signals as well, and suggests that the responsiveness of T cells during the initial expansion is plastic and can be modified during antigenic re-challenge.</p><p>Collectively, our results highlight the importance of the inflammatory environment for both primary and secondary CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion. These findings can be beneficial for pre-clinical exploration of adoptive T cell settings, where antigen-specific T cells are expanded to large numbers. In addition, our report has important implications for prime-boost vaccination strategies, as it provides evidence for the plasticity of memory T cells that is shaped by the nature of the pathogen to generate them.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River and were used as WT mice. <italic>Cd70</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coquet et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Cd80/86</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borriello et al., 1997</xref>) and <italic>Ptprc</italic><sup><italic>a</italic></sup> (<italic>Cd45.1</italic>, <italic>Ly5.1</italic>) mice were bred in house to the obtained C57BL/6 background. <italic>Cd70/80/86</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were generated by crossing <italic>Cd70</italic><sup>−/−</sup> with <italic>Cd80/86</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice.

Blood was collected via the tail vein. Erythrocytes were lysed in a hypotonic ammonium chloride buffer. Determination of the antigen-specific T cell response by MHC class I tetramers and intracellular cytokine staining was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arens et al., 2011b</xref>). Briefly, single-cell suspensions were incubated with fluorescently conjugated antibodies and tetramers for 30 min at 4°C. To determine the expression of costimulatory ligands, spleens were first injected with 1 mg/ml collagenase and 0.02 mg/ml DNAse in IMDM without FCS, after which the spleens were chopped in small pieces and incubated for 25 min at RT. Subsequently 0.1 M EDTA was added and cells were transferred through a 70 µm cell strainer to make single cell suspensions. Next, cells were pre-incubated with normal mouse serum and Fc-block (clone 2.4G2), after which biotinylated or fluorochrome conjugated antibodies were added. For analysis of intracellular cytokines, cells were restimulated for 5 hr with 1 µg/ml MHC class I restricted peptides in the presence of 1 µg/ml brefeldin A, followed by cell surface staining and intracellular staining for IFN-γ. The following fluorescently conjugated antibodies were purchased by BD Biosciences, eBioscience (San Diego, CA, United States) or BioLegend (San Diego, CA, United States): CD3 (V500), CD8 (A700), CD11b (eFluor450), CD11c (eFluor780), CD44 (eFluor450) CD45.1 (FITC), CD62L (eFluor780), CD70 (biotin), CD80 (FITC), CD86 (PE), CD90.1 (FITC), IFN-γ (APC), KLRG1 (PE-Cy7), OX40L (biotin), Vα2 (PE), 4-1BBL (biotin). Fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin (PE, APC or Brilliant Violent 605) was used to detect biotinylated antibodies. Flow cytometric acquisition was performed on a BD LSR II and cells were sorted using a BD FACSAria.

After 5 days of incubation at 10°C the solution was concentrated on an Ultracel 10 kD filter (Merck Millipore (Billerica, MA, United States)). The concentrated protein was loaded on a PBS equilibrated Hi-Load 16/60 superdex 75 column. The collected peak of the protein was concentrated on the Ultracel 10 kD filter and stored with 16% glycerol at −80°C. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford and OD<sub>280</sub> nm. The bioactivity was determined according to a protocol described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seeds and Miller, 2011</xref>) with slight alterations. In short; L929 cells were seeded in 96-well plates in serum free RPMI and incubated at 37°C, the next day different dilutions of IFNα2 were added. The following day Mengovirus was added and after 2 days of incubation an MTT assay was performed (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD, United States). Cell survival was determined by the following formula: (OD<sub>570-655</sub> sample with IFNα2 and virus/OD<sub>570-655</sub> without virus and IFNα2) × 100%. One unit of IFNα2 was defined as the concentration at which 50% of the cytopathic effect was inhibited. Our batch had a bioactivity of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> units/ml.

However, there are a number of issues that would need to be dealt with, using substantive newly generated data, for the manuscript to make a rigorous point broad enough to be of interest to the cross-disciplinary readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The part of this study that simply demonstrates contextual variations of costimulatory requirements in viral infections is not novel but conceptually similar to several previous studies, and it would be appropriate to acknowledge them. Thus, for example, the finding that LCMV responses are independent of CD28 (and by inference B7.1, B7.2) for which the original reference (Shahinian et al., Science, 1993) also noted that costimulation requirements are viral context-dependent, or the finding that anti-LCMV but not anti-influenza CD8 T cell responses are unimpaired in the absence of both CD28 and 4-1BBL (DeBenedette et al., JI, 1999), or the epitope repertoire-independence of viral infection contextual costimulation requirements (Lin et al., JI, 2009, and Salek-Ardakani 2011). Thus, the manuscript should be a bit more balanced in acknowledging such previous contributions to the field, particularly when the idea of contextual variation in costimulation requirements has been reviewed recently (Wotzman et al., Immunol Rev 2013).</p><p>2) The primary limitation of the manuscript is the absence of a comprehensive and systematic framework at least delineating if not explaining the shifting matrix of costimulatory requirements/redundancies in distinct infection/immunisation situations in vivo. Thus, at least for the pair of LCMV (Armstrong) and MCMV, an experiment of the kind shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, but with a more complete set of combinations, and comparing LCMV and MCMV, would be very useful. Such experiments will be best done using transferred p14-TCR-transgenic CD8 T cells to ‘control’ for TCR-repertoire-related differences and to allow the use of IFNIR<sup>+/+</sup> and IFNIR<sup>-/-</sup> p14 CD8 T cells to enable the inclusion of IFN-I-signaling in the analytical matrix.</p><p>Technically, too, this most novel aspect of the study is somewhat underdeveloped. For example, the blocking studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, show only one time point for the readout and would be more convincing if more than one time point were examined. The authors administer very large amounts of antibodies without indicating any isotype controls, raising worries about the specificity of the blockade and about possible FcR mediated APC effects. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> is a critical experiment, but it’s hard to determine how strong the result is – it would be useful to see each mouse shown as a single point and all the mice included, rather than just showing a bar graph.</p><p>3) It is necessary to explore mechanistic explanations for the inability of IFN-I (or LCMV-infected mouse day 2 serum) to allow MCMV-GP33-specific P14 CD8 T cells to become <italic>Cd80/86</italic> independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). A GP33-negative LCMV-co-infection (instead of recombinant IFN-I or LCMV-infected mouse serum) might, for example, be useful to test. If there is no reconstitution of <italic>Cd80/86</italic> independence for MCMV-immunisation even so, then alternative complex explanatory interactions, possibly requiring the inclusion of antigen presentation kinetics and/or infected/presenting APC-specific issues, will need to be considered and addressed substantively.</p><p>In this context, while the authors show that LCMV infected mice have much higher levels of type I IFN as well as much higher levels of costimulatory molecules than MCMV infected mice, they do not explore the relationships involved any further. Does type I IFN regulate the levels of the costimulatory molecules? For example, does IFNAR blockade lower any of the costimulatory molecules in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, or is the differential induction in MCMV versus LCMV infection due to direct response to the viral particles? Some efforts to gain insights into the ‘contextual’ role would add value.</p><p>4) As noted above, data with transferred P14-TCR-transgenic CD8 T cells in all contexts tested would be needed to address the question of whether costimulatory requirement distinctions in LCMV, MCMV, LM and SLP contexts are independent of differences, if any, in the GP33 peptide-specific TCR repertoires.</p><p>5) It would be preferable to test all conclusions carefully in situations where the extent of CD8 T cell expansion is similar between the LCMV- versus MCMV-groups being compared, since differences in the degree of expansion may have contributory consequences not apparent in the situation <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.</p><p>6) It is somewhat surprising, given the importance of littermate controls, that the manuscript uses ‘wild-type’ from a commercial source as a control for in-house knockout mice. It would be useful to have some clarification of this issue.</p><p>7) The data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) suggest that there are no differences between co-stimulatory requirements for primary versus secondary CD8 T cells. There is some controversy in the extant literature regarding the co-stimulation requirements of ‘memory’ CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flynn and Mullbacher, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borowski et al., 2007</xref>). In fact, ‘memory’ CD8 T cells may not respond as well as naive CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belz et al., 2007</xref>), and type I interferons may negatively affect memory CD8 T cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hervas-Stubbs et al., 2010</xref>) under certain circumstances. If the present manuscript is to address co-stimulatory requirements of memory CD8 T cells, it would be appropriate to have these issues acknowledged and addressed.</p><p>8) The title does not reflect the novel aspects of the study; it would be useful for the title to reflect that the new finding is the redundancy of costimulatory pathways for CD8 T cell responses to LCMV, rather than simply the context-dependent nature of costimulation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “The viral context instructs the redundancy of costimulatory pathways in driving CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below: This paper elegantly shows that it is the viral context rather than the TCR repertoire or specific epitope that determines B7/CD28 dependence of CD8 T cell responses to viruses. By using LCMV epitopes or GP33 specific T cells in the context of an LCMV or MCMV infection, the authors show that LCMV induced responses are <italic>Cd80/86</italic> independent whereas MCMV responses are <italic>Cd80/86</italic> dependent. This is true of secondary responses to LCMV or MCMV delivered epitopes also, regardless of whether cells were primed by LCMV or MCMV. As LCMV infection induces particularly high levels of type I Interferon, the authors investigated the role of type I interferon in the <italic>Cd80/86</italic> dependence. However, blocking type I interferon receptor similarly impaired WT or <italic>Cd80/86</italic> knockout mice, arguing that type I interferon does not explain <italic>Cd80/86</italic> independence of the LCMV specific response. Neither transfer of serum from LCMV infected mice nor coinfection changed the results. LCMV infection was found to induce higher levels of several costimulatory molecules and blocking and knockout mice were used to show redundancy of costimulatory pathways for LCMV specific CD8 T cell responses.</p><p>A remaining question is: does LCMV induce more costimulation through more inflammation or more antigen? It would be of interest to determine the level of viral antigen in LCMV versus MCMV delivered GP33, as prolonged antigen presentation might explain how additional costimulatory molecules are induced. Although a direct measure of antigen levels would be difficult, the level of antigen presentation over time could be measured by transfer of CFSE labeled P14 cells at different times post infection into MCMV-GP33 or LCMV infected mice over time to test the prediction that longer or stronger antigen presentation explains increased induction of costimulatory molecules and redundancy. If possible, such data would add very substantially to the value of the manuscript. At the very least, it is essential to discuss this issue and possibility.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07486.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The part of this study that simply demonstrates contextual variations of costimulatory requirements in viral infections is not novel but conceptually similar to several previous studies, and it would be appropriate to acknowledge them.

Importantly, the outcome corroborated our previous findings and additionally strengthened the novel findings regarding costimulatory requirements.</p><p>In the LCMV model, we dually blocked OX40L and 4-1BBL in CD70<sup>-/-</sup> or B7.1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (in addition to CD70<sup>-/-</sup>/B7.1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice). Furthermore, we either blocked OX40L or 4-1BBL in CD70/B7.1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Dual blockade of OX40L and 4-1BBL in B7.1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, and OX40L blockade in CD70/B7.1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed comparable responses to mice in which all costimulatory pathways were abrogated, indicating that the largest effects on LCMV-specific CD8 T cell expansion are found when both B7.1/2-mediated costimulation and interactions among the TNFR/TNF family members OX40/OX40L are abrogated (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In addition, we analysed the LCMV-specific CD8 T cell response at different time points. On day 5.5 post LCMV infection, CD70/B7.1/2<sup>-/-</sup> and CD70/B7.1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice with additional OX40L/4-1BBL block have a lower response in the blood compared to WT mice. Similar to the spleen, on day 7 post-infection these differences are observed in the blood as well. This new data is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. In the antibody blocking experiments, we also added control mice receiving a similar amount of antibody (a rat IgG isotype antibody).</p><p>We found that in the absence of CD70- or B7.1/2-mediated costimulation, MCMV-specific CD8 T cell responses were severely hampered, and even more so when both pathways were abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). This was also observed for GP33-specific responses using MCMV-IE2-GP33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). It has been shown that blockade of either OX40L or 4-1BBL does not impact the initial MCMV-specific CD8 T cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Humphreys et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Humphreys et al., 2010</xref>). We addressed whether dual blockade of OX40L- and 4-1BBL signalling hampered MCMV-specific CD8 T cell expansion, but we did not observe any significant differences compared to mice receiving isotype control antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). As MCMV-specific CD8 T cell responses were already severely hampered and hardly detectable in CD70/B7.1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, we did not additionally block OX40L and 4-1BBL interactions in CD70/B7.1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice during MCMV infection.</p><p>To control for possible differences in the TCR repertoire, we transferred P14 cells in WT and costimulation deficient mice and infected these mice with LCMV. Upon transfer of WT P14 cells we found comparable costimulatory requirements as observed for endogenous T cell responses. The largest effects were observed when both CD70- and B7.1/2-mediated costimulation were abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). To determine type I IFN related effects on costimulation dependency, IFNAR<sup>-/-</sup> P14 cells were transferred into WT, CD70<sup>-/-</sup>, B7.1/2<sup>-/-</sup> and CD70/B7.1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. IFNAR<sup>-/-</sup> P14 cell expansion was severely hampered in WT mice. In the absence of type I IFN signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), P14 cells are severely hampered in WT mice and correspondingly also in costimulation deficient mice. We additionally transferred IFNAR<sup>+/+</sup> and IFNAR<sup>-/-</sup> P14 cells in WT and costimulation deficient mice that were subsequently infected with MCMV-IE2-GP33, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>. We found, similar to what is observed for endogenous GP33 responses, that IFNAR<sup>+/+</sup> P14 cells were highly dependent on costimulatory signals and only slightly hampered when type I IFN signalling was absent. However, GP33-expansion was mostly affected when both type I IFN signalling and costimulatory interactions were abrogated. We feel we have herewith addressed all questions of the referees.</p><p><italic>3) It is necessary to explore mechanistic explanations for the inability of IFN-I (or LCMV-infected mouse day 2 serum) to allow MCMV-GP33-specific P14 CD8 T cells to become</italic> Cd80/86 <italic>independent (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5E</italic></xref><italic>).

Some efforts to gain insights into the ‘contextual’ role would add value</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is a very interesting aspect to examine. We performed a co-infection experiment using MCMV-Smith and LCMV Armstrong and we found that even upon this co-infection, MCMV-specific CD8 T cells are still dependent on B7.1/2-mediated signals, whereas LCMV-specific T cells are not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). The costimulatory requirements seem thus very locally regulated. We addressed possible explanations for the contextual role in the Discussion. To identify the exact mechanism of T cell priming in MCMV and LCMV infection is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>We addressed whether the high levels of type I IFN upon LCMV infection were responsible for the elevated expression levels of costimulatory molecules in the LCMV induced environment. Upon IFNAR blockade we found that on CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells, the expression of all costimulatory molecules was diminished, however on CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells only CD86 and 4-1BBL expression was affected. Thus the high levels of type I IFN are only partially responsible for the elevated expression levels of costimulatory ligands that are found. This data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) As noted above, data with transferred P14-TCR-transgenic CD8 T cells in all contexts tested would be needed to address the question of whether costimulatory requirement distinctions in LCMV, MCMV, LM and SLP contexts are independent of differences, if any, in the GP33 peptide-specific TCR repertoires</italic>.</p><p>We have added data in which TCR transgenic P14 cells are transferred and subsequently primed under different conditions: MCMV-IE2-GP33, LCMV, LM-GP33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Comparable to the endogenous GP33-specific T cell responses, the expansion of the TCR transgenic P14 cells was dependent on B7.1/2-mediated costimulation upon MCMV-IE2-GP33 and LM-GP33 infection. However, B7.1/2-mediated signals were dispensable during LCMV infection. These data further exclude that differences in the TCR repertoire explain the distinct costimulatory requirements in different pathogenic conditions.</p><p><italic>5) It would be preferable to test all conclusions carefully in situations where the extent of CD8 T cell expansion is similar between the LCMV- versus MCMV-groups being compared, since differences in the degree of expansion may have contributory consequences not apparent in the situation</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref>.</p><p>In MCMV-Smith infection, the expansion of M45-specific CD8 T cells is comparable to the expansion of GP33-specific CD8 T cells in LCMV infection, which indicates that the extent of CD8 T cell expansion for dominant epitopes in LCMV and MCMV infection is actually similar. Furthermore, even upon a lower dose of LCMV (2 × 10<sup>2</sup> PFU/mouse), we still observe that B7.1/2-mediated costimulation is dispensable for LCMV-specific CD8 T cell expansion. To investigate the GP33-specific response in an MCMV context, we have used a MCMV-mutant expressing the GP33 epitope in the IE2 protein. This leads to a lower response due to promoter specific reasons. Indeed, a MCMV-mutant expressing the GP33 epitope in the M45-gene, inducing a GP33-specific response following the normal pattern of expansion and contraction, elicits in the acute phase of infection a higher GP33-specific response than MCMV-IE2-GP33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Also, in this case we found a high B7.1/2-costimulatory requirement, which further indicates that the degree of expansion is comparable between the LCMV versus MCMV groups, and that possible differences in expansion is not implicated in differences in costimulation redundancy.</p><p><italic>6) It is somewhat surprising, given the importance of littermate controls, that the manuscript uses ‘wild-type’ from a commercial source as a control for in-house knockout mice. It would be useful to have some clarification of this issue</italic>.</p><p>We are well aware of possible issues regarding littermate controls and therefore we have bred back the knockout mice onto the background of the B6 mice from the commercial source. We have explained this in the Materials and methods of the revised version.</p><p><italic>7) The data (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>) suggest that there are no differences between co-stimulatory requirements for primary versus secondary CD8 T cells.

If the present manuscript is to address co-stimulatory requirements of memory CD8 T cells, it would be appropriate to have these issues acknowledged and addressed</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers regarding the literature on this topic. Indeed, it was reported that in vitro memory CD8 T cells do not require costimulatory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flynn and Mullbacher, 1996</xref>). However, we and others have found that depending on the context in vivo costimulatory molecules can be critical for expansion of memory virus-specific CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borowski et al., 2007</xref>; Fuse, Zhang and Usherwood, 2008).

At the very least, it is essential to discuss this issue and possibility</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for addressing this point. It may be indeed interesting to know whether the increased costimulation during LCMV infection is through more inflammation or more antigen. Both MCMV and LCMV are natural mouse pathogens, and both viruses have more extensive replication as compared to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) for example (Kundig TM et al., 1996, Immunity). However, whereas LCMV Armstrong is eventually cleared from the body, MCMV becomes latent. It is possible that differences exist between MCMV and LCMV infections with respect to the duration of antigen presentation during the acute phase but virus levels peak in the spleen and liver around day 4 post-infection in case of MCMV (Cicin-Sain L, 2008, J. Virol.; Stacey MA et al., 2011, J.Immunol) but also in case of LCMV (Buchmeier MJ et al., 1980, Adv. Immunol).</p><p>We think, however, that the proposed experiment may not enable us to answer this question. Adoptive transfer of P14 cells in LCMV and MCMV infected mice at different time points would tell more about the time points of optimal priming of these cells, but differences in expansion could still be due to differences in the duration of antigen presentation, or due to differences in the local pro-inflammatory environment (or by both in combination). Thus, such adoptive transfers do not discriminate between prolonged antigen presentation and increased inflammation as both can lead to increased costimulatory molecule expression. Also, curtailing the viral replication would change the pro-inflammatory environment.</p><p>To examine whether prolonged antigen expression is different between MCMV and LCMV, one would need to perform mass spectrometry to identify the MHC-bound and presented viral epitopes including GP33. However, considering the low number of infected APCs that can be derived from infected mice, this is currently technically not feasible.</p><p>Nevertheless, we believe that this is a valid and important point and have discussed this issue in more detail in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
