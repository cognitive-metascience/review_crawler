Here, we report on the prospective follow up of infected members of this nested cohort (N = 333) for two successive rounds following treatment. Using a negative binomial regression fitted to egg count data, we found that every percentage point increase in piped water coverage was associated with 4.4% decline in intensity of re-infection (incidence rate ratio = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93–0.98, p=0.004) among the treated children.

In the tropics and subtropics, schistosomiasis is a major cause of disability among neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) accounting for 1.43 million disability-adjusted life-years lost in 2017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">GBD 2017 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators, 2018</xref>). Infection occurs when trematodes of the genus Schistosoma shed by infected freshwater snails (an intermediate host) penetrate the skin upon contact with infested water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colley et al., 2014</xref>). Intensity of infection in the human host is a function of the parasite load and can indirectly be quantified by the number of eggs excreted. Host variations in worm burden has been attributed to recent chemoprophylaxis, heterogeneities in exposure and host susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colley et al., 2014</xref>). Most human infections in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are due to <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, which causes intestinal schistosomiasis and <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> responsible for urogenital schistosomiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lai et al., 2015</xref>). However, <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> has the widest geographical coverage in SSA and is the main cause of infection in the Hlabisa sub-district, where our study is based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saathoff et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In our previous work, we assessed the impact of piped water coverage on the risk of <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> infection in a rural South African community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanser et al., 2018</xref>). We argued that a measure of piped water access by individuals/households, which is commonly used in the existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grimes et al., 2014</xref>), is less sensitive than a measure of piped water coverage at the community level. Our hypothesis is that a higher community coverage of piped water reduces both an individual’s exposure to parasitic agents (direct benefit) as well as the number of contacts that infectious individuals in the surrounding have with open water bodies, thus decreasing the overall transmission intensity of <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> within the community (indirect benefit).</p><p>We previously used novel geostatistical methods, annual population-based surveillance data, and a parasitological survey to quantify the risk of <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> infection in a nested cohort of 1976 primary school children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanser et al., 2018</xref>). In this baseline parasitological survey, we showed that every percentage increase in community piped water (in the prior 7 years) was associated with a 2.5% decrease in the odds of <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> infection. However, we did not determine if community piped water coverage reduced re-infection rates among the same children who were treated with praziquantel during the baseline survey.</p><p>Here, we report the results of two consecutive rounds of follow-up of infected children, which were undertaken between September and December of 2007 (round 1), and between April and August of 2008 (round 2) respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate the impact of community piped water coverage on <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> re-infection rates following treatment with praziquantel and therefore address a major public health evidence gap highlighted in a recent review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grimes et al., 2015</xref>). A strong relationship would provide compelling evidence for the protective effect of increased piped water coverage and have broad implications for the treatment and management of <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> in resource-limited settings.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>During the baseline parasitological survey, a total of 2105 children from all 33 primary schools located in a contiguous geographical area in rural KwaZulu-Natal consented to participate in the study.

This design presents a strong basis to directly quantify the causal association between community piped water coverage and <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> infection. Secondly, the study was nested within a large population-based cohort in rural KwaZulu-Natal province with detailed homestead level geospatial data linking each child to their residence within the demographic surveillance area. Thirdly, we had access to a comprehensive survey of household level piped water use and asset ownership conducted in 2007 that we utilized to derive an index of community piped water coverage and household wealth index. Finally, we utilized longitudinal databases of environmental predictors of disease infection, described in detail in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanser et al., 2018</xref>), to adjust for potential confounding in the regression models.</p><p>A limitation to our study is that we did not assess praziquantel treatment effect after drug administration. It may therefore be difficult to ascertain whether a positive diagnosis was due to re-infection or treatment failure. However, approximately 80% cure rates at 4 weeks after treatment with praziquantel has been reported in KwaZulu-Natal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saathoff et al., 2004</xref>) and Côte d'Ivoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">N'Goran et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that most positive diagnoses after treatment were likely re-infections. Furthermore, we observed a shift in burden of heavy infections from older age groups at baseline survey (pre-treatment) to younger age groups in the re-infection cohort analysis that cannot be accounted for by treatment failure, thus providing further evidence suggesting that the impact of treatment failure was minimal. Whilst we demonstrated a clear relationship between piped water coverage and re-infection intensity, the study was not powered to detect differences in the absolute rate of re-infection by piped water coverage category. Furthermore, we observed an increase in the proportion of dropouts with increasing distance from the water bodies (follow-up round 1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) and among girls (follow-up round 2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). An increase in dropout rates among individuals who are at a lower risk of infection (that is, residing away from water bodies or girls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanser et al., 2018</xref>]) may partially explain the high re-infection rates documented in follow-up round 1 and follow-up round 2. In our baseline analysis we showed that sex was a strong independent predictor of infection with <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> and that the impact of community piped water coverage was greater among girls than among boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanser et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, a higher proportion of attrition among girls will potentially bias the association of piped water on re-infection intensity towards the null hypothesis, implying that our effect estimates may be marginally conservative.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The WHO recommends mass drug administration (MDA) with a single oral dose of 40 mg/kg of praziquantel for the global control and elimination of schistosomiasis. Although this strategy has clear short-term benefits of reduced morbidity, sustained benefits are uncertain given the current global MDA coverage of circa 20%, low drug compliance and efficacy, and rapid re-infection rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ross et al., 2017</xref>). Our study provides evidence that improved access to piped water in the community significantly reduces the intensity of re-infection among school going children. Therefore, <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> control programs should consider scaleup of piped water coverage in the community as a preventive strategy against re-infection to supplement the MDA strategy. Secondly, targeting households within the high risk areas would mean the most vulnerable population is prioritized with the added benefits of reducing transmission to the entire community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergquist et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ross et al., 2017</xref>).

Finally, we recommend further studies to examine the impact of an integrated approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knopp et al., 2019</xref>) that include MDA, piped water coverage and behavioral change education (potentially including installation of safe water recreational areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kosinski et al., 2012</xref>]) on re-infection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Ethical approval was provided by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of the university of KwaZulu-Natal (reference #E165/05).

Participants with confirmed infection at baseline or during the follow-up rounds were treated immediately at school. <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> infection status was determined using the urine reagent strips for evaluating microhematuria with confirmation using microscopy diagnosis. A single oral dose of 40 mg/kg body weight of praziquantel was administered to children with detectable microhematuria following recommended World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> preventive chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saathoff et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">WHO Expert Committee on the Control of Schistosomiasis, 2002</xref>) under strict supervision of trained nurses. Children who had false negative urine reagent strip results (based on microscopy gold standard) were subsequently traced back in school, and became eligible for treatment and inclusion in the cohort analysis. However, because of the time lag between laboratory testing and treatment, some children with a false negative test results missed treatment for baseline infection if they were absent from school during tracing and were therefore not eligible for inclusion in the cohort analysis. In addition, some parents/guardians of children who were screened and treated for baseline infection did not give consent for their children to participate in the follow-up rounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, the re-infection cohort was defined as children who had microscopically confirmed <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> infection at baseline, were treated for baseline infection and consented to participate in at least one follow-up round. Eligibility for the second round of follow-up was subject to treatment at round 1 (for those found to be infected during screening) and consent at round 2 regardless of the infection status at round 1, or children who were treated for baseline infection and consented for only round 2 of screening and treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Sample collection and laboratory analysis</title><p>Sample collection, consenting and laboratory testing procedures were similar to those conducted during the baseline parasitological survey that we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanser et al., 2018</xref>). Urine samples were collected between 10:00 and 12:00 hr using 500 mL honey jars (one sample per child). Each sample testing for infection was done in two stages: 1) testing using urinalysis reagent strips (Bayer Uristix) in schools and 2) confirmatory microscopy analysis in the laboratory. The urine samples were aliquoted and processed in duplicates of 10 mL sub-samples and diluted using 2% methiolate in 5% Formalin. Filtration was done using the polycarbonate filters (diameter of 25 mm and 8.0 μm pore size). Upon sample filtration, each urine filter, potentially containing <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> eggs, was placed on a glass slide, stained and examined under a microscope with x10 magnification. Eggs were counted by trained laboratory technicians and expressed per 10 mL of urine. The primary outcome of interest was the subject level egg count determined by averaging the duplicate egg counts for each participating child in each follow-up round. Here, infection or re-infection status refers to microscopically confirmed <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> eggs in urine samples. We categorized egg counts into a priori groups of heavy (≥50 eggs/10 mL) and light (&lt;50 eggs/10 mL) re-infections following WHO classification guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">WHO Expert Committee on the Control of Schistosomiasis, 2002</xref>) on intensity of re-infection with <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics were used to describe demographic and environmental characteristics of <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> re-infection. We used geometric means to summarize egg counts and estimated disease burden by computing prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Royston’s χ<sup>2</sup>-test-of-trend and the classical chi-square test for nominal data were used to assess the linear trend and nominal associations between variables respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Re-infection rates</title><p>Given that the exact date of re-infection after treatment is not observed, we randomly imputed a re-infection date between the treatment date and the testing date assuming a uniform distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vandormael et al., 2018</xref>) for all children who were re-infected with <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> in both rounds of follow-up. We used the imputed dates of re-infection or testing date for non-infected children to compute time at risk that was used as a denominator when computing the 2007–2008 re-infection rates and computed the 95% CIs assuming the Poisson distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Covariates for schistosomiasis re-infection</title><p>We have previously presented a detailed description of the procedure used to derive the exposure variable and potential confounders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanser et al., 2018</xref>). Water supply from the reservoir to the study area is mainly through gravitated PVC pipes. A household had access to safe water supplies if there was reliable piped water in the dwelling or if the key household informant reported that the household used water from the public tab, borehole, protected dug well, protected spring or rainwater from storage tanks, for the household chores. We derived the community piped water coverage for each residential homestead of the participating child from a weighted two-dimensional Gaussian kernel of 2 km radius using data from the 2007 homestead level survey on access to piped water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The 2 km radius was selected based on our previous analysis in which a tradeoff between sensitivity to local variations and robustness to random noise was considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanser et al., 2018</xref>). We used the derived community piped water coverage (exposure variable), and the well-established potential confounders (environmental and social economic covariables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brooker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Appleton, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Simoonga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clennon et al., 2004</xref>]) in both descriptive and inferential analysis. We also obtained the altitude, slope, distance to the nearest water body, landcover classification and household wealth index as we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanser et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Regression modelling</title><p>Count models have previously been utilized to assess determinants of host intensity of re-infection and account for host heterogeneity inherent in the distribution of schistosomiasis egg counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chipeta et al., 2014</xref>). The negative binomial model was the best fit to our data among the plausible count models that we examined in a data driven model selection procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tang et al., 2012</xref>). We used univariable analyses (retaining significant covariates at p&lt;0.1) and backwards exclusion of non-significant covariates (p&gt;0.05) to arrive at a final parsimonious model. The exposure variable (community piped water coverage), age, toilet and sex were included in multivariable models regardless of their significance in the univariable analyses. We used predictive margins to estimate egg counts at various predefined levels of the exposure variable from the final multivariable regression model. To account for correlation among children who contributed data to both the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> follow-up rounds (pooled analysis), we obtained robust standard errors in models adjusted for the fixed effects of follow-up round and further conducted subgroup analyses on each follow-up round separately.</p><p>We performed statistical analyses using Stata 14 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) and computed the spatial scan statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kulldorff et al., 2009</xref>) using SaTScan version 9.4.2 software (Havard medical School, Boston, MA, USA). We used ArcGIS version 10.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Esri and Here, 2004</xref>) for the standard Gaussian kernel density estimation and cartographic display.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Local cluster detection</title><p>In our baseline analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanser et al., 2018</xref>), we described geographical heterogeneity of <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> infection prevalence and identified 4 clusters of significantly high relative risk. Here, we used the Gaussian kernel density estimations to describe the geographical heterogeneity of re-infection intensity and identified the presence of significant geographical clusters of intense re-infection using the scan statistic implemented in SaTScan software. Briefly, we examined for geographical areas experiencing significantly higher intensity of re-infection (mean log-egg count) than would be expected by chance using the normal probability model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kulldorff et al., 2009</xref>). SaTScan software imposes a scanning window (predefined here to be circular and non-overlapping) that moves systematically across geographical space and with varying radius. For each geographical location and scanning window size, the geometric mean egg count is computed, and significance testing performed using the Monte-Carlo simulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Role of the funding source</title><p>The funders had no role in the study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation of results, manuscript writing or decision to submit for publication.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Impact of community piped water coverage on re-infection with urogenital schistosomiasis in rural South Africa&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission is a Research Advance; this format is for substantial developments that directly build upon a previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper. Specifically, the present submission is intended to expand on a paper by your colleagues entitled &quot;Impact of the scale-up of piped water on urogenital schistosomiasis infection in rural South Africa&quot;, authored by Tanser et al.</p><p>With the above context in mind, your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior/Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>As is customary in <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another. What follows below is an edited compilation of the essential and ancillary points provided by reviewers in their critiques and in their interaction post-review. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter we also need to see the corresponding revision in the text of the manuscript. Some of the reviewers' comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text. Please keep in mind, however, that readers may have the same perspective as the reviewers. Therefore, it is essential that you attempt to amend or expand the text to clarify the narrative accordingly.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Impact of community piped water coverage on re-infection with urogenital schistosomiasis in rural South Africa&quot; presents a study with new results supporting the scale-up of piped water coverage against <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> transmission. Nested in a broader project that was published last year in <italic>eLife</italic>, this longitudinal study shows that a one-percent increase in piped water coverage was associated with 4.4% decline in re-infection intensity. These are relevant public health results that could improve the control of an important though neglected tropical disease.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the authors referred whenever possible to their previous article, it should also be possible to read the current manuscript as a self-contained work. Please provide one or two sentences of background on <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> as a clinical and epidemiological entity.</p><p>2) You demonstrate a 15.4% reinfection after one round of praziquantel mass drug administration, and 12.8% reinfection rate after the second round of MDA. While your main findings are focused on re-infection intensity, this is but one metric to focus on. Relatedly, re-infection rates are also extremely important. What is the significance of piped water contributing to a 4.4% decline in infection intensity? Infection intensity may be driven by many factors, including degree of exposure, questionable development of protective immunity, and time since the most recent praziquantel treatment. There is ample evidence (e.g. Taabo District, Cote d'Ivoire, among many other sites), where MDA will decrease environmental contamination of water sources and partially block the lifecycle of the parasite. Over only a few years, we expect to see a decline in infection rates plus after even 2 rounds of MDA (typically annually or biannually) most infections are &lt;50 eggs per 10 cc urine (low intensity as per WHO guidelines). Please clarify why the infection rates are similar after two rounds of MDA, and why there is only a very modest drop in infection intensity given the piped water intervention plus MDA.</p><p>3) It is unclear how many observations were included in the results of the analysis presented in the different figures and tables. It is difficult to assess the internal validity of the results and how they were affected by attrition.</p><p>4) Introduction, last paragraph: the number of children included in the follow-up round should be presented in the Results section. Indeed only few details can be given in this section. As a result readers could be misled to think that 333 children took part in both rounds.</p><p>Results:</p><p>5) Information is lacking in certain figures; please expand the figure legends.</p><p>6) &quot;In the pooled adjusted negative binomial model…&quot; should the readers assume that 378 measurements were included in this analysis?</p><p>7) Subsection “Impact of community piped water coverage on intensity of re-infection”: Figure 4 and Figure 2B do not clearly give a measure of the association between mean egg counts and piped water coverage, the authors should consider to mention these results explicitly in the Results section.</p><p>8) Figure 5: Consider replacing the study area in a map of South-Africa.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>9) Discuss attrition and how power may have been impaired by the size of your study sample.

Please provide one or two sentences of background on <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> as a clinical and epidemiological entity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a paragraph in the Introduction giving a summary of the epidemiology as shown below.</p><p>“About 243 million people are infected with schistosomiasis worldwide, of whom ~93% reside in sub-Saharan Africa where children carry the greatest burden of the disease. […] However, <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic>has the widest geographical coverage in SSA and is the main cause of infection inthe Hlabisa sub-district, where our study is based[1].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) You demonstrate a 15.4% reinfection after one round of praziquantel mass drug administration, and 12.8% reinfection rate after the second round of MDA. While your main findings are focused on re-infection intensity, this is but one metric to focus on. Relatedly, re-infection rates are also extremely important. What is the significance of piped water contributing to a 4.4% decline in infection intensity? Infection intensity may be driven by many factors, including degree of exposure, questionable development of protective immunity, and time since the most recent praziquantel treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that re-infection rates are another important outcome metric. However, re-infection intensity provides a more precise and nuanced outcome measure, which is therefore often used to quantify the effect of interventions in schistosomiasis research [2-7] and to map transmission intensity [8, 9].</p><p>Our cohort study, by design, only included individuals who were at a high risk of re-infection (i.e. only participants who had confirmed <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> infection at baseline) and the use of a less precise binary measure like re-infection, whilst potentially useful would require a larger sample size to be able to detect significant effects. We do recognize that re-infection intensity is a function of a set of features as pointed out by the reviewers. In this respect we adjusted for exposure time since recent treatment and age (a proxy for acquisition of immunity) in the regression models. Time since recent treatment, was not a significant predictor in the model partly because the follow-up timepoints were predefined. Although immunity is important, it may not play a major role in this study given the limited age range observed. Therefore, we predict that the intensity of infection observed was due to the varying degree of exposure and that high piped water coverage significantly decreases exposure resulting to lower intensity of infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is ample evidence (e.g. Taabo District, Cote d'Ivoire, among many other sites), where MDA will decrease environmental contamination of water sources and partially block the lifecycle of the parasite.

Please clarify why the infection rates are similar after two rounds of MDA, and why there is only a very modest drop in infection intensity given the piped water intervention plus MDA.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point here. Unlike most MDA studies (which target all children regardless of their infection status and include all children treated at baseline in the denominator when computing re-infection rates), our re-infection cohort participants were children who were infected and were treated for baseline infection (the denominator only includes children who were infected, treated at baseline and examined at any given follow-up round). Therefore, our cohort participants were children who were at a higher risk of re-infection given their baseline status. The prevalence of re-infection at round 1 and 2 would have been much lower if the entire cohort were to be examined and included in the denominator (as done in MDA) given their predicted low exposure to infection. We also note that, our study only tested and treated grade 5 and 6 children. Thus, there were still many untreated and infected children of other ages capable of sustaining the transmission cycle in these communities. This ultimately results in a high potential for re-infection in our cohort of previously infected children.</p><p>We include the following statement in the Discussion section:</p><p>“Finally, we recommend further studies to examine the impact of an integrated approach [10] that include MDA, piped water coverage and behavioral change education (potentially including installation of safe water recreational areas [11]) on re-infection.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is unclear how many observations were included in the results of the analysis presented in the different figures and tables. It is difficult to assess the internal validity of the results and how they were affected by attrition.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the number of observations in both the figures and table legends where appropriate and included them in tables as well.

Urine reagent strips (changed from RDT given the highlighted potential confusion) were used in schools to determine children who were infected and therefore eligible for treatment immediately in school. In addition, we conducted a confirmatory microscopy analysis in our laboratories.

However, false negative children that were not treated at baseline (absent in school during tracing) were not eligible for inclusion in the cohort analysis.</p><p>We have included the following statements:</p><p>“Children who had false negative urine reagent strip results (based on microscopy gold standard) were subsequently traced back in school, treated and included in the cohort analysis.
