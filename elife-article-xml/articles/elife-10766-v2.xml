Some integrins contain an I-domain that is a major ligand binding site. The ligands preferentially engage the active forms of the integrins and trigger signaling cascades that alter numerous cell functions. Here we found that the adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA), a key virulence factor of the whooping cough agent <italic>Bordetella pertussis,</italic> preferentially binds an inactive form of the integrin complement receptor 3 (CR3), using a site outside of its I-domain. CyaA binding did not trigger downstream signaling of CR3 in human monocytes and CyaA-catalyzed elevation of cAMP effectively blocked CR3 signaling initiated by a natural ligand. This unprecedented type of integrin-ligand interaction distinguishes CyaA from all other known ligands of the I-domain-containing integrins and provides a mechanistic insight into the previously observed central role of CyaA in the pathogenesis of <italic>B. pertussis</italic>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10766.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10766.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10766.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The outer surfaces of animal cells are coated with proteins, including many that are able to sense signals from the environment. The integrins are one such group of proteins.

CR3 binds to molecules found on the surface of bacteria, and prompts the immune cell to engulf and destroy the bacteria.

However, it is not clear how CyaA is able to bind to CR3 without activating the signaling cascades.</p><p>Here, Osicka et al. used biochemical techniques to address this question. The experiments reveal that CyaA mostly binds to an inactive form of CR3 through a unique site outside of the I-domain. It enables the toxin to use the integrin without triggering an immune response. Furthermore, the experiments show how CyaA prevents ligand signaling via CR3 proteins to allow <italic>B. pertussis</italic> to shut down the host’s first line of defense against infection.</p><p>Osicka et al.’s findings show how CyaA evades the host’s immune system and highlight the central role played by this toxin in <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infections.

There are 18 different alpha subunits and 8 beta subunits that combine in a limited number of combinations of which 24 are currently known in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tan, 2012</xref>). Integrins are essential for regulation of numerous cellular functions including cell signaling and adhesion. Nine of the eighteen integrin alpha subunits harbor a conserved I (inserted)-domain that is crucial for binding of endogenous ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnson and Chouhan, 2014</xref>). Four of these integrin alpha subunits (α<sub>D</sub>, α<sub>L</sub>, α<sub>M</sub> and α<sub>X</sub>) form heterodimers exclusively with the β<sub>2</sub> subunit, thus forming the α<sub>D</sub>β<sub>2</sub> (CD11d/CD18), α<sub>L</sub>β<sub>2</sub> (CD11a/CD18, LFA-1), α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub> (CD11b/CD18, complement receptor 3 (CR3), Mac1) and α<sub>X</sub>β<sub>2</sub> (CD11c/CD18, CR4, p150/195) integrins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnaout, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mazzone and Ricevuti, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sanchez-Madrid, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Van der Vieren et al., 1995</xref>). The β<sub>2</sub> integrins have specialized roles in immune and inflammatory responses and, like other integrins, employ a two-step mechanism of bi-directional signal transmission between the interior of cells and the extracellular milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anthis and Campbell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tan, 2012</xref>). Upon activation by various intracellular signals, the inside-out signaling is initiated through rearrangement of the integrin molecule from an inactive (bent, closed, resting, low-affinity) conformation to an active (extended, open, high-affinity) conformation. Subsequent ligand binding triggers outside-in signaling of the extended integrins through activation of Src family tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jakus et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mócsai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schymeinsky et al., 2007</xref>). Src kinases phosphorylate tyrosine residues within the so-called immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), on the cytoplasmic face of ITAM-containing transmembrane adaptor proteins, such as DAP12 or the FcR γ-chain (FcRγ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jakus et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mócsai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schymeinsky et al., 2007</xref>). These serve as docking sites for the tandem phosphotyrosine-binding Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of the non-receptor spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jakus et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mócsai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schymeinsky et al., 2007</xref>). Recruitment and activation of Syk then leads to assembly of a multi-protein signaling complex that contains cytosolic Syk-binding molecules and initiates further downstream signaling, ultimately triggering various cellular responses that play a central role in the innate immune defense to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mócsai et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The β<sub>2</sub> integrin complement receptor 3 (CR3) is used as receptor by the 1706 residue-long RTX (<underline>R</underline>epeats in <underline>T</underline>o<underline>X</underline>in) adenylate cyclase toxin-hemolysin (CyaA, ACT, or AC-Hly) of <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>, which plays a crucial role in virulence and immune evasion of the whooping cough agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodwin and Weiss, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guermonprez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khelef et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vojtova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Weiss et al., 1984</xref>). Upon binding to CR3, CyaA penetrates myeloid phagocytes and paralyzes their bactericidal functions by catalyzing uncontrolled conversion of cytosolic ATP to the key signaling molecule cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Confer and Eaton, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guermonprez et al., 2001</xref>). The toxin also hijacks maturation and proinflammatory signaling of CR3-expressing dendritic cells and it likely subverts antigen presentation and induction of adaptive T cell immune responses to bacterial infection by intraepithelial dendritic cells of host respiratory mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boschwitz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyd et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fedele et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hickey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Njamkepo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ross et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Spensieri et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here we reveal that CyaA acts as a unique type of ligand of the I-domain-containing integrin CR3, preferentially recognizing an inactive state of the integrin through interaction at a novel binding site located outside of the I-domain.

Furthermore, we show that CyaA-catalyzed elevation of cAMP effectively blocked the iC3b opsonin-elicited activation of the CR3-Syk signaling pathway in human monocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CyaA binds CR3 outside of its ligand-binding I-domain</title><p>It was previously shown that Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human CR3 can be used as a suitable model for studying the interaction of CyaA with CR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guermonprez et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, CR3 (CD11b/CD18) expressed by CHO cells allowed the binding and cAMP-elevating (cytotoxic) activities of CyaA, while the highly homologous CR4 (CD11c/CD18) was unable to bind CyaA despite sharing the same β<sub>2</sub> (CD18) subunit with CR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guermonprez et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, to delineate the CyaA binding site(s) on CR3, we performed swapping of the homologous alpha chain segments (CD11b and CD11c) of CR3 and CR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). First, a CHO cell line stably expressing the CD18 subunit (CHO-CD18) was established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This was next used for generating stable cell lines that expressed similar quantities of intact CD11b (CHO-CD11b/CD18), CD11c (CHO-CD11c/CD18), or of the chimeric CD11b-CD11c heterodimeric complexes on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The capacity of such cells to bind CyaA was then assessed by flow cytometry and the susceptibility to CyaA penetration and enzymatic intoxication by the delivered AC domain of the toxin was measured as intracellular accumulation of cAMP. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, replacement of the segment containing residues 614 to 682 (segment 614-682) of CD11b by the corresponding portion of CD11c caused a sharp, about ten-fold decrease of CyaA binding to the CHO-CD11b<sub>614-682c</sub>/CD18 transfectants, as compared to cells expressing intact CR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This resulted in accordingly reduced toxin penetration and cAMP accumulation in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). CyaA binding was also partially reduced on cells expressing CR3 chimeras having the residues 33 to 115 (72 ± 6%), 342 to 424 (61 ± 10%), or 686 to 1152 (89 ± 11%) of CD11b replaced by the corresponding segments of CD11c, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). No reduction of CyaA binding was observed on cells expressing the remaining CD11b-CD11c/CD18 chimeras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which all accumulated comparable levels of cAMP as the cells expressing intact CR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Surprisingly, CyaA binding and subsequent intoxication of cells by cAMP were neither reduced by swapping of the homologous I-domain regions between CD11b and CD11c (CD11b<sub>120-272c</sub> and CD11b<sub>275-339c</sub>), nor upon removal of the entire I-domain of CD11b (CD11b<sub>Δ164-339</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). This demonstrates that CyaA does not bind CR3 through the I-domain and rather recognizes the segment containing residues 614 to 682 that encompasses the C-terminal end of the last repeat of the β-propeller domain and the N-terminal portion of the thigh domain of CD11b. This finding is consistent with the sequence alignment by the Jotun Hein method (Lasergene software, DNASTAR) showing that the 614-682 segments of CD11b and CD11c are only 41% identical at the amino acid level, compared to the entire CD11b and CD11c subunits that exhibit an overall 61% sequence identity. Since, however, some other segments of CD11b appeared to be important for full toxin binding to CR3 as well, these results suggest that CyaA likely binds the integrin through a multivalent interaction, making contacts with several integrin segments. Moreover, CyaA bound CD11b only when this was associated with CD18 and not when the CD11b subunit was expressed alone on the surface of CHO-CD11b cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10766.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Residues 614-682 of CD11b are crucial for CyaA binding and penetration into cells.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) The CD11 subunits of β<sub>2</sub> integrins consist of a long N-terminal extracellular domain, a single-pass transmembrane segment (TS) and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, respectively. The N-terminal part of the extracellular domain harbors seven β-sheet repeats (numbers in boxes), forming a β-propeller domain, which is followed by the thigh, calf-1 and calf-2 domains. The I-domain segment, inserted between repeats 2 and 3 of the β-propeller domain, plays a critical role in interaction of the I-domain-containing integrins with their endogenous ligands. To map the CyaA binding site on the CD11b subunit, segments of CD11b (green) were systematically replaced with their CD11c counterparts (blue). In the CD11b<sub>Δ164-339</sub> molecule, the entire I domain of CD11b was deleted.

For this experiment, a leukocyte-enriched fraction was isolated from fresh human blood and treated (or not) with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) that is a known agonist activating CR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diamond and Springer, 1993</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>, PMA-stimulated monocytes expressed the same amounts of CR3 as untreated monocytes (detected with OKM1 mAb), but bound the toxin with a significantly lower efficiency. This was clearly due to conformational rearrangement of CR3 on PMA-activated monocytes, as the activated cells bound approximately two-fold more of the activation-reporting mAb MEM-148 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drbal et al., 2001</xref>) than the non-activated monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

This initiates downstream signaling and provokes multiple cellular activation responses, including complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi et al., 2006</xref>). We hence examined if the I-domain-independent interaction of CyaA with CR3 activates Syk in human monocytic cells. THP-1 monocytes, which bind CyaA in a CR3-dependent and saturable manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), were exposed to different concentrations of CyaA over a range of incubation times. Phosphorylated Syk was next immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb and was detected by anti-Syk mAb in immunoblots. As a positive control, the CR3-Syk signaling pathway was activated by iC3b-opsonized zymosan particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi et al., 2006</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, Syk phosphorylation on tyrosine residues was observed after 30 min of incubation of THP-1 cells with iC3b-opsonized zymosan.

Taken together, our data show that the cAMP signaling of CyaA decreases the capacity of CR3 to bind the iC3b opsonin, prevents activation of Syk by iC3b-engaged CR3 and inactivates also Syk that has already been activated by iC3b/CR3.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We show here that CyaA hijacks the complement receptor 3 of phagocytes by subversively binding to its bent, inactive conformation by binding to a unique site located outside of the I-domain.

This possibility has already been suggested by Guermonprez and co-workers, who observed that in contrast to I-domain-dependent CD11b ligands, CyaA binding does not require the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guermonprez et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, we show that CyaA primarily recognizes the CD11b segment consisting of residues 614 to 682. This encompasses the C-terminal end of the last β-propeller repeat and the N-terminal portion of the thigh domain.</p><p>Besides interacting with the I-domain, certain ligands appear to interact to some extent also with the β-propeller domain of alpha subunits of β<sub>2</sub> integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li and Zhang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yalamanchili et al., 2000</xref>). The β-propeller domain consist of seven β-sheet repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that are arranged in a torus, or propeller, with each β-sheet representing one blade of the propeller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oxvig and Springer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Springer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xie et al., 2010</xref>). Its fold is most closely related to the β subunit of the trimeric G-protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Springer, 1997</xref>) and proper folding of the β-propeller requires association of the α subunit with the β<sub>2</sub> subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang and Springer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lu et al., 1998</xref>). The β-propeller is followed by the thigh domain, exhibiting a C2-set immunoglobulin fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chothia and Jones, 1997</xref>), and by a genu region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">2010</xref>). The structural rearrangement at the thigh/genu interface is involved in the activation-dependent extension of the integrin α subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xie et al., 2004</xref>). It was previously suggested that the β-propeller/thigh region segment of CD11b (residues 599 to 679), comprising the principal CyaA binding site, can fold also in the absence of the CD18 subunit, since it was recognized by the OKM1 mAb when the CD11b subunit was expressed alone on COS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lu et al., 1998</xref>). Indeed, we observed here that OKM1 recognized CD11b that was expressed alone on CHO-CD11b cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, CyaA failed to bind any significantly to cells expressing the isolated CD11b subunit on their surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). In contrast to the OKM1 epitope, hence, the CyaA-binding site within the segment 614-682 of CD11b may acquire the correct structure (fold) only when the CD11b subunit is in complex with CD18. Alternatively, an interaction of CyaA with the CD18 subunit may also be involved in CyaA binding to CR3, even though CD18 alone was unable to bind CyaA on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>In addition, recognition of additional segments of CD11b appears to contribute to the full capacity of CR3 to bind CyaA. Engagement of these segments likely facilitates or stabilizes the higher-affinity interaction of CyaA with the principal binding site (residues 614 to 682). Toxin interactions at several sites on CD11b would then synergize in bringing about the highly selective interaction of CyaA with the CD11b subunit of CR3. Indeed, we have previously described that an initial low-affinity interaction of CyaA with N-linked glycan chains of the C-terminal part of the CD11b subunit is a critical prerequisite for toxin binding to CR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hasan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morova et al., 2008</xref>). A low-affinity interaction with abundant N-linked glycans on the integrin molecule most likely serves as the initial step of toxin pre-concentration from solution into the two-dimensional space of the cell surface. This increase of local CyaA concentration would then increase the probability of proper positioning of the toxin molecule for its subsequent high affinity interaction with specific amino acid residues of the CR3 glycoprotein. This two-step mode of CyaA-CR3 interaction is supported by the SPR binding curves which fit well using the bivalent analyte model, describing a two-step association process. Compared to a mechanism of direct single step binding from solution, a sequential binding mechanism would, indeed, lower the affinity constraints on interaction of CyaA with the ectodomain of CR3. The stability of the CyaA-CR3 complex may then be further increased by an irreversible insertion of the hydrophobic domain and of the acyl chains of CyaA into the cellular membrane, which most likely accounts for the observed high apparent affinity of toxin binding to CR3-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guermonprez et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>It was recently proposed that CyaA can specifically bind yet another β<sub>2</sub> integrin on leukocytes, the LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paccani et al., 2011</xref>). However, this is at odds with the initial observation of Guermonprez and co-workers that CyaA does selectively and with high affinity bind the dendritic cells and macrophages expressing CD11b/CD18, whereas B and T cell lines expressing exclusively the LFA-1 complex were recognized with substantially lower efficacy, if at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guermonprez et al., 2001</xref>). To rule out that this difference in CyaA binding was due to unequal expression levels of the integrins on various cell types, we added a fluorescent YFP tag to the C-terminus of the CD11a subunit and generated a cell line (CHO-CD11a-YFP/CD18) expressing the same quantities of the integrin molecules on the cell surface as found on the CR3-expressing cell line (CHO-CD11b-YFP/CD18) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, over a range of CyaA concentrations, the CHO-CD11a-YFP/CD18 cells bound about two orders of magnitude less CyaA toxin than the CD11b-YFP/CD18-expressing cells. Moreover, the difference in binding of CyaA to CD11a-YFP/CD18-expressing cells, CD11c-YFP/CD18-expressing cells, or the mock-transfected cells expressing no β<sub>2</sub> integrin at all, was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). To exclude the concern that the residual binding of CyaA to CD11a-YFP/CD18 could be due to the presence of the YFP tag, we generated a cell line expressing comparable amounts of intact CD11a/CD18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and demonstrated that CyaA binds these cells as poorly as cells expressing CD11a-YFP/CD18 with the YFP tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In addition, we purified the intact LFA-1 integrin from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by immunoaffinity chromatography on MEM-25 mAb-Sepharose beads and immobilized it onto an SPR sensor chip. Real-time SPR measurements revealed no CyaA∆H binding to the intact LFA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>; cf. CyaA∆H binding to CR3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>). Finally, cells expressing CD11a-YFP/CD18 were intoxicated by CyaA to equally low cAMP levels as the control cells expressing CD11c-YFP/CD18, or lacking any β<sub>2</sub> integrin, while cAMP intoxication of cells expressing CD11b-YFP/CD18 was over two orders of magnitude higher than that of the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).

Despite the fact that CyaA was repeatedly reported to subvert FcR- and CR3-mediated opsonophagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Confer and Eaton, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kamanova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lenz et al., 2000</xref>), little attention has been paid to the effector molecules and pathways targeted by CyaA-generated cAMP signaling. The Syk tyrosine kinase pathway, pinpointed here as the target of CyaA action, plays a central role in both FcR- and CR3-mediated phagocytosis, as it is activated immediately upon binding of immunoglobulin or iC3b opsonins to the respective FcR and CR3 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crowley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kiefer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi et al., 2006</xref>). We show that CyaA bypasses the Syk-activating interaction with CR3 through a subversive preferential recognition of its bent, resting conformation and by engaging the CR3 structures outside of the I-domain of CD11b. In contrast to iC3b opsonin, binding of CyaA, or of its non-enzymatic CyaA-AC<sup>-</sup> toxoid, did not trigger any CR3-mediated activation of Syk. Strikingly, CyaA-catalyzed elevation of cAMP in phagocytes effectively blocked subsequent activation of Syk through iC3b binding to CR3. Most importantly, when Syk was pre-activated by incubation of phagocytes with iC3b, the subsequent CR3-dependent invasion of CyaA into cells enabled cAMP signaling-mediated inactivation of Syk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>It remains to be elucidated how CyaA-produced cAMP signaling suppresses Syk activity. Two plausible working hypotheses are, nevertheless, worth mentioning in this context. The first would be based on the observation that increased cAMP levels activate the inhibitory C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) via the cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vang et al., 2001</xref>). Csk may then directly inactivate the Src kinases by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vang et al., 2001</xref>). Inactive Src kinases would then be unable to accomplish the double phosphorylation of the ITAM-containing adaptor, which is a prerequisite for recruitment and activation of Syk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jakus et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mócsai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schymeinsky et al., 2007</xref>). A second plausible mechanism would be based on our recent observation that CyaA/cAMP-mediated signaling triggers activation of the ubiquitously expressed SH2-containing non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (PTPN6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cerny et al., 2015</xref>). This phosphatase has been previously implicated in regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and in blocking of FcγR–mediated phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kant et al., 2002</xref>). Experiments aimed at deciphering the mechanism by which cAMP signaling inactivates Syk are ongoing.</p><p>CR3-mediated phagocytosis involves active RhoA GTP-ase, which acts downstream of Syk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caron and Hall, 1998</xref>). We have previously shown that cAMP signaling of CyaA rapidly decreases RhoA activity and induces dephosphorylation of the actin filament-severing protein cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kamanova et al., 2008</xref>). CyaA thereby provokes massive actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and unproductive membrane ruffling of macrophage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kamanova et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore speculate that this inhibitory intervention of the toxin at the two different signaling levels of Syk and RhoA, respectively, synergizes in bringing about a complete and rapid inhibition of CR3-mediated phagocytosis and complement-mediated opsonophagocytic killing of bacteria.

Zymosan A (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was incubated in 50% human serum at 37°C for 30 min. Zymosan particles were washed with PBS to remove unattached components of serum and dissolved in DMEM without FCS before use for treatment of cells. Unopsonized zymosan was prepared by incubating zymosan particles in PBS at 37°C for 30 min.</p><p>CyaA or genetically detoxified CyaA (CyaA-AC<sup>-</sup>) was diluted to final concentrations from concentrated stocks in DMEM without FCS. For the time course experiments, 3x10<sup>6</sup> THP-1 cells were treated with 30 ng/ml of toxin for different time points at 37°C. For concentration dependence experiments, 3x10<sup>6</sup> THP-1 cells were incubated at 37°C with different amounts of CyaA or CyaA-AC<sup>-</sup> for 15 or 30 min, respectively. 3x10<sup>6</sup> THP-1 cells treated with 300 µg of opsonized or unopsonized zymosan were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.

Cell lysates were collected and debris was removed by centrifugation. Aliquots of lysates were taken to detect the total amounts of Syk in individual samples. Tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (P-Tyr-01) for 3 hr at 4°C and bound to protein A-coupled sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) overnight at 4°C. The beads were washed in Triton X lysis buffer and boiled with Laemmli loading buffer.

The membrane was blocked with 5% BSA in TBS-T (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mM NaCl, 2.6 mM KCl, 0.3% Tween 20) for 60 min at 25°C and incubated with anti-Syk mAb (SYK-01) for 1 h at 25°C. Upon washing with TBS-T, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody for 1 hr and washed with TBS-T.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. As you will see the major concerns are related to the methodology used to distinguish between active and inactive integrin conformations. The summaries of your work written by the three reviewers as well as the detailed concerns that need to be addressed are detailed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and experiments related to it.</p><p>The authors have overexpressed in CHO cells both α<sub>M</sub> (CD11b) and α<sub>X</sub> (CD11c) integrins and shown that CyaA only binds to α<sub>M</sub>. After that they have overexpressed numerous α<sub>M</sub>/α<sub>X</sub> swaps.</p><p>The conclusion that CyaA cannot bind to α<sub>M</sub> I-domain is based on the construct in which αI-domain region has been deleted.</p><p>The weakest CyaA binder was a receptor in which α<sub>M</sub> contained α<sub>X</sub> residues 614-682. These residues are said to locate &quot;next to the β-propeller domain&quot;, but they are actually part of the &quot;thigh&quot; domain (In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> they have been correctly marked there). The structure and function of this domain should be discussed in more detailed manner.</p><p>The unconventional binding mechanism of CyaA is not a completely novel observation since Guermonprez et al. 2001 have reported that Mg<sup>2+</sup> is not needed for CyaA recognition by α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub> integrin. This fact should be discussed.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>The data based on antibodies support the existence of many binding site. Even the αI domain antibodies have a statistically significant effect. Can these antibodies activate/inactivate integrin conformation?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>The authors have used molecular modelling to indicate that it is structurally possible that CyaA binds to the thigh domain and propose that this takes place via electrostatic interactions. Based on the model they have done arginine to alanine mutations and indicate that simultaneous mutation of three arginine residues affects CyaA binding. Despite the fact that this observation suggests an interaction between CyaA and thigh domain (in addition to binding the β-propeller) more direct evidence is needed no really name the thigh domain as CyaA binding site. Could it be possible to produce α<sub>M</sub> and α<sub>X</sub> thigh domains as recombinant proteins?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>To test, whether CyaA binds to the bent or to the extended integrin conformation the authors have treated cells with an integrin activator PMA. PMA increases the number of activated integrins on cell surface and decreases CyaA binding. The observation is interesting, but one should remember that PMA has also many other effects on cells in general and, more specifically, on integrins. It may, for example, increase integrin clustering and mask binding sites in integrin legs. A better experiment would have been to use mutant integrins (e.g. E320A in α<sub>M</sub>) that favour the bent conformation together with integrins harbouring a gain-of-function mutation. Mn<sup>2+</sup> could also have been used to activate integrins.</p><p>The authors have also isolated soluble α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub> integrins and then managed to separate bent and extended conformations and to attach them to Biacore chips. It is quite surprising that the highly dynamic integrins can keep their conformations, but at least the data based on the conformation specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>) supports this idea. However, the Biocore curves seem to be more or less identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>) and indicate at best only marginal difference between the bent and the extended conformation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> shows the calculations based on bivalent analyte model. The authors should indicate a scientific reason why this model was chosen. They should also show the K<sub>d</sub> values in addition to association and dissociation rates. How many times this experiment was repeated? Was the difference statistically significant, when independent experiments were combined?</p><p>The idea that the α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin is in bent conformation is in conflict with a previously published report (Guermonprez et al. 2001), which indicates that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is needed for the interaction and that EDTA and EGTA inhibit it. Depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> forces the integrins to bent conformation (and should increase CyaA binding if it takes place to the non-activated integrin). The authors should be able to solve this critical discrepancy.</p><p>Interestingly, CyaA has been reported to bind α<sub>L</sub>β<sub>2</sub> integrin that is in the activated conformation (Paccani et al. 2011). Is there a fundamental difference in the action of α<sub>M</sub> when compared α<sub>L</sub>? Can this be explained by structural comparisons? Can α<sub>L</sub> thigh domain bind to CyaA? Can α<sub>M</sub>/α<sub>L</sub> I domains bind to CyaA?</p><p>The experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> is suggesting that α<sub>L</sub>β<sub>2</sub> could not recognize CyaA. Since this is in conflict with a previously paper, the authors should control the experiment very carefully and e.g. show that α<sub>L</sub>β<sub>2</sub> is functional as YFP fusion protein. Does native α<sub>L</sub> support CyaA entry in these assays?</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> (Conclusion <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>The data nicely indicates that CyaA can inhibit iC3b induced phosphorylation of SYK. Based on the conclusion figure, one would also expect experiments testing whether CyaA prevents/allows α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub> binding to iC3b? Similarly CyaA should not be able to affect recombinant α<sub>M</sub> I-domain binding to iC3b.</p><p>6) Activation of the integrin with PMA decreases the capacity of CyaA to associate with these integrins. It would be interesting to know whether this is translated into a lower induction of cAMP by CyaA in target cells.</p><p>7) A weakness of that manuscript is the absence of numerical values for the respective K<sub>d</sub> in the text. There are equations given in Materials and methods, a table, but these numerical values should be introduced in the text, for the deleted mutants, substituted mutants and various target forms developed in the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer summaries:</p><p><italic>Reviewer#1:</italic></p><p>The adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) is a virulence factor of <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>. CyaA has been reported to bind to two integrin-type receptors on cell surface, namely α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>L</sub>β<sub>2</sub>, while a third integrin in the same subfamily, α<sub>X</sub>β<sub>2</sub>, cannot recognize CyaA. In this manuscript the authors show evidence that CyaA binds to the non-activated (bent) α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub> state instead of the activated (extended) conformation. Moreover, they suggest that CyaA binding site is not in the αI (αA) domain. The exact significance of CyaA binding to cellular receptors is not clear (Its internalization is supposed to take place directly through plasma membrane, not via endocytosis, see Landant and Ullmann, 1999), but the observations are still interesting for integrin biology, since very little is known about the putative atypical ligand binding sites and mechanisms. Still, ligand binding to the bent integrin conformation is not entirely new idea, since non-activated integrins may participate e.g. in leukocyte rolling and human echovirus-1 binds to the non-activated α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin.</p><p>The finding that CyaA binds to beta-propeller/thigh-domain in α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub> and favour the bent integrin conformation would be important. However, based on the experiments shown in this manuscript, these conclusions are not fully justified. In some important points there are unsolved discrepancies when compared to previously published reports. In general the authors should study previous literature more carefully and in the discussion they should stress the structural aspects instead of signaling.</p><p><italic>Reviewer#2:</italic></p><p>The work presented by Osicka et al., describes the mode of interaction of the adenylate cyclase toxin CyaA from <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> with the integrin complement receptor 3 CR3 (CD11b/CD18) and how this modulates the activation of Syk-kinase downstream of the CR3.</p><p>By conducting two different approaches (CD11 b/c chimera and antibody interference) the authors first define that CyaA binds to the region 614-682 outside the I-domain. They also show that the swapping this stretch of amino acids between CD11b and CD11c confers to CD11c the capacity of binding to CyaA. The 3D structure modeling-coupled to mutagenesis followed by functional analysis allow the authors to identify in CyaA a group of negatively charged amino-acids implicated in this interaction and a group of positively charged amino-acids in their vicinity in CD11b. This convincingly points for the importance of electrostatic interactions in the interaction of the toxin with its receptor. They also established that CyaA binds preferentially to the close conformation / inactive form of the integrin. They also show that CyaA has a blocking effect on the activation of Syk prior to and after addition of iC3b-zymosan, in a AC independent and dependent manner, respectively.</p><p>This elegant work is well presented and the conclusions are thoroughly established by complementary approaches.</p><p>This work characterizes a new mode of interaction of a bacterial toxin with its integrin receptor that is critical to block Syk-dependent innate immune responses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Osicka and coworkers here reveal the major domains involved in the interactions between the Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase Cya and its major receptor CR3. Moreover, they dissected the signaling of a kinase Syk that is important in the CR3 signaling cascade to demonstrate that, after Cya integration into the cytoplasma, the elevation of cyclic AMP is responsible for the blockade of Syk phosphorylation. Overall, this is a huge work with many techniques, thoroughly conducted and abundantly explained and illustrated. There remains some weaknesses that should be easily correctly in order to render the text more substantial.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10766.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and experiments related to it.</italic></p><p><italic>The authors have overexpressed in CHO cells both</italic> α<italic><sub>M</sub> (CD11b) and</italic> α<italic><sub>X</sub> (CD11c) integrins and shown that CyaA only binds to α<sub>M</sub>.

Even the αI domain antibodies have a statistically significant effect. Can these antibodies activate/inactivate integrin conformation?</italic></p><p>To address the question of the reviewers, whether the I-domain-specific antibodies can activate/inactivate integrin conformation, the CHO cells expressing intact CR3 were pre-incubated with the 44 and 2LPM19c mAbs and the conformation of the integrin was probed with the MEM-148 mAb. As now shown in the newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, neither binding of these two mAbs, nor binding of any other mAb used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> did cause any activation of the integrin. As clearly shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the I-domain is not involved in the multivalent interaction of CyaA with CR3. Therefore, we conclude that the statistically significant decrease of CyaA binding to CR3, in the presence of the I-domain-specific mAbs 44 and 2LPM19c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), resulted from steric hindrance of the 150 kDa-large I-domain-bound mAbs and not from activation of the integrin.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</italic></p><p><italic>The authors have used molecular modelling to indicate that it is structurally possible that CyaA binds to the thigh domain and propose that this takes place via electrostatic interactions. Based on the model they have done arginine to alanine mutations and indicate that simultaneous mutation of three arginine residues affects CyaA binding. Despite the fact that this observation suggest an interaction between CyaA and thigh domain (in addition to binding the β-propeller) more direct evidence is needed no really name the thigh domain as CyaA binding site. Could it be possible to produce α<sub>M</sub> and α<sub>X</sub> thigh domains as recombinant proteins?</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that demonstration of direct CyaA binding to the isolated segment 614-682 of CD11b (or the entire thigh domain) would potentially bring an added value. However, due to the complex and multivalent nature of CyaA interaction with CR3, such experiments are not likely to yield conclusive results. In contrast to binding of some endogenous ligands to the isolated recombinant I-domain of CR3 (Zhou et al., JBC, 1994), CyaA appears to recognize in a first step the presence of N-linked glycan chains of the C-terminal part of CD11b (Hasan et al. 2015), which is a critical prerequisite for toxin binding to CR3 (Morova et al. 2008). However, no N-glycan chains necessary for CyaA binding appear to be present within the segment 614-682 (Hasan et al. 2015). Moreover, as discussed in the manuscript and above, recognition of several segments of CD11b appears to contribute to the full capacity of CR3 to bind CyaA. Engagement of these segments likely facilitates or stabilizes the higher-affinity interaction of CyaA with the principal binding site located within the segment 614 to 682. Further, as now documented in the newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, CyaA recognizes the CD11b subunit only when this is in the heterodimeric complex with CD18. This strongly suggests that proper folding of the CD11b segment on the scaffold of the CD18 subunit is essential for toxin binding. This may explain why we failed to observe any significant inhibition of CyaA binding to the CD11b/CD18 heterodimer in the presence of a synthetic peptide derived from the 614-682 segment of CD11b (data not shown). Therefore, we opted here for a 'transplantation' experiment yielding positive evidence, where the 614-682 segment of CD11b was swapped into the context of the CD11c subunit of CR4 and conferred on CR4 a substantial capacity to bind CyaA and support toxin penetration into cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We consider this as providing convincing evidence that the segment 614-682 is the principal binding site of CyaA. This conclusion is then strongly supported by loss of CyaA binding (i) upon swapping of the corresponding segment 614-682 of CD11c into CD11b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); (ii) in the presence of mAbs competing with the toxin for the same segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and (iii) upon site-directed mutagenesis of the segment 614-682 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), respectively.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</italic></p><p><italic>To test, whether CyaA binds to the bent or to the extended integrin conformation the authors have treated cells with an integrin activator PMA. PMA increases the number of activated integrins on cell surface and decreases CyaA binding. The observation is interesting, but one should remember that PMA has also many other effects on cells in general and, more specifically, on integrins. It may, for example, increase integrin clustering and mask binding sites in integrin legs. A better experiment would have been to use mutant integrins (e.g. E320A in α<sub>M</sub>) that favour the bent conformation together with integrins harbouring a gain-of-function mutation. Mn<sup>2+</sup> could also have been used to activate integrins.</italic></p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions were used to activate CR3 on the surface of primary human monocytes. Similarly as with PMA, CyaA binding and cAMP intoxication of cells with the activated integrin was reduced in comparison with cells that were not treated with Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions. The results addressing this issue are now shown in the newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. To control the possibility that activation of CR3 with PMA or Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions would mask CyaA binding site in integrin legs due to increased integrin clustering, we used the OKM1 mAb that recognizes the same segment 614-682 of CD11b as CyaA. In contrast to reduced binding of CyaA to the activated CR3 integrin, no such reduction of binding was observed with the OKM1 mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The potential PMA-provoked integrin clustering thus does not appear to be involved in the masking of the CyaA binding site in integrin legs.</p><p><italic>The authors have also isolated soluble α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub> integrins and then managed to separate bent and extended conformations and to attach them to Biacore chips.

Here we applied a similar procedure to isolate the bent and extended conformers of the soluble ectodomain of the β<sub>2</sub> integrin CR3 (sCR3), documenting the separation by negative stain electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is important to note that the sCR3 separation, immobilization on an SPR chip and binding experiments were performed within a single day, in order to limit the extent of possible conformational changes of the purified sCR3 particles. The real time interaction of CyaA∆H with the bent and extended conformations of the sCR3 ectodomain revealed typical binding curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F, G</xref>). These were fitted with several kinetic binding models (e.g. a simple 1:1 Langmuir model, a heterologous ligand model, a conformational change (two-state) model), where only the bivalent analyte model yielded satisfactory results in terms of reduced χ<sup>2</sup> value and residual statistics that were not sensitive to changes in coupling levels and flow rates. As now stated in the legend to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, two independent SPR binding experiments were performed in duplicate and the differences between mean values of CyaA∆H binding to the bent and extended conformation of sCR3 were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01; Student´s t-test). The determined K<sub>d</sub> values of the interaction between CyaA∆H and the bent (K<sub>d</sub> = 2.1x10<sup>-7</sup> M) or extended (K<sub>d</sub> = 6.4x10<sup>-7</sup> M) conformers of sCR3 differed by a factor of ~3 and are now given in the revised text.</p><p><italic>The idea that the α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin is in bent conformation is in conflict with a previously published report (Guermonprez et al. 2001), which indicates that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is needed for the interaction and that EDTA and EGTA inhibit it. Depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> forces the integrins to bent conformation (and should increase CyaA binding if it takes place to the non-activated integrin). The authors should be able to solve this critical discrepancy.</italic></p><p>The requirement for Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not in conflict with preferential binding of CyaA to the bent conformer of the CR3 integrin. The reason is that CyaA is itself a calcium-binding protein and the functional folding of its receptor-binding RTX domain does strictly depend on loading of the ~40 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites formed by the RTX repeats of CyaA (Rose et al., JBC, 1995). Calcium loading then confers on CyaA a conformational change that enables it to bind and penetrate cells (Hewlett et al., JBC, 1991; Rogel et al., JBC, 1992). In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, the CyaA cannot recognize the CR3 molecule because its RTX domain is not folded (Guermonprez et al. 2001).</p><p><italic>Interestingly, CyaA has been reported to bind α<sub>L</sub>β<sub>2</sub> integrin that is in the activated conformation (Paccani et al. 2011). Is there a fundamental difference in the action of α<sub>M</sub> when compared α<sub>L</sub>? Can this be explained by structural comparisons? Can α<sub>L</sub> thigh domain bind to CyaA? Can α<sub>M</sub>/α<sub>L</sub> I domains bind to CyaA? The experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> is suggesting that α<sub>L</sub>β<sub>2</sub> could not recognize CyaA. Since this is in conflict with a previously paper, the authors should control the experiment very carefully and e.g. show that α<sub>L</sub>β<sub>2</sub> is functional as YFP fusion protein. Does native α<sub>L</sub> support CyaA entry in these assays?</italic>Already Guermonprez et al. 2001 have unambiguously demonstrated that CyaA binds selectively and with high affinity the cells expressing CR3, such as the dendritic cells and macrophages, whereas B and T cells, which express only the LFA-1 complex, are recognized by CyaA with very low efficacy, like other cells lacking CR3 and β<sub>2</sub>integrins, such as erythrocytes. Guermonprez et al. summarized their observations as follows: “The lack of efficient binding to CD11c/CD18 transfectants, or CD11a/CD18 expressing cells such as EL4 or LB27.4, also suggests that CD11b/CD18 is the only integrin of the β<sub>2</sub> family involved in the binding of CyaA to the target cells”. We have fully reproduced here the findings of Guermonprez et al. 2001, showing that cells expressing LFA-1 bound about two orders of magnitude less CyaA toxin than cells expressing the same quantities of CR3, when the β<sub>2</sub>integrin expression level per cell was calibrated by using the YFP tag C-terminally fused to either of the alpha integrin subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In addition, there was no statistically significant difference in the levels of CyaA binding to cells expressing high amounts of CD11a-YFP/CD18, of CD11c-YFP/CD18, or not expressing any β<sub>2</sub> integrin at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, CyaA binding to cells expressing CD11c-YFP/CD18 was newly added to the figure). This was not surprising, since CyaA has a well-documented capacity to bind and penetrate with a low efficacy the plasma membrane of all cell types lacking CR3 (reviewed in Vojtova et al. 2006; Ladant et al., Trends Microbiol, 1999; Hanski et al., Trends Biochem Sci, 1989).</p><p>To make sure that the low (residual) binding of CyaA to LFA-1 was not due to the presence of the YFP tag, we generated a cell line expressing comparable amounts of intact LFA-1 and demonstrated that CyaA binds cells expressing intact LFA-1 as poorly as cells expressing LFA-1 with the YFP tag (added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, we purified the intact LFA-1 integrin from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by immunoaffinity chromatography and immobilized it onto an SPR sensor chip. Real-time SPR measurements revealed that CyaA fails to bind the immobilized LFA-1 (added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, cells expressing LFA-1 were intoxicated by CyaA to equally low cAMP levels as the control cells expressing CR4, or lacking any β<sub>2</sub> integrin. Indeed, cAMP intoxication levels of cells expressing CR3 were over two orders of magnitude higher than those of the control cells (added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, panel B). This is in agreement with previously published data showing that a concentration of 5 ng/ml of CyaA was sufficient to produce 6 pmol of cAMP per 1 million of human THP-1 monocytes expressing CR3 (Ahmad et al., Cell Microbiol, 2015), while ~1600-times higher concentration of CyaA (8 μg/ml) had to be used to yield ~2 pmol of cAMP per 1 million of human blood T-cells or Jurkat T lymphoma cells expressing LFA-1 (Paccani et al. 2011). Moreover, LFA1-expressing Jurkat cells were previously found to bind CyaA as inefficiently as sheep erythrocytes that lack any β<sub>2</sub> integrin (Gray et al., Infect Immun, 1999). Numerous in vitro studies previously reported that CyaA can penetrate a wide variety of cells lacking any β<sub>2</sub> integrin, which is simply due to the extremely high specific AC enzyme activity. At &gt;100 ng/ml concentration, the toxin causes easily detectable increase of intracellular cAMP concentrations over time in essentially any cell type (reviewed in Vojtova et al., Curr Opin Microbiol, 2006; Ladant et al., Trends Microbiol, 1999; Hanski et al., Trends Biochem Sci, 1989).</p><p>In conclusion, data obtained in several different laboratories show that CyaA binds and intoxicates cells expressing CR3 with substantially higher efficacy than cells expressing LFA-1. The data further demonstrate that CyaA does not bind LFA-1 any more avidly or in any more specific manner than it interacts through its weak lectin activity with other β<sub>2</sub> integrin-unrelated glycoproteins or glycolipids of cell surface (Gordon et al., JBC,1989; Vojtova et al., MRT, 2006; Morova et al. 2008).</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> (Conclusion <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</italic></p><p><italic>The data nicely indicates that CyaA can inhibit iC3b induced phosphorylation of SYK. Based on the conclusion figure, one would also expect experiments testing whether CyaA prevents/allows α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub> binding to iC3b? Similarly CyaA should not be able to affect recombinant α<sub>M</sub> I-domain binding to iC3b.</italic></p><p>These experiments were, indeed, included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref> in the initial manuscript and demonstrated that pre-incubation of monocytes with CyaA causes a partial reduction of iC3b-coated particle binding to CR3-expressing cells. However, a significant decrease of iC3b binding was not observed upon preincubation of monocytes with the CyaA-AC<sup>-</sup> toxoid that is unable to catalyze conversion of cytosolic ATP to cAMP. Moreover, as revealed by mAbs staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>, pre-incubation with CyaA did not provoke any significant decrease of CR3 levels exposed on cell surface, showing that decreased binding of iC3b-coated particles was not due to CyaA-triggered CR3 internalization. In contrast, pre-incubation of cells with iC3b-opsonized zymosan did not reduce binding of CyaA or CyaA-AC<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). It indicates that the CyaA/CyaA-AC<sup>-</sup> molecules do not directly compete with iC3b for binding to CR3. Instead, the cAMP signaling action of CyaA by an as yet unknown mechanism causes a partial decrease of the iC3b opsonin-binding capacity of CR3 on cell surface.</p><p><italic>6) Activation of the integrin with PMA decreases the capacity of CyaA to associate with these integrins. It would be interesting to know whether this is translated into a lower induction of cAMP by CyaA in target cells.</italic>As suggested by the reviewers, intracellular levels of cAMP produced upon interaction of CyaA with PMA-activated primary monocytes were determined. The results demonstrate that intracellular cAMP levels produced by the toxin are significantly lower in PMA-treated cells than in untreated cells. The data were now added into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> as the panel C and the corresponding modifications have been made in the main text and in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, respectively.</p><p><italic>7) A weakness of that manuscript is the absence of numerical values for the respective Kd in the text. There are equations given in Materials and methods, a table, but these numerical values should be introduced in the text, for the deleted mutants, substituted mutants and various target forms developed in the manuscript.</italic></p><p>With the membrane-penetrating CyaA toxin used in this study, determination of the equilibrium constants (K<sub>d</sub> values) for binding to the membrane-anchored CR3 receptor variants on cell surface cannot be performed in any meaningful way. This is because the binding of CyaA to the receptor is followed by irreversible insertion of the hydrophobic pore-forming domain and of the acyl chains of the toxin into cellular membrane, which occurs even at low temperature used in the binding assay (Rogel et al., JBC, 1992; El-Azami-El-Idrissiet al. 2003; Masin et al., Biochemistry, 2005). Membrane insertion withdraws the cell-bound toxin molecules from the association-dissociation equilibrium with CR3 and shifts the binding equilibrium to the right, yielding the very high apparent affinities (~10<sup>-9</sup> M) reported by Guermonprez et al., JEM, 2001. Therefore, the interaction between CyaA and the various CR3 variants could not be expressed as numerical K<sub>d</sub> values. Instead, the interaction of CyaA with cells expressing various CR3 mutants was quantified by flow cytometry and expressed as % of binding compared to cells expressing intact CR3.</p><p>Since the construction and selection of transfectants and subsequent production and affinity purification of the secreted integrin ectodomain is a rather lengthy and very laborious procedure, this was undertaken here only for the intact CR3. It would go far beyond the scope of the present work to produce and purify the ectodomains of all mutant CR3 variants developed in the manuscript. Therefore, only the K<sub>d</sub> values of the interaction between CyaA and the bent and extended CR3 ectodomain conformers were determined by SPR. These values were now added into the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
