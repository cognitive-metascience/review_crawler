To understand how chromosome folding accommodates transcription, we investigated the assembly of the axial element, the proteinaceous structure that compacts meiotic chromosomes and promotes recombination and fertility. We found that the axial element proteins of budding yeast are flexibly anchored to chromatin by the ring-like cohesin complex. The ubiquitous presence of cohesin at sites of convergent transcription provides well-dispersed points for axis attachment and thus chromosome compaction. Axis protein enrichment at these sites directly correlates with the propensity for recombination initiation nearby. A separate modulating mechanism that requires the conserved axial-element component Hop1 biases axis protein binding towards small chromosomes. Importantly, axis anchoring by cohesin is adjustable and readily displaced in the direction of transcription by the transcriptional machinery. We propose that such robust but flexible tethering allows the axial element to promote recombination while easily adapting to changes in chromosome activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07424.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07424.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07424.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Chromosomes are long molecules of DNA that represent the genetic material of an organism. In most animal cells, chromosomes are found in pairs; with one inherited from the mother and the other from the father. Sex cells—egg cells and sperm—contain half the normal number of chromosomes, so that when they fuse, the resulting single-celled embryo inherits the full set.</p><p>When sex cells are being produced, a ring made from a protein called cohesin encircles each pair of chromosomes and holds them together until they are ready to be separated. The paired chromosomes also swap sections of DNA via a process called recombination. Structures, referred to as axial elements, compact the chromosomes in each pair and bring them in close contact so that recombination can take place. In the sexually reproducing baker's yeast, axial elements contain three main proteins: cohesin, Hop1, and Red1, but it remains unclear how the entire structure is anchored to the underlying chromosomes. Furthermore, the genes encoded within the DNA of the compacted chromosomes remain active, but it is also not clear how this is possible. This is because the compacted structure would be expected to prevent the molecular machinery that expresses genes from accessing the DNA.</p><p>Sun, Huang et al. have now studied this process in budding yeast cells by using a method called ChIP-seq to determine where cohesin and the Hop1 and Red1 proteins are found along the chromosomes. The experiments showed that cohesin, Hop1, and Red1 are enriched in regions between two genes that run in the opposite directions to each other. Sun, Huang et al. also observed that cohesin recruits Red1, which in turn, recruits Hop1, and that all three proteins physically interact with one another. These findings imply that it is cohesin that anchors the axial elements to the underlying chromosomes.</p><p>Further experiments showed that cohesin slides along chromosomes towards areas where genes are active. This suggests that cohesin provides a robust, but flexible, link between the axial elements and the chromosomes. This flexibility would enable recombination and gene expression to continue in compacted chromosomes. A loss of flexibility may be one of the reasons why mutations in cohesin components of the axial element cause infertility in men and condition called premature ovarian failure in women.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07424.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07424.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>axial element</kwd><kwd>cohesin</kwd><kwd>red1</kwd><kwd>rec8</kwd><kwd>hop1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM088248</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hochwagen</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000912</institution-id><institution>March of Dimes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant 6-FY13-105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hochwagen</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund (FWF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F3405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klein</surname><given-names>Franz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund (FWF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F3410</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klein</surname><given-names>Franz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Charles A.

A key event in meiosis is the programmed recombination of homologous chromosomes, which ensures proper chromosome segregation during the first meiotic division and also provides genetic variation in the offspring. Homologous recombination events initiate with programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are introduced by the topoisomerase-like enzyme Spo11. Upon endonucleolytic removal of Spo11 from break ends, a subset of DSBs are repaired by crossing-over thereby physically linking homologous chromosome pairs for segregation during meiosis I. The genomic distribution of meiotic DSBs is decidedly non-random (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitzblau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buhler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pan et al., 2011a</xref>), but the mechanisms driving this distribution, and thus the patterns of recombination, are not yet well defined.</p><p>DSB formation and repair occur in the context of a specific chromosome architecture characterized by linear arrays of chromatin loops with the bases attached to a proteinaceous axis, known as the axial element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moens and Pearlman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zickler and Kleckner, 1999</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> most DSBs occur within the chromatin loops, whereas axis association sites are cold for DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blat et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 2014</xref>). The axial element in yeast contains the axis proteins Red1 and Hop1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hollingsworth et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith and Roeder, 1997</xref>), as well as the meiotic cohesin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klein et al., 1999</xref>). Red1 and Hop1 physically interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de los Santos and Hollingsworth, 1999</xref>), and Red1 helps recruit Hop1 to chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith and Roeder, 1997</xref>). Meiotic cohesin is not essential for chromosomal binding of Red1 and Hop1, but Red1 and Hop1 distribution is highly abnormal in cohesin mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, this phenotype is not due to a loss of sister chromatid cohesion, as axis protein distribution is largely normal on unreplicated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blitzblau et al., 2012</xref>). It is currently unclear whether cohesin directly interacts with Red1 and/or Hop1 in budding yeast.</p><p>One of the first functions of Red1 and Hop1 is to correctly localize the essential DSB factors Mer2, Rec114 and Mei4 to axis sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, DSB levels are strongly reduced in <italic>hop1Δ</italic> or <italic>red1Δ</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mao-Draayer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwacha and Kleckner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, reduction in Red1 and Hop1 binding in the absence of cohesin correlates with reduced Spo11 binding and low DSB levels on several larger chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kugou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>). Conversely, increased binding of axis proteins on small chromosomes correlates with increased DSB levels and crossover recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaback et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitzblau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pan et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The molecular determinants of axis attachment sites remain poorly defined. Red1 was reported to favor AT-rich segments on chromosome III at a resolution of 3 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blat et al., 2002</xref>), whereas Hop1 has preferential affinity for G-rich sequences and specific DNA topologies in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kironmai et al., 1998</xref>). However, on meiotic chromosomes, Hop1 and Red1 binding coincides with cohesin binding sites and regular distribution of Hop1 requires cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that cohesin is a major determinant of axis attachment sites. The yeast meiotic cohesin complex consists of Smc1, Smc3, Scc3, and the kleisin Rec8, which replaces the mitotic kleisin Scc1/Mcd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watanabe and Nurse, 1999</xref>). Despite the different subunit composition, the cohesin-associated chromosomal sites are highly conserved between mitosis and meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blat and Kleckner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glynn et al., 2004</xref>). A strong correlation between cohesin sites and regions of convergent transcription has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lengronne et al., 2004</xref>), and changes in transcriptional activities can result in altered cohesin localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lengronne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bausch et al., 2007</xref>). Because cohesin can encircle DNA from two sister-chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ivanov and Nasmyth, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2007</xref>) it is hypothesized to be pushed along genes ahead of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex, thus accumulating at convergent regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ocampo-Hafalla and Uhlmann, 2011</xref>). However, sliding has not been addressed in meiotic prophase, where cohesin may be stably incorporated in the axial element. Moreover, the mechanisms of meiotic axis protein loading and the functional link to cohesin remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Here, we probed axis assembly using high-resolution chromatin binding studies of axis protein distribution and in vivo detection of physical associations between axis proteins. We found that axis proteins dynamically accumulate between convergent genes in a distinctive two-peak pattern, which we demonstrate to be a direct consequence of the underlying transcriptional activity. We show that cohesin is responsible for this behavior and that Rec8 interacts closely with both axis proteins via Red1. In the absence of Rec8, Hop1 becomes essential for chromosomal Red1 recruitment, defining a cohesin-independent mode of axis protein recruitment. Intriguingly, Hop1 but not Rec8 is required for the preferential loading of Red1 to short chromosomes, possibly by preventing excess Red1 accumulation on large chromosomes and at centromeres. Our findings demonstrate that the well-dispersed binding and chromosome size-biased enrichment of axis proteins are controlled by two independent recruitment modes and provide important insight into the mechanistic hierarchy of meiotic axis assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide distribution of axis association sites</title><p>We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) to determine the chromosomal distribution of two axis proteins, Red1 and Hop1, as well as two cohesin subunits, Rec8 and Smc3. To validate our data, we compared the resulting profiles with previous lower-resolution ChIP–chip data of Hop1, Red1, and Rec8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blitzblau et al., 2012</xref>). A high correlation indicated that the identification of axis association sites was consistent between the two approaches (Pearson's <italic>r</italic> = 0.80). As observed previously, the genome-wide distribution of axis proteins and cohesin was highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), with the exception of centromeric regions where cohesin was more highly enriched than axis proteins. Because of the high correspondence in localization, we chose the Red1 data set as the representative axis protein data set for subsequent analyses.</p><p>We observed Red1 binding sites distributed across all chromosomes, with a notable bias toward the smallest chromosomes. Statistical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) derived a total of 774 Red1 binding sites, in close agreement with previous reports, which identified 656 and 802 axis association sites, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blitzblau et al., 2012</xref>). Binding was particularly strong on the three shortest chromosomes, which displayed a higher overall level of axis protein enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>). Significantly, Rec8 exhibited no such bias, suggesting that this chromosome-specific patterning of axis proteins is not dictated by Rec8 (see later sections). The enrichment of Red1 on small chromosomes mirrored a previously noted bias of average meiotic DSB levels, which are also highest on the three shortest chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitzblau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pan et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thacker et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, the numbers of axis sites on individual chromosomes were highly correlated with the number of Spo11 cleavage events (Spo11-linked oligonucleotide counts; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Given that axis proteins are required for the majority of meiotic DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mao-Draayer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwacha and Kleckner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kugou et al., 2009</xref>), their preferential enrichment on small chromosomes may contribute to the observed chromosome-size bias of meiotic DSB formation.</p><p>Consistent with previous findings, DSB hotspots were largely excluded from sites of axis protein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blat et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pan et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 2014</xref>). Most axis sites detected by ChIP-seq were broad, ranging from 1 to 3 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Spo11 cleavage activity, as determined by sequencing Spo11-associated DSB ends (Spo11 oligos), was strongly depleted in these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This pattern further corroborates the notion that DSBs occur preferentially within loop regions that are not bound by axis proteins. As is the case with DSB hotspots, motif discovery did not yield strong consensus sequences associated with Red1 binding. A repetitive sequence pattern consisting of varying numbers of a 3-bp GAN unit was found modestly enriched at Red1 peaks (E-value = 6.6e-6), with maximal enrichment at the summits of Red1 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>, P-value = 5.0e-4). However, this motif was not predictive of Red1 binding and was only present in 16.1% (125/774) of Red1 peaks, indicating that DNA sequence is at best a minor determinant of axis protein binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Axis proteins preferentially bind to 3′ ends of convergent genes</title><p>To better understand the binding preference of axis proteins, we examined where Red1 binds relative to genes. We plotted the average Red1 binding signals with respect to all open reading frames (ORFs). We found that Red1 enrichment was significantly biased toward the ends of ORFs, reaching a summit in the 3′ ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with the high signal density on short chromosomes, we found an overall elevated signal along genes situated on short chromosomes. To further interpret the enrichment of axis proteins at 3′ ends of genes, we confined the analysis of binding peaks to 500 bp around Red1 summits. We found that 94.6% (732/774) of Red1 peaks were located at the 3′ ends of genes (250 bp on either side of the stop codon; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). This bias contrasts with DSBs, which are predominantly detected at promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitzblau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pan et al., 2011a</xref>).

One important feature of the compact yeast genome is that convergent intergenic regions are usually very short, and convergent transcripts frequently overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">David et al., 2006</xref>). Accordingly, our analysis of published meiotic mRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brar et al., 2012a</xref>) revealed that 79% of convergent transcript pairs exhibited overlapping 3′ UTRs during the early stages of meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). After ranking the convergent gene pairs according to the extent of overlap of their 3′ UTRs, the presence and spacing of the two Red1 peaks appeared directly correlated with the amount of overlap. Gene pairs with an extensive overlap showed well-separated peaks, whereas gene pairs with little or no overlap exhibited a single peak at the midpoint of their intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Red1 binding was maximally enriched ∼150 bp downstream of the 3′ ends of the respective transcripts, a behavior also observed for cohesin subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

This analysis revealed higher and more confined Red1 occupancy between two highly transcribing convergent genes than between gene pairs with less transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating that ongoing transcription helps to focus axis proteins between convergent gene pairs. We also noted that the relative heights of the two Red1 peaks between a pair of convergent transcripts often differed substantially. Therefore, we sorted convergent gene pairs based on the relative transcriptional activity of the two genes. This analysis uncovered a strong reciprocal relationship between transcriptional strength and axis protein enrichment. In gene pairs with differential transcriptional activity, Red1 tends to accumulate downstream of the more highly expressed side. Accordingly, peaks of equal heights were present in gene pairs with similar transcriptional strengths. The reciprocal relationship was apparent both when average Red1 occupancy was calculated for six ranked quantiles and when the sorted gene pairs were displayed as a heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Both genes exhibit low transcriptional activities during early stages of sporulation and are located in convergent gene pairs, in which the convergently transcribed neighbor is more highly expressed. Two concentrations of copper (5 μM and 20 μM) were applied to induce different levels of expression during early meiosis. In wild-type control cells, the Red1 binding profile was skewed to the sides of the weakly transcribed <italic>GCY1</italic> and <italic>GAL2</italic> genes irrespective of copper concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref> shows <italic>GCY1</italic>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref> for <italic>GAL2</italic>). A similar profile was also observed for the <italic>pCUP1</italic> strains in the absence of copper, although a shift of Red1 binding away from <italic>pCUP1</italic> was apparent and correlated well with the leaky expression of this promoter (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>; also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Addition of 5 μM Cu<sup>2+</sup> induced a marked shift in the Red1 binding pattern toward the downstream gene.

Such refocusing could either result from sliding motion or repeated recruitment to a chromatin modification or structure at the 3′ ends of transcription bubbles.

Specifically, Red1 binding appeared to increase on large chromosomes and close to centromeres. In wild-type cells, we observed higher overall levels of Red1 on the 3 smallest chromosomes (2.5-fold over the rest, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), correlating well with the higher enrichment of DSB machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>) and increased DSB levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitzblau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pan et al., 2011a</xref>) on small chromosomes. The over-representation of Red1 was nearly abolished, falling to 1.25-fold, in the <italic>hop1Δ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, Hop1 modulates Red1 deposition in a chromosome-dependent manner. Relative scaling of ChIP signals between different experiments by NCIS (Normalization of ChIP-Seq data with untagged control) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liang and Keles, 2012</xref>) suggested that the reduced chromosome-size bias may be due to increased Red1 enrichment on the larger chromosomes in the <italic>hop1Δ</italic> mutant. To independently validate the ratio of Red1 occupancy between <italic>hop1∆</italic> and wild-type strains, we used qChIP at 6 loci with increased and 6 loci with decreased Red1 enrichment. qChIP confirmed the direction of Red1 signal change predicted from ChIP-seq at all 12 genomic positions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> shows the comparison between the ratios expected from ChIP-seq and those observed by qChIP. These results identify Hop1 as a chromosome-dependent regulator of Red1 deposition and suggest that it down-regulates accumulation of Red1 on the thirteen largest chromosomes.</p><p>We also observed increased Red1 binding near centromeres in <italic>hop1Δ</italic> mutants. A doublet of small V5-Red1 peaks was found to flank the yeast centromeres at a stereotypic distance of about 270 bp from their centers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In <italic>rec8Δ</italic> and <italic>rec8Δ hop1Δ</italic> double mutants, these peaks were strongly decreased or missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). By contrast, in <italic>hop1Δ</italic> mutants, the centromere proximal peaks of Red1 were strongly enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), suggesting that Rec8 recruits Red1 next to the centromere against negative regulation by Hop1, which may in turn possibly prevent unwanted centromere proximal recombination.</p><p>The precise positioning of axis proteins at centromeres allowed us to probe the arrangement of cohesin and Red1 within axis association sites in more detail.

Rec8 accumulation aligned with the ends of transcripts surrounding the largely transcript-free zone of the centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) and was unchanged in <italic>red1Δ</italic> mutants. Red1 peaks are slightly closer to the centromeres (∼270 bp), raising the possibility that Red1 is sandwiched between the Cse4 hemi-nucleosome, which may act as a strong barrier, and cohesin, which in turn might be driven by the advancing RNAPII complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Red1, Hop1, and Rec8 physically interact</title><p>Given that Rec8 is essential for Red1 recruitment along chromosome arms in <italic>hop1Δ</italic> mutants, we investigated whether the two proteins physically interact. Because interaction between Rec8 and Red1 could preferentially occur in insoluble chromatin, we first used M-track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zuzuarregui et al., 2012</xref>) to test their interaction in vivo. M-track uses HKMT, a histone lysine methyltransferase and its acceptor sequence, a histone H3 fragment, each fused to one of the proteins suspected to interact, to create permanent methyl marks on the acceptor even upon transient interaction of the proteins of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). When HKMT was fused to Rec8, Red1-HA-3xH3 received a robust H3K9me3 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The signal existed, as long as Red1 was detectable. We also observed methylation of Hop1-HA-3xH3 by Rec8-HKMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In agreement with our ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), methyl transfer to Hop1, but not Hop1 protein stability, depended on the presence of Red1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), showing the specificity of the assay. Unexpectedly, Red1-HA-3xH3 depended on Hop1 for its interaction with Rec8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, right panels). This result was at odds with the observation that chromosomal recruitment of untagged Red1 did not require <italic>HOP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To investigate this discrepancy, we performed ChIP analysis of Red1 with or without the C-terminal HA-3xH3 tag. Only Red1 tagged at the C-terminus depended on Hop1 for chromosomal binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Therefore, Hop1 contributes to the interaction between Red1 and Rec8.

We used microarray-based measurement of DSB-associated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA arrays) to locate DSB hotspots in a <italic>dmc1Δ</italic> mutant background, which prevents DSB repair and allows cumulative DSB measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitzblau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buhler et al., 2007</xref>). In the presence of cohesin, DSB hotspots were distributed across most of the genome. By contrast, DSB formation in <italic>rec8Δ</italic> mutants was largely restricted to small chromosomes and the vicinity of Red1 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Thus, DSB formation is limited to the genomic neighborhoods that exhibited persistent Red1 and Hop1 binding in <italic>rec8Δ</italic> mutants. These findings are consistent with our previous observation that these regions selectively retain essential components of the meiotic DSB machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>). Strikingly, despite the loss of transcriptional focusing of axis association sites in the absence of cohesin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and the overall altered patterns of Red1 distribution, DSB formation within Red1 clusters occurred at the same hotspots as in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Thus, hotspot designation does not depend on the precise location of axis binding sites. These data suggest that the general proximity of axis proteins is sufficient to activate DSB hotspots and that the primary role of Rec8 in controlling DSB formation is to broadly distribute axis proteins across meiotic chromosomes.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07424.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Mitotic cohesin rescues transcriptional focusing but not genome-wide defects of <italic>rec8Δ</italic> mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative DSB hotspot intensity of each chromosome in WT (green) and <italic>rec8Δ</italic> mutants (blue) as determined using ssDNA arrays.

For this purpose, we replaced the only meiosis-specific subunit of cohesin, Rec8, with its mitotic counterpart Scc1/Mcd1 by deleting <italic>REC8</italic> and expressing <italic>SCC1</italic> from the <italic>REC8</italic> promoter (<italic>pREC8-SCC1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Toth et al., 2000</xref>). ChIP analysis revealed that Scc1-containing cohesin was targeted to the same chromosomal sites as Rec8-cohesin, indicating that Scc1 can fully substitute for Rec8 in recruiting cohesin to meiotic chromosomes (Pearson's <italic>r</italic> = 0.93, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, Scc1-cohesin did not efficiently recruit Red1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). As a result, the DSB distribution of <italic>rec8Δ pREC8-SCC1</italic> cells remained similar to <italic>rec8Δ</italic> mutants and unlike wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Consistent with this observation, Scc1 failed to detectably precipitate with V5-Red1 when expressed instead of Rec8 from the <italic>REC8</italic>-promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). We conclude that only meiotic cohesin can efficiently recruit meiotic axis proteins. Surprisingly, <italic>pREC8-SCC1</italic> did restore transcriptional focusing to axis association sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These data indicate that focusing of axis proteins and axis protein recruitment are separable activities of meiotic cohesin and suggest that Rec8, but not Scc1, provides the necessary Red1 contacts for evenly distributing axis proteins, and thus recombination events, along meiotic chromosomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Meiotic chromosomes assume a compact axial architecture while being actively transcribed. Here, we demonstrate that chromatin anchoring of the axial element is adaptable to ongoing transcription, and we identified independent roles for the meiotic cohesin subunit Rec8 and the conserved meiotic axis component Hop1 in guiding axis protein binding throughout the genome and on small chromosomes, respectively. These findings reveal fundamental design principles of higher-order chromosome structure.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Formation of a loop-axis array</title><p>The establishment of a quasi-regular array of chromatin loops represents a considerable mechanistic challenge that could be solved by recruitment motifs or de novo patterning mechanisms. Our findings indicate that the dispersed genomic distribution of cohesin rings at convergent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glynn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kugou et al., 2009</xref>), and thus ultimately the transcriptional landscape, dictates the preferred attachment sites of the axial element. The enrichment of cohesin between convergent genes is not meiosis-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glynn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lengronne et al., 2004</xref>), but by replacing the Scc1 subunit of cohesin with a meiotic variant (Rec8), cohesin is converted into a landmark for axial element anchoring. Using oriented <italic>URA3</italic> insertions, we demonstrate that such sequence-independent recruitment ensures that the patterning of axis attachment sites readily adapts to changes in gene arrangements. Moreover, this mechanism may inherently separate axis attachments from DSB hotspots, which occur in promoters and are inhibited by the immediate neighborhood of axis proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 2014</xref>). We note that, similar to yeast, mitotic cohesin is enriched on or near transcribed genes in both flies and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wendt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gause et al., 2010</xref>), and cohesin complexes are required for forming the meiotic loop-axis architecture in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Novak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Llano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hopkins et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the use of the transcriptional landscape as a dynamic reference for meiotic axis assembly may well be conserved through evolution. Perhaps, linking both DSB hotspots and axis association sites to landmarks of active, RNAPII-dependent transcription ensures that meiotic recombination remains confined to euchromatic and thus non-repetitive regions of the genome, reducing the potential for non-allelic homologous recombination and genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sasaki et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our data show that recruitment of axis proteins involves direct physical interaction with cohesin. The robust positive signal of an in vivo physical proximity assay between Rec8 and Red1 is corroborated by co-precipitation between Red1 and Rec8. Consistent with this observation, Red1 is recruited exclusively to Rec8 binding sites on chromatin by Rec8 in the absence of Hop1. In fact, among cohesin subunits, Rec8 plays a pivotal role, as its mitotic paralogue, Scc1, does not interact notably with Red1. In <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, meiotic cohesin interacts with the homolog of ScRed1 (Rec10) via Rec11, the meiosis-specific <italic>S. pombe</italic> homolog of ScScc3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sakuno and Watanabe, 2015</xref>). Whether this mechanism of interaction also operates in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is unknown, but as Scc1-cohesin does not recruit or stably interact with Red1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we suggest that Rec8 directly contributes to Red1 binding. These findings indicate that the meiotic cohesin ring forms a stable protein complex with Red1 and Hop1 to flexibly link the axial element with chromatin.</p><p>How axis attachment sites congress to form the loop-axis array remains to be determined. Previous data showing that linear elements are lost in the absence of Red1 but remain detectable by electron microscopy (EM) in the absence of Hop1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rockmill and Roeder, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klein et al., 1999</xref>), suggest that Red1, but not Hop1, is required to link axis attachment sites to form linear elements. Red1 has a well-known ability to oligomerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Woltering et al., 2000</xref>), which may support the congression of axis sites, although other proteins, including Hop1, may contribute to the wild-type structure. Whether the linear organization emerges from simple nearest neighbor interactions of axis attachment sites along a contiguous piece of DNA remains to be shown.</p><p>Another open question is whether all sites of cohesin binding (with the exception of centromeres) function as axis attachment sites on a given chromosome, and thus whether spacing of axis attachment sites can serve as a proxy for estimating loop sizes. Immunofluorescence analyses show Rec8 in continuous tracks, whereas Hop1 and Red1 frequently exhibit more focal staining (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith and Roeder, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2009</xref>] and data not shown), which may indicate incomplete occupancy of potential axis attachment sites. On the other hand, EM analysis yields estimates of chromatin loop sizes of approximately 20 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moens and Pearlman, 1988</xref>), which is only moderately larger than the average spacing of cohesin sites of 10.9 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glynn et al., 2004</xref>), indicating that loops generally do not span more than 2 or 3 potential axis association sites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Hop1 quantitatively modulates Red1 accumulation</title><p>Hop1 emerges from this work as an intriguing modulator of axis patterning. We show that Hop1 contributes to Red1 recruitment in three ways. First, Hop1 mediates Red1 binding to a number of chromosomal sites independently of Rec8. Second, Hop1 contributes to the recruitment of Red1 by Rec8, as revealed by the loss of Red1–Rec8 interaction in <italic>hop1∆</italic> mutants when the C-terminus of Red1 is tagged. Third and most unexpectedly, Hop1 is a negative regulator of Red1 accumulation at selected chromosomal regions. It has been noted that DSB formation is dangerous and thus suppressed in the vicinity of centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pan et al., 2011a</xref>) and that DSB density is higher on the three smallest chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitzblau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pan et al., 2011a</xref>), which also enjoy substantially higher meiotic recombination rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaback et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaback, 1996</xref>). Hop1 strongly suppresses Red1 hyper-accumulation close to centromeres but also on medium and large chromosomes. In the presence of Hop1, Red1 densities on chromosomes I, VI, and III are over twofold higher than on other chromosomes, but without Hop1, Red1 densities for all chromosomes are nearly the same. These findings predict that preferential DSB formation on small chromosomes should be eliminated in a <italic>hop1∆</italic> mutant. This is indeed the case based on Spo11 oligo mapping (P Schlögelhofer, personal communication). Earlier results have shown that the overrepresentation of DSB machinery on small chromosomes is not dependent on Spo11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>), allowing us to exclude models that involve a DSB feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thacker et al., 2014</xref>) to explain the compensatory accumulations. Moreover, the preferential accumulation of Red1 is unaffected, if not exacerbated in <italic>rec8∆</italic> mutants, consistent with the observation that Rec8 binding itself exhibits no chromosome-size bias. These data exclude a role of cohesin in creating this bias and support the conclusion that Hop1 is the key factor mediating compensatory DSB machine accumulation on small chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The role of axis proteins in activating DSB formation</title><p>Our findings support the view that visibly condensed axial structures may not be prerequisite to efficient DSB formation. In particular, yeast <italic>rec8∆</italic> mutants fail to assemble discernable linear chromosome axes by EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klein et al., 1999</xref>) but remain competent to induce DSBs in chromosomal domains that retain Red1/Hop1 binding. This correlation therefore likely reflects a quasi-local function of axis proteins in hotspot activation that is independent of linear axis formation but this remains to be shown. We previously demonstrated that axis proteins are required for the recruitment of several essential DSB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>). Since axis proteins inhibit DSB formation within ∼800 bp of their binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 2014</xref>), the Red1/Hop1-dependent local concentration of DSB factors likely activates hotspots at a distance, involving higher-order chromatin interactions. This model explains why aberrant fine-scale positioning of Red1 in <italic>rec8∆</italic> mutants still supported DSB formation at wild-type hotspots. The fact that the positions of DSB hotspots remain unchanged in these mutants strongly argues that axis proteins are not responsible for designating certain sequences as hotspots. This conclusion is consistent with growing evidence (summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borde and de Massy, 2013</xref>) that hotspot designation is primarily driven by epigenetic marks associated with gene promoters.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Adaptability of the axis-chromatin interface</title><p>Significantly, our findings indicate that anchoring of the axial element is highly flexible. We demonstrate that axis protein accumulation peaks ∼150 bp downstream of transcript ends and is actively driven by differential promoter activity, implying that axis proteins are not stably bound to DNA. For steric reasons, the observed double peaks likely reflect the average distribution of axis proteins within the assayed cell population, rather than the distribution along a single chromatid. Given that the cohesin ring was previously proposed to slide along chromatin in response to transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bausch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ocampo-Hafalla and Uhlmann, 2011</xref>), these data indicate that cohesin sliding controls the sites of axis protein attachment.

Based on the range of transcriptional overlap, loop movements will in most cases not exceed 500 bp and are not drawn to scale.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07424.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07424.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07424-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>In addition, the adjustable axis-chromatin interface offered by the cohesin ring may also be important during meiotic recombination. Although our data indicate that positional flexibility of axis attachment is dispensable for DSB formation, meiotic chromosome axis components have multiple roles in meiotic recombination, including chromosome pairing, checkpoint signaling and preventing non-productive recombination between sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zickler and Kleckner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Humphryes and Hochwagen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Subramanian and Hochwagen, 2014</xref>). Evidence for recruitment-independent roles of the cohesin ring comes from <italic>rec8Δ</italic> mutants, which are severely defective in maintaining homolog-directed repair bias at a hotspot on chromosome III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). This defect occurs despite normal levels of Hop1 and Red1 on this chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kugou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>) (this work). Intriguingly, expression of Scc1-cohesin, which we show restores transcriptional focusing for axis proteins, also partially rescues homolog-directed repair bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Given that targeted DNA repair requires substantial flexibility of DNA ends, these observations raise the possibility that the dynamic anchoring of axis proteins may also be an important prerequisite for controlled meiotic recombination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p>All strains used in this study are of the SK1 background.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers, one of whom, Adèle Marston, has agreed to share her identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a careful study probing the functional distribution of meiotic chromosome axis proteins, building on previous work demonstrating the importance of cohesin. The key findings are: (1) transcription spatially determines the localization of axis proteins along chromosomes due to their association with cohesin. (2) Hop1 modulates (reduces) Red1 association with large chromosomes. (3) Even altered Red1 localization correlates with DSBs nearby.</p><p>We have one major concern that we would like you to address:</p><p>The conclusion that Hop1 reduces Red1 levels on all but the three smallest chromosomes is exciting but should be strengthened. Even with NCIS normalization it is unclear how quantitative ChIP-Seq is. Therefore, the ChIP-qPCR data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1A</xref> is important and this analysis should be expanded to look at more sites. Biological replicates should be shown and untagged controls should be included for all experiments. It would also be helpful to use a complementary technique to ChIP. Is the difference between Red1 localization on the different chromosomes observable cytologically, e.g. on chromosome spreads?</p><p>We would also like you to tone down the comment about the use of the M track assay to establish the close proximity between Rec8, Red1 and Hop1. We don't think it can it really be used as evidence of direct contact? For instance, is the interaction detectable using standard co-immunoprecipitation methods (with and without DNase?)? My advice is to not do any more experiments but to tone down the conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07424.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The conclusion that Hop1 reduces Red1 levels on all but the three smallest chromosomes is exciting but should be strengthened.

Is the difference between Red1 localization on the different chromosomes observable cytologically, e.g. on chromosome spreads</italic>?</p><p>As the referees have pointed out correctly, it is one thing to show that Hop1 is a conditional regulator of Red1 deposition (this can be derived from the ChIP-seq data with high certainty), but a more sophisticated problem to compare two ChIP-seq profiles and scale them correctly, relative to each other. Although we had NCIS and one independent control (qChIP) included in the orginial submission, we completely agree that this point needed strengthening. We have added 3 additional biological repeats (n listed and error bars added, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), each comparing Red1-qChIP between <italic>hop1∆</italic> and <italic>HOP1</italic>, and have included an untagged control for each primer pair. We had of course performed untagged controls for all experiments in the first submission but not always shown them for space reasons (ChIP-seq of the untagged control is required for NCIS calculations and can be found as a separate data set at GEO).</p><p>In addition, we have expanded the number of intervals analyzed by qChIP. To further strengthen this analysis, we exploited the fact that ChIP-seq not only identified positions where Red1 was increased in the absence of Hop1 (on long chromosomes), but also a few positions where Red1 was decreased. Using 6 positions with an expected increase, in parallel to 6 positions where a decrease is expected, controls against experimental variation concerning overall yield of an IP. Only if the yield of each IP remained constant between the <italic>HOP1</italic> and <italic>hop1∆</italic>, the ratios would be reproduced. If, for instance ChIP of <italic>HOP1</italic> cells produced overall less DNA, positions supposed to be higher in <italic>HOP1</italic> would fail to meet the expectation. However, in all experiments, the ratios on each position predicted to be below 1 behaved as expected, and those predicted to be above 1 did also. Despite this confirmation, we cautiously interpreted our result in the manuscript as “suggesting” down-regulation by Hop1 on long chromosomes.</p><p>Chromosome spreads: This is a very good idea, but unfortunately cytological output is on several levels too different from Chip-seq to allow meaningful comparisons. First, ChIP is an averaging technology, while cytology studies single cells. Second, ChIP specifically monitors protein-DNA binding sites. Cytology does not. Big structures, like axial element fragments may be attached with many or few DNA binding sites, but this will not be distinguishable in cytology. Third, cytology will show any binding, independent of sequence specificity, while completely random attachments will generally not be visible in ChIP-seq profiles.</p><p><italic>We would also like you to tone down the comment about the use of the M track assay to establish the close proximity between Rec8, Red1 and Hop1. We don't think it can it really be used as evidence of direct contact? For instance, is the interaction detectable using standard co-immunoprecipitation methods (with and without DNase?)? My advice is to not do any more experiments but to tone down the conclusions</italic>.</p><p>We apologize if we overstated the M-track results. Indeed, we did not see co-immunoprecipitation in earlier experiments between Red1 and Rec8, prompting us to turn to M-track in the first place. However, the strength of the H3K9me3 signal suggested a stable physical interaction that was at odds with not getting a Co-IP signal. Red1-Rec8 interaction could lead to insoluble structures that possibly escaped our IP. Therefore we now used strong sonication followed by Benzonase treatment. This yielded a robust Rec8-HA Co-IP signal, when we precipitated with V5-Red1. We hope the referees agree that the Co-IP confirms physical interaction between cohesin and Red1 in the absence of DNA. This result is important, because it suggests a division of labor, in which Red1 has a more structural role both in organizing cohesin into linear, continuous arrays and in recruiting Hop1, while Hop1 may be more specialized for signal transduction and stimulating Spo11 activity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
