host side effects. Here, we show that agents with a broad polypharmacology, often considered ‘dirtier’ drugs, can have unique efficacy if they combine deleterious effects on the parasite with beneficial actions in the host. This principle is evidenced through a screen for drugs to treat schistosomiasis, a parasitic flatworm disease that impacts over 230 million people. A target-based screen of a <italic>Schistosoma</italic> serotoninergic G protein coupled receptor yielded the potent agonist, ergotamine, which disrupted worm movement. In vivo, ergotamine decreased mortality, parasite load and intestinal egg counts but also uniquely reduced organ pathology through engagement of host GPCRs that repressed hepatic stellate cell activation, inflammatory damage and fibrosis. The unique ability of ergotamine to engage both host and parasite GPCRs evidences a future strategy for anthelmintic drug design that coalesces deleterious antiparasitic activity with beneficial host effects.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35755.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>More than 200 million people worldwide are infected with parasitic worms that cause the disease schistosomiasis. Most cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Long-term infections can damage organs, and children who are affected may suffer delayed growth and learning difficulties. Despite its significant health and economic impact, schistosomiasis is still considered a ‘neglected’ tropical disease. This means there has not been adequate investment into developing new treatments or cures.</p><p>A drug called praziquantel is currently the only treatment for schistosomiasis. However, the drug has unpleasant side effects, cannot cure all infected individuals, and there is a concern that worms may develop resistance to its effects. This means there is an urgent need to develop new therapies. One possible approach would be to develop drugs that interfere with the worm’s ability to move.</p><p>Chan et al. screened thousands of existing chemicals for interactions with a protein that is known to control how the worms move. A drug called ergotamine, which is currently used to treat migraines, strongly interacted with the protein. Treating infected mice with ergotamine eliminated the parasites and reduced the organ damage caused by the infection. Praziquantel also reduced the number of parasites in the mice but it did not prevent organ damage.</p><p>The results presented by Chan et al. show that a single drug can interact with targets in both the worm and the animals it infects. Searching for drugs that have this dual effect may help to develop more effective treatments for schistosomiasis and other diseases caused by parasites. Ergotamine itself is unlikely to be used to treat people for schistosomiasis because of the side effects produced when using it repeatedly. However, these findings will help researchers identify and develop safer drugs with similar benefits.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>schistosomiasis</kwd><kwd>parasitic diseases</kwd><kwd>G protein coupled receptor</kwd><kwd>drug discovery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI25821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marchant</surname><given-names>Jonathan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI130642</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marchant</surname><given-names>Jonathan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM088790</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marchant</surname><given-names>Jonathan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32AI124598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Engagement of both host and parasite signaling pathways proves a novel approach for developing improved anti-parasitic therapies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Schistosomiasis (infection with parasitic blood flukes) affects over 230 million people, with severe infections causing ~200,000 deaths per year. Chronic infections are associated with morbidities such as anemia, impaired cognitive development and stunted growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">King and Dangerfield-Cha, 2008</xref>). Infection is acquired upon exposure to freshwater, larval cercariae which penetrate the host skin. Inside host tissue, cercariae transform into schistosomula that access and traverse the circulatory system, pass through the lungs and liver before finally residing as mature adults within either the mesenteric vessels (<italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> and <italic>Schistosoma japonicum</italic>) or vasculature surrounding the urinary bladder (<italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Georgi et al., 1986</xref>). The sexually mature male and female worms pair up and generate a prodigious number of eggs, depositing hundreds to thousands of eggs per female worm per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheever, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheever et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlow and Meleney, 1949</xref>). Eggs lodge within the peritoneal organs, evoking a massive Th2 response which cues granuloma formation and consequent pathology in affected organs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheever, 1969</xref>]). In the case of urogenital schistosomiasis (<italic>S. haematobium</italic> infection) eggs are deposited in the bladder mucosa and urinary tract, resulting in hematuria and increased rates of squamous-cell carcinoma. In the case of intestinal schistosomiasis (<italic>S. mansoni</italic> and <italic>S. japonicum</italic> infections), eggs are deposited in the liver and hepatic portal system leading to periportal fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension and ascites.</p><p>Broad spectrum chemotherapy of schistosomiasis relies upon praziquantel (PZQ), which has been in clinical use for nearly 40 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">King and Dangerfield-Cha, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 1983</xref>). Mass drug administration (MDA) programs will require ~250 million tablets of PZQ per year for at risk populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osakunor et al., 2018</xref>). The widespread distribution of schistosomiasis, coupled with observations that PZQ can be subcurative in areas of high intensity of infection and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Danso-Appiah and De Vlas, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">King et al., 2011</xref>) raise concerns that treatment resistant parasites may emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fallon and Doenhoff, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fallon et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ismail et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is important to identify new flatworm drug targets and lead compounds to expand the arsenal of drugs available to treat schistosomiasis and other parasitic flatworm infections currently resolved through PZQ administration.</p><p>In this regard, targeting parasite neuromuscular physiology has proven to be a highly successful anthelmintic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geary et al., 1992</xref>). In schistosomes, serotonin (5-HT) controls motor function and a specific serotonergic G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) mediating this effect has been implicated by both RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Patocka et al., 2014</xref>) and drug screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2016b</xref>). Here, we cloned full-length 5-HT receptor sequences from each of three major species causing human infection worldwide and expressed these targets in a high-throughput capable assay enabling screening of thousands of compounds from natural product libraries. The dataset identified anti-schistosomal chemotypes that conveyed anti-parasitic efficacy. Most importantly these activities led to the discovery that the ergot alkaloid ergotamine ameliorated both infection and the pathological sequelae of infection. These properties highlight an opportunity to combat schistosome infections and their pathological impact on the host using single agents that coalesce deleterious actions on parasites with beneficial activities on host responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pharmacological profiling of a schistosome 5-HTR</title><p>Full-length sequences for a serotoninergic GPCR (5-HTR) were cloned from the three major schistosome species causing infections worldwide; <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> (Sm.5HTR<sub>L</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2016b</xref>]), <italic>S. haematobium</italic> (Sh.5HTR) and <italic>S. japonicum</italic> (Sj.5HTR). The three 5HTRs shared high amino acid similarity (84–94%), and clustered with 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors from other organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). In mammalian HEK293 cells, GFP-tagged variants of each 5-HTR localized at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), enabling functional profiling. To measure signaling output, GPCR activity was assessed using a luciferase based cAMP reporter (GloSensor 22F, Promega) engineered to undergo a conformational change on cAMP binding that increases luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The choice of this reporter was guided by prior evidence demonstrating coupling of the flatworm SER-7 GPCRs to G<sub>s</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Patocka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2016b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2016c</xref>) and the ability of this approach to resolve real time kinetics of cAMP generation with high sensitivity in intact cells. The 5-HTRs from each individual schistosome species were transiently transfected into a stable HEK293 cell line expressing the cAMP reporter and luminescence values monitored during addition of 5-HT. Each of the GPCRs responded to the addition of 5-HT with a rapid elevation in luminescence values (~70–110 fold increase, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) with sensitivity in the low nanomolar range for Sj.5HTR and Sh.5HTR (EC<sub>50</sub> = 3.0 ± 0.3, 3.6 ± 0.3 nM) and 76 ± 1 nM for Sm.5HTR<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To facilitate high-throughput drug screening of these targets, dual stable cell lines expressing both the cAMP reporter and individual 5-HTR clones were derived and individual lines evaluated based on performance in a 384-well format.

Based on the results from the natural product screen, an expanded series of ergot alkaloid ligands was sourced for structure-activity screening (‘SAR by commerce’). Complete dose-response relationships were performed for twenty compounds containing the tetracyclic ergoline skeleton (5 compounds from the primary screen plus 15 commercially sourced ligands) against all three schistosome 5.HTRs (Sm.5HTR<sub>L</sub>, Sh.5HTR and Sj.5HTR).</p><p>Ergot alkaloid interactions with the schistosome 5-HTRs spanned a range of effects. To summarize these actions, agonist efficacy (relative to peak levels of 5-HT evoked cAMP generation) and antagonist potency (pKi) were represented as heat-maps where increasingly intense coloration represents higher efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Several features of this dataset merit comment. First, these representations convey a shared responsiveness across the three 5-HTRs to tested ligands, suggesting a conservation of pharmacological profile between the 5-HTR orthologs from the different schistosome species. This is important if any putative lead compounds are to be broad spectrum, that is effective against each of the major infective strains. Second, the data evidence a broad spectrum of potencies and efficacies within the ergot alkaloid series evidencing full agonists (for example, compound ‘1’ ergotamine, ‘2’ dihydroergotamine), partial agonists (compound ‘3’, lisuride), antagonists (compounds ‘16’ terguride, ‘19’, bromocriptine, ‘20’ 2-bromo-LSD) as well as closely related ‘inactive’ compounds (compound ‘14’, α-ergocryptine). Third, marked changes in efficacy and inhibitory potency resulted from minimal structural modifications to the core scaffold. For example, hydrogenation of the D9-10 double bond of lisuride (compound ‘3’) eliminated efficacy to yield the antagonist terguride (compound ‘16’, IC<sub>50</sub> = 400 ± 50 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The partial agonist LSD (compound ‘6’) is converted into a potent antagonist (IC<sub>50</sub> = 100 ± 20 nM) on bromination at the B2 indol ring position (2-Bromo-LSD, compound ‘20’). Distinct structural modifications impacting efficacy could be seen in an ergopeptine series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), through comparison of the chemical structures of ergotamine (compound ‘1’), a potent full agonist at each schistosome receptor (E<sub>max</sub>95 ± 4, 96 ± 5 and 114 ± 3% of 5-HT for Sm.5HTR<sub>L</sub>, Sh.5HTR and Sj.5HTR, respectively), the inactive α-ergocryptine (compound ‘14’) and bromocriptine (compound’ 19) which acted as a potent blocker (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.6 ± 0.4 µM) of Sm.5HTR<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

First, ergotamine treatment significantly reduced worm burden from 28 ± 8 worm pairs per mouse to 9 ± 6 worm pairs per mouse (~65% reduction, p&lt;0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Next, egg counts were performed. Eggs deposited within the mesenteric system progress through the intestinal mucosa for excretion from the host, thereby propagating the parasite life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pellegrino and Faria, 1965</xref>). Therefore, it is possible to determine whether drug treatment impacted parasite egg laying by counting eggs in sections of the large and small intestines. Control mice contained large numbers of viable eggs in both the small and large intestine. However, treatment with either ergotamine or PZQ resulted in a considerable reduction (96.3 ± 1.2 and 99.9 ± 0.1%, respectively) in intestinal egg burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We also assessed whether serotonergic manipulation influenced egg laying in worms cultured ex vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Egg laying was decreased following treatment with ergotamine (1 µM, 54.2 ± 12.6% reduction), serotonin (100 µM, 82.4 ± 2.2% reduction) or forskolin (100 µM, 61.6 ± 12.6% reduction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B&amp;C</xref>). Eggs laid by ergotamine treated worms were often small and deformed, indicating abnormal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We conclude ergotamine was highly effective at blocking parasite egg production and development.</p><p>Next, liver and spleen sizes were measured. A consequence of the enormous production of schistosome eggs is a host Th2 wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grzych et al., 1991</xref>) that drives granuloma formation and fibrosis in affected peritoneal organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pearce and MacDonald, 2002</xref>). Hepatosplenomegaly is a hallmark of chronic schistosomiasis and splenomegaly and liver fibrosis are observed in the murine model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fallon, 2000</xref>). This is reflected by comparison of the weights of uninfected mouse spleens (0.12 ± 0.02 g) and the spleens of infected littermates (~6 fold enlargement, weighing 0.76 ± 0.20 g at 49 days p.i), or increases in liver mass (~2 fold enlargement from 2.0 ± 0.3 g in uninfected mice to 4.8 ± 0.8 g in infected mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). PZQ treatment (one week, starting at 42 days p.i) did not prevent spleen and liver enlargement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). There was no difference in the weights of the liver and spleen between PZQ-treated and vehicle treated infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). This is likely due to the fact that, while PZQ is highly effective at eliminating worms at six weeks infection and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sabah et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keiser et al., 2009</xref>), sexual maturation and egg laying commence as early as 5 weeks post infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sabah et al., 1986</xref>), meaning that eggs deposited prior to treatment initiation still evoke an immune response which PZQ exposure does not ameliorate. In contrast to PZQ, ergotamine exposure prevented hepatosplenomegaly. Ergotamine reduced the infection-promoted increase in spleen mass by 55.8 ± 14.0% and liver mass by 52.0 ± 14.2% relative to vehicle treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>).

Movat's stain and Masson’s trichrome showed decreased levels of collagen deposition surrounding granulomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,II–III</xref>).

It is well established that the host pathology of schistosomiasis infection is driven by an initial Th1 response to the worms themselves followed by a sustained Th2 response that drives egg-induced fibrosis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pearce and MacDonald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wynn et al., 2004</xref>]).

The identity of transcripts changing with drug treatment (either with PZQ or with ergotamine treatment versus control infections) largely overlapped with those changing with infection (uninfected animals versus control infections) but as expected drug-treatment was associated with a decrease of transcripts up-regulated in control infections (relative to uninfected animals) or an increase of transcripts down-regulated in control infections (relative to uninfected animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Specifically, PZQ or ergotamine treatment decreased expression of pathways associated with host immune response to either parasites (acute phase response signaling, Th1 and Th2 pathway) or bacteria entering the circulation with the breakdown of the intestinal epithelium that occurs with heavy parasite egg production ultimately leading to host death (LPS/IL-1 mediated inhibition of RXR function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feingold et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2005</xref>]). Expression of pathways associated with drug metabolism (xenobiotic metabolism signaling) and liver function (hepatic cholestasis) increased with both treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These observations that the PZQ and ergotamine cohorts shared similar transcriptional patterns relative to control infection is consistent with both treatments resolving infection and parasite egg production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we sought to filter the transcriptomic dataset to identify transcriptional changes unique to ergotamine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). This involved selecting transcripts that (i) displayed significant changes between uninfected and control infection cohorts, and (ii) were differentially expressed between control infection and ergotamine-treated cohorts, and (iii) showed little change between control infection and praziquantel treated cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Ingenuity pathway analysis using this triple-filtered criteria identified a cohort of transcripts uniquely associated with ergotamine, but not PZQ, treatment. These transcripts were tagged for involvement in hepatic fibrosis and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation (p-value 0.00015, Fisher's exact test). Ergotamine treatment down-regulated gene products associated with HSC activation to control infections, while PZQ treatment had little to no effect on the same suite of transcripts. HSCs represent a quiescent, non-proliferative cell population in normal liver but once activated during injury or disease, drive fibrotic responses by transforming into proliferative, contractile myofibroblasts that deposit extracellular matrix components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsuchida and Friedman, 2017</xref>). Differentially expressed transcripts in ergotamine-treated samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) included known markers of HSC activation responsible for extracellular matrix production (<italic>COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1</italic>), transcripts associated with HSC contraction (<italic>CACNA1E, CACNA1H</italic>), migration (<italic>IGFBP3, RANTES</italic>), survival (<italic>IGFBP5, GAS6</italic>) and transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts (<italic>MMP13, GLI1, PAK1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>).

However, unlike PZQ, ergotamine was also effective at attenuating the hepatosplenomegaly associated with the chronic pathology of schistosomiasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–G</xref>), due to decreased activation of profibrotic HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Given the importance of serotonergic signaling in parasite physiology, the possibility of serotonergic drugs providing effective antiparasitic agents has long been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mansour, 1979</xref>). With a defined molecular target (a prevalent schistosome 5-HTR cloned from each of the main species that cause schistosomiasis) and an optimized functional profiling assay for this GPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we have now been able to investigate this possibility. Here, we screened thousands of compounds in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and interpolated structure-activity studies on promising chemical series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These cell-based assays yielded candidates for ex vivo screening against adult parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and thereby prioritization of the most active compounds for in vivo testing in a mouse model of schistosomiasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This pipeline identified unique properties of ergotamine, an ergot alkaloid first isolated 100 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hofmann, 1978</xref>) and FDA-approved medication for migraine, for treating schistosomiasis. Ergotamine increased survival in a murine model of schistosomiasis through reductions in parasite burden and resultant egg load, but most intriguingly resolved inflammatory damage caused by schistosome eggs laid in host tissues, an effect not observed with PZQ under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These effects likely result from the broad polypharmacology of ergotamine that coalesces a fortuitous combination of effects at both host and parasite GPCRs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Action on parasite</title><p>Ergotamine is a potent Sm.5HTR<sub>L</sub> agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Sm.5HTR<sub>L</sub> is downregulated upon pairing of adult <italic>S. mansoni</italic> females and males, implicating an additional role in sexual maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). As a G<sub>s</sub> coupled receptor, the role of 5-HT acting through cAMP to regulate flatworm metabolism is also relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mansour, 1984</xref>). These broad physiological roles - motor function, female egg production, metabolism – underscore consideration of Sm.5HTR<sub>L</sub> as an attractive antischistosomal target. Screening hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and subsequent structure-activity studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) confirmed the ergoline core as a customizable scaffold for ligand optimization at Sm.5HTR<sub>L</sub>. These analyses provided a toolbox of compounds with varied potencies and efficacies against Sm.5HTR<sub>L</sub>in vitro and Sm.5HTR<sub>L</sub> agonists and antagonists stimulated and inhibited adult worm motility ex vivo as predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However in vivo, only agonists of Sm.5HTR<sub>L</sub> signaling caused a hepatic shift of worms and mitigated worm burden, Sm.5HTR<sub>L</sub> blockers were ineffective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This observation was surprising given the presumed beneficial effect of causing potent (BOL-148) or long-lasting (bromocriptine) worm paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2016c</xref>), but nevertheless informative for future phenotypic screens to prioritize ‘hyperactive’ over ‘hypoactive’ serotoninergic hits. From these analyses, ergotamine emerged as a potent full agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) that stimulated movement ex vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and reduced worm and disease burden in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Action on host</title><p>While ergotamine stimulates schistosome movement through 5.HTRs, the drug also acts on host GPCR targets. Ergotamine is known to display a broad polypharmacology, interacting with numerous bioaminergic GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Connor and Roth, 2005</xref>). These interactions likely engage physiological responses that mitigate the damage caused by egg laying and possibly contribute to worm elimination. Acutely, ergotamine acts as a vasoconstrictor, including within the mesenteric vasculature where the adult worms reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mikkelsen et al., 1981</xref>). Disruption of the parasite environment consequent to ergotamine-evoked mechanical changes and alterations of blood flow within the hepatic portal system could drive parasites from the mesenteries to the liver for elimination. This action would mirror recent data demonstrating R-PZQ, which also causes a hepatic shift, acts a human 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor partial agonist that contracts host mesenteric vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2017</xref>). Chronically, drug treatment with either PZQ or ergotamine improved various aspects of liver function (hepatic cholestasis, retinol metabolism, bile acid synthesis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) relative to untreated infections. Beneficial changes highlighted by RNA-Seq also encompassed protection against intestinal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2010</xref>). Various pathways involved in response to bacterial infection were down regulated with PZQ and ergotamine treatment relative to control infections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This is likely because mice experience a relative infection burden orders of magnitude higher than typical for humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheever, 1969</xref>) resulting in compromised intestinal integrity and release of microbiota into the circulation as mature parasites commence egg production. These effects likely contribute to the observed lethality post-infection and are shown to be mitigated by both drug treatments in the RNA-Seq analysis.</p><p>However, ergotamine additionally provided protection against the spleen and liver enlargement that persisted in PZQ-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>), suggesting a further action of ergotamine on the host immune response. Analysis of RNA-Seq datasets identified transcriptional changes unique to ergotamine and not PZQ treatment, most notably a decrease in gene products involved in hepatic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–G</xref>). Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are key drivers of fibrosis during liver disease. Upon their transformation into myofibroblasts, HSCs initiate active production of extracellular matrix components (collagen, elastin – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,II-IV</xref>) and decrease lipid storage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,V</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsuchida and Friedman, 2017</xref>]). HSCs are known to express a portfolio of GPCRs that regulate activation and transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsuchida and Friedman, 2017</xref>). These include several serotonergic GPCRs (5HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5HT<sub>1F</sub>, 5HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5HT<sub>2B</sub>, 5HT<sub>7</sub>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ruddell et al., 2006</xref>]). It is tantalizing that the known polypharmacological signature of ergotamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Connor and Roth, 2005</xref>) closely matches the serotoninergic GPCR expression profile in HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ruddell et al., 2006</xref>). This may imply a cell-autonomous action of ergotamine on HSCs, although further insight would be needed to distinguish this possibility from non cell-autonomous mechanisms given that serotonin impacts immune responses and liver regeneration in a multiplicity of ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lesurtel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ebrahimkhani et al., 2011</xref>). For example, ergotamine could impair HSCs indirectly by inhibiting macrophage polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de las Casas-Engel et al., 2013</xref>) or immune mediators such as TNF-α and ICAM-1 (54). ICAM-1 is found at elevated levels within egg-evoked granulomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ritter and McKerrow, 1996</xref>) and TNF-α drives the host immune response to schistosome eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amiri et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leptak and McKerrow, 1997</xref>). Prior studies on schistosome infection of immune compromised mice have shown that T-cell deprived mice exhibit hepatic microvesicular steatosis, since granulomas also have a beneficial function of facilitating excretion of eggs from the mesenteries and sequestering toxic egg products (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hams et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doenhoff et al., 1986</xref>]). Ergotamine treatment impaired the granulomatous response to eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), but increased microvascular damage was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Additional experiments will be needed to investigate stellate cell responsiveness and whether ergotamine is effective against other parasitic diseases currently treated with PZQ.</p><p>While the polypharmacology of ergotamine evidences the principle of combining host and parasite responses for therapeutic effect, it is not itself a likely candidate for repurposing. Repeated dosing of ergotamine as an antimigraine therapy is associated with known side effects: it is contraindicated in pregnancy and poorly suited for the large pediatric population susceptible to schistosomiasis. For future studies, analogs with improved pharmacokinetic profile and bioavailability will need to be evaluated for clinical potential as safe and effective agents. Indeed, for treatment of parasitic infections, a single bolus dose may provide more flexibility and avoid cumulative side effects associated with repeated dosing. Our limited structural-activity studies to date (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) on schistosome GPCRs do suggest modifications of the core ergot alkaloid scaffold can generate analogs with a range of potencies and efficacy.</p><p>In conclusion, ergotamine is fortuitously suited to engage pathways in both host and parasite that are simultaneously deleterious to the blood fluke but beneficial to the infected host in terms of worm clearance and mitigation of damage caused by eggs. Rather than prioritizing ‘selective’ antiparasitic therapies with no host effects, these data demonstrate merit in evaluating agents with broader polypharmacology across parasite and host as a route to novel discovering effective treatments for parasitic disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line</td><td valign="bottom">HEK293 cells</td><td valign="bottom">Company</td><td valign="bottom">ATCC;

For hepatic shift assays, infections matured to 7 weeks, at which point mice were given test compounds by intraperitoneal injection and euthanized 3 hr later. Compounds were solubilized in 50 µL DMSO, and diluted in 200 µL 5% w/v Trappsol (Cyclodextrin Technologies Development, THPB-p-31g) in saline (NaCl 0.9%) solution. Immediately after being euthanized, mice were dissected to separate the liver from the portal vein, so that the number of worms recovered from the portal vein, mesenteric vasculature and liver could be recorded for each mouse. Hepatic shift assays were performed on at least 3 mice per drug treatment. Assays testing the curative efficacy of compounds against schistosome infections were performed on mice at 3 weeks post infection (immature parasites) and 6 weeks post infection (mature parasites). Drugs were dosed as follows. Ergotamine (60 mg/kg) was solubilized in 50 µL DMSO and diluted in 200 µL Trappsol-saline and delivered by intraperitoneal injection twice a day for one week. Praziquantel (50 mg/kg) was similarly solubilized and injected intraperitoneally once a day for one week. The negative control cohort was given twice daily injections of DMSO (50 µL) added to 200 µL Trappsol-saline solution. Mice were weighed and euthanized at 49 days post infection. Worms were harvested and counted as described for the hepatic shift assay. Spleen and livers were weighed, and a segment of intestine was excised from the most distal region of the rectum to 10 cm above the cecum. The small and large intestines were separated by cutting immediately above and below the cecum. Each was cut lengthwise to expose the lumen and thoroughly washed in NaCl (1.2%) to remove excrement. Intestines were laid flat with the intestinal mucosa facing upwards and clamped between two glass plates to allow visual inspection of egg morphology and number using a stereo microscope. Scored egg counts reflect ‘viable’ eggs containing a developing embryo or a mature miracidium, while empty egg shells and granulomas were not included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pellegrino and Faria, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mati and Melo, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Liver histology and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Mouse livers were removed immediately after animals were euthanized, rinsed in ice cold PBS, and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin.

After drug treatment from weeks 6–7 post infection, mice were euthanized and livers and spleens were immediately removed and placed on ice. For liver samples, a section of the larger, right lobe was excised and homogenized in TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). For spleen samples, the entire organ was homogenized in TRIzol. Samples were stored in −80°C until processed. Total RNA was extracted from TRIzol according to manufacturer’s protocols and quantified with RiboGreen RNA Assay Kit. Libraries were generated using the Clontech StrandedRNA Pico Mammalian kit and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 system (high-output mode, 50 bp paired-end reads) at a depth of approximately 20 million reads/sample. Trimmed reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10/GRCm38) using HISAT2. Expression was quantified using featureCounts (read counts) and cuffquant (FPKM). EdgeR was used to identify differentially expressed genes (tagwise dispersion model, adjusted p-value&lt;0.05) which were processed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen) and DAVID functional annotation tool (version 6.8).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wenhui Li as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ray Pierce (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the absence of vaccines and in light of the very limited repertoire of available treatments, the search for new drugs against schistosomiasis is a priority. Chan et al. report here an elegant and creative approach that led to an interesting set of findings on a target-based screen of a <italic>Schistosoma</italic> serotoninergic GPCR receptor. Ergotamine is identified as an agonist hit that negatively influences worm movement. In a mouse model ergotamine decreases mortality of schistosome-infected mice, parasite number, and egg load. At the same time ergotamine treatment also reduces organ pathology in the mouse liver through the engagement of host GPCRs, which suppress the activation of hepatic stellate cells as well as inflammatory damage and fibrosis. Based on high quality data, the authors conclude that ergotamine exerts dual affects by targeting host and parasite GPCRs with a deleterious outcome for the parasite and a beneficial effect for the host.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Ergotamine is an alkaloid that shares structural similarity with neurotransmitters like dopamine. Acting as an agonist, this drug leads to vasoconstriction and is mainly prescribed for patients suffering from migraines. However, contraindications comprise among others hepatic disease, pregnancy, and the age of patients – such as preschoolers. Since schistosomiasis mainly affects children, including preschoolers, and since it is also a hepatic disease, how safe or how problematic could this drug be for a patient?</p><p>According to the Mayo Clinic recommendations (last update: March 01, 2017), 1 – 2 mg are recommended for adults. In case no side effects occur, a second and even a third dose can be taken; however, the doses should be taken at least 30 minutes apart, and should not exceed 3 mg per day. Ergotamine should not be taken by very young children (&lt; 6 years). And from 6 years on, or older, 1 mg is recommended with a maximum of 3 mg a day along with the restriction that this drug should not be taken by children more often than 2 times a week, at least five days apart. Against the background of these facts and the animal data from this study (60 mg/kg twice daily for one week in the mouse model), the low bioavailability in human (2%, when given as tablet; PMCID: PMC1428366), and the short half time of 2 – 3 hours (https://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/rn/113-15-5), how realistic are the chances for ergotamine to become a drug repurposed for schistosomiasis?</p><p>The potential problems that may arise with the repurposing of this drug and the extensive clinical testing in the context of treatment for schistosomiasis should be addressed in the Discussion.</p><p>2) The antiparasitic effect of ergotamine was accompanied by a marked apparent improvement in the pathological effects of infection on the host. The observed reduction in liver and spleen size and the improvement in liver morphology was found to correlate with an ergotamine-specific effect on hepatic stellate cells, and hence on liver fibrosis. A marked reduction in granuloma size and liver fibrosis is seen in congenitally athymic mice. However, in the case of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection, this leads to increased mortality and fewer eggs passed into the feces (Cheever et al., Am J Trop Med Hyg, 1993, 48:496-503). Byram and von Lichtenberg (Am J Trop Med Hyg, 1977, 26:944-56) suggested that the deficient granuloma formation led to failure to sequester toxic egg products, resulting in hepatocellular damage. Although smaller, the livers of ergotamine-treated, infected mice do not seem normal (Figure 5D) and have a darker color, even than control infected or PZQ-treated mice. Further, the picrosirius red-stained histological sections (Figure 5G) could be complemented with other staining methods to determine whether any hepatocyte necrosis is visible. It is important to show that the ergotamine effect on the host response is really beneficial.</p><p>3) Do these compounds (e.g., ergotamine) have activity against other schistosome stages (schistosomules, juveniles). Those experiments could be done ex vivo for a start, and subsequently in vivo. This issue is an important one, as juvenile worms (2-4 weeks p.i.) are refractory to PZQ. The issue should at least be discussed. Also do these compounds have activity in motility assays (or, even better, in vivo) against other species of schistosomes? Based on the data in Figure 3, one would expect they would, but it would be nice to know.</p><p>4) Why is mouse survival lower in ergotamine-treated than in PZQ-treated infected mice despite the ameliorating effects of ergotamine on pathology.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Coalescing beneficial host and deleterious antiparasitic actions as an antischistosomal strategy&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Wenhui Li (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed by editing the text before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In their revised version, Chan et al. addressed a number of points raised by the reviewers.</p><p>With respect to my former comment that: &quot;contraindications comprise among others hepatic disease, pregnancy, and the age of patients – such as preschoolers. Since schistosomiasis mainly affects children, including preschoolers, and since it is also a hepatic disease, how safe or how problematic could this drug be for a patient?&quot; the authors responded that they &quot;acknowledge the side effect profile of ergotamine and agree in the absence of preclinical data that speculation upon the human repurposing potential of ergotamine as a treatment is premature. […] We have therefore removed previous text speculating on the repurposing potential of ergotamine throughout the manuscript text. Additionally, we note: (i) our SAR studies (Figure 3) underscore the potential for manipulation of the core ergot alkaloid pharmacophore to develop analogs with varied efficacy, and potentially improved PK/PD, (ii) treatment of parasitic diseases with a single bolus dose of drug may provide more flexibility than dosing parameters established on the basis of cumulative side effects from repeated drug dosing.&quot;</p><p>In their marked version, however, it is not possible to follow these deletions since appropriate positions have not been marked as deleted within the text. Please indicate the &quot;removed previous text speculating&quot; clearly. Furthermore, I miss comments within the manuscript with respect to &quot;the potential for manipulation of the core ergot alkaloid pharmacophore to develop analogs with varied efficacy, and potentially improved PK/PD&quot;. The chapter &quot;Structural determinates of activity at schistosome 5-HTRs&quot; ends with &quot; ergotamine (compound '1) as the most potent, full agonist and 2-Bromo-LSD (compound '20') as the most potent antagonist for further evaluation.&quot; Unfortunately, also the Discussion fails to discuss this point critically.

Acting as an agonist, this drug leads to vasoconstriction and is mainly prescribed for patients suffering from migraines. However, contraindications comprise among others hepatic disease, pregnancy, and the age of patients – such as preschoolers. Since schistosomiasis mainly affects children, including preschoolers, and since it is also a hepatic disease, how safe or how problematic could this drug be for a patient?</p><p>According to the Mayo Clinic recommendations (last update: March 01, 2017), 1 – 2 mg are recommended for adults. In case no side effects occur, a second and even a third dose can be taken; however, the doses should be taken at least 30 minutes apart, and should not exceed 3 mg per day. Ergotamine should not be taken by very young children (&lt; 6 years). And from 6 years on, or older, 1 mg is recommended with a maximum of 3 mg a day along with the restriction that this drug should not be taken by children more often than 2 times a week, at least five days apart. Against the background of these facts and the animal data from this study (60 mg/kg twice daily for one week in the mouse model), the low bioavailability in human (2%, when given as tablet; PMCID: PMC1428366), and the short half time of 2 - – 3 hours (https://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/rn/113-15-5), how realistic are the chances for ergotamine to become a drug repurposed for schistosomiasis?</p><p>The potential problems that may arise with the repurposing of this drug and the extensive clinical testing in the context of treatment for schistosomiasis should be addressed in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the side effect profile of ergotamine and agree in the absence of preclinical data that speculation upon the human repurposing potential of ergotamine as a treatment is premature. Backing up, we believe our contribution in the context of academic drug-discovery is validation of new parasite targets and the discovery of new treatment strategies (drugs to engage both parasite and host responses, rather than just parasite-selective ligands), and would rather highlight our findings with ergotamine in this context. We have therefore removed previous text speculating on the repurposing potential of ergotamine throughout the manuscript text. Additionally, we note: (i) our SAR studies (Figure 3) underscore the potential for manipulation of the core ergot alkaloid pharmacophore to develop analogs with varied efficacy, and potentially improved PK/PD, (ii) treatment of parasitic diseases with a single bolus dose of drug may provide more flexibility than dosing parameters established on the basis of cumulative side effects from repeated drug dosing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The antiparasitic effect of ergotamine was accompanied by a marked apparent improvement in the pathological effects of infection on the host. The observed reduction in liver and spleen size and the improvement in liver morphology was found to correlate with an ergotamine-specific effect on hepatic stellate cells, and hence on liver fibrosis. A marked reduction in granuloma size and liver fibrosis is seen in congenitally athymic mice. However, in the case of S. mansoni infection, this leads to increased mortality and fewer eggs passed into the feces (Cheever et al., Am J Trop Med Hyg, 1993, 48:496-503). Byram and von Lichtenberg (Am J Trop Med Hyg, 1977, 26:944-56) suggested that the deficient granuloma formation led to failure to sequester toxic egg products, resulting in hepatocellular damage. Although smaller, the livers of ergotamine-treated, infected mice do not seem normal (Figure 5D) and have a darker color, even than control infected or PZQ-treated mice. Further, the picrosirius red-stained histological sections (Figure 5G) could be complemented with other staining methods to determine whether any hepatocyte necrosis is visible. It is important to show that the ergotamine effect on the host response is really beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree completely with these comments highlighting the multifaceted role of immune response to schistosome infection. As the reviewers point out, the granuloma may serve beneficial functions sequestering toxic egg components in the liver and facilitating egg transport across the intestinal mucosa for fecal excretion. If ergotamine treatment were to have deleterious effects, mimicking the scenario with T-cell deficient mice, we would expect to observe hepatocyte microvesicular steatosis and eggs accruing in the intestine (Doenhoff et al., 1986).</p><p>In the revised manuscript we have therefore expanded our histological analyses of control and drug-treated livers as suggested (Figure 6G, new text in the third paragraph of the subsection “In vivo efficacy of ergotamine”, new Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and 4). We agree that the gross appearance of ergotamine-treated livers is not identical to uninfected livers, but the expanded histology, taken together with the RNA-seq data, indicate that they do much more closely resemble the uninfected state than PZQ-treated samples. These data show that ergotamine treatment results in decreased liver collagen staining, decreased elastin staining, decreased lipid loss and no elevation in caspase activation relative to both infected and PZQ-treated samples (Figure 6G, Figure 6—figure supplement 2). As the reviewers note, impairing granuloma formation could have deleterious effects. However, histology does not reveal hepatocyte damage or obvious microvesicular steatosis in the livers of ergotamine treated mice that exceeds that already present in control infections (Figure 6—figure supplement 4). However, it is the case that all infected livers – from DMSO, ergotamine and praziquantel treated mice – exhibit pathology such as increased white blood cells and occasional slight “foaminess” within hepatocytes. Our proposed model of ergotamine inhibition of pro-fibrotic HSC activation would not necessarily replicate models of ablated host T-cell response, which show blockage of egg passage across the intestinal barrier. We did not find that ergotamine treatment resulted in an accrual of intestinal eggs (Figure 6C), but we also cannot state that this is due to functional immune-meditated transport since it likely largely reflects impaired egg production due to decreased worm burden (Figure 6B) and impaired egg development (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). These data, as well as the increased survival of ergotamine-treated animals, do not indicate that host pathology is worsened with ergotamine treatment. Figure 6 has been expanded and two additional figure supplements (Figure 6—figure supplements 2 and 4) have been added to reflect the additional histology performed. New text discussing these data has also been added (in the aforementioned subsection and subsection “Action on host”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Do these compounds (e.g., ergotamine) have activity against other schistosome stages (schistosomules, juveniles). Those experiments could be done</italic> ex vivo <italic>for a start, and subsequently</italic> in vivo<italic>. This issue is an important one, as juvenile worms (2-4 weeks p.i.) are refractory to PZQ. The issue should at least be discussed. Also do these compounds have activity in motility assays (or, even better,</italic> in vivo<italic>) against other species of schistosomes? Based on the data in Figure 3, one would expect they would, but it would be nice to know.</italic></p><p>We now provide both ex vivo and in vivo data to address this point in the revised manuscript. Figure 6—figure supplement 3 shows that ergotamine and 5-HT stimulate movement of juvenile worms ex vivo (Figure 6—figure supplement 3A and B). However in vivo, ergotamine – like PZQ – was ineffective at clearing infections (Figure 6—figure supplement 3C). Artemether was used as a positive control. These data suggest refractoriness to ergotamine at the juvenile stage of infection is not due to a lack of effect on the worms themselves. New text discussing these data has also been added (subsection “In vivo efficacy of ergotamine”, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why is mouse survival lower in ergotamine-treated than in PZQ-treated infected mice despite the ameliorating effects of ergotamine on pathology.</p></disp-quote><p>Our in vivo work (Figure 6A) represents analysis of a single window of treatment (day 42-49) on survival over a subsequent 8 week period (to day 105). We expect that the remaining worm burden in mice sacrificed after 7 weeks reinitiates pathology over the subsequent monitoring period to cause the small extent of observed mortality.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed by editing the text before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In their revised version, Chan et al. addressed a number of points raised by the reviewers.</p><p>With respect to my former comment that: &quot;contraindications comprise among others hepatic disease, pregnancy, and the age of patients – such as preschoolers.

The chapter &quot;Structural determinates of activity at schistosome 5-HTRs&quot; ends with &quot; ergotamine (compound '1) as the most potent, full agonist and 2-Bromo-LSD (compound '20') as the most potent antagonist for further evaluation.&quot; Unfortunately, also the Discussion fails to discuss this point critically.

This new text makes clear the challenges with ergotamine as a repurposing candidate itself, which is not the intended implication of this study: ergotamine simply illustrates the potential benefit of coalescing beneficial host actions (on stellate cells) with deleterious antiparasitic activity in eliminating worms and mitigating their pathological effects.
