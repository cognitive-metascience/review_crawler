downstream targets remain. Here, we evaluate the dynamics of cerebellar interpositus nucleus (IpN) neurons over the course of Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning. A diverse range of learning-induced neuronal responses was observed, including increases and decreases in activity during the generation of conditioned blinks. Trial-by-trial correlational analysis and optogenetic manipulation demonstrate that facilitation in the IpN drives the eyelid movements. Adaptive facilitatory responses are often preceded by acquired transient inhibition of IpN activity that, based on latency and effect, appear to be driven by complex spikes in cerebellar cortical Purkinje cells. Likewise, during reflexive blinks to periocular stimulation, IpN cells show excitation-suppression patterns that suggest a contribution of climbing fibers and their collaterals. These findings highlight the integrative properties of subcortical neurons at the cerebellar output stage mediating conditioned behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cortical subcortical communication</kwd><kwd>eyeblink conditioning</kwd><kwd>cerebellar nuclei</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH093727</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medina</surname><given-names>Javier F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1MH114269</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medina</surname><given-names>Javier F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AA025572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medina</surname><given-names>Javier F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Zhenyu</given-names></name><name><surname>De Zeeuw</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Zeeuw</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Conditioned olivocerebellar network activity elicits transient spike pauses and timed spike facilitation in the neurons of interposed nuclei that predicts and likely causes conditioned eyelid responses on a trial-by-trial basis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cerebellar cortex, like the neocortex, is well suited for establishing new associations required during memory formation. It is becoming increasingly clear that, like cortical and subcortical structures (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Constantinople and Bruno, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Koralek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Igarashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Douglas et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sherman and Guillery, 2004</xref>), the cerebellar cortex and nuclei exhibit complex interplay, for instance through reciprocal nucleo-cortical projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). Classical Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning has proven an ideal model for studying the neural mechanisms underlying associative learning, and offers a suitable paradigm to address the question of how the cerebellar nuclei integrate their cerebellar cortical and extra-cerebellar input.</p><p>As a simple and quintessential behavioral manifestation of learning and memory, eyeblink conditioning depends on the cerebellar cortex and nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McCormick et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McCormick and Thompson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yeo et al., 1985a1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">1985b</xref>), which are known to facilitate processes that require precise timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ivry and Keele, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Breska and Ivry, 2016</xref>). In short, animals learn to respond to a neutral conditional stimulus (CS), such as a light, with a well-timed conditioned blink response (CR), when the CS is consistently paired at a fixed temporal interval with an unconditional blink-eliciting stimulus (US), such as a corneal air puff. Lobule HVI of the cerebellar cortex and its downstream target, the interposed nucleus (IpN), are essential for the manifestation of this conditioned eyelid behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McCormick et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McCormick and Thompson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yeo et al., 1985a1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">1985b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Krupa and Thompson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ohyama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mostofi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heiney et al., 2014b</xref>). Genetic and pharmacological manipulations of cerebellar cortical Purkinje cells indicate that the expression of CRs may require various cell physiological processes, including plasticity at the excitatory parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ito and Kano, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Koekkoek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schonewille et al., 2010</xref>), inhibition at the molecular layer interneuron to Purkinje cell synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">ten Brinke et al., 2015</xref>), as well as intrinsic mGluR7-mediated processes in Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Johansson et al., 2015</xref>). IpN neurons that can drive eyeblink behavior through the red nucleus and facial nucleus provide a feedback to the cerebellar cortex that amplifies the CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Giovannucci et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, IpN neurons receive excitatory inputs from mossy fiber and climbing fiber collaterals, which need to be integrated with the inhibitory inputs from the Purkinje cells and local interneurons and possibly even from recurrent collaterals of the nucleo-olivary neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan-Palay, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan-Palay, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Zeeuw et al., 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Van der Want et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Uusisaari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Uusisaari and Knöpfel, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagnall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kodama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Witter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Najac and Raman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canto et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>IpN neurons and their inputs are endowed with ample forms of plasticity, all of which may in principle be implicated in eyeblink conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ohyama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Foscarin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zheng and Raman, 2010</xref>). These include for example short-term and long-term potentiation (LTP) at the mossy fiber to IpN neuron synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Person and Raman, 2010</xref>), both of which may facilitate the induction of intrinsic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aizenman and Linden, 1999</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aizenman and Linden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zheng and Raman, 2010</xref>), and learning-dependent structural outgrowth of mossy fiber collaterals in the cerebellar nuclei, which may be directly correlated to the rate and amplitude of CRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boele et al., 2013</xref>). So far, extracellular recordings of neurons in the cerebellar nuclei have revealed CR-related increases in activity that lead the eyeblink movement (anterior IpN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McCormick and Thompson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berthier and Moore, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gould and Steinmetz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi and Moore, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Halverson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heiney et al., 2014b</xref>), and CR-related increases and decreases in activity that lag the eyeblink movement (posterior IpN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gruart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Delgado-García and Gruart, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sánchez-Campusano et al., 2007</xref>). However, comprehensive trial-by-trial analysis of different components of IpN modulation in relation to conditioned behavior, as well as evaluation against conditioning-related modulation of activity in the cerebellar cortex and other non-cortical inputs, is lacking.</p><p>Here, we recorded conditioning-related activity in an identified blink area of the anterior interpositus nucleus of awake behaving mice, and used in-depth trial-by-trial correlational analysis, optogenetic manipulation and computationally modeled IpN output based on previously reported eyelid-related Purkinje cell modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">ten Brinke et al., 2015</xref>) to detail and cement the causal role of IpN activity in conditioned behavior. Our results reveal an intricate dynamic modulation of cerebellar nuclei activity during the generation of conditioned movements. We discuss how these findings shed light on a number of electrophysiological properties of the olivocerebellar network as integrated at the IpN in the normal functional context of eyeblink conditioning in awake, behaving mice. Together, our results highlight how neurons in the IpN integrate cortical and non-cortical input to establish a circuitry optimally designed to generate well-timed conditioned motor responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of cerebellar IpN neurons</title><p>To explore the characteristics of IpN spike modulation and its relation to conditioned eyelid behavior, we made extracellular recordings across 19 mice that were trained or in training.

Thus, rather than focusing on the course of training and across-trial variability, the recordings of the second dataset served to capture cerebellar nuclear dynamics in an optimally and fully conditioned system (for an overview of the two different datasets, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In subsequent analyses, we focused on three relevant time intervals during stimulus presentation: the last 200 ms of the CS-US interval, during which broad Purkinje cell simple spike modulation takes place; 50–130 ms after the CS, during which CS-related climbing fiber activity emerges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ohmae and Medina, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">ten Brinke et al., 2015</xref>); and the first 60 ms after the US, during which robust climbing fiber signals take place (the data structure in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref> contains these variables for both datasets).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>IpN facilitation but not suppression can drive conditioned eyelid behavior</title><p>We first sought to characterize whether facilitation and suppression observed in IpN neurons during the last 200 ms of the CS-US interval correlates with the amplitude of eyelid closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

A cluster of markedly positive correlations can be seen in the upper triangle of the matrix in the second half of the CS-US interval, running parallel to the diagonal. This means the strongest across-trial correlations occurred between spiking and subsequent behavior.

Additionally, cells with stronger suppression showed higher spike irregularity (i.e., higher CVs: r = 0.587, p=0.0038, Spearman). Compared to facilitation, suppression had lower amplitudes (baseline z-score: 5.3 ± 1.5 vs 7.6 ± 4.7, p=0.0007, Mann-Whitney U test, MWU) and lower durations (53 ± 38.4 vs 95.5 ± 36.2 ms, p=0.0012, MWU), but similar onset (132 ± 21.2 vs 136.5 ± 19.9 ms, p=0.6, MWU) and modulation peak times (176 ± 37.2 vs 166 ± 34.2 ms, p=0.6, MWU). Relative spike suppression was further correlated to eyelid closure at US-onset relative to baseline for all recordings of suppressive cells with conditioned behavior (n = 16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).

Although the second dataset showed stronger facilitation than the first dataset (59.2 ± 38.1 vs 30.1 ± 25.3 Hz, p=0.0009, MWU), arguably due to superior CR performance (mean percentage CRs: 86.2 ± 17.3%; mean CR amplitude: 43.5 ± 17% eyelid closure), the level of suppression was not different between the two datasets (11.9 ± 5 Hz vs 12.9 ± 6.4 Hz, p=0.864, MWU). Moreover, the correlation matrices for eyelid position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref>) and velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) echo-ed the finding that the time difference between suppressive modulation and eyelid movement was not significantly different from zero on average (6.9 ± 25 ms, p=0.2439, Wilcoxon signed rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>).</p><p>Together, these results, found across two independent datasets, reveal a large portion of IpN cells showing spike facilitation during the CS-US interval that predicts subsequent conditioned eyelid behavior.

To further establish the causal role of IpN facilitation in the expression of specifically conditioned eyelid behavior, we employed optogenetic inhibition of the IpN in a set of three fully trained mice. Optic fibers were implanted near the IpN of L7cre-Ai27 mice, in which ChR2 was expressed in all Purkinje cells (see Materials and methods). During optogenetic excitation of Purkinje cell axon terminals, IpN neurons suppress their firing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Witter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canto et al., 2016</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). If excitatory rather than suppressive modulation in the IpN plays a causal role in driving the CRs, CRs should be selectively eliminated by optogenetic stimulation.

We therefore analyzed the spike modulation during the US epoch and searched for the modulation pattern indicative for an imprint of the US evoked complex spike activation. Interestingly, 10.6 ± 4.7 ms after US onset we found a marked increase in IpN spikes (99 ± 59 Hz), which exceeded five baseline SDs in 211 cells of the first dataset (78.2%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>, see Materials and methods). This IpN response, here referred to as a US peak, had two important features: First, US peak amplitude, measured from baseline, diminished over the course of training, as apparent from a comparison of recordings made in the first four training days and those made subsequently (88 ± 48 vs. 29 ± 44 Hz, p&lt;0.0001, MWU; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Second, US peak amplitude correlated negatively with conditioned behavior, in terms of both CR percentage (r = −0.426, p&lt;0.0001, n = 270, Spearman) and CR amplitude at US onset (r = −0.333, p&lt;0.0001, n = 270, Spearman), confirming its reduction as conditioned behavior is acquired. Furthermore, among 62 recordings with a US peak and CR behavior, trial-by-trial correlations revealed 13 cells in which US peak amplitude correlated negatively to CR amplitude (p&lt;0.0001, bootstrap with 500 repetitions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These significant recordings were twice as likely as the other 49 cells to also show significant positive correlations between CR amplitude and CS-US facilitation (69.2% (9/13) versus 36.7% (18/49), p=0.0077, Fisher test), which itself was three times as likely to occur in cells with US peak compared to those without (26.1% (55/211) vs. 5/59, 8.5% (5/59), p=0.007, Fisher test). Together, these results establish a substantial prevalence of US peak responses in the IpN, demonstrate their co-occurrence with conditioning-related facilitation and spike-eyelid correlations in the CS-US interval, and show cell- and trial-wide conditioning-related dynamics that are similar to those of US-related climbing fiber responses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28132.012</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>US peak and pause responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average spike traces for cells showing a US peak but not a US pause response (n = 134); left panel shows activity in the CS-US interval aligned to baseline, right panel shows post-US activity aligned to the last 50 ms of the CS-US interval.

We analyzed the Purkinje cell data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">ten Brinke et al. (2015)</xref> to see if eyelid opening responses were related to US-complex spikes. Indeed, across trials where mice opened their eye further in the CS-US interval, those without a US-related complex spike showed slightly more eyelid opening (−2.65 ± 1.85%) than those with a US-complex spike (−0.84 ± 1.86%, p=0.0254, MWU; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).

The latency of this response, referred to as the US pause, fits with the idea of climbing fiber input inhibiting the cerebellar nuclei indirectly via Purkinje cell complex spikes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hoebeek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this notion, the majority of cells that showed a CS pause also showed a US pause (86%, vs. 105/263 (40%), p=0.0012, Fisher’s exact test). We found considerable overlap in the prevalence of US peaks and pauses: a third of the cells showing the one response also showed the other (77 out of 239, 32.2%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Additionally, cells with only a US pause tended to be more dorsally located (1939 ± 299 μm) than cells with only a US peak (2182 ± 373 μm), and cells that showed both responses averaged an intermediate depth (2075 ± 322 μm; p=0.0025, Kruskal-Wallis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). In terms of conditioning-related dynamics, the US pause showed characteristics that were similar to those of US peaks. Across the first four training days, 47.1% of cells (66/140) showed a US pause, compared to 30% (39/130) on subsequent training days in the first dataset (p=0.0057, Chi-square test). Moreover, further into training (day 5+), the US pause showed lower magnitudes than those observed on earlier days (−13 ± 30.3 vs −28.8 ± 30.4 Hz, resp., p=0.0018, MWU). Furthermore, on a trial-by-trial basis, 4 out of 41 recordings with a US pause and at least 20% CRs showed deeper pauses in trials with worse behavior (p=0.0017, bootstrap with 500 repetitions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Note that, as with the US peak, US pauses were observed less frequently in the second dataset (23.5%). These findings establish a transient post-US suppressive response that is observed most reliably in conditions associated with climbing fiber-driven complex spikes in Purkinje cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>US pauses are followed by fast excitatory responses in IpN neurons after conditioning</title><p>In addition to the US peak and pause responses, 83 IpN cells in the first dataset showed a rapid excitatory response that peaked at 46 ± 7 ms and showed magnitudes of 61.4 ± 28.3 Hz (39.4%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, arrow), which we refer to as the second US peak.

Our findings, consistent across two independent datasets, together characterize cerebellar cortico-nuclear integration as a multi-faceted process involving the impact of common afferents. The data suggest that the dynamic modulation of activity in the IpN during the generation of conditioned eyelid movements can be affected through a learned Purkinje cell simple spike suppression on the one hand, and through climbing fiber mediated Purkinje cell complex spike activity, possibly in tandem with activation of mossy fiber and climbing fiber collaterals, on the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28132.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Eyelid-related modulation in cerebellar cortex and nuclei.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean spike traces for simple and complex spikes in Purkinje cells and IpN spike show how eyelid-related cerebellar cortical and nuclear modulation relate after training.

In all, the comprehensive trial-by-trial correlational analysis reported here confirms the leading nature of facilitation in IpN cells, in terms of the temporal profiles of modulation as well as the temporal distribution of spike-eyelid correlations. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of Purkinje cells, which was shown to suppress the activity of cerebellar nuclei neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Witter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canto et al., 2016</xref>), effectively abolished CRs. One potential complication could have been the obstruction of CRs by the elicitation of twitches, but the inhibitory effect in the IpN that results from our protocol would only have been able to induce twitches at its offset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Witter et al., 2013</xref>), which fell outside the CS-US interval. The opposite potential caveat could be a sudden drop in muscle tone and a resulting immobility. However, this should have been reflected in reduced natural fluctuations of eyelid behavior compared to baseline, for which there was no indication in our data. Thus, while it was shown previously that activation of IpN via optogenetic suppression of Purkinje cells is sufficient to elicit eyelid behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Heiney et al., 2014a</xref>), we here expand on pharmacological evidence for the necessity of facilitation in the IpN for the expression of conditioned eyelid behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Freeman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ohyama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bracha et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heiney et al., 2014b</xref>), by inactivating IpN cells, only during the CS-US interval, through optogenetic stimulation of their inhibitory Purkinje cell input.</p><p>IpN neurons showing CR-related suppression of activity have previously been reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berthier and Moore (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gruart et al., 2000</xref>, and were hypothesized to facilitate conditioned behavior through inactivation of antagonistic muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gruart et al., 2000</xref>). However, whereas the facilitation IpN cells that we recorded showed predictive trial-by-trial correlations to conditioned eyelid responses, to the modest extent that the suppressive IpN neurons showed correlations, they did only to simultaneous or past, but not future, behavior, across both datasets. While the overall minor presence of suppression in IpN neurons, and their modest, reflective correlations may be indicative of a minimal role in driving behavior, hinting perhaps at sensory feedback, the relaxation of antagonistic muscles is a secondary, passive means of facilitating CRs; its benefit would in part comprise a reduced energy cost to effect behavior, and may therefore escape proper detection in a correlational analysis focusing only on eyelid kinematics. Alternatively, as our electrodes might have preferentially targeted the large projection neurons, the suppression cells might also represent smaller inhibitory interneurons of the nuclei that in fact could serve to further shape the activity of the facilitation cells, smoothing the CR.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Stereotyped pause-excitation responses in the IpN</title><p>Many IpN neurons responded at the onset of the conditioned eyelid movement with a characteristic transient pause, which was followed by a period of increased activity.

To these potential mechanisms, our results add one more: In the first dataset, the fastest and strongest cases of excitatory modulation in the IpN neurons occurred right after the CS-related spike pause (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, in the second dataset, a similar pattern of pause followed by strong excitation was observed in US-alone trials, which are known to trigger climbing fiber-driven complex spikes in Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hesslow, 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mostofi et al., 2010</xref>). This CS-related spike pause is likely to have a direct impact on the subsequent spike modulation, as the modulation amplitudes and velocity were significantly higher in the cells with a CS-related spike pause (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This characteristic profile fits well with the notion of rebound depolarization in the cerebellar nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hoebeek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtsson et al., 2011</xref>).

The rapid post-US excitatory response had an average latency of 10.6 ms (25th-75th percentile: 7–12 ms), which allows for both mossy fiber and climbing fiber collateral activation as possible pathways for driving the response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berthier and Moore, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cody and Richardson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mostofi et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mostofi et al.

Nevertheless, several properties of the US peak provide some clues as to its origin. On the one hand, one could argue that the robust and ubiquitous manifestation of the US peak across the IpN suggests mossy fiber collaterals are a more likely source than climbing fiber collaterals. IpN cells that showed eyelid-related facilitation constitute a selective subgroup of cells in the IpN, and neurons showing US pauses were more commonly observed in less deeply located IpN neurons, which agrees with the notion that the anterior IpN is the main target region for eyelid-related Purkinje cell output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yeo et al., 1985a1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Steinmetz et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bracha et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Krupa and Thompson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De Zeeuw and Yeo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Freeman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heiney et al., 2014b</xref>). If climbing fiber collaterals would be distributed as widely throughout the IpN as the US peak was observed to be, this would almost certainly mean they are not constrained within eyelid-related olivocerebellar modules. Therefore, mossy fiber input, which is not assumed to adhere to such a modular organization and forms a more robust input to the cerebellar nuclei (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Person and Raman, 2010</xref>), may more appropriately fit the observed manifestation of the US peak. Moreover, the reduction of US peak responses over the course of conditioning may well reflect the reduced impact of the air puff US due to protection of the eyelid, and a resultant reduced mossy fiber signal. On the other hand, there is research to suggest that climbing fiber collateral input may be more robust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Van der Want et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hesslow, 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De Zeeuw and Yeo, 2005</xref>) than the notion of ‘sparse collaterals’ suggests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan-Palay, 1977</xref>). Moreover, stimulation of the inferior olive results in a consistent excitatory response in the cerebellar nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitai et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hoebeek et al., 2010</xref>), and spontaneous complex spikes elicit a co-occurrence of excitatory and inhibitory responses in the nuclei 24% of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blenkinsop and Lang, 2011</xref>), which is not very different from the percentage we observed (32%). The cell- and trial-wide correlations suggesting weaker US-peaks with better CRs may also be explained in terms of a changing level of nucleo-olivary inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Medina et al., 2002</xref>), which would agree with a contribution of the climbing fiber collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">De Zeeuw et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, the interesting occurrence of weaker US peaks in trials where mice opened their eyes further than baseline, agrees with Purkinje cell US-complex spike data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">ten Brinke et al. (2015)</xref>, underlining another similarity between the US peak and climbing fiber activity. Thus, while these arguments suggest it is likely that climbing fibers contribute to the US peak response, its broad prevalence across the IpN suggests mossy fibers are also involved.</p><p>The question remains as to why the US-related responses were substantially more widespread than the CS-related responses. Considering the strong convergence of Purkinje cells onto IpN neurons (approx. 40:1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Person and Raman, 2011</xref>), only a relatively small portion of the IpN neurons might evoke functional behavioral responses. As the large pool of remaining IpN neurons may show US-responses that relay general sensory information of the face, including that of the areas surrounding the eyelid region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Koekkoek et al., 2002</xref>), or feed into cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wagner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sokolov et al., 2017</xref>), there may also be a substantial amount of redundant, yet detectable, spike responses. This would be consistent with recent findings that dense population coding during eyeblink conditioning also occurs at the cerebellar input stage, i.e. in the granule cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">D'Angelo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Giovannucci et al., 2017</xref>), which may partly result from nucleocortical feedback originating in the IpN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Houck and Person, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gao et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Functional implications</title><p>In the present study, we have detailed the learning-related dynamic modulation of cerebellar IpN cells and evaluated it against the previously observed modulation of Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex by which they are inhibited during Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning.

Moreover, we have uncovered a well-timed imprint of presumptive complex spike activity in the IpN and a subsequent strong excitation. Thus, possibly in interaction with direct input to the IpN, climbing fiber input to the cerebellar cortex could provide an additional mechanism through which spike modulation may be elicited in the IpN to fine-tune the timing of CRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">De Zeeuw and Ten Brinke, 2015</xref>).

We chose to determine average spike modulation of cells in terms of absolute instead of relative change from the average baseline firing frequency, as we wanted to not process the data further away from actual firing frequency than necessary. Moreover, absolute change was not different across firing frequencies in terms of facilitation (r = 0.025, p=0.68, n = 270, Spearman), and absolute suppression was only slightly deeper in faster firing cells (r = −0.131, p=0.0308, n = 270, Spearman), whereas relative mean modulation was more clearly linked to average firing frequency (facilitation: r = −0.378, p&lt;0.0001; suppression: r = −0.211, p=0.0005; n = 270, Spearman). Thus, expressing spike modulation in absolute terms thus avoids the use of a modulation criterion that is implicitly looser for cells with lower firing frequencies. We considered cells to carry CS-US facilitation if they showed an average increase of at least <bold>5 Hz</bold> above baseline mean in the last 200 ms of the CS-US interval, after subtracting the mean above-baseline activity within the baseline itself. Similarly, cells showing an activity of at least <bold>5 Hz</bold> below baseline mean, correcting for below-baseline activity within the baseline itself, were considered suppressive. For both types of modulation, this threshold roughly corresponds to 3 SDs among the incidentally negatively modulating cells, i.e. cells where the baseline showed more facilitation/suppression than the CS-US interval. Duration of modulation was calculated as the sum of ms-bins exceeding 3 baseline SDs in the last 200 ms of the CS-US interval; spike firing needed to exceed this threshold for at least 10 ms during the CS-US interval.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>CS-responses</title><p>To see how IpN neurons may reflect CS-related Purkinje cell complex spikes, rapid shifts in spike frequency were assessed between 50 and 125 ms post-CS in average spike traces that were standardized to baseline.

A first US peak was identified if it exceeded either 5 or 2 baseline SDs from the average of the last 50 ms of the CS-US interval, with the latter case also requiring a 5 SD difference from baseline. This way, cells that showed high facilitation in the CS-US interval were not ignored simply because they did not spare enough room for the spike increase required to meet the first criterion. Pauses were recognized if they exceeded 5 baseline SDs below the final 50 ms of the CS-US interval, and were at least 2 SDs below baseline. Alternatively, they could be 2 SDs below the end of the CS-US interval and exceed 5 SDs from baseline. This means pauses that did not dip below baseline level were not recognized as such, as it is difficult to ascertain whether they are pauses, or just the space between two peaks. Finally, second peaks were considered significant if they were still at least 2 SDs above the last 50 ms of the CS-US interval as well as 5 SDs above baseline. For both the pause and the second peak, the subsequent turnaround had to regress at least 2 SDs back to baseline, so as to avoid the inclusion of blunt, unpeak-like movements in the average spike traces. For trial-by-trial analyses, absolute firing frequency was used, taking the maximum (or, for pauses, minimum) values within 30 ms time-windows centered at the average peak- or pause-time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Simple spike-based model of IpN neurons</title><p>Using Python software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008394">SCR_008394</ext-link>), A total of 26 IpN neurons were modeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) using the parameters shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>, with each modeled IpN neuron incorporating the simple spike modulation of a Purkinje cell from the dataset in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">ten Brinke et al.

It is not known how similar or dissimilar simple spike modulation of Purkinje cells projecting to the same nuclear cell is. We here opted to take the same reference Purkinje cell for each of the thirty simple spike patterns used to model IpN activity. To avoid reusing trials, we expanded the Purkinje cell simple spike data. For each Purkinje cell, inter-spike interval distribution (ISI) characteristics (mean, SD, skewness, kurtosis) were determined across trials for each 1 ms bin in the trial timespan. By iteratively sampling a random ISI from the local ISI distribution, trials of simple spike activity are created that carry the same firing and modulation characteristics as the original Purkinje cell. The resulting set of 900 trials of simple spike activity was fed to the model, resulting in 30 trials of IpN spike activity.

For combined analysis of multiple cells, mixed-effects linear regression was performed, with random intercepts and slopes for cells included based on likelihood ratio tests. Visual inspection of residuals safeguarded adequate normality and homoscedasticity, and helped identify extreme outliers (never more than four).

Matrices for multiple cells were subsequently compiled by taking the average r-values across matrices, after nullifying the r-values of the sign opposite to the sign of interest. Note that this constitutes a methodological tool used to assess the temporal distribution of correlations, and not to quantify their significance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Authors are grateful to Erika Goedknegt and Elise Haasdijk for technical assistance.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naoshige Uchida as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: John Freeman (Reviewer #1); David Herzfeld (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Eyeblink conditioning has been a great model for studying the neural mechanism underlying classical conditioning. Although the cerebellum has long been implicated in eyeblink conditioning, how neurons in in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and those in the cerebellar cortex regulate eyeblink conditioning is yet to be determined. The present study provides a comprehensive analysis of the firing of DNC neurons (in particular, those in the interposed nucleus [IpN]) in relation with learning and Purkinje cell (PC) activities. Most notably:</p><p>1) The authors demonstrate a tight relationship between PC complex spikes and firing pauses of DCN neuron. This work builds on the work of Eric Lang (presence of complex spikes in DCN activity) and Javier Medina (presence of complex spikes due to the conditioned stimulus).</p><p>2) The authors show a trial-by-trial correlation between the activity of &quot;facilitatory&quot; DCN cells and eyeblink behavior.</p><p>3) Optogenetic activation of PCs caused inhibition of DCN neurons and reduced the conditioned response (eyeblink), supporting the necessity of normal IpN activity for conditioned behavior (although the enthusiasm of this result varied among the reviewers).</p><p>The reviewers thought that this work provides an important set of results that advances our understanding of the contributions of different neuron types in the cerebellum in eyeblink conditioning. Nonetheless, the reviewers noted some issues with respect to their interpretation and presentation of the results. We therefore would like to see the authors' response to the following points:</p><p>Essential points:</p><p>1) Most of the analyses rely on discrete classifications of neurons based on their response types, and do not provide a comprehensive view on the diversity of responses in each population. Furthermore, the main results such as correlation between neural activities and behaviors were obtained using a relatively small fraction of neurons that exhibited particular responses. The reviewers are generally concerned on these points, and suggest that the authors provide additional analyses or discussions to remedy these issues, taking into account the diversity of observed response types in the data set. More detailed comments regarding this are as follows:</p><p>1a) The authors have recorded from a large set of diverse DCN neurons. They are generally subdivided by a particular response property and then analyzed within those subdivisions. This subdivision can be confusing or problematic, as the criteria often change from experiment to experiment. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, facilitation/ suppression cells are defined as having at least 5 Hz up/down modulation. First, it would be helpful if the authors show a histogram of the population, as it is not clear that these are distinct populations. Second, later in the manuscript (subsection “CS-related transient spike trough reflects acquired CS-related complex spike response”), the amount of facilitation is compared between this population and a separate population which was defined in a different way. Furthermore, in some cases, the numbers of neurons in each category is so small (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) that it remains unclear how many different response types there are, and how much each type really contributes to the behavior.</p><p>1b) The proportion of neurons with learning-relevant activity is lower than found in many of the previous studies cited. Only 29% showed facilitation and 17 of those showed positive correlations with the CR. This raises a concern regarding whether or not the recordings were from neurons in an eyelid control area of the IpN. A related concern is that some of the previous studies examining IpN activity used electrical stimulation through the recording electrode to elicit eyelid movement to determine whether the neurons recorded from that electrode were in an eyelid control area of the IpN. There are problems associated with this method such as activating fibers of passage, but the authors should note in the paper that some of the IpN neurons could have been controlling CRs for other muscles that happen to be highly correlated with eyelid closure.</p><p>1c) Modeling needs to be performed carefully, taking into account the scarcity of some of the key response types. In other words, a major challenge for the interpretation of the current results is how to weight the contributions of neurons exhibiting particular response types as indicated in Figure 9. For example, the authors stress the importance of the neurons showing a pause in spiking early in the CS period, but there were only 7 of these neurons. It appears that the study yielded sufficient data to model the interactions described in Figure 9, taking into account all of the various contributors in the population, weighted by their prevalence, magnitude of neuronal modulation, and strength of correlation with CRs.</p><p>1d) In the Materials and methods section, the descriptions of selection criteria for e.g. suppression vs. troughs are confusing. This is partly because the authors have specific terminologies that are not always obvious (for instance, it was not clear that there a fundamental difference in the meaning of 'suppression' vs. 'trough'). The authors should reference the specific figures/ experiments to which they refer for each section. Please use consistent descriptive terminology indicating response profiles associate with CS/US/complex spikes.</p><p>2) The comparison of the IpN neurons with predicted responses based on models of summed PC inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is very interesting. However, the authors in general seem to discount the role of non-PC inputs to DCN, specifically mossy fibers. For instance, the larger facilitation in neurons that show a CS-trough is interpreted as being due to rebound potentiation. How can enhanced MF plasticity onto those neurons (resulting from stronger CS modulation) be ruled out?</p><p>3) It is unclear about the putative relationship between PC complex spikes and the peak activity shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. From Blenkinsop and Lang (2011), it would seem that if there is facilitation in the DCN following a PC complex spike, it should be brief compared to the depression (representing short-latency climbing fiber excitatory collaterals rather than complex spike related inhibition from the PCs). However, the duration of the excitatory peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, F</xref> seems comparable to those provided in the early part of the same figure. Are these really complex spike mediated responses? Consider that IpN cell 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> seems to show suppression with a presumptive complex spike following the US (opposite of the bursting relationship after CS).</p><p>In essence, there is no data to distinguish clearly between complex spike vs. climbing fiber afferent regulating DCN responses. The reviewers were concerned that the impact statement (as well as parts of the Discussion) goes beyond the data. Please revise the impact statement and other related descriptions to reflect this concern.</p><p>4) The Materials and methods section for the optogenetic experiments is missing.</p><p>5) Simultaneous activity of presynaptic PCs likely inhibits IpN cells well below their basal firing rate. Depending on the duration of stimulation, this could affect the kinematics of the unconditioned response. Do the authors see any changes in the kinematics of the eye blink for stimulation versus pre/early-training in which there is no CR?</p><p>6) It is unclear whether the results of this study are applicable to cerebral cortical interactions with the thalamus as suggested in the first paragraph of the Introduction and last paragraph of the Discussion. The reviewers thought that the nature of connectivity is very different, with cerebellar cortical output being exclusively inhibitory, for example. The reviewers thought that the Introduction is oversold and largely irrelevant. The reviewers suggest removing the discussion on cortical-subcortical interactions.</p><p>7) The author's trial-by-trial correlation analysis could be strengthened. The authors calculated correlations between 20ms bins of spike responses and behavior across trials. This analysis inherently assumes that each 20ms bin is independent, which is not the case. It would be good to use the actual time-dependent spiking responses to predict the CR behavior in time. A potential analysis: average rate responses of a neuron across trials in which a CR occurred (e.g., day 7+). For the same trial period determine the learned CR as the average difference between the eye position trace after learning and the position traces before learning. Now do a correlational analysis between these two average timeseries. What is the optimal lag/lead across neurons? How well does the facilitation timeseries predict the learned CR response (in time)?</p><p>8) The emergence of facilitation and suppression shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref> occurs much more rapidly than does the emergence of behavior. This seems to disagree with the correlation results and optogenetic stimulation in the rest of the paper. If IpN facilitation is both necessary and sufficient to drive eye-blink behavior why does the end of Day 5 (which has approximately the same facilitation as Day 7) have significantly less CRs? Perhaps this is due to averaging spike responses across the entire CS-US period in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. If the authors plotted the 20ms bin average at the ideal lag (80ms), would this look qualitatively different that the average responses plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref> (e.g., emerging slower)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28132.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential points:</p><p>1) Most of the analyses rely on discrete classifications of neurons based on their response types, and do not provide a comprehensive view on the diversity of responses in each population.

Our choice to use a 5 Hz-threshold is based on a number of considerations. First, our preference was to not process spike modulation data further away from actual firing frequency than necessary. Second, when comparing baseline firing frequency to relative CS-US modulation expressed as Hz, it is clear that this approach does not introduce a baseline frequency dependent selection bias. In contrast, when we express it as a percentage in relation to baseline frequency, it does induce a bias in that neurons with low baseline frequency are preferred. For selection bias, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1. A</xref> 5 Hz-threshold identifies modulating cells evenly (red plots), whereas percentage threshold shows preference towards low frequency cells (orange plots, general population top correlation plots, subsets of facilitation cells see bottom plot). Moreover, when looking at the distribution of suppression and facilitation (blue and red histograms, resp.), the negative values indicate occasions when there was more modulation in the baseline than in the CS-US interval; the one-sided 3 SD thresholds for these incidental magnitudes (dotted blue and red lines) both are in close agreement with a 5 Hz threshold (dashed black lines). Thus, given its intuitive straightforwardness, the fact that it does not introduce bias across neurons showing different baseline firing frequencies, and its statistical appropriateness, we decided on using a 5 Hz threshold. This rationale is now explained in the Materials and methods section.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28132.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28132-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>With regards to the comparison in the subsection “CS-related transient spike trough reflects acquired CS-related complex spike response”, facilitation is not computed any differently in the two groups that are compared. Rather, all facilitation cells were split into a group with cells that also showed a putatively CS-complex spike related spike trough, and one with cells that did not. We have now rephrased this part to be clearer. Moreover, with the additional data, we now provide a more comprehensive dataset, upping the numbers for the different categories of neuronal responses. Lastly, we now provide a visualized classification of these different groups in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1b) The proportion of neurons with learning-relevant activity is lower than found in many of the previous studies cited.

Berthier and Moore (1990) observed similar numbers of 50 out of 165 cells showing CR-related facilitation (30.3%) in trained animals. Moreover, when we use the same criteria as Halverson, Lee, and Freeman (2010), we would have 41% facilitation cells. For this study we decided to use the 5 Hz selection threshold for the reasons elaborated in the previous point.</p><p>Our original approach, recording throughout the IpN, is one reason why the strong prevalence of almost immediate excitation after the US implies the ubiquity of whichever collaterals are responsible for them (climbing fibers seem to play a substantial role, given our data and the compatibility between the bimodal latencies of US-complex spikes in Mostofi et al. (2010) and US-peak responses in Berthier and Moore, (1990)). Nevertheless, we concede the downside that some of our IpN neurons could have been controlling other highly correlated muscles than the eyelid. We therefore addressed this concern by incorporating a second dataset, which allowed us to corroborate our findings in recordings that were demonstrably eyelid-controlling, by virtue of micro-stimulation. As pointed out by the reviewer this approach, although not perfect either, does indeed provide a higher percentage of facilitation cells (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We now explain this comparison and highlight this reasoning in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1c) Modeling needs to be performed carefully, taking into account the scarcity of some of the key response types.

In the current version of the manuscript, we have alleviated this concern through the addition of substantial data obtained in optimally conditioned mice. This has greatly sharpened the image in terms of the manifestation of neuronal responses, e.g. by drastically increasing the number of cells showing CS pause responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and in contrast by leaving the CS peak response wholly uncorroborated (and thus relegated to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The layered pie-charts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> now provide an extensive overview of how the different response types co-occur, also distinguishing between cells that do or don’t show significant spike-eyelid correlations. Finally, we have now updated the modeled diagram in Figure 9 (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) to include the second dataset, thereby greatly strengthening the visualized interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1d) In the Materials and methods section, the descriptions of selection criteria for e.g. suppression vs. troughs are confusing.

This suggests that a contribution of potentiated mossy fiber input is not necessary per se. Still, we do not rule out MF plasticity, and would in fact agree that it could play a role in the facilitation observed in IpN neurons showing the CS-related spike trough. For MF-DCN synapses to potentiate, their activation likely needs to be combined with a post-inhibitory rebound depolarization (Pugh and Raman, 2006, 2008), which we propose could be provided by the synchronized complex spike input likely underlying the CS pause. Still, if the larger facilitation we report is indeed partly due to potentiated mossy fiber collateral synapses, the CS signals conveyed through them from the pontine nuclei would have to have a curious temporal profile, with a maximum right after the CS-related spike trough. While this is a rather tough requirement for MF-DCN LTP to explain the larger IpN facilitation we report, the temporal profiles of pontine activity reflecting 300 ms tone CSs does offer some plausibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in Clark, Gohl, and Lavond, 1997). The more straightforward version of rebound excitation, not dependent on LTP at MF-DCN synapses, also involves the confluence of excitation and inhibition, which leads to concomitant activation of GABAA and mGluRs that together drive subsequent rebound firing (Zheng and Raman, 2011) with a temporal profile that readily fits the temporal profile of the larger IpN facilitation we observed. While the inhibition may be provided by the possibly synchronized CS-related complex spikes, the requisite excitation could be provided by mossy and/or climbing fiber collaterals. We now make reference to the potential role of both mossy and climbing fiber collaterals in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is unclear about the putative relationship between PC complex spikes and the peak activity shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>.

However, the duration of the excitatory peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, F</xref> seems comparable to those provided in the early part of the same figure. Are these really complex spike mediated responses? Consider that IpN cell 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> seems to show suppression with a presumptive complex spike following the US (opposite of the bursting relationship after CS).</p><p>In essence, there is no data to distinguish clearly between complex spike vs. climbing fiber afferent regulating DCN responses. The reviewers were concerned that the impact statement (as well as parts of the Discussion) goes beyond the data. Please revise the impact statement and other related descriptions to reflect this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we agree that our datasets did not differentiate between complex spike vs climbing fiber afferent induced facilitation. Therefore, we are now more cautious to draw any conclusion in the Discussion. Interestingly enough, CS related peak responses were rarely observed in the second dataset added to the study, suggesting it is a rare phenomenon within eyelid-controlling regions of the IpN. We therefore relegated this response to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, now only presenting it as a curiosity. Thus, on the broader point of overreach in the impact statement and parts of the Discussion regarding a potential contribution of climbing fiber collaterals, we agree that this assertion was not based on sufficiently robust data in our study and falls short of accurately conveying the actual significance of our findings. As a consequence, together with the remarks in point 6, we have now rephrased the impact statement to better reflect our findings, and toned down our extrapolations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Materials and methods section for the optogenetic experiments is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the missing section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Simultaneous activity of presynaptic PCs likely inhibits IpN cells well below their basal firing rate. Depending on the duration of stimulation, this could affect the kinematics of the unconditioned response. Do the authors see any changes in the kinematics of the eye blink for stimulation versus pre/early-training in which there is no CR?</p></disp-quote><p>To explore the possibility that optogenetic stimulation could affect the US responses, we compared the US responses with optogenetic inhibition with those in the trails with no CR. In essence, we looked at the difference in UR kinematics between trials with a CR and those without a CR, where the No-CR trials were due to optogenetic stimulation in one dataset, and due to a natural absence of behavior in the other dataset (IpN recordings). From the latter dataset, we took all recordings (n = 12, shown in panel A) with at least 30 trials, with conditioned behavior (&gt;20%), but no more than 90% CRs, and with an average CR amplitude that is within the range of the average CR amplitudes in the three optogenetic experiments (shown in panel B). For each recording/session, we next extracted the difference between the averages of CR and No CR trials (panel C). Finally, for each recording/session, we determined the z-scores, by performing a bootstrap analysis of 500 repetitions (panel D). The bootstrap specifics (per recording/session): for each repetition, we randomly redistributed trials across the CR/No-CR groups, retaining the original Ns per group, and computed the difference as in C. The z-scores for the actual differences in C were then computed by subtracting for each data-point the corresponding mean of the bootstrapped dataset and subsequently dividing by the corresponding standard deviation of the bootstrapped dataset.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28132.023</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28132-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>Whereas on average the results indicate no significant difference between CR and No-CR trials anywhere in the UR phase in the IpN dataset, we do find an effect in the optogenetics data. All three experiments are suggestive of a tendency of the mice to keep their eyelid more closed between 100-300 ms post-US (= post-stimulation offset), with session’s average passing the 2 SD line, and another even passing the 3 SD line. The time window within which the average z-score trace for the optogenetic data was above 2 SDs is indicated by the shaded pink area in panels B and D. The delay between stimulation offset and this time window of substantial difference is roughly similar to that reported in Witter et al. (2013; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Thus, the data here presented suggest a behavioral effect due to post-stimulation rebound that is consistent with previous work using a similar optogenetic methodology (Witter et al., 2013). Given the already substantial size of the manuscript and this observation’s relative distance from the central aims of this study, we would prefer not to include it in the paper, unless the reviewers/Editors disagree.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is unclear whether the results of this study are applicable to cerebral cortical interactions with the thalamus as suggested in the first paragraph of the Introduction and last paragraph of the Discussion. The reviewers thought that the nature of connectivity is very different, with cerebellar cortical output being exclusively inhibitory, for example. The reviewers thought that the Introduction is oversold and largely irrelevant. The reviewers suggest removing the discussion on cortical-subcortical interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now removed most of the cortical-subcortical angle, and rewrote the Introduction’s first and Discussion’s last paragraph to more tightly reflect the scope of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The author's trial-by-trial correlation analysis could be strengthened. The authors calculated correlations between 20ms bins of spike responses and behavior across trials. This analysis inherently assumes that each 20ms bin is independent, which is not the case. It would be good to use the actual time-dependent spiking responses to predict the CR behavior in time. A potential analysis: average rate responses of a neuron across trials in which a CR occurred (e.g., day 7+). For the same trial period determine the learned CR as the average difference between the eye position trace after learning and the position traces before learning. Now do a correlational analysis between these two average timeseries. What is the optimal lag/lead across neurons? How well does the facilitation timeseries predict the learned CR response (in time)?</p></disp-quote><p>The relation between the amplitudes of spiking and eyelid response can be analyzed in two orthogonal ways: I) by correlating across time points within individual trials or the average across trials, as now implemented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> as per the reviewers’ suggestion; or II) by correlating across trials at individual time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>) or the average across time points within the CS-US interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>), which is our original approach. Whereas the data in the former across-time points analysis concern a discrete sampling of a continuous process (one could interpolate between time data points), the data from the across-trial analysis actually concerns discrete, independent measurements (from different trials), and is therefore suitable for statistical inferences, as we draw from single analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>.</p><p>The temporal dynamics of the relationship between spike and eyelid modulation can be explored in terms of two aspects that are also orthogonal: I) the degree of relatedness at different times in the trial timespan; and II) the degree of relatedness at different temporal offsets, i.e. the lead/lag relationship. The suggested temporal cross-correlation method explores the latter, but gives no information about which part or parts of the trial timespan carry the relatedness between spikes and eyelid. By contrast, the correlation matrix analysis, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>, readily allows for the integrated evaluation of both aspects: relatedness can be assessed at different times in the trial timespan (I) by moving along the diagonal parallel to the dashed white line, and at different lead/lag relationships (II) by moving along the perpendicular/orthogonal diagonal. Thus, different temporal components of the spike-eyelid relationship can be identified, at different times and with different lead/lag relationships, such as the two hotspots in the Purkinje cell correlation matrix in ten Brinke et al. (2015; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The early hotspot in that matrix, relating the short CS-complex spike response to the full CR, and the relatively broad hotspot at an adjacent time in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> are consistent with the notion of a CS-related complex spike input triggering rebound-excitation in the IpN. Thus, the correlation matrix approach allows for but does not assume independent components across time-bins, whereas the suggested temporal cross-correlation approach actually assumes dependence across time points. This can be problematic when using spike activity with multiple components that may or may not be interdependent (as we see in our dataset), because with across-timepoint correlations, these components are conflated.</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree that temporal cross-correlation could indeed strengthen our analysis, for two reasons. First, in the event there is little meaningful across-trial amplitude variation, it can still provide information about the lead/lag relationship between the conditioned spike and eyelid responses. Second, when applied to each trial individually instead of the average across trials, the resultant dataset can give a 95% confidence interval of the optimal lead/lag relationship, based on independent measurements. This analysis is now included in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and shows lead/lag relationships that are consistent with our original analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The emergence of facilitation and suppression shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref> occurs much more rapidly than does the emergence of behavior. This seems to disagree with the correlation results and optogenetic stimulation in the rest of the paper. If IpN facilitation is both necessary and sufficient to drive eye-blink behavior why does the end of Day 5 (which has approximately the same facilitation as Day 7) have significantly less CRs? Perhaps this is due to averaging spike responses across the entire CS-US period in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. If the authors plotted the 20ms bin average at the ideal lag (80ms), would this look qualitatively different that the average responses plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref> (e.g., emerging slower)?</p></disp-quote><p>The most straightforward conceptualization for simultaneous emergence of spike modulation and behavior would assume a uniform one-on-one relation, meaning the magnitude of spike modulation is representative of its population and proportional to the corresponding eyelid behavior. Based on our data, we think there could well be a threshold that needs to be reached before spike modulation starts manifesting as CRs. This could be in terms of magnitude of modulation, and/or number of IpN cells being recruited.</p><p>The finding that spike modulation occurring ahead of eyelid behavior is supported by previous work, such as Freeman and Nicholson (2000), Halverson, Lee, and Freeman (2010), and McCormick and Thompson (1984).</p><p>As per the reviewers’ suggestion, we have plotted the facilitation data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref> in 20ms bins, in four different ways, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>. Red and blue distinguish between relative firing rates expressed in Hz or in Z-scores (resp.), and plain and light color shades distinguish between the full CS-US interval and the CS-US interval up until 170ms (resp.). These two ranges assume no lag or an 80ms lag, respectively, which together with the eyelid velocity analysis, and the new temporal cross-correlational analyses, is the outer limit (the optimal lag likely lies between the two). Note that the recordings included here all met the facilitation criterion, like the corresponding data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>. While among these different visualizations one may agree with CR development better than others, there does not seem to be a game-changing difference with regards to the matter of asynchronous development of spike and eyelid modulation.</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28132.024</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28132-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig><p>Altogether, rather than suboptimal averaging of spike responses, we would suggest, as presented in the manuscript, that the development of the spike modulation ahead of the behavioral expression reflects the actual development of the conditioning process.</p></body></sub-article></article>
