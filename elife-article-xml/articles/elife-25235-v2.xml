activating them for biological function. Despite decades of research, the mechanism connecting ATP hydrolysis and chaperone function remains elusive. Particularly puzzling has been the apparent lack of cooperativity in hydrolysis of the ATP in each protomer. A crystal structure of the mitochondrial Hsp90, TRAP1, revealed that the catalytically active state is closed in a highly strained asymmetric conformation. This asymmetry, unobserved in other Hsp90 homologs, is due to buckling of one of the protomers and is most pronounced at the broadly conserved client-binding region. Here, we show that rather than being cooperative or independent, ATP hydrolysis on the two protomers is sequential and deterministic. Moreover, dimer asymmetry sets up differential hydrolysis rates for each protomer, such that the buckled conformation favors ATP hydrolysis. Remarkably, after the first hydrolysis, the dimer undergoes a flip in the asymmetry while remaining in a closed state for the second hydrolysis. From these results, we propose a model where direct coupling of ATP hydrolysis and conformational flipping rearranges client-binding sites, providing a paradigm of how energy from ATP hydrolysis can be used for client remodeling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25235.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25235.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Hsp90</kwd><kwd>TRAP1</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd><kwd>ATP hydrolysis</kwd><kwd>homodimer</kwd><kwd>asymmetry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elnatan</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Betegon</surname><given-names>Miguel</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yanxin</given-names></name><name><surname>Agard</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yanxin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54-GM094597</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01-GM098254</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Agard</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A flip of the dimer asymmetry following the first ATP hydrolysis provides a mechanistic model for client remodeling by the mitochondrial Hsp90, TRAP1.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a highly conserved ATP-dependent molecular chaperone. Although originally identified and named as part of the heat-shock response, Hsp90’s many important roles in the general stress response, regulation of protein function, disease and evolution are now appreciated. Hsp90 physically interacts with ~10% of the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>), highlighting its ability to recognize a broad range of substrate ‘client’ proteins, having diverse functions, sequences, structures, and sizes. Although Hsp90 can function as a canonical chaperone and promote protein folding by suppressing aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krukenberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wiech et al., 1992</xref>), it is unique in that it also plays an active role in regulating the activities of a large subset of the proteome, including many proteins involved in signal transduction such as kinases and hormone receptors, thus supporting normal cellular functions. This essential function of Hsp90 is intimately tied to its ATPase activity, and mutations that either enhance or suppress this activity compromise cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nathan and Lindquist, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panaretou et al., 1998</xref>). Conversely, deregulation of cellular Hsp90 levels helps support uncontrolled growth in many human cancers making Hsp90 an important pharmacological target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Whitesell and Lindquist, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Hsp90 is a V-shaped homodimer, with each protomer consisting of three major domains: a C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD); a middle domain (MD), which has been linked to client binding; and an N-terminal ATPase domain (NTD). The Hsp90 NTD and the upper part of the MD confer membership to the GHKL (DNA <underline>G</underline>yrase, <underline>H</underline>sp90, Histidine <underline>K</underline>inases, Mut<underline>L</underline> mismatch repair protein) family of ATP-powered molecular machines.</p><p>In the apo state, Hsp90 is highly dynamic and can sample a range of conformations from a highly extended to a more compact state, potentially accommodating interactions with a diverse set of client structures and sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krukenberg et al., 2008</xref>). Large conformational changes are also coupled to nucleotide binding: ATP binding stabilizes a closed state where both NTDs are dimerized, forming the catalytically active state, whereas ADP binding favors a transiently formed compact state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shiau et al., 2006</xref>). Such structural studies have suggested an ATPase cycle of closure, hydrolysis and reopening.</p><p>Most higher eukaryotic cells possess four Hsp90 homologs: two cytosolic isoforms, one of which is constitutively expressed while the other is induced by heat shock and stress (Hsp90β and Hsp90α, respectively), one localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (Grp94) and one localized to the mitochondria (TRAP1). Despite some sequence divergence and a few insertions/deletions decorating the globular domains, the structures of all Hsp90 homologs remain conserved, suggesting a fundamental mechanism that adapted to different cellular environments. Indeed, a survey of conformational states in bacterial, yeast, and human Hsp90 revealed species-specific tuning of conformational equilibria and ATPase rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Southworth and Agard, 2008</xref>). In general, reaching the NTD-dimerized closed state is rate limiting for ATP hydrolysis. In the case of TRAP1, the formation of this closed state is further regulated by a temperature-sensitive kinetic barrier imparted by an extra N-terminal extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Partridge et al., 2014</xref>). For eukaryotic cytosolic Hsp90s, binding of co-chaperones can stabilize particular conformational states and modulate ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eckl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Retzlaff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Southworth and Agard, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Despite the wealth of information regarding Hsp90 dynamics, little is known about how the energy of ATP hydrolysis is coupled to client protein remodeling. The current model focuses attention on the ATP-induced large conformational change going from a wide-open V-shape to the NTD-dimerized closed state, whereas conversion to the compact ADP state would displace the bound client, followed by reopening to reset the chaperone. However, given that these conformational states are roughly isoenergetic and that ATP binding only marginally stabilizes the closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mickler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Southworth and Agard, 2008</xref>), this model does not provide a clear connection between utilization of energy from ATP hydrolysis and client remodeling.</p><p>A recent crystal structure of AMPPNP-bound zebrafish TRAP1 (zTRAP1) in a closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>) revealed a novel conformational asymmetry between the protomers, most pronounced at the MD:CTD interfaces where one has 2.5-fold more buried surface area than the other (400 Å<sup>2</sup> vs. 1000 Å<sup>2</sup>). One of the protomer arms is buckled while the other remains straight, nearly identical to the previously observed conformation in p23-bound yeast Hsp90 (yHsp90) closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2006</xref>). Notably, the previously determined client-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Genest et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Street et al., 2012</xref>) located at the MD:CTD interface is maximally affected by the protomer asymmetry.</p><p>Using TRAP1 as a model system for Hsp90, here we investigate how ATP hydrolysis is coupled to its conformational asymmetry and propose a model connecting it to client remodeling. We examine whether ATP hydrolysis in TRAP1 is sequential, what the order of hydrolysis events is, and how the asymmetry is coupled to the nucleotide states along the ATPase cycle. By covalently linking TRAP1 monomers, we created homogeneous populations of obligate heterodimers having one hydrolysis-dead protomer, and determined that TRAP1 must undergo ATP hydrolysis in both protomers to efficiently progress through the cycle. Crystal structures of WT TRAP1 closed with ATP in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> showed that the buckled protomer hydrolyzes ATP more rapidly than the straight one. Microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations reveal differences in water dynamics within the nucleotide-binding pocket of each protomer, highlighting distinct environments surrounding the ATP that may establish differences in hydrolysis rates. Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) distance measurements using dipolar electron-electron resonance (DEER) methods revealed that, in solution, a TRAP1 mutant mimicking the hemi-hydrolyzed (ATP/ADP) state adopts a uniform conformation distinct from the stochastic mixture seen in WT. In this heterodimer, the protomer containing ATP is buckled while the protomer containing the ADP-mimicking mutation is straight. Integrating this data, we propose a revised model of the TRAP1 ATP-driven cycle where the two hydrolysis events are sequential and deterministic, with the buckled protomer being most competent for ATPase hydrolysis, followed by a flip in the MD:CTD asymmetry to position the opposite protomer in the buckled conformation, promoting hydrolysis of the second ATP and allowing TRAP1 to proceed through the cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two ATP hydrolyses are required by TRAP1 to progress through its ATPase cycle</title><p>Previous studies on various Hsp90s show that their ATPase activities follow simple, non-cooperative kinetics despite having two ATP-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dollins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McLaughlin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Richter et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with these observations, the activity of the wild-type ATPase domain is unaffected by whether its partner carries a mutation that does not bind ATP or one that does not hydrolyze ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cunningham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richter et al., 2001</xref>). Such heterodimeric studies are possible because Hsp90 dimers dynamically exchange within minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hessling et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richter et al., 2001</xref>). Simply mixing wild-type and mutant proteins creates a mixture of dimer species (wild-type + heterodimer + mutant) at equilibrium. Using this approach, we looked at human TRAP1 (hTRAP1) ATPase activity by mixing wild-type and a point mutant (E115A) that impairs ATP hydrolysis, but not ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panaretou et al., 1998</xref>) at different ratios. In contrast to previous studies, the activities of these TRAP1 mixtures are lower than what is expected if the two ATPase domains were to act independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting TRAP1 requires that both bound ATPs be hydrolyzed in its ATPase cycle. Since these experiments were done under steady-state conditions, the decreased activity of heterodimers can be due to either an impaired ability to form the closed state or an impaired ability to exit the closed state, thus changing the rate-limiting step.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25235.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Both ATPs need to be hydrolyzed for efficient cycling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Steady-state ATPase assay with constant dimer concentration and varying ratios of wild-type and catalytically-dead E115A mutant shows that ATP hydrolysis by each protomer is not independent.

However, a significant drawback is that the resulting mixture of dimer species complicates further biochemical or especially structural analyses. To allow precise targeting of protomer-specific mutations and produce a homogeneous population of heterodimers without dimer exchange, a covalently bound heterodimeric hTRAP1 was engineered using SpyCatcher/SpyTag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zakeri et al., 2012</xref>) appended after the CTD dimerization domain. Similar to our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Partridge et al., 2014</xref>), we can efficiently monitor TRAP1 closure by attaching FRET probes to cysteines engineered into the NTD (E140C) and MD (K413C) of a cysteine-free chaperone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Using the covalent heterodimers, the E115A mutation was introduced in one of the protomers. Appropriate functionality was confirmed by observing that only half of the bound ATP was hydrolyzed under single-turnover conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Since dimer closure is required to hydrolyze ATP, this rules out the model where the heterodimer cannot form the closed state. Furthermore, it suggests that the impaired steady-state ATPase of the dimer may be due to an inability to exit the closed state. If true, this would lead to a build up of the closed state under multiple-turnover conditions that can be monitored by FRET (high FRET), whereas constant turnover of the wild-type enzyme would maintain a low FRET signal. Indeed, this is just what is observed upon addition of 2 mM ATP/MgCl<sub>2</sub> to either wild-type or +/E115A TRAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The buildup rate of the heterodimer (0.16 min<sup>−1</sup>) is comparable to the steady-state ATP turnover rate of the cysteine-free wild-type (0.19 min<sup>−1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that having only one active ATP site does not affect the kinetics of forming the closed state. Since the closure rate of the +/E115A construct is not affected and dimer closure precedes ATP hydrolysis, the reduced steady-state ATPase rate must be due to a slower process that happens after the dimer is closed.</p><p>To directly test the ability of the hemi-hydrolyzed dimer to exit the closed state, a FRET experiment was designed to look at the kinetics of dimer opening after ATP hydrolysis starting from a synchronized closed state population. This is possible because TRAP1 accumulates in the closed state upon addition of ATP in absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), whereupon hydrolysis can be initiated by addition of excess MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Partridge et al., 2014</xref>). If hydrolysis of both bound ATPs is required to reset TRAP1 back to an open state, then the hemi-hydrolyzing mutant should have an impaired re-opening rate after MgCl<sub>2</sub> is added. Indeed, a very slow re-opening rate is observed for the +/E115A heterodimers, whereas the wild-type protein rapidly returns to low FRET baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These observations strongly support a model where two ATP hydrolyses are required for TRAP1 to progress efficiently through its ATPase cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Crystallographic evidence of sequential and deterministic ATP hydrolysis in TRAP1</title><p>The observed accumulation of TRAP1 closed state upon addition of ATP in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> appears to be specific to the mitochondrial homolog, as bacterial Hsp90 (bHsp90) and yHsp90 do not exhibit this behavior and remain in the open state (data not shown). To characterize this unique state and, through it, gain insight into the TRAP1 ATPase cycle, we crystallized zebrafish TRAP1 (zTRAP1) closed with ATP in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> with an excess of EDTA. An initial crystal, collected 3 days after setting crystal trays, diffracted to 2.5 Å and was solved using molecular replacement with the previously published TRAP1 structure closed with AMPPNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>) (PDB:4IPE). The refined model showed no major conformational differences with any of the previously published full-length TRAP1 structures closed with non-hydrolyzable nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The same pronounced asymmetry (one straight protomer and one buckled protomer) was clearly observed. However, differences exist in the ATP-binding pocket: as expected, the Mg<sup>2+</sup> electron density previously observed contacting the nucleotide phosphates is missing and, surprisingly, while the straight protomer contained a mostly intact ATP, the buckled protomer had only weak density for the γ-phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, Day 3).

After screening crystals from multiple time points for diffraction quality, two additional datasets were collected (1-day and 53-day-old crystals), solved and refined through the same methods to resolutions of 3.5 Å and 2.2 Å, respectively. Similar to the 3-day-old crystal, no significant conformational differences were observed and no Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion density was present in the ATP-binding pocket.

This result leads to a model in which TRAP1 hydrolysis events are sequential and deterministic, with the buckled protomer conformation being catalytically favorable and hydrolyzing first.

From this experiment, the spontaneous and TRAP1-catalyzed (Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free) ATP hydrolysis rates are 0.00155 and 0.5808 per hr (per active site), respectively. Spontaneous hydrolysis would take 62 days, whereas the protein-catalyzed hydrolysis would take 4 hr to hydrolyze 90% of the initial ATP concentration. Although we do not have time points between 1, 3, and 53 days for the crystallography, within an order of magnitude, the solution rates roughly correspond to what we see in the crystal. After 3 days, ATP is fully hydrolyzed by the buckled protomer while ATP remains intact in the straight protomer. Under the same experimental conditions, the rate of dimer closure is an order of magnitude faster (6.95/hr) than the observed hydrolysis rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since dimer closure is no longer the slowest step in hydrolysis, it is likely that in absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, hydrolysis of the first ATP by the buckled protomer is now the rate-limiting step.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Asymmetric water dynamics near ATP γ-Phosphate between protomers</title><p>To further explore the structural origins of the differential rates of ATP hydrolysis by the two protomers, we performed microsecond all-atom molecular dynamics simulations based on the crystal structure of the asymmetric zTrap1 dimer (PDB ID: 4IYN).

In contrast, previous TRAP1 experiments with these analogs resulted in similar asymmetric structures with no obvious conformational differences. In our time-resolved crystallography experiments, the solved structures remain in essentially the same conformation despite having gone through a full conversion from two ATPs to two ADPs. Because crystallographic packing likely prevents any significant conformational changes that might occur after the first ATP hydrolysis, DEER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pannier et al., 2011</xref>) was again the optimal choice for directly probing the solution MD:CTD conformation of hTRAP1 in the hemi-hydrolyzed (ATP/ADP) state. The challenge is then to capture a stable ATP/ADP hybrid state.</p><p>To generate an ADP-state in only one protomer, we make use of the observation that the MD-Arg (R402 in hTRAP1), the only residue in Hsp90 that contacts the γ-phosphate, acts as an ATP sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cunningham et al., 2012</xref>) and mutating this residue would effectively mimic the ADP state. Using the SpyCatcher/SpyTag heterodimer, we introduced a point mutant (R402A) to break the γ-phosphate contact in only one protomer. This heterodimeric construct (+/R402A) can form the closed state upon incubation with the ATP analog ADP-BeF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and has minimally perturbed (twofold increase) ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A cysteine-free version of this heterodimer was used for site-directed spin labeling at the MD (K439C) and CTD (D684C). These positions optimally report on unique MD:CTD distances within each protomer. By measuring the distance between these probes via DEER, one can distinguish between a buckled or straight conformation of the labeled protomer in the closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>). As expected for the wild-type heterodimer, two peaks were observed centered at about 22 Å and 41 Å with roughly equal proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This is close to the 50:50 probability of a protomer randomly adopting either conformation in an asymmetric closed state. Although the observed distances do not exactly match the corresponding values from the crystal structures, they are well within measurement uncertainties when the maleimide linker (~8 Å) and broad distribution of distances are taken into account.

Instead, two different distances were observed depending on the placement of the spin-labels with respect to the R402A mutation. Protomers with an intact γ-phosphate contact adopt mostly a 22 Å MD:CTD distance - consistent with the buckled conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), whereas spin-labeled protomers lacking the γ-phosphate contact exhibit a major peak at 41 Å - consistent with the straight conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Our interpretation that these distances faithfully report on the MD:CTD conformations rely on assumptions that the spin-labels, the R417A mutation, or the SpyCatcher fusion did not introduce unintended perturbations.</p><p>To address this concern, we crystallized an equivalent heterodimeric construct of zTRAP1 (+/R417A in zebrafish sequence numbering) in the presence of ADP-BeF. The heterodimeric crystal diffracted to 3.2 Å and was solved with molecular replacement using the published model of ADP-BeF-bound zTRAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>) (PDB:4J0B) and a SpyCatcher-SpyTag complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2014</xref>) (PDB:4MLS). As predicted from the DEER results, the heterodimer adopts an essentially identical asymmetric closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), and the C-terminal-fused SpyCatcher-SpyTag complex packs against its symmetry mate in the opposing dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The structure shows that the R417A mutation does not perturb the overall closed state. To avoid model bias, the dataset was refined starting with alanines replacing arginines at positions 417 on both protomers. The Fo-Fc difference map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, insets) show strong positive density for the arginine only on the buckled protomer (ATP state), while the R417A mutation is on the straight protomer (ADP state). This is completely consistent with the interprobe distances measured in the DEER experiments correctly representing the buckled and straight protomer conformations. Altogether, this demonstrates that the loss of the γ-phosphate contact within the closed dimer is a strong determinant of the corresponding protomer conformation. Thus, the first ATP hydrolysis directly alters dimer asymmetry upon phosphate release.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous equilibrium Hsp90 structural studies have provided a picture of a dynamic molecular machine whose conformational ensemble, well described by rigid-body motions of its globular domains, is differentially tuned, but not exclusively determined by nucleotide binding. While ATP-binding has a clear role in stabilizing the NTD-dimerized closed state — depicted clearly by closed states of yHsp90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2006</xref>), zTRAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>), and hHsp90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verba et al., 2016</xref>) — the role of ATP hydrolysis in Hsp90’s conformational cycle remains unclear. In this study, we present evidence for a sequential, deterministic hydrolysis of the two ATPs within the mitochondrial Hsp90 (TRAP1) dimer. Each step of hydrolysis drives conformational changes at the client-binding site located at the juncture between the middle and C-terminal domains. We discuss below how this provides a new framework for understanding the mechanism of ATP-dependent client remodeling by Hsp90.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mechanism of conformational coupling to sequential ATP hydrolysis</title><p>Earlier TRAP1 studies had shown how the strain of closing results in a markedly asymmetric (straight:buckled) two-ATP (ATP/ATP) closed state both in the crystal and in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>).

Thus, once closed, kinetic rather than thermodynamic processes govern progression through the conformational cycle. Given this observation, we focused on whether the order of ATP hydrolysis depends upon the asymmetry and on what happens after the first ATP is hydrolyzed.</p><p>To facilitate this work, covalent heterodimers were efficiently created using C-terminal fusions with SpyCatcher and SpyTag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zakeri et al., 2012</xref>). Also critical, was the ability to close TRAP1 with ATP but in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, allowing the normally rate-limiting closure step to be bypassed, thereby synchronizing all molecules in a closed ATP/ATP state. The fortuitous ability of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free closed state to be crystallized with ATP allowed the slow hydrolysis process to be examined crystallographically using crystals of different ages, revealing that the buckled protomer hydrolyzes ATP first while the straight protomer is still bound to an intact ATP. Concerned that the slow hydrolysis seen in the crystal could be an artifact of packing effects on the ATP lid, quantitative kinetics using a highly sensitive assay for phosphate release confirmed that in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, ATP hydrolysis does occur slowly in solution.</p><p>What happens structurally after the first ATP is hydrolyzed? Unfortunately, beyond small perturbations, the crystal lattice blocks significant conformational rearrangements, even after weeks when both ATPs have been hydrolyzed. To resolve this, we used DEER measurements on heterodimers engineered to mimic the mixed ADP/ATP state in solution. In the ATP/ATP state, the labeled protomers adopt roughly an equal mixture of the two conformers, due to the random buckling on transition to the highly strained closed state. By contrast, after the first ATP hydrolysis, essentially all the molecules are in a defined state with the ADP protomer being straight and the ATP protomer buckled.</p><p>Combined, these results indicate that hydrolysis of the first ATP must alter the conformational asymmetry in all molecules such that the ADP containing protomer straightens while the remaining ATP protomer adopts the buckled, catalytically favorable conformation. Including our observation that reopening only efficiently occurs from the ADP/ADP state leads to the proposed conformational cycle, revealing how ATP hydrolysis can potentially perform work to remodel a bound client protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>): (i) Binding of ATP leads to stabilization of a strained, high-energy closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Partridge et al., 2014</xref>). (ii) The buckled protomer preferentially hydrolyzes ATP, transiently producing a buckled ADP state. (iii) The asymmetry flips so that the ATP protomer is now buckled, setting it up for hydrolysis. (iv) The second ATP is hydrolyzed, leading to reopening and fully relieving the strain. While this work was done with the mitochondrial Hsp90 ortholog, the proposed sequential hydrolysis mechanism also explains the lack of ATPase cooperativity observed in other Hsp90s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Richter et al., 2008</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25235.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Revised model of the TRAP1 ATPase cycle showing the obligatory sequential hydrolysis and conformational switching. </title><p>The protomers are colored teal and gray. The dynamic apo state (upper left) binds two ATPs, which stabilize a strained asymmetric NTD-dimerized closed state. Within this closed state, ATP is hydrolyzed first by the buckled protomer. Release of Pi likely drives the observed conformational switch of the straight protomer (ATP) to a buckled conformation, while the previously buckled protomer (now ADP), straightens. Concomitant with the flip, the client-binding sites (magenta ellipses) are rearranged, to facilitate client remodeling. Now in a buckled conformation, the second ATP is set up to be hydrolyzed. Finally, the ADP/ADP dimer re-opens, releasing nucleotides and resetting TRAP1 to the apo state.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25235.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25235.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25235-fig6-v2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A model for Hsp90 client maturation mechanism</title><p>Although Hsp90 has been studied for over 30 years and its importance in many key cellular processes established, the mechanism by which it matures a large set of diverse clients remains uncertain. This is partly due to Hsp90 preferentially interacting with intrinsically unstable proteins, which has hampered in vitro studies of the chaperone in the context of these clients. In the absence of client proteins, Hsp90 cycles between a wide-open V-shaped apo state and a more compact closed state. In principle, rearrangements of hydrophobic residues accompanying the large conformational change (open-to-closed) could be used to remodel client protein, leading to a molecular ‘clamp’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prodromou et al., 2000</xref>). However, we note that constricting the large open-to-close transition, as done by forcing constitutive dimerization of the NTDs, has no major adverse effect on cell growth and only modestly impairs client activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pullen and Bolon, 2011</xref>). This observation, plus the marginal impact of ATP binding in driving dimer closure, the typically quite weak ATP affinity, and the fact that the open and closed states are roughly isoenergetic, implies that the open-to-close transition is unlikely to be the ATP-driven mechanism for client remodeling by Hsp90.</p><p>The conformational changes directly linked to ATP-hydrolysis, especially at client-interacting residues, seem better suited for such a mechanism. Studies on HtpG with the model client Δ131Δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Street et al., 2011</xref>) as well as the recently determined atomic structure of the human Hsp90:Cdc37:Cdk4 kinase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verba et al., 2016</xref>), have begun to map critical determinants of client-binding residues at the juncture of the Middle and C-terminal domains. As noted by Lavery et al., this coincides with the region of maximal asymmetry in TRAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>). Our observation of a hydrolysis-driven conformational switch in which ATP hydrolysis directly promotes a rearrangement of the client-binding region provides a mechanism for actively inducing conformational changes in the client. Equally important is that flipping of the entire TRAP1 population allows clients preferentially bound to either protomer, depending on their size, conformation or other characteristics, to be remodeled via rearrangement of their binding interface. Thus, the first hydrolysis would be used for client remodeling, while the second one would be used to reset the ATP-dependent cycle of TRAP1. Notably, there is some evidence that such a sequential ATP hydrolysis mechanism may be shared among other GHKL ATPases. Yeast topoisomerase II, an enzyme which unlinks double-stranded DNA catenanes, hydrolyzes two ATPs sequentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harkins et al., 1998</xref>), and the first ATP hydrolysis appears to be used to facilitate DNA transport in decatenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baird et al., 2001</xref>). Whether this asymmetric mechanism is conserved throughout all GHKL family members remains to be seen.</p><p>A critical feature of our model is the presence of functional asymmetry within the Hsp90 homodimer. Such asymmetry can either be intrinsic to Hsp90 or induced by interactions with other components. Indeed, emerging evidence suggests that functional complexes are preferentially asymmetric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ebong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirschke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verba et al., 2016</xref>). For the eukaryotic cytosolic enzymes, this asymmetry can be provided by the numerous Hsp90-specific cochaperones or asymmetric post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mollapour et al., 2014</xref>). By contrast, TRAP1 and its bacterial homologs have no known cochaperones. The results and data presented here suggest that, in the case of the mitochondrial and bacterial chaperones, this necessary functional asymmetry may be an intrinsic property encoded by the structural asymmetry of the closed state.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning and protein purification</title><p>The constructs for Human and Zebrafish TRAP1 were the same as previously used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>).

The initial protein structure was modeling based on the crystal structure of zebrafish Trap1 (PDB ID: 4IYN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lavery et al., 2014</xref>) and subsequently solvated in a cubic water box at 150 mM NaCl salinity, neutralized with extra ions employing VMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>). All simulations were carried out with periodic boundary conditions in a constant particle number, temperature, and pressure ensemble (NPT). The initial energy minimization and equilibration were carried out on general purpose supercomputers using NAMD 2.10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>). The system to be simulated was first subjected to 10000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization and equilibrated for two ns with harmonic restraints applied to all the heavy atoms of the protein. The simulation was then continued for 10 ns without restraints at a constant pressure of 1 bar using Nosé–Hoover Langevin piston barostat and at a constant temperature (310 K or 360 K) maintained using Langevin dynamics with a damping constant of 1.0 ps<sup>–1</sup>. Multiple time stepping was employed with an integration time step of 2.0 fs, short-range forces being evaluated every time step and long-range electrostatics evaluated every three time steps. Cutoff for short-range nonbonded interactions was 10.0 Å; long-range electrostatics was calculated using the particle-mesh Ewald method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darden et al., 1993</xref>). All bonds involving hydrogen in the protein were constrained using RATTLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen, 1983</xref>), while the geometries of water molecules were maintained using SETTLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miyamoto and Kollman, 1992</xref>). The resulting equilibrated structure was employed as the initial state for production simulations, carried out on the special purpose supercomputer Anton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shaw et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shaw et al., 2009</xref>) for ~1.1 μs, where constant temperature (310 K or 360 K) and constant pressure (p=1 bar) were maintained. Multiple time stepping was employed, with an integration time step of 2.0 fs. Short-range forces were evaluated every time step and long-range electrostatics every three time steps. Cutoff for the short-range nonbonded interactions was 9.5 Å; long-range electrostatics was calculated using the k-Gaussian Split Ewald method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shan et al., 2005</xref>) with a 64 × 64 × 64 grid. All bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained using SHAKE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ryckaert et al., 1977</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Agard Lab for helpful discussions.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Andreas Martin (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Art Horwich (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the present study, Elnathan et al. investigate the ATPase mechanism of the mitochondrial Hsp90 TRAP1, how its ATP hydrolysis is coupled to dimer asymmetry, and how hydrolysis-coupled conformational switching of protomers between buckled and straight states may rearrange client protein binding sites for remodeling. Using a combination of X-ray structure determination and kinetic crystallography, MD simulations, and elegant biochemical experiments with wild-type TRAP1 and mutant heterodimers, the authors provide strong evidence for sequential and deterministic ATP hydrolysis in the asymmetric dimer, which may induce a conformational flip to drive the ATPase cycle forward and promote the mechanical remodeling of clients. This study thus answers important, long-standing questions about the coordination of ATP hydrolysis and conformational changes of Hsp90.</p><p>All reviewers agreed in their overall positive assessments, sharing enthusiasm about this elegant study and its important novel insights into the ATP-hydrolysis cycle of Hsp90. However, they also agreed about revisions that will be necessary before we can make a final decision about publication. These revisions will, for instance, have to address discrepancies in the presented kinetics for dimer closure and ATP hydrolysis, and the derived model for the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle. Furthermore, the study in general lacks required statistical analyses, as there is no information provided about the number of measurement repeats, errors, or statistical significance of the results. The authors should also strongly consider to further experimentally support the main conclusion about conformational switching. It may indeed be possible to directly monitor the switch in protomer conformation upon ATP hydrolysis, using a heterodimer that is already available. The reviewers agreed that such measurements would significantly strengthen the conclusions of this manuscript and should be feasible to be completed within a couple of months.</p><p>As outlined below, the reviewers also request additional discussions, clarifications, and the presentation of more detailed data, for instance for the FRET-based measurements.</p><p>Critical revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have suggested that a set of experiments would be valuable to resolve some important questions. These proposed experiments should be considered seriously, and if not considered feasible then the revised manuscript should provide a careful justification for why that is the case.</p><p>These questions concern the proposal that preferential ATP hydrolysis in the buckled subunit of the closed asymmetric TRAP1 dimer leads to a conformational flip, in which the buckled, now ADP-bound subunit straightens and the straight subunit becomes buckled to facilitate the second ATP hydrolysis event. However, the authors were so far unable to directly monitor this conformational switch or show any succession of states. The current model is solely based on results for static, non-switching subunits that show differential hydrolysis activities and preferred buckled vs. straight conformations depending on the nucleotide state. The authors state in the discussion that &quot;kinetic rather than thermodynamic processes govern progression through the conformational cycle&quot;, but present mainly thermodynamic two state measurements that may also be explained by a shift in equilibrium. Experimentally monitoring the switch would therefore significantly strengthen the main conclusion and model.</p><p>By using spin-labeled heterodimers in DEER measurements, it may in fact be possible to directly detect the conformational switching upon ATP hydrolysis. The authors should consider spin-labeling the wild-type subunit in the wild-type / E115A heterodimer. Assuming an equal probability of WT and E115A subunits adopting the buckled conformation after adding ATP, about 50% of the WT subunits should be buckled with a small interprobe distance. ATP hydrolysis upon Mg addition is expected to induce straightening of those WT subunits, which should be accommodated by a shift to the larger interprobe distance. This state would then be stable due to the lack of ATP hydrolysis in the E115A subunit (as shown for the high-FRET closed state in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Heterodimers in which the E115A subunit was buckled and the labeled WT subunit was straight after ATP addition should not lead to an inverse change in DEER signal, because the EA subunit is hydrolysis incompetent.

The authors should at least comment on why it is valid to assume that the nucleotide replacement does not affect the local structure and dynamics of the ATPase sites, and why they assume that fixing the ATP lid, which directly faces the ATP phosphates and is disordered in the straight protomer, is not expected to have a significant effect on the MD simulations (in particular for the straight protomer).

Unfortunately the time scale of the kinetic switching is too fast even at reduced temperatures to permit the necessary handling required for following the switch post adding Mg. We had actually put significant effort into this previously. Since the review, we have now spent many months in an effort to carry out the proposed experiment using the hemi-hydrolyzing heterodimer (+/E115A). Unfortunately, despite repeated efforts and numerous control experiments, the behavior of this mutant in terms of the structural asymmetry as revealed by the DEER profiles did not allow for a clear interpretation of the results. That is, there appears to be an unexpected interaction between the mutation and the site of the spin probes. In an effort to sort out what was happening, we have placed an inactive version of the spin label on the opposite side of the active label on the protomers cis and trans to the E115A mutation and also swapped the SpyCatcher/SpyTag to rule out possible bias in conformation. All the results with the WT and Arg mutant data shown originally were recapitulated in the new experiments. We even went so far as to collect data on a different DEER instrument located in a different lab. To use this mutant for experiments beyond its inability to hydrolyze ATP will require further characterization including choosing new sites for the DEER probes and is unfortunately beyond the scope of this study.</p><p><italic>Other important revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The reviewers have raised a number of other issues that we feel could be addressed through careful revision of the manuscript, with explanations provided as needed, but without necessarily engaging in additional experiments.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Errors and number of repeats should be reported for all measurements.</italic> </p><p>We’ve now included the number of repeats for experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

Since the dimer reaches the same closed state irrespective of magnesium binding to the nucleotide, we can only speculate that the Mg-dependent hydrolysis happens more rapidly due to better water coordination by the metal. As for the concern regarding the use of human and zebrafish TRAP1, the 10-fold difference in apparent nucleotide affinity may just be due to species-specific tuning that exists in Hsp90 family. Using small-angle X-ray scattering, we previously showed that the asymmetric closed state is conserved across species (bacterial Hsp90 vs. human TRAP1) and also within orthologs (human vs. zebrafish TRAP1) (Lavery et al., 2014). Since the focus of this work is to look at the conserved asymmetric closed-state within these two species, we feel that it’s appropriate to use either one as a model system, especially when it is critical to enable the experiments (for example the crystallization).</p><p><italic>3) The authors performed MD simulations on buckled and straight protomers to explain the differential rates in ATP hydrolysis. However, for those MD simulations the authors replaced the ADP-AlF4 in the crystal structure with ATP-Mg and modeled the ATP lid region of both protomers to be identical and ordered.

It is surprising to me that having more and longer-lived waters in the straight compared to the buckled protomer would lead to slower hydrolysis.</italic> </p><p>The 1-day zTrap1 crystal structure with ATP bound reported here confirmed that replacement with ATP does not affect the local structure. In fact, all crystal structures of the closed states of TRAP1 obtained with ATP or multiple ATP analogs are essentially identical regarding the lid structures, so it’s safe to assume that nucleotide replacement does not significantly alter the local structures within the closed state. The part of the lid that is disordered and we modeled is not in direct contact with ATP (~15 Å away). Starting with identical lid conformations allows us to remove bias from different initial lid conformations in the simulations. In our MD simulations, the lid in the buckled protomer consistently exhibits more flexibility than the one in the straight protomer despite starting from the same state. This indicates that the simulation is long enough to overcome any bias from the initial structures. The observation that longer-lived waters correlated with slower hydrolysis also surprised us. The difference in water dynamics is only a correlation with hydrolysis rate. The precise mechanism remains to be explored, possibly through in-depth QM/MM studies.</p><p><italic>4) The authors present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> the single-turnover ATP hydrolysis of the WT / E115A heterodimer (induced by addition of hot/cold ATP-Mg), with a kcat of 0.37 min-1.

At high concentration, dimer-dimer interactions between TRAP1 may affect the ATPase rate. In any case, the figure is only meant to show that the E115A mutant works as expected in that it should abolish only one active site. Because the FRET/DEER experiments onward require the use of cysteine-free constructs, the relevant comparison for the FRET experiments is between cysteine-free TRAP1 and the labeled proteins. Since closure precedes hydrolysis, the observation of similar rates between heterodimer (wt/E115A) closure kinetics and steady-state turnover rate of cys-free TRAP1 suggests that indeed closure is rate limiting, since the cys-free TRAP1 is not trapped in the closed state and goes through the cycle.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows the kinetics of dimer closure induced by ATP / no Mg, with a rate of 0.116 min-1.

We have previously observed that the closure rate of TRAP1 is profoundly sensitive to perturbations in the nucleotide pocket: the rate of closure obtained with AMPPNP, ATP-BeF, ATP no Mg, etc. all differ by as much as an order of magnitude on the same construct (Partridge et al., 2014). The precise mechanism for this effect is still unknown. Subtle effects introduced by mutations in the construct (e.g. Glu115Ala mutation) or experimental conditions (e.g. omitting Mg<sup>2+</sup>) further compound the effect and make comparison across experiments with different constructs impossible.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, we only mean to show that both WT and E115A achieve the same amount of closed state. We show this through a kinetic trace rather than a single end-point to also show that they both start from the same open state and exhibit a similar trajectory.

In this context, the Arg-to-Ala substitution on the MD effectively mimics the addition of ADP to the wildtype protein: homodimers with this point mutant remain in the open state in presence of ATP, while the WT/R402A heterodimer accumulates in the closed state in the presence of ATP alone and reopens upon addition of Mg – as expected if it were properly mimicking the ADP state. Additionally, as evidenced by the fact that the nucleotide pocket can accommodate an ATP analog with a dye moiety attached at the γ-phosphate (Ratzke et al. 2012, see both references below), there are no steric constraints around the γ-phosphate that could be used to discriminate between nucleotide states.
