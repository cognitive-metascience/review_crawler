Due to its ability to rapidly spread in contaminated water, cholera poses a serious world health risk, affecting between 1 and 4 million people and causing 21,000–143,000 deaths per year, especially in poor or underdeveloped countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">WHO, 2019</xref>). Many disease-causing bacteria have developed mechanisms for rapidly evolving in response to environmental pressures, and these rapid changes are often responsible for the formation of new serogroups with pandemic potential. One way in which <italic>V. cholerae</italic> acquire new phenotypes is through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which is the direct movement of DNA from one organism to another. A major mode of HGT is natural competence for transformation in which bacteria are able to absorb free DNA from their surroundings using their competence-induced DNA-uptake complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Dubnau, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnston et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matthey and Blokesch, 2016</xref>). When sufficient homology is present between the incoming DNA and the bacterial genome, the absorbed genetic material can be integrated into the genome via double homologous recombination at the expense of the initial DNA region. As an example of the significant power of this natural competence for gene uptake, we previously witnessed the gain of an ~40 kbp O139-antigen cluster at the expense of the original ~30 kbp O1-antigen cluster through natural transformation (followed by strong selective pressure exerted by antibiotics or phages; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blokesch and Schoolnik, 2007</xref>), which significantly changed the phenotypes of these bacteria. And while Griffith’s experiment in 1928 unambiguously proved that transformation contributes to evolution and pathogen emergence, the general prevalence of non-degraded DNA with sufficient coding capacity has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Overballe-Petersen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Croucher et al., 2016</xref>), drawing inquiries as to whether this mode of HGT could be responsible for the major changes causing pandemic strains to emerge.</p><p>The induction of competence in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is tightly regulated (recently reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Metzger and Blokesch, 2016</xref>). Briefly, upon growth on the (molted) chitin-rich exoskeletons of zooplankton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pruzzo et al., 2008</xref>), the most abundant polysaccharide in the aquatic environment and therefore an important carbon source for chitinolytic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gooday, 1990</xref>), the expression pattern of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meibom et al., 2004</xref>) to render it naturally competent for genetic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meibom et al., 2005</xref>). Initially, when chitin degradation products are sensed by <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, it produces the regulatory protein TfoX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li and Roseman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meibom et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meibom et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamamoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dalia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yamamoto et al., 2014</xref>). This competence activator positively regulates the expression of the major DNA-uptake machinery in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matthey and Blokesch, 2016</xref>), providing a direct connection between growth on chitin and competence activation. Apart from TfoX, natural competence and transformation also depend on the master regulator of quorum sensing, HapR, in two ways: i) HapR acts as repressor of <italic>dns</italic>, which encodes an extracellular nuclease that inhibits transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blokesch and Schoolnik, 2008</xref>); and ii) HapR together with TfoX co-activates the transcription factor QstR, which further represses <italic>dns</italic> as well as activates several DNA-uptake genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lo Scrudato and Blokesch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jaskólska et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>While the chitin-induced DNA-uptake complex of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is able to absorb DNA from the surrounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seitz and Blokesch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seitz and Blokesch, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seitz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ellison et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2019</xref>), environmental DNA is often heavily degraded and therefore short in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Overballe-Petersen et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, free DNA is thought to originate from dead and therefore less fit bacteria, which renders the coding part of such genetic material non-favorable for naturally competent bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Redfield, 1988</xref>). In line with these arguments, we recently showed that <italic>V. cholerae</italic> does not solely rely on randomly released environmental DNA. Instead, it actively acquires ‘fresh’ DNA from healthy, living bacteria through kin-discriminatory neighbor predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borgeaud et al., 2015</xref>), which, conceptually, also occurs in other naturally competent bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Veening and Blokesch, 2017</xref>). Neighbor predation in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is accomplished by a contractile injection system known as the type VI secretion system (T6SS) that transports toxic effector proteins into prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cianfanelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Galán and Waksman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, the T6SS of pandemic <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is exquisitely co-regulated with its DNA-uptake machinery in a TfoX-, HapR-, and QstR-dependent manner when the bacterium grows on chitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borgeaud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Watve et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Metzger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jaskólska et al., 2018</xref>), which increases the chances of the competent bacterium to take up freshly released DNA compared to free-floating ‘unfit’ DNA. Notably, this coupling of competence and type VI secretion is also conserved in several non-cholera vibrios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Metzger et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we determined the extent of the absorbed and chromosomally-integrated prey-derived DNA. Previous studies had scored transformation events in other naturally competent Gram-negative bacteria such as <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, <italic>Helicobacter pylori,</italic> and <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bubendorfer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfsnes et al., 2018</xref>). These former studies, however, relied on the supplementation of large quantities of purified DNA (with up to 50 donor genome equivalents per cell; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bubendorfer et al., 2016</xref>) at the peak of the organism’s competence program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mell et al., 2014</xref>). Such an approach neither recapitulates the natural onset of competence nor discloses the fate of the DNA that is released from dying cells. Thus, to address these points and to mimic natural settings, we determined the frequency and extent of DNA exchanges under chitin-dependent co-culture conditions of two non-clonal <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains. We show that the DNA transfer frequency is significantly enhanced in T6SS-positive compared to T6SS-negative strains and that large genomic regions are transferred from the killed prey to the competent acceptor bacterium.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The T6SS fosters horizontal co-transfer events encompassing two selective markers</title><p>To compare the absorption of T6SS-mediated prey-derived DNA as opposed to environmental DNA (released through, for example, random lysis), we first scored the transformability of T6SS-positive (wild-type [WT] predator) and T6SS-negative (acceptor) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains, which would allow us to directly measure the contribution of the T6SS on gene uptake. These two strains were co-cultured with non-kin prey (donor) bacteria that were all derived from the environmental isolate Sa5Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keymer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borgeaud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matthey et al., 2018</xref>) and contained two antibiotic resistance genes in their genomes: 1) An <italic>aph</italic> cassette (Kan<sup>R</sup>), which was integrated in the <italic>vipA</italic> gene on the small chromosome (chr 2); and 2) a <italic>cat</italic> cassette (Cm<sup>R</sup>), which was inserted at variable distances from the <italic>aph</italic> cassette on the same chromosome or, alternatively, on the large chromosome (chr 1). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the WT predator strain efficiently absorbed and integrated the prey-released resistance cassettes (<italic>aph</italic> or <italic>cat</italic>), while the transformation efficiency for the T6SS-defective acceptor strain was significantly reduced (by 97.8% and 99.2% for <italic>aph</italic> and <italic>cat</italic>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, comparable frequencies were observed for both selective markers, suggesting that their acquisition does not significantly affect the strains’ fitness under non-selective conditions. We tested whether these transfer events were indeed competence-mediated and not based on other modes of HGT using a strain with a competence-related DNA import deficiency in that it lacked the competence protein ComEA that reels external DNA into the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seitz et al., 2014</xref>).

These transformations occurred, as expected, at lower rates compared to single-resistant clones and were mostly below the limit of detection for the T6SS-minus acceptor strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a gradual decrease in the frequencies the further the two resistance genes were apart from each other on the same chromosome, while a sharp drop occurred in the number of recovered transformants when the two resistance genes were carried on the two separate prey chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). While the latter scenario unambiguously requires at least two separate DNA-uptake events, the former, in which the resistance markers are carried in cis, could reflect a mix between single and multiple DNA absorption and integration events. When purified genomic DNA was instead provided as the transforming material to simplify the experiment and provide measurable results for all conditions, the in cis double-resistance acquisition efficiencies reached a comparable range to the in trans efficiencies when the two resistance genes were separated by at least 100 kbp. This suggested that the more efficient transformations of less than 100 kbp likely often occurred through a single acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the WT predator and T6SS-minus acceptor behaved similarly when purified DNA was provided, which makes sense as the need for active DNA release through neighbor predation was eliminated. Based on these data and the fact that the double-acquisition rates for the T6SS-minus acceptor strain were mostly below the detection limit in the prey scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we hypothesized that neighbor predation might foster the transfer of long DNA stretches, which frequently exceeded 50 kbp and therefore carry significant coding capacity. Moreover, the significantly lower double-acquisition rates when both cassettes are located in trans (e.g., on two different chromosomes) for the co-culturing conditions compared to the supplementation of purified gDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) led us speculate that long DNA stretches might be released from the killed prey thereby saturating the system against uptake of additional fragments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Comparative genomics of pandemic strain A1552 and environmental isolate Sa5Y</title><p>To test our hypothesis that the T6SS contributes to the horizontal transfer of large DNA fragments, we used a whole-genome sequencing (WGS) approach to properly outline the transferred DNA regions.

We expected to see significant differences in the pandemic A1552 strain compared to the environmental isolate Sa5Y in terms of the absence/presence of genomic features and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in core genes that would allow us to measure HGT events occurring between the strains, and several of these major differences are highlighted here. Indeed, as expected from its non-clinical origin, the environmental isolate lacked several genomic regions, including those that encode major virulence features, namely <italic>Vibrio</italic> pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (VPI-1, VPI-2), <italic>Vibrio</italic> seventh pandemic islands I and II (VSP-I, VSP-II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dziejman et al., 2005</xref>), the cholera toxin prophage CTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waldor and Mekalanos, 1996</xref>), and the WASA-1 element. In addition, the strain’s O-antigen cluster differed significantly from the O1-encoding genes of pandemic strain A1552 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The region that differed the most between both strains was the integron island, which is consistent with the role of this assembly platform in fostering the incorporation of exogenous open reading frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mazel, 2006</xref>). Given these major differences between strain A1552 and Sa5Y and, in addition, an overall SNP frequency of approximately 1 in 55 nucleotides for conserved genes, we concluded that HGT events occurring between these two strains on chitinous surfaces could be precisely scored using short-read sequencing. Apart from this important genomic information, we also noted that the pandemic strains as well as Sa5Y contained previously unrecognized rRNA operons, with nine or ten rRNA clusters in total compared to the initially reported eight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heidelberg et al., 2000</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48212.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparative genomics of pandemic strain A1552 and the environmental isolate Sa5Y.</title><p>The genomic sequences of chr 1 and 2 of Sa5Y (green) were segmented in 10-kbp-long fragments and aligned against the respective chromosome of the reference A1552 (red).

To do this, we co-cultured the predator (A1552) and prey (Sa5Y) strains on chitinous surfaces for 30 hr without any deliberate selection pressure. To be able to afterwards screen for the transfer of at least one gene, we first integrated an <italic>aph</italic> cassette within the <italic>vipA</italic> of strain Sa5Y, which concomitantly deactivated the prey’s T6SS, to select kanamycin-resistant transformants of strain A1552. Using this system, resistant transformants of A1552 were selected at an average frequency of 1.8 × 10<sup>−4</sup> after the 30 hr co-culturing on chitin, and 20 of those transformants were randomly picked for further analysis. After three independent experiments, the whole genome of each of the 60 transformants was sequenced, and the reads were mapped to either the predator’s or the prey’s genome sequence (see Materials and methods section for detailed bioinformatic analysis). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, apart from the common acquisition of the <italic>aph</italic> resistance cassette, the location and the size of the prey-donated genomic region differed significantly between most transformants. Previous estimates of the average length of total acquired DNA were made in experiments using purified donor gDNA and were considered to be ~23 kbp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, we observed in these new experiments that the average length of the total acquired DNA, meaning the DNA surrounding the <italic>aph</italic> cassette plus any transferred regions elsewhere on either of the two chromosomes, was almost 70 kbp and therefore significantly larger than the previous estimates. Around 15% of all transformants acquired and integrated more than 100 kbp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which was previously considered unlikely due to rareness of such long DNA fragments in the environment. Consistent with the principle of natural transformation, it should be noted that the new DNA was acquired through double homologous recombination such that it replaced the initial DNA region and the overall genome size did not significantly change. Further analysis indicated that about 50% of the strains experienced a single HGT event around the <italic>aph</italic> cassette, while the others exchanged regions in up to eight different locations on the two chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Finally, we analyzed the length of continuous DNA stretches that were acquired from the prey and observed that those ranged from a few kbp up to 168 kbp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that <italic>V. cholerae</italic> can acquire large genomic regions from killed neighbors with an average exchange of more than 50 kbp or ~50 genes. Notably, our observed recombination events were significantly larger than the mean recombination event size of ~4 kbp that was recently reported for surface-grown <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowley et al., 2018</xref>). In their study, Cowley et al. observed that competence-mediated homologous recombination was more likely to occur upon direct cell-to-cell contact, which the authors mimicked by growing <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> on synthetic biofilm-like assemblages on agar plates or on human lung epithelial cell lines. These conditions were used to recapitulate the natural nasopharynx environment in which this competent bacterium is frequently encountered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowley et al., 2018</xref>). Their data combined with our findings therefore contradict the notion that natural transformation is unlikely to serve DNA repair purposes or for the acquisition of new genetic information due to the quick fragmentation of free DNA in natural environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Overballe-Petersen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48212.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based quantification of horizontally acquired DNA.</title><p>WGS analysis of transformants after prey killing and DNA transfer.

First, the acceptor strain was grown in a monoculture immediately supplemented with purified genomic DNA (gDNA) derived from the same donor (prey) strain as described above. Notably, when the gDNA was added at the start of the chitin-dependent culture, no transformants were reproducibly detected from three independent biological experiments, suggesting that free DNA is rapidly degraded under such conditions.

ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Doing so led to similar transformation frequencies as those observed for the prey-released DNA caused by T6SS attacks (condition <bold>①</bold>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). WGS of 20 transformants from two biologically independent experiments likewise resulted in similar DNA acquisition patterns with average and maximum DNA acquisitions of 70 kbp and 188 kbp, respectively, and the presence of multiple exchanged regions of varying sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>). While we cannot entirely exclude that the maximum length of individual DNA stretches was biased by the purification step, despite the fact that we chose a method that was designed for chromosomal DNA isolation of 20–150 kbp sized fragments (see Materials and methods), our results suggest that the maximum DNA acquisition length of single fragments is probably reached between 100–110 kbp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, the comparable acquisition patterns between conditions ① and <bold>②</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) imply that the prey-released DNA in condition ① is neither heavily fragmented nor is its accessibility or absorption by the competent acceptor bacterium significantly hindered due to, for example, DNA-binding proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Prey-exerted T6SS counter attacks do not change the DNA transfer pattern</title><p>Since the <italic>aph</italic> cassette was located within the T6SS sheath protein gene <italic>vipA</italic> in the above experiments, we wondered if this T6SS inactivation biased the DNA transfer efficiency.

As shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), similar transformation frequencies were observed independent of the position of the <italic>aph</italic> cassette. Moreover, WGS of 2 × 20 transformants showed similar average and maximum DNA acquisition values (55.7 kbp and 227.4 kbp, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) as well as similar distribution patterns around the resistance marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, while not statistically supported, it appeared as if these conditions were prone to the acquisition of multiple non-connected regions, as transformants with only single/connected exchanges dropped from ~50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> for condition ①) to around 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> for condition ③). Based on this observation, we hypothesized that the now-restored T6SS-mediated killing capacity of the prey led to the additional release of genomic DNA from the predator, which interfered with the uptake of prey-released DNA.

The rationale behind this approach was a recent population genomic study on <italic>Vibrio cyclitrophicus</italic> that suggested the mobilization of the entire chromosome 2 and caused the authors to speculate: ‘how often and by what mechanism are entire chromosomes mobilized?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shapiro et al., 2012</xref>). In the current study, we were unable to experimentally show such large transfer events. We considered four potential reasons for the absence of such large transfers: 1) mild fragmentation of prey-released DNA that excluded fragments above ~200 kb; 2) limited DNA uptake and periplasmic storage capacity of the acceptor strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seitz and Blokesch, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seitz et al., 2014</xref>); 3) limited protection of the incoming single-stranded DNA by dedicated proteins (such as Ssb and DprA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mortier-Barrière et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suckow et al., 2011</xref>); or 4) lethality of larger exchanges due to the presence of multiple toxin/antitoxin modules within the integron island on chr 2 of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iqbal et al., 2015</xref>). While technical limitations did not allow us to address the first three points, we followed up on the last idea by repeating the above-described experiments using prey strains in which the <italic>aph</italic> cassette was integrated on the large chromosome 1 (inside <italic>lacZ</italic>). We used these to test three (co-)culture conditions in which the prey strain was either T6SS-positive (condition <bold>⑥</bold>), T6SS-negative (condition ⑦), or replaced by purified gDNA (condition <bold>⑧</bold>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, the <italic>aph</italic> cassette was again transferred with high efficiency from the killed prey strain to the acceptor strain. However, comparing conditions <bold>⑥</bold> (co-culture conditions) and <bold>⑧</bold> (prey-derived purified gDNA as transforming material) revealed a small but significant transformation increase for the latter condition (~4 fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Based on these data, we speculate that the larger size of chr 1 (~3 Mb) compared to chr 2 (~1 Mb) slightly lowers the probability of acquiring the <italic>aph</italic> cassette when released from the killed prey that carried the resistance marker on chr 1. Indeed, the cassette’s relative occupancy per chromosome is reduced by one third for the larger chromosome 1 compared to the smaller chromosome 2, which would reduce the chance of absorbing the <italic>aph</italic> cassette if it was embedded in large chromosomal fragment(s). This effect would become negligible, however, when purified gDNA is provided, most likely due to the size constraints of the purification procedure (max. 150 kb), which ultimately results in more or less equally sized DNA fragments. Consistent with this idea was the finding that purified gDNA from all those prey strains described in this study resulted in the same level of transformation no matter where the selective marker was located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we randomly picked 20 transformants from two biologically independent experiments for each of these three experimental conditions (⑥ to ⑧) and sequenced their genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplements 7 to 9</xref>). The analysis of these transformants showed that the average and maximum DNA acquisition values were highly comparable to those described above for DNA exchanges on chromosome 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and that multiple exchanged regions were likewise observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We therefore conclude that prey-derived transforming DNA can equally modify both chromosomes. Moreover, our data suggest that consecutive stretches of exchanged DNA above ~200 kbp either do not occur or occur at levels below the detection limit of this study, and that this size limitation is not caused by the toxin/antitoxin–module-containing integron island on chr 2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the data presented above, we conclude that T6SS-mediated predation followed by DNA uptake leads to the exchange of large DNA regions that can bring about bacterial evolution. This finding is consistent with the heterogeneous environmental <italic>V. cholerae</italic> populations that were observed in cholera-endemic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Faruque et al., 2004</xref>). Still, an open question that remains is why pandemic cholera isolates are seemingly clonal in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mutreja et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Domman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weill et al., 2019</xref>), and we propose two explanations for this. First, sampling strategies might be biased for the selection of the most pathogenic strains and, concomitantly, exclude less virulent variants that have undergone HGT events. Secondly, transformation-inhibiting nucleases similar to Dns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blokesch and Schoolnik, 2008</xref>) have recently spread throughout pandemic <italic>V. cholerae</italic> isolates as part of mobile genetic elements (experimentally shown for VchInd5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dalia et al., 2015</xref>] and predicted for SXT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blokesch, 2017</xref>]), which makes these pandemic strains less likely to undergo HGT events. One could also argue that pandemic <italic>V. cholerae</italic> are rarely exposed to competence-inducing chitinous surfaces due to the prevalence of inter-household transmission throughout cholera outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clemens et al., 2017</xref>). Yet in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT) assays showed strong human immune responses against proteins of the DNA-uptake pilus that fosters natural transformation, kin recognition, and chitin colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meibom et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seitz and Blokesch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2019</xref>), which contradicts this idea. Indeed, the major pilin of the DNA-uptake pilus, PilA, was most frequently identified by IVIAT together with the outer-membrane secretin PilQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hang et al., 2003</xref>), which suggests that the bacteria encounter competence-inducing conditions either before entering the human host or after its colonization. The latter option is not, however, supported by in vivo expression data from human volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lombardo et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, our work shows the incredible DNA exchange potential that chitin-induced <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains exert under co-culture conditions and future studies are therefore required to better understand strain diversity in clinical and environmental settings in the absence of sampling biases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>)</td><td><italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 El Tor, strain A1552 (Primary strain)</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9473029">9473029</ext-link> <break/>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574591">30574591</ext-link> (genome sequence)</td><td/><td>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for strains and plasmids used in this study</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>)</td><td><italic>V. cholerae</italic>, strain Sa5Y (Secondary strain)</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17449702">17449702</ext-link> <break/>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574591">30574591</ext-link> (genome sequence)</td><td/><td>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for strains and plasmids used in this study</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>TCBS agar, selective medium</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>86348–500G</td><td>Additional, standard growth media are described under growth conditions</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Pwo SuperYield DNA Polymerase</td><td>Roche / <break/>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>4340850001</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>GoTaq G2 DNA Polymerase</td><td>Promega</td><td>M7848</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Genomic-tip 100/G (DNA purification)</td><td>Qiagen</td><td>10243</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Genomic DNA Buffer Set</td><td>Qiagen</td><td>19060</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids, and growth conditions</title><p>The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

To visualize the overall architecture and differences, circular plots in which each 10 kb fragment was linked to its reference genome counterpart and colored according to the number of differences were made in R using the circlize package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gu et al., 2014</xref>).

This stock is resistant to streptomycin, which is consistent with most literature reports on strain N16961, while the original reference strain N16961 remained sensitive to streptomycin according to its genome sequence. This difference suggests that mutagenesis event(s), including the characteristic streptomycin-resistance mutation within <italic>rpsL</italic> (encoding for RpsL[K43R]) must have occurred while the strain was domesticated. Comparative genomics between our laboratory stock of N16961 and the reference genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heidelberg et al., 2000</xref>) showed a high level of sequence identity, though also confirmed the previously reported inversion around the origin of chromosome 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Val et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, significant differences were observed between the two N16961 genome sequences with respect to the number and arrangement of the ribosomal RNA clusters, which could have resulted from assembly artifacts. Indeed, while Heidelberg and colleagues described the presence of eight rRNA operons (16S-23S-5S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heidelberg et al., 2000</xref>), we found ten rRNA operons (plus an additional 5S copy close to the tRNA-Thr). The only other major differences observed between the strains were in genes VC1620 and <italic>vasX</italic> (VCA0020) on chromosome 1 and 2, respectively, as also mentioned in the main text (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; marked with * and #). VC1620, or <italic>frhA,</italic> on chr 1 encodes a large protein with several cadherin tandem repeat domains, the number of which vary among different <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Syed et al., 2009</xref>). Due to the repetitive nature of this DNA region, an assembly mistake in either of the two genome assemblies can therefore not be excluded. The sequence of the newly sequenced stock of N16961 was, however, identical to the region in pandemic strain A1552 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). For the discrepancy within <italic>vasX</italic> on chr 2, we observed a significant number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; n = 11) or nucleotide insertions (n = 14) within this 3,272-bp-long gene. One of these nucleotide insertions caused a frameshift that therefore resulted in a premature stop codon. As BLAST analyses suggested that this change was strain specific and not previously observed, we Sanger sequenced the corresponding DNA region using the same genomic DNA preparation that was used for the long-read PacBio sequencing, which allowed us to elucidate whether the mutations reflected a lab domestication event or whether the PacBio sequence was of low quality in this specific area of the genome. The latter turned out to be the case, as the mutations described above were absent from the Sanger sequencing reads. We therefore conclude that the two genomes are highly identical and that the major differences involve imperfect rRNA cluster assembly in the reference genome, which resulted in the underestimation of the number of rRNA clusters and the inverted assembly around the origin of replication of chr 1.</p><p><italic>V. cholerae</italic> O1 El Tor (Inaba) strain A1552 (formerly known as 92A1552-Rif<sup>r</sup>) is a rifampicin-resistant derivative of strain 92A1552 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yildiz and Schoolnik, 1998</xref>), which was isolated in California from a traveler returning from South America.

The genome architecture, however, was not maintained, as strain A1552 had undergone a large inversion of approximately 2.7 Mbp between two rRNA clusters on chr 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; genome sequence inverted to simplify visualization), a finding that is consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kemter et al., 2018</xref>).

If multiple possibilities with the same number of mismatches were possible, the possibilities were kept for later processing. The alignments were performed with an in-house code derived from the fetchGWI tool [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tagger/files/fetchGWI-tagger/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/tagger/files/fetchGWI-tagger/</ext-link>], but other tools such as BWA or bowtie2 would equally qualify for the same purpose. The results of this first analysis phase were obtained as tab-delimited lists of read pairs with their alignment positions, number of mismatches for each of the reads of the pair, and number of matching positions with the same number of mismatches.</p><p>The second step of the analysis consisted of a C program that parsed the tab-delimited file of the previous step and recorded the accumulated coverage and the observed nucleotide for each position of each of the donors’ and acceptors’ chromosomes. For each analysis, two separate recordings were kept: the first recording took only those read pairs into account that showed zero mismatches together with a unique unambiguous matching position, while the second recording took all other matches into account (e.g., a coverage of 1 was counted in each matched position regardless of whether the match was unique or not). At the end of this process, regions with continuous coverage were created by looking for positions in the first recording (unique and exact matches) for which the observed coverage was at least 3. The start and end positions of such continuous stretches were determined by extending as far as possible from this seed position, taking into account the total coverage from both recordings. If the length of the so-defined fragment was at least 500 nucleotides it was kept for output. The output consisted of a FASTA file containing all the defined fragments and the FASTA header of each fragment. This header recorded which reference was covered (e.g., which strain [acceptor or donor] and which chromosome [large chr 1 or small chr 2]). For each position, the nucleotide that composed more than half of the coverage of that position was generated in the output. If no single nucleotide represented more than half of the coverage, an N was used.</p><p>The expectation was that the fragments obtained in the previous step constituted a full coverage of the transformant, which had inherited its genomic material mostly from the parental acceptor strain with some DNA regions originating from the donor strain by HGT; this referred particularly to those regions containing the antibiotic resistance cassette, which was used as selective marker. A global DNA alignment for each output fragment was therefore performed by mapping the fragments onto the corresponding chromosomes of the donor and acceptor strains. Since we determined that the donor and acceptor genomes differed on average by 1 nucleotide every 55 nucleotides, it was expected that several mismatches would be found when a fragment originating from the donor strain was aligned to the genome of the acceptor strain. The first and last mismatches of those fragments were defined as outer bounds of the transferred fragments, as they arguably represented the minimal length of the transferred DNA region. The summary data of these alignments and boundary information were determined using Perl scripts as were those regions of the acceptor genomes that were not covered by reads derived from the analyzed transformant (e.g., transformed acceptor strain). The output of those scripts (available on GitHub: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/sib-swiss/VibrioCholerae_HGT">https://github.com/sib-swiss/VibrioCholerae_HGT</ext-link>) was then used to generate a final table of transferred segments as well as summary plots by applying the R package circlize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gu et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, the data were transferred to Excel to calculate the total length of horizontally acquired DNA per transformant as well as the number of HGT events per transformant. The GraphPad Prism software was used for graphic visualization. To validate the bioinformatic approach, the mapped reads obtained for &gt;50 samples were also visually inspected for transferred regions using the software Geneious.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistically significant differences were determined by the two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test where indicated. For natural transformation assays, data were log-transformed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keene, 1995</xref>) before statistical testing.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript is extending the observations published by your group in 2015, where you showed that the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> T6SS, which serves as a predatory killing device, is part of the competence regulon in this bacterium. You had also shown that deliberate killing of nonimmune cells via competence-mediated induction of T6SS released DNA and made it accessible for horizontal gene transfer, but the precise extent of HGT remained unknown, as did the size of the DNA that could be taken up and recombined in conditions such as the ones used in the current study, which are closer to what happens in the real world than the conditions used in other previous studies on different competent models.</p><p>These questions are now expertly clarified with data gathered from the different experiments presented here. The studies answer several pending questions that are of interest for a large community of microbiologists interested in the bacterial evolutionary mechanism of HGT and its broader impact. In particular, you established that the size of DNA that could be taken up under the investigated conditions is remarkable, even more than 150kb, which is much larger than what was considered so far. You also show that in many cases there are multiple DNA fragments from different genome locations that are integrated by homologous recombination in a single clone – you exactly mapped all of these events by establishing the genome sequence of multiple clones in a set of various conditions and controls.</p><p>There are nevertheless a number of points that need to clarified before the paper can be accepted:</p><p>1) It is interesting that the authors observe that two markers cannot be transferred when they are on separate chromosomes during T6SS-mediated HGT but can be transferred when purified gDNA is used. In particular, in the subsection “T6SS-mediated DNA exchanges are not limited to the small chromosome”, in the discussion on the effect of the size of chr1 and chr2 on the frequency of the <italic>aph</italic> transfer is not clear. Each cell only carries one copy of each chromosome, so there should be only one <italic>aph</italic> equivalent par genome, whatever is the hosting chromosome. However, the different figures show many co-transformants carrying chr1 fragments when <italic>aph</italic> is on chr2, and vice versa. Possible explanations should be discussed in more details in the manuscript.</p><p>2) The authors concluded that T6SS-independent prey lysis results in exchange of shorter DNA fragments. To support this idea, they calculated the average and maximal length of acquired DNA and the number of exchanged regions under conditions where both donor and acceptor strains were T6SS-. However, such condition resulted in much less transformants. Another control condition would be to mix a T6SS-negative acceptor with a donor strain that can be lysed by for example inducing a phage lytic gene carried on a plasmid to lyse the donor cells in T6SS-independent manner.</p><p>3) The authors quantitatively compared the transfer of DNA under co-culture conditions or monoculture with purified gDNA. An estimation of DNA concentration released upon T6SS-mediated killing in the co-culture should be provided. Similarly, instead of total amount of gDNA added, authors should estimate what was the concentration of gDNA in the monoculture experiments. Are these comparable?</p><p>4) Statistical analysis of differences between data provided in Figure 1B and 1C should be provided to support certain claims in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48212.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] There are a number of points that need to clarified before the paper can be accepted:</p><p>1) It is interesting that the authors observe that two markers cannot be transferred when they are on separate chromosomes during T6SS-mediated HGT but can be transferred when purified gDNA is used.

We would like to note though that the comment addressed two different aspects: First, that two markers are rarely transferred under co-culture conditions when they are located on different chromosomes (Figure 1) and second, that the transfer efficiency is slightly lower when the <italic>aph</italic> cassette is integrated into chr 1 compared to chr 2 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Concerning the second point: It is of course true that each cell carries only one copy of each chromosome. However, their sizes differ with the large chromosome (chr 1) being ~3 Mbp and the small chromosome (chr 2) only 1 Mbp. As such, the <italic>aph</italic> cassette occupies a smaller proportion of the total chr 1 compared to the total chr 2 (a ~3-fold difference). Thus, if major parts of the chromosomes are released and more or less kept intact while the transfer occurs, the chances for the <italic>aph</italic> acquisition is most likely reduced to one third if the cassette is located on chr 1 compared to chr 2 due to this size difference. This could explain the slightly lower transformation frequency. However, the chromosomal size difference would become irrelevant when purified DNA is provided, as the purified DNA is equally fragmented into DNA stretches of max. 150 kb. However, please note that we didn’t want to imply in any way that this 4-fold difference is of major biological significance. Instead, this part of the Discussion primarily serves to address the statistical difference that we observed and to provide a potential explanation of the latter, especially when compared to the purified DNA data.</p><p>Concerning the first point (Figure 1): Co-transfers indeed occur – also in trans (that is, on the other chromosome) though not in the majority of transformants and at vastly different positions. The transfer of two specific loci (e.g., the two resistance markers), however, will again depend on the location of the two cassettes and whether the fragments in which they are integrated are saturating the system or not. This is unlikely to be the case for purified gDNA, due to the size limitation that resulted from the purification method.</p><p>Overall, it should be noted though that the experiments described in Figure 1 were meant to introduce the question and provide the first hint that we are dealing with the transfer of large DNA regions, an idea that is then further addressed throughout the rest of the manuscript. Indeed, as discussed in the text, these data do not directly show whether one large DNA fragment was absorbed and integrated or two independent events occurred with the exception of the condition in which both resistance markers are on separate chromosomes (which by definition requires independent transfers). This scenario and the data we obtained is one of the most intriguing parts of Figure 1, as double resistance rarely occurs in co-culture experiments in which T6SS-mediated DNA release is involved, which is in contrast to gDNA supplementation conditions. This difference indirectly suggests that the prey-released DNA is saturating the system and that the released DNA is probably not fragmented to the same extent as the purified DNA (e.g., below 150kb in size). To highlight this point even better and to also address point #4 mentioned below, we now included an additional supplementary figure in which we directly compare the transformation frequencies of Figure 1B and 1C. Please note that we did not want to replace the initial panels 1B and 1C by the combined figure, as we realized that readers could get slightly lost if confronted with all the different conditions in a single panel. We hope that this is acceptable for the reviewers and editors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors concluded that T6SS-independent prey lysis results in exchange of shorter DNA fragments.

And while we agree that the proposed experiment would be exciting from a genetic engineering standpoint, the results would be i) strongly biased and ii) not provide any novel information about the natural system that we aimed at elucidating in this study. Please let us explain these two points further. Why biased? Because the timing of induction of the plasmid-encoded suicide toxin gene (such as a lytic phage-derived lysis gene) would strongly determine when the prey DNA is released. This might influence transformation in a comparable manner as we showed for the supplemented gDNA experiments. Indeed, the released DNA would be quickly degraded at early time points (e.g., when <italic>V. cholerae</italic>’s nuclease Dns is produced and active) while it might serve as transforming material at high cell densities. However, in the latter case, the system would be further biased, as the inducer might not reach all cells that are deeply embedded in chitin-attached biofilms equally compared to those that are surface-exposed or planktonic and therefore not in close contact with an acceptor strain. Hence, three different outcomes can be envisioned from the proposed experiment: first, the transformation data would look similar to T6SS-mediated prey lysis; second, the data would mimic the random lysis data, or, due to enhanced DNA release, the supplemented gDNA data; or third, the data would look completely different from the all other scenarios. We truly believe that none of these potential outcomes would contradict the current manuscript and neither strengthen the overall conclusions of our study, as such a genetically engineered prey suicide system is hugely artificial and not driven by the acceptor/predator strain itself. Indeed, the outcome would primarily dependent on the initial optimization steps apart from the fact that setting up such an artificial system would be very time consuming (estimated as around 6 months for the cloning, bringing it onto the chromosomes (as <italic>V. cholerae</italic> doesn’t like plasmids), induction optimization protocol without and ultimately with chitinous surfaces, the real experiment in three independent biological replicates, the isolation of the transformants, high quality DNA extractions from 40-60 transformants, NGS, and the data processing and analysis) and costly. We therefore disagree that this experiment would represent a “control condition” and respectfully refrain from doing it, as we truly believe that the results would not provide novel insight on the natural system of T6SS-mediated killing combined with DNA uptake.</p><p>The point that transformants are rare under such random lysis conditions is true and, in fact, of prime importance. Indeed, we strongly emphasized this point in the manuscript as the combination of seeing that transformants are rare (e.g., 1% compared to interbacterial killing conditions) and that these rare transformants carry less transferred material gives strong indication of the benefit that arises from coupling the two systems (T6SS-mediated killing and DNA uptake). Hence, it is transformation quantity and quality that changes, which is what we emphasized in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors quantitatively compared the transfer of DNA under co-culture conditions or monoculture with purified gDNA. An estimation of DNA concentration released upon T6SS-mediated killing in the co-culture should be provided. Similarly, instead of total amount of gDNA added, authors should estimate what was the concentration of gDNA in the monoculture experiments. Are these comparable?</p></disp-quote><p>This is again a very valid and interesting point. Indeed, the amount of gDNA that we added was based on optimized protocols that we established over the past 15 years. However, as suggested, we now included more information in the revised manuscript and added estimations of how much prey DNA might be maximally released. Briefly, the concentration of supplemented gDNA was 2 µg for all corresponding experiments. Due to a final volume of 1 ml (information added to manuscript) the final concentration was therefore 2µg/ml. For the coculturing conditions we now provided two estimates in the manuscript: the first one is based on the inoculum (e.g., if all prey cells that we initially added into the mixture would lyse). This value corresponds to ~0.2µg/ml. The second estimate is based on the number of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cells that can be recovered after incubation on chitin for 30h (~0.4µg/ml). Thus, even if all prey cells would lyse, which is unlikely to occur as many of these cells will not be in direct contact with a predatory bacterium, the total amount of prey-released DNA would still be lower than the supplemented gDNA in the corresponding experiments. These data therefore further strengthen the findings that neighbor predation strongly enhances HGT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Statistical analysis of differences between data provided in Figure 1B and 1C should be provided to support certain claims in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this point and thank the reviewers for bringing it up. We now added a new supplementary figure that combines the panels 1B and 1C, as described above under point #1. Statistical analysis has been performed for these comparative data and the differences are indicated. As the reviewers can now appreciate, the statistical analysis fully supports our claims.</p></body></sub-article></article>
