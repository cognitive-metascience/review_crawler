Often, this encoding is thought to be largely captured by the cells’ receptive fields, so that a cell’s activity reflects an increase of the preferred stimulus feature inside its receptive field. In the retina, for example, neurons generally respond strongly to local or global increases in preferred visual contrast inside their spatial receptive fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuffler, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meister and Berry, 1999</xref>). Thus, when a new image comes into view, increases in spiking activity of ganglion cells are expected to represent image parts that contain large local contrast changes. During natural vision, however, images do not arrive in isolation, but are embedded in a continuous, strongly structured stream of visual stimulation. Brief periods of relatively stable fixation are interspersed with sudden shifts in the direction of gaze (‘saccades’), so that images come in rapid sequences, separated by brief transition periods. Saccades of the eyes or head are ubiquitous among vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Land, 2015</xref>), including mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sakatani and Isa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), and they can exert a strong influence on ganglion cell spiking, evoking transient spike bursts in some ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Noda and Adey, 1974</xref>) and suppressing activity in others by triggering inhibition in the retinal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roska and Werblin, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Yet, despite the abundance of saccades and their strong influence on the natural flow of visual stimuli, relatively little is known about how these natural stimulus dynamics influence the processing of visual information in early vision. In particular, systematic investigations are lacking of how the previously fixated visual pattern affects the encoding of a newly arriving image. Moreover, the rapid image sequences and the strong, global motion signal during a saccadic transition appear to trigger specific excitatory and inhibitory circuit elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Passaglia et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roska and Werblin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geffen et al., 2007</xref>), which may alter the processing of visual information compared to responses under simpler, more traditional laboratory stimuli.</p><p>In particular, interactions of local excitatory signals from presynaptic bipolar cells with the interconnected network of amacrine cells have an enormous potential for shaping ganglion cell responses in a nonlinear, stimulus-context-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gollisch and Meister, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwartz and Rieke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Taylor and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Masland, 2012b</xref>). Various examples have shown that such interactions can mediate specific, functionally relevant response characteristics beyond contrast detection inside the receptive field for a number of ganglion cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Olveczky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Münch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bölinger and Gollisch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vaney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). The examples have led to the hypothesis that many amacrine cells function in a highly task-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Masland, 2012a</xref>), making it difficult to study their influence on retinal signal processing with simple, generic stimuli and suggesting to systematically explore the characteristics of stimulus encoding under more natural stimulus dynamics. A particularly suited stimulus context appears to be given by eye-movement-like rapid image transitions. These are characterized by a fairly stereotypic temporal structure of alternating image fixations and shifts, yet the rapid image sequences and the strong, global motion stimulus during a transition can be expected to trigger various neuronal interactions in the retinal network.</p><p>We therefore investigated how ganglion cells in the mouse retina encode stimulus transitions across saccade-like image shifts. This revealed that, contrary to common stimulus–response models, particular ganglion cells robustly responded to recurrences of the same image across the transition, but were suppressed when the image position changed. Finally, a combination of pharmacological interventions, intracellular recordings, and computational modeling indicated that this unexpected sensitivity to image recurrence is mediated by a circuit of serial inhibition, demonstrating how saccade-triggered inhibitory interactions can alter retinal stimulus encoding.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sensitivity to image recurrence across saccade-like transitions</title><p>To explore how the retina encodes visual information in the presence of saccade-like image transitions, we investigated how responses of ganglion cells in the mouse retina depend on the spatial pattern of the fixated images prior to and after the transition. We recorded the spiking activity of individual ganglion cells in the isolated mouse retina with multi-electrode arrays while stimulating the photoreceptors with saccade-like shifts of a spatial grating. After each shift, the grating stopped randomly for a brief fixation at one out of four different spatial phases, here called positions 1 to 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), resulting in 16 possible transitions. Each transition occurred many times in this random sequence, and we collected the responses from all instances of a transition to compute a firing rate profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top). To compare responses from all 16 transitions, we arranged these profiles in a matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom) to denote the dependence on the positions prior to the transition (‘starting position’) and afterwards (‘target position’). The response matrix of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows that this particular sample cell preferred certain target positions (here position 2 or 3), and responses were further enhanced when the starting position was among the reversed positions (here 1 and 4). This response structure is consistent with the classical idea of receptive field activation, yielding the strongest responses when, after the transition, the stimulus inside the receptive field (better) matches the cell’s preferred contrast.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22431.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sensitivity to image recurrence by retinal ganglion cells under saccade-like image shifts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Space-time representation of the saccade stimulus. The stimulus consisted of a spatial grating that was repeatedly shifted in a saccade-like fashion during 100 ms and then stopped randomly at one out of four different grating positions, where it then remained fixed for 800 ms before the next shift.

The sample cell of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> fired a spike burst during each saccade-like transition. It then displayed a second pronounced spike burst about 100 to 150 ms after the onset of the new fixation, but only for such transitions where the grating returned to the same spatial phase, that is, where starting and target position were equal. Clearly, this spike burst during the new fixation did not encode the occurrence of a particular preferred grating position or an increase in preferred contrast. Rather, this response marked such transitions across which changes in the stimulus pattern were minimal.</p><p>These distinct response peaks for transitions with equal starting and target position were characteristic for about 5–10% of the recorded ganglion cells, and we will here refer to these cells as image-recurrence-sensitive (IRS) cells (see ‘Materials and methods’ for a quantitative criterion of detecting IRS cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

They were Off cells with transient responses to negative contrast steps and strongly biphasic spike-triggered averages under white-noise flicker of light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The biphasicness of the filters was particularly striking, and we quantified this by computing a biphasic index as the size ratio between the second filter peak and the first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zaghloul et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garvert and Gollisch, 2013</xref>). This showed that, indeed, filters of identified IRS cells were systematically more biphasic than for other recorded cells (IRS cells: 1.04 ± 0.40, mean ± SD; other cells: 0.66 ± 0.52; p&lt;10<sup>−30</sup>; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Furthermore, IRS cells showed fairly large receptive fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>; average diameter of 275 ± 40 µm, mean ± SD), and the spatial arrangement of receptive fields indicated that they border on each other with little overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,F</xref>), Moreover, neighboring cells displayed correlated spiking at short latencies of approximately 5 ms and smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,G</xref>), characteristic of gap-junction coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu and Bloomfield, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Together, these data suggest that the IRS cells identified in our recordings correspond to a single ganglion cell type. Moreover, the transient responses, biphasic filter shapes, and fairly large receptive field sizes of IRS cells match the functional characteristics of transient Off-alpha cells in mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huberman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Wyk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baden et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, we found, as discussed in more detail below, that IRS cells can be targeted in patch-clamp recordings by aiming for cells with the morphological characteristics of transient Off alpha cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murphy and Rieke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Margolis and Detwiler, 2007</xref>), indicating that it is this specific type of ganglion cells that constitutes the class of IRS cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Influence of stimulus history on the encoding of image recurrence</title><p>The responses of IRS cells clearly display a strong dependence on stimulus history across the image transition; the same post-transition image can evoke fundamentally different response patterns, depending on what stimulus preceded the transition. To examine this dependence on stimulus history further, we applied several variations of the saccade stimulus. To test whether the actual motion during the saccade-like transition bears any significance for the characteristic responses of IRS cells, we randomly masked individual transition periods with uniform illumination of mean intensity. Responses of IRS cells to these ‘blink-like’ transitions were nearly indistinguishable from those to the saccade-like transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating that the stimulus motion during the transition was not necessary for generating the IRS response and merely served to transiently blur the image.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22431.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Stimulus history dependence of IRS responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of responses from a sample IRS cell (left) for saccade-like transitions (black traces) and transitions masked by a gray screen of mean illumination (green traces) as well as population analysis of the maximum firing rate and its latency for the two transition types (right).

The variations in transition duration were accompanied by corresponding differences in the speed of the saccade-like shifts. The characteristic IRS responses are visible in all cases. Note, though, that longer saccade-like shifts produced additional intermediate activity peaks. Apparently, the sequence of bright and dark illumination is now slow enough so that the neurons can follow and produce transient activation, for example, when the grating position temporarily matches the starting position during the saccadic transition. For example, for 300 ms shifts, the transition from position 1 to 3 yields two response peaks in addition to the transition-onset peak, in agreement with the fact that the transition here goes through 2.5 grating periods. For the transition from position 3 to 1, the grating only goes through 1.5 periods, and there is correspondingly only one additional peak. Furthermore, this explanation is in agreement with the fact that the masked transitions do not lead to intermediate activity peaks.

As expected, IRS cells responded well to the flashed gratings at all four positions. Compared to the responses after fixation onset of a recurring grating, the responses to isolated gratings occurred with shorter latency, yet were generally weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This is noteworthy because under the saccade-like stimulation, the prior exposure to the same grating should lead to adaptation and thereby decrease sensitivity to the recurrence of the grating. Furthermore, the spike burst that occurs during the transition itself and that precedes the spike burst at the onset of the new fixation by a mere 100–150 ms should trigger spike-frequency adaptation in the ganglion cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O'Brien et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim and Rieke, 2003</xref>) and thereby additionally decrease sensitivity when the grating recurs after the transition. Yet, despite these adaptation processes, the responses to recurring gratings were still stronger than for isolated gratings. This suggests that mechanisms beyond standard stimulus integration and response adaptation are involved in creating this non-standard history dependence.</p><p>Saccadic shifts in the direction of gaze may be accompanied by changes in low-level stimulus statistics, such as visual contrast. We therefore tested whether the sensitivity to image recurrence is affected by contrast changes. To do so, we randomly selected the contrast for each fixation to be either 30 or 60% and masked the transition periods by background illumination. We found that, regardless of the combination of contrast before and after the transition, post-transition spike bursts only occurred for equal starting and target position of the grating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating a certain invariance to contrast in the detection of a recurring spatial stimulus layout by the IRS cells. The robustness of the characteristic IRS responses is also underscored by varying the duration of the transition. In fact, we found that the specific sensitivity to image recurrence for these cells occurred for transition durations from few tens to some hundreds of milliseconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To dissect which aspects of the spatial stimulus structure are most relevant for controlling the sensitivity to image recurrence, we therefore manipulated the spatial structure of the saccade stimulus. First, we restricted stimulation to a small spatial patch, just slightly larger than the receptive field center, so that activation of the receptive field surround should be strongly reduced.

To test whether the recurrence of one or the other of these components generates the IRS response, we decomposed the grating into its bright and dark stripes and presented transitions between patterns of only bright stripes as well as between patterns of only dark stripes. Here, we did not use actual saccadic shifts because these would simply correspond to a bright/dark grating with altered mean illumination and reduced contrast. Thus, we focused on transitions that were masked by background (gray) illumination. Unlike for the full grating transitions, which always combine brightening at some locations with darkening at others, some stimulus locations now remain unchanged at transition onset and/or fixation onset, and the other locations simultaneously all experienced either brightening or darkening (see schematic stimuli in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We found that the dark bars alone were sufficient to trigger the characteristic IRS response, with strong post-transition peaks in the firing rate only when the target position matched the starting position of the dark bars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Note, though, that transitions with a change in grating position now caused slightly increased post-transition responses as compared to stimulation with the full grating, indicating that the response suppression for a change in stimulus position was not as robust as for a true saccade-like transition where the mean stimulus intensity during transition and fixation matched. Transitions of only bright bars, on the other hand, did not evoke post-transition responses by themselves, but triggered the first response peak that occurred during the transition, indicating that this is a response to the offset of non-preferred stimulus contrast.</p><p>We also checked whether the characteristic IRS responses could also be evoked by saccade-like shifts of natural images. Here, natural photographs were shifted between different positions, and the recurrence of the same image position was achieved by translating the image rapidly forth and back, similar to the occurrence of a saccadic intrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abadi and Gowen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Otero-Millan et al., 2011b</xref>). These image recurrences indeed generally led to the strongest post-transition responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, similar to the grating stimuli, the responses of IRS cells to natural images were largely independent of whether the transition occurred in a saccade-like or blink-like fashion, with the motion masked by mean illumination. Note, though, that responses of individual cells for different fixation positions were somewhat more variable than for grating stimuli. This response variability is likely due to variability of stimulus patterns inside the receptive field; patches of fairly homogeneous bright illumination, for example, are not expected to yield strong IRS responses because of the Off-type nature of these cells.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we computed, for each pair of recorded cell and applied image, the correlation between the receptive field activation and the size of the firing rate peak under image recurrence (inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, see Materials and methods). For both transition onset and fixation onset, receptive field activation was here computed as the integrated amount of darkening, weighted by the profile of the receptive field. Indeed, we found systematically positive correlations both between the amount of darkening at transition onset and the size of the first response peak (p=1.1·10<sup>−6</sup>, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) as well as between the amount of darkening at fixation onset and the size of the second response peak (p=2.3·10<sup>−4</sup>). Thus, variations in receptive field activation by natural images appear to be a strong source of response variability. Note, however, that despite this response variability on the single-cell level, the population response of IRS cells can still robustly encode global image recurrences, with the strongest contributions to the population response generally coming from different subsets of IRS cells for different images.</p><p>Finally, the robustness of the IRS responses to changes in spatial stimulus structure is also reflected by the fact that the sensitivity to image recurrence occurred in a similar fashion for gratings with different spatial frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Spatial sensitivity and potential role for fixational eye movements</title><p>We investigated the spatial sensitivity of the IRS cells by testing how different the pre- and post-transition images have to be in order to suppress the post-transition spike burst.

In fact, rapid recurrences of image position may be of particular relevance in the context of fixational eye movements because small drifts in eye position may be actively corrected by microsaccades to reset the proper direction of gaze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engbert and Kliegl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rolfs, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otero-Millan et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costela et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore tested the responses of IRS cells to stimuli that were composed of a small drift-like translation for half a grating period, followed by a rapid reset that either correctly compensated for the drift or was too far or too short. Here, IRS cells responded with a distinct spike burst after the reset, which was most pronounced when the target position after the reset was equal to the starting position before the drift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, the responses of IRS cells to combinations of drift and reset marked correct reset sizes that compensated for the drift.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Inhibitory interactions underlie the sensitivity to image recurrence</title><p>In order to elucidate the mechanism behind the unexpected response patterns of IRS cells, we aimed at recording intracellularly from these cells. Based on the general response characteristics of IRS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we had hypothesized that these cells corresponded to transient Off-alpha cells, which can be targeted for patch-clamp recordings via their large soma size. Indeed, cell-attached recordings of spiking activity from such candidate cells showed the same sensitivity to image recurrence as we had observed in the multielectrode-array recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

This inhibition was suppressed when the grating reappeared with the same spatial phase (peak currents 280 pA ±110 pA and 1070 pA ±170 pA, mean ± SEM, for recurrence and change, respectively; p=0.0054, paired <italic>t</italic>-test). A corresponding dependence on image recurrence was observed for the excitatory input. Here, a second response peak occurred only when the grating reappeared with the same spatial phase. When the grating phase changed across the transition, this excitatory input was suppressed (peak currents −249 pA ± 43 pA and −18 pA ± 41 pA, mean ± SEM, for recurrence and change, respectively; p=0.031, paired <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, both inhibition and excitation depend on the stimulus transition in a way that supports strong responses for recurring images. This parallel modulation of excitation and inhibition may be explained by a single source of inhibition, which acts both directly onto the ganglion cell as well as onto the bipolar cell terminals that mediate the excitatory synaptic input to the ganglion cell. This inhibition would be active after a transition with a change in grating position and thereby provide inhibitory input to the ganglion cell and simultaneously suppress the excitatory input. Such dual effects of inhibitory signals are well known; AII amacrine cells, for example, project both directly onto transient Off-alpha cells as well as onto their presynaptic bipolar cell terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloomfield and Dacheux, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ivanova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manookin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murphy and Rieke, 2008</xref>).</p><p>To further probe the role of inhibition in generating the IRS responses, we pharmacologically blocked either glycinergic or GABAergic inhibition and evaluated the effect on the responses under saccade-like stimulus transitions. When we applied the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine, we found that IRS cells lost their specificity in responding to recurring images. Instead, the cells responded non-specifically to all fixations under strychnine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). By contrast, when we applied the GABA<sub>A</sub>-antagonist gabazine to the retina, we found that the sensitivity to image recurrence was also abolished, but now because the response for the recurring image was suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Thus, blocking glycinergic inhibition and blocking GABAergic inhibition had opposite effects, with the former leading to an increase of activity after change across the transition and the latter to a suppression of activity after image recurrence. Together, this suggests that glycine-mediated inhibition acts directly onto the ganglion cell or onto its excitatory input, whereas GABAergic inhibition has an indirect effect because the activity reduction upon its block indicates a sign-inverted effect of this inhibitory signal. This lets us hypothesize that the presynaptic circuit of IRS cells involves serial inhibition, with glycinergic inhibition acting directly on the ganglion cell activity and GABAergic inhibition acting on the source of the glycinergic inhibition.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22431.010</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Role of GABA<sub>A</sub>- and glycine-mediated inhibition in generating IRS responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: Firing rate profile of a sample IRS cell before, during, and after application of the glycine blocker strychnine.

The responses to very brief and long transitions point to shortcomings of the model for processing rapid stimulus components. Apparently, the applied bipolar cell filters are too weakly activated under 33-ms transitions of recurring images. Furthermore, for longer transitions, the model is quite sensitive to the stimulus dynamics during a saccadic transition, producing a second response peak under 200-ms transitions for the transitions from positions 3 to 1 and 4 to 2, but not for the opposite transitions. Note that this asymmetry is connected to our implementation of the shift distance, which covers 1.5 grating cycles for the former transitions, but only 2.5 grating cycles for the latter.

To gain insight into how the IRS responses arise from this model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> displays the activation of some of the local interneurons for different local stimuli with either a net change of luminance across the transition (left) or a recurrence (right). For stimuli with local changes across the transition, this shows that locations with a net darkening lead to two peaks in the excitation mediated by the Off-type bipolar cell, coming from the offset of the previous fixation and the onset of the new fixation, respectively. Locations with net brightening, however, provide slow, strong, long-lasting inhibition through the activity of the On-type amacrine cell, which is triggered by both transition onset and fixation onset. This inhibition suppresses activity after fixation onset, but, owing to the low-pass filtering, is too slow to suppress the earlier activity peak during the transition.</p><p>For image recurrences, however, no location provides strong, long-lasting inhibition, because the On-type amacrine cell is either suppressed by transition onset (‘Bright-to-bright’ locations) or by fixation onset (‘Dark-to-dark’ locations). Thus, here, the first excitation peak, generated by transition onset at ‘Bright-to-bright’ locations, leads to spiking because it escapes the slower inhibition, and the second excitation peak, generated by fixation onset at ‘Dark-to-dark’ locations, leads to spiking once it overcomes the decaying On-type inhibition.</p><p>These dynamics can also explain why the responses after an image recurrence are somewhat stronger but occur with a longer latency than the responses to isolated image flashes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), as experimentally observed (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The isolated flash of a grating triggers both excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the ganglion cell. Because excitation is faster than inhibition (in the model reflected by the low-pass filtering of the On-type amacrine cell), a spike burst is generated at short latency, but the peak response is then already suppressed by the rising inhibition. For an image recurrence, on the other hand, inhibitory inputs are present during the early phase of the new fixation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, ‘Dark-to-dark’), preventing short-latency spiking. But eventually, this inhibition is strongly suppressed for both ‘Bright-to-bright’ and ‘Dark-to-dark’ locations, allowing a relatively strong peak in the firing rate, but with longer latency.</p><p>The model also incorporates the experimentally observed variability in the occurrence of a first response peak during the saccade (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) by just varying a single parameter, namely the amount of tonic inhibition onto the ganglion cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Increased tonic inhibition can prevent the first response peak but not the IRS response after fixation onset because it becomes itself suppressed through the serial inhibition. Responses to other variants of the stimulus transitions are furthermore reproduced without any adjustments of parameters. Model responses to transitions with masked saccades (‘blink-like’ transitions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>) were nearly identical to those under saccade-like stimulation (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). And model simulations under stimulation with dark bars only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>) showed IRS responses similar to experimental results (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), including the increased small responses under changing stimulus position, whereas responses to stimulation with just bright bars generated the first response peak only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>).</p><p>Note that the presented model was intended for checking whether a serial-inhibition circuit can qualitatively reproduce the characteristics of the IRS cell responses, not as a quantitative description of firing rate profiles, and we therefore did not perform any systematic parameter optimization. Nonetheless, it is instructive to check how the model performs under different variations of stimulus and model parameters. When applying the model to transitions of different durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), we observed that IRS-like responses occurred for transition durations as short as 33 ms and that longer transitions led to a gradual decline of the IRS response patterns and the emergence intermediate activity peaks, qualitatively similar to the experimental data (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). There are, however, substantial quantitative deviations of the model responses from the experimental data for short and long transitions, in particular for saccade-like transitions, though less so for masked transitions. These indicate shortcomings of the model in its ability to resolve fast stimulus components, such as the very brief transitions or the stimulus fluctuations during the long transition period for long transitions. Yet, these deviations are not surprising, given that temporal stimulus integration in the model was implemented purely through filtering operations and neglects, for simplicity, well-known feedback and gain control operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry and Meister, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keat et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pillow et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jarsky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ozuysal and Baccus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu and Gollisch, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we investigated the robustness of the model to parameter variations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). In particular, this shows that the model responses are largely invariant to whether the On-type inhibition goes directly to the ganglion cell or whether it acts presynaptically on the terminals of the Off-type bipolar cells, that is, before rectification of the excitatory input to the ganglion cell takes place. Furthermore, this analysis indicates that the qualitative behavior of the model does not depend sensitively on individual parameters, such as the strength of the On-type or Off-type inhibition or the time scales of the filters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we showed that a specific subset of ganglion cells in the mouse retina displays an unexpected, non-standard dependence on stimulus history when stimulated with rapid transitions of images, as occur during dynamics of the direction of gaze, such as saccades or fixational eye movements. Rather than primarily responding to an increase in preferred contrast across a transition, these cells fire a distinct spike burst when the spatial pattern inside the receptive field is nearly identical before and after the transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). This encoding of image recurrence is robust to changes in transition type, visual contrast, and spatial structure of the image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) and is exquisitely sensitive to changes in the image on a scale of few tens of micrometers, suggesting a potential role in monitoring fixational eye movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Finally, a combination of intracellular recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), pharmacology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and computational modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) indicated that these responses are controlled by a circuit of serial inhibition that is triggered by the rapid image transition.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell type identity of IRS cells</title><p>Cells that displayed the characteristic IRS response in the multielectrode-array recordings all showed similar general response characteristics; they were transient Off cells with a fairly large receptive field.

Interestingly, the superior colliculus is known to be involved in the control of saccades, with at least a rough match in the topographic organization between the visual inputs and the saccadic directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, inputs from transient Off-alpha cells to the superior colliculus might provide sensory feedback to the motor control of gaze shifts and thereby contribute to establishing and monitoring the appropriate topographic organizations, which indeed appear to depend on visual experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We cannot exclude that other types of ganglion cells, perhaps more rarely recorded with the multielectrode arrays, also show similar response patterns and therefore contribute to our analysis of the class of IRS cells. Given the overall homogeneity of the response characteristics of IRS cells, however, we do not expect a large contribution from other cell types. In fact, the particular response to image recurrence was so distinct that IRS cells could often be readily detected during the experiment by a glance at the voltage trace on the oscilloscope. Thus, stimuli with rapid image transitions may represent an interesting complement to the standard stimulus repertoire for defining signature response characteristics and distinguishing cell types in physiological experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carcieri et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farrow and Masland, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baden et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Yet, some variability between IRS cells was observed in the occurrence of a first response peak during the transition itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). We suspect that this results from variability within a single cell type rather than from contributions of different types, in particular because the simulations showed that the first response peak sensitively depends on the level of tonic inhibition onto the ganglion cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Indeed, the level of tonic inhibition received by alpha ganglion cells can vary considerably, for example depending on the light level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Wyk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marco et al., 2013</xref>), and it thus appears likely that variability in tonic inhibition occurs between experiments and even between cells in individual experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Consequences for signal processing in the retinal network</title><p>Our results show that the rapid image transitions induced by natural dynamics of the eye can trigger interactions in the retinal network that provide retinal ganglion cells with previously unknown response characteristics. The serial-inhibition circuit that underlies the responses of IRS cells illustrates the computational power of the interconnected inhibitory network in the retina. Here, it operates by gating the inhibitory signal flow through the retina. Other examples of transient, context-dependent gating of retinal signal flow by serial inhibition have been found in the salamander retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roska et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geffen et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that signal gating may be a general function of the inhibitory interconnections in the retina. Moreover, such gating of inhibitory signaling might be a general motif of adjusting signal processing to stimulus context; it was recently shown, for example, that the strength of cortical surround suppression depends on contextual image statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coen-Cagli et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The deduced circuit model of the IRS cells postulates that the inhibitory interactions be sensitive to local stimulus structure on a scale much smaller than the receptive field. Sensitivity to small stimuli of few tens of micrometers has also been observed in the disinhibitory signals of sustained Off-alpha cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marco et al., 2013</xref>). The local nature of the inhibitory interactions suggests that the serial inhibition is either mediated by narrow-field amacrine cells or involves local processing in dendritic compartments of a larger amacrine cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grimes et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Investigating the IRS cells in the context of rapid image transitions was essential for discovering the interactions in the inhibitory circuit. While the offset of the pre-transition image triggers the slow and sustained direct inhibition onto the ganglion cell, the onset of the new image evokes the rapid transient suppression of this direct inhibition. Commonly used simple stimuli, such as isolated images or white-noise flicker, will therefore not effectively activate this interaction. Thus, rapid image transitions trigger a mode of operation in the retina that differs from the processing of simpler stimuli. It will be interesting to see whether similar operational switches can be found in other circuits or under other naturalistic stimulus contexts, thereby potentially allowing individual ganglion cells to fulfill different visual tasks in a stimulus-context-dependent fashion. Furthermore, one may expect that comparable studies of other cell types under stimulation with rapid image transitions or with similar naturalistic stimulus dynamics will help elucidate further features of the inhibitory interactions in the retinal circuitry.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Consequences for neural coding</title><p>The characteristic IRS responses provide a distinct and sensitive code for the reappearance of spatial stimulus patterns. This explicit representation of image recurrence may be useful for different purposes of visual processing. For example, it may help distinguish and monitor different types of eye dynamics. While saccades are expected to alter visual input at many locations on the retina, saccadic intrusions, which typically occur as a coupled pair of saccades in opposing directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abadi and Gowen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Otero-Millan et al., 2011b</xref>), and resetting microsaccades may bring the same image back in focus within tens or hundreds of milliseconds. Microsaccades, for example, are hypothesized to correct for fixational-eye-movement drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engbert and Kliegl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rolfs, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otero-Millan et al., 2011a</xref>) and for blinking-induced gaze shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costela et al., 2014</xref>), and the monitoring of proper resets may aid the formation and maintenance of these corrective eye movements. Note, though, that such complex gaze shift patterns have so far primarily been analyzed in humans and other primates, and although the existence of saccadic eye movements in mice is now well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sakatani and Isa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), detailed observations of gaze movement patterns in freely behaving mice, which may move their eyes as well as their heads, are still lacking.</p><p>In the context of saccades, the IRS responses may furthermore allow tagging those parts of the visual field where the stimulus pattern stays relatively constant. This may occur, for example, when shifting the gaze along a contour, which appears to be a preferred way of directing saccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foulsham et al., 2008</xref>). In this context, it is worth noting that the IRS spike burst typically occurs with a latency of more than a hundred milliseconds after the end of the transition, and it is thus well placed to escape any saccadic suppression occurring downstream from the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ibbotson and Krekelberg, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we did not find evidence for an On-type ganglion cell with IRS responses. Although, again, we cannot exclude that On-type IRS cells do exist as a counterpart to the Off cells characterized here and were missed because of recording bias, one may wonder whether there is an advantage of detecting image recurrence based on negative rather than positive contrast in the image. One reason may be that negative contrast is encountered more frequently than positive contrast in natural scenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ratliff et al., 2010</xref>), which suggests a higher level of spatial detail available through the Off pathway.</p><p>From a more general perspective, the sensitivity to image recurrence can be viewed as a complement to the more common sensitivity to changes in the visual scene. This is analogous to other dual pathways of the visual system, such as the segregation into On and Off channels or the occurrence of adapting as well as sensitizing ganglion cells after a change in visual contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kastner and Baccus, 2011</xref>). The occurrence of such dual information channels has been linked to the need for efficiently covering the natural range of a given stimulus feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gjorgjieva et al., 2014</xref>). Another counterpart to the sensitivity to change is formed by suppressed-by-contrast ganglion cells, which display response suppression for most changes in visual input and which have recently been implicated in the detection of image transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tien et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, while the suppressed-by-contrast cells display suppression fairly unselectively to nearly any stimulus transition, the IRS responses depend in a specific fashion on the net change in the visual pattern across a transition. Also, the IRS responses to the drift-reset stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) bear some resemblance to the synchronized activity of ganglion cells under reversal of motion direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schwartz et al., 2007</xref>). However, the latter appears to provide a general signal for the occurrence of a motion reversal and does not rely on inhibitory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), whereas the IRS response depends on the precise relation of image positions across a brief transition.</p><p>Beyond the retina, several studies have shown that naturalistic stimulus statistics in general and eye-movement-like stimulus dynamics in particular can influence the response statistics and tuning properties of neurons in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">David et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kayser et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ruiz and Paradiso, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baudot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coen-Cagli et al., 2015</xref>).

The grating was presented at 60% Michelson contrast and was held fixed for 800 ms at one of four linearly spaced spatial phases before being shifted during 100 ms to stop again at one of the four spatial phases to start another 800-ms fixation. For each shift, the spatial phases before and afterwards are termed ‘starting position’ and ‘target position’, respectively. The sequence of fixation positions was chosen randomly. During each shift, the grating covered a distance of 1.5 to 2.5 spatial periods, depending on the exact difference between starting and target position. For transitions between contrast-reversed gratings, either 2.5 or 1.5 spatial periods could be applied, and we here chose for concreteness to use the former for the two transitions from position 1 to 3 and from 2 to 4 and the latter for the two opposite transitions. The range of transition distances corresponds to shifts of around 13–22° of visual angle, in the range of saccade amplitudes observed in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sakatani and Isa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). For the special case where the saccade duration was reduced to 33 ms, the shift was reduced to the range of 0.5 to 1.5 spatial periods to minimize aliasing by the monitor refresh rate. Firing rate profiles were obtained for each transition as peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) with a bin size of 10 ms. Post-transition peak latency was determined from the PSTH by identifying the bin with the maximum firing rate, fitting a second-order polynomial through this and the two neighboring data points and determining the peak time from the fit.</p><p>Variations of the standard stimulus included changes in contrast, in the spatial period of the grating, in the duration of the saccade-like transition, and in the number of fixation positions, as indicated in the text and in the corresponding figures. We also tested the contribution of the motion during the transition by randomly masking the 100-ms transition with uniform gray illumination at mean intensity (‘blink-like’ transitions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For testing responses to a drift-reset motion, the grating was shifted from its starting position over 266 ms for a distance of half a grating period. This was immediately followed by a rapid shift over 67 ms in the opposite direction of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1.0 grating periods to reach the target position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The sequence of fixation positions was again chosen randomly.</p><p>To test the influence of the spatial extent of the stimulus, we performed experiments during which the saccade stimulus was restricted to a small patch of 480 µm x 480 µm on the retina, surrounded by homogeneous gray illumination at mean intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The patch was successively moved to a total of 31 different locations to approximately cover the region spanned by the electrodes. The size of the stimulus patch was chosen to be somewhat larger than typical receptive field centers of IRS cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). For comparison with responses to the standard stimulus, we included cells only when a stimulus patch completely covered the receptive field center.</p><p>To explore responses to saccade-like shifts of natural images, we used photographs from the van Hateren natural image database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Hateren and van der Schaaf, 1998</xref>). The images were normalized to the same mean intensity as the gratings and to a contrast of 50% (defined as the standard deviation of the pixel intensity relative to the mean). They were presented with a pixel size of 15 µm on a side and shifted between four fixation positions in the same way as the gratings, translating the image between 600 and 900 µm on the retina. For shifts between equal starting and target position, the image was shifted forth and back between the fixation position and the position in the center of the four fixation positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Each transition occurred 5–10 times during the recording. To compare saccade-like with blink-like transitions, individual transitions were masked at random by blurring the image during the 100 ms transition period with a Gaussian filter (σ = 2250 µm).</p><p>In order to relate the activation of the receptive field by the natural images to the size of the firing rate peaks (inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), we computed for each cell the integrated darkening at transition onset and fixation onset. Five of 17 recorded cells were excluded here because no receptive field had been recovered from the spatiotemporal white-noise analysis. We restricted the analysis to transitions with equal starting and target position and to transitions masked by the blurred image in order to be independent of the complex stimulus dynamics during a motion transition. To compute the activation at, for example, fixation onset, we subtracted the blurred image from the actual image to obtain a measure of contrast for each pixel. To take the receptive field profile into account, we used a 2D Gaussian fit of the spatial receptive field and multiplied each pixel contrast value by the value of the Gaussian profile at the corresponding location. To focus on the negative contrast (since the IRS cells are Off-type cells), we set all positive pixel values to zero, then sign-inverted all pixel values and summed them up over space. We then computed, for each cell and image, the correlation coefficient R between the four activation values (corresponding to the four fixation positions) and the peak size of the second peak in the PSTHs. Finally, we tested whether the collection of these R values significantly deviated from a distribution around zero by a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The analysis for transition onset proceeded in an analogous fashion, except that we here subtracted the actual image from the blurred image (instead of the other way around) and that the size of the first firing rate peak was used for the correlation.</p><p>In the patch-clamp recordings, in order to increase data collection efficiency, fixation periods were shortened to 500 ms, and saccade stimuli were typically presented with only two fixation positions, corresponding to contrast-reversed versions of the same grating. The transitions were masked by a gray screen at mean illumination, and the sequence of fixations was organized so that image recurrences and changes alternated. Furthermore, the grating period in these experiments was set to 200 µm, and the stimulus region was restricted to a 400 µm x 400 µm square, centered on the recorded cell’s soma, to reduce cell-by-cell variability in the surround-evoked inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Detection of IRS cells</title><p>To define a criterion for including recorded cells into the analysis of the IRS response, we evaluated peaks in the firing rate profile after fixation onset, using a window from 50 to 200 ms after fixation onset. First, we required that IRS cells had at least an average peak firing rate of 50 Hz in the PSTHs for the four stimulus transitions with equal starting and target position. This criterion aimed at excluding cells that did not respond to image recurrence and at avoiding false positives that showed spurious firing rate peaks because of noise in the PSTHs. 963 cells out of a total of 2357 recorded cells passed this criterion. We then compared the maxima of the derivatives of the PSTHs between transitions with image recurrence and transitions with maximally different starting and target position. We chose this measure because it is independent of the background activity that the peak my ride on. The derivatives were determined by computing the differences for successive 10-ms time bins in the PSTH. Concretely, we compared for each target image <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> the maximal derivative <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>rec</mml:mtext><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> under image recurrence (that is when the starting image also equaled <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) to the maximal derivative <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>change</mml:mtext><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> when the starting image was the contrast-reversed grating.

This yielded altogether a total of 209 detected IRS cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Model simulation</title><p>We modelled the responses of an IRS ganglion cell to saccade-like shifts of a grating according to the neural circuit displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, representing cells by temporal filters and synaptic transmission by half-wave rectification as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>. The receptive field of the ganglion cell was composed of four non-overlapping spatial subunits that together covered one spatial period of the grating. Each subunit contains an Off-type bipolar cell, which provides excitatory input to the ganglion cell, and an On-type bipolar cell, which is the source of inhibitory input to the ganglion cell via an intermediate On-type amacrine cell in the subunit. The ganglion cell summed over the excitatory and inhibitory inputs from all subunits, and its half-wave rectified activation was interpreted as the firing rate (in arbitrary units). As a critical circuit element, each subunit also contained serial inhibition, mediated by an Off-type amacrine cell, which received excitatory input from the Off-type bipolar cell and inhibited the On-type amacrine cell. By assuming that the On-type amacrine cell, which suppresses the ganglion cell activity, is glycinergic and that the Off-type amacrine cell, whose influence on the ganglion cell is indirect, is GABAergic, this circuit is consistent with the observed response-increasing action of the gabazine blocker strychnine and with the indirect, response-suppressive action of the GABA<sub>A</sub> blocker gabazine (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Note that the alignment of individual bipolar cells with quarter-periods of the grating was merely done for simplifying the circuit and is not relevant for its operation. For a better match with physiology, each individual model bipolar or amacrine cell should be thought of as a collection of several, smaller cells, which all receive approximately identical inputs because they are stimulated by the same region of the grating. Furthermore, for simplicity, we restricted the On-type inhibition to act directly on the ganglion cell. Yet, letting this inhibition instead act on the synaptic terminals of the Off-type bipolar cells leads to a functionally nearly identical model. We implemented this by subtracting the inhibitory signal of each On-type amacrine cell from the four Off-type bipolar cell inputs to the ganglion cell before the synaptic rectification instead of afterwards. To keep the net strength of this inhibition fixed, we multiplied the activity of the On-type amacrine cell by 0.5, since the grating activates two Off-type bipolar cells simultaneously. The results from this ‘presynaptic-inhibition’ model are compared to the standard, ‘postsynaptic’ model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref>.</p><p>Finally, note that, in principle, the GABAergic inhibition could also – in order to have an indirect, sign-inverting effect – act on the On-type bipolar cell, which provides the input to the On-type inhibition. However, this would require that the On-type bipolar cell itself be slow enough so that its activity would control the level of inhibition well beyond the stimulation of the On-type bipolar cell during the transition. As this ‘long memory’ of bipolar cells appears less likely, we here focused on the described direct interaction of glycinergic and GABergic inhibition for exploring their opposing effects.</p><p>Visual stimulation, neuronal processing, and synaptic transmission were implemented as follows: The grating stimulus was represented by contrast values of ±1 for bright and dark stripes, respectively. The activation of the bipolar cells was modeled by averaging the contrast signal over the spatial region of the subunit and then applying a biphasic temporal filter to this spatially averaged contrast signal. The temporal filters of the On-type and Off-type bipolar cells were identical except for their sign and had the form (here shown for the Off-type cell)<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>exp</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>exp</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>exp</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>exp</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> otherwise, with time constants <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>40</mml:mn><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> for the excitatory lobe of the filter and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>60</mml:mn><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> for the antagonistic lobe, and with normalization factors <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, which are used to set the time integral of the filter to zero (to enforce transient activation upon contrast steps) and to normalize it to unit Euclidean norm for a discrete sampling at 0.1 ms resolution.</p><p>Synaptic signal transmission was modelled by half-wave rectifying the activation of the presynaptic cell and providing the resulting signal as an additive input to the postsynaptic cell. To model the inhibitory effect of the amacrine cells, their output signals were multiplied by −1. The excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the On-type amacrine cell were adjusted by gain factors of 0.05 and 0.2, respectively, to avoid overwhelmingly strong inhibition to the ganglion cell and allow effective suppression of this inhibition by the Off-type amacrine cell. The On-type amacrine cell furthermore contributed temporal low-pass filtering to its input, consistent with the slower time course of glycinergic inhibition in the retina as compared to GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moore-Dotson et al., 2015</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Alexander Borst (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Van Essen as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kevin L Briggman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, Krishnamoorthy and colleagues examine RGC responses to eye-movement like visual stimuli in the mouse retina. They find that 5-10% of RGCs are &quot;image-recurrence sensitive,&quot; meaning that their spiking is generally suppressed after a transition from one spatial pattern to the next, unless the same pattern reappears. IRS cells correspond to transient Off α RGCs. Through a series of clever manipulations of a shifting grating stimulus, pharmacology, intracellular recordings and computational modeling, they convincingly show that the IRS response is mediated by a serial inhibition circuit in the inner retina. The authors argue that this type of feature sensitivity may be useful in guiding micro saccades to correct for fixational drift. The mechanistic explanation of this unexpected IRS response is very solid, and it stands as an unusually convincing example of attributing some feature of retinal computation to a serial inhibition circuit. This is achieved mostly through the authors' clever stimulus design and willingness / ability to use whole cell recordings from identified OFF α cells. The effort to firmly identify these IRS cells as the transient OFF α RGCs is very nice.</p><p>Major points to address in revision:</p><p>1) Function of IRS cells for natural eye movements in mice: do mice show saccadic eye movements, with saccadic intrusions, that would help to stabilize and fixate the image, as the authors speculate in the discussion? The references given in this context by the authors appear to mainly address humans. What about saccades along contours, as in the Discussion? Relatedly, the IRS responses seen using natural images are much less consistent than those elicited by gratings stimuli. From a population perspective this suggests that for a given transition, some subset of cells will show IRS-like responses and others will not. Some discussion of encoding by this heterogeneous population would be useful to include.</p><p>2) IRS brain target region: Given the fact that the ganglion cell type is identified, the authors could discuss to which target region in the mouse brain this ganglion cell is sending its axon to.</p><p>3) Sources of response variability: From the data it is difficult to get a sense of the sources of variability in the responses. The proposed mechanism behind IRS seems to depend on the appropriate amount of negative contrast within the RF. Similarly, if the variable transition response (e.g <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) is an offset response, then it would rely on there being sufficient positive contrast in the starting position. Can you explain any of the variability in these responses based on the portion of the grating that is within each cell's RF? This sort of analysis would be especially useful in the context of the natural image experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which show much less robust IRS responses. Can you use the computational model to predict which natural images will or will not show an IRS response?</p><p>4) Illustrating the model: The computational model is a bit hard to follow and ultimately is not used as much as it could have been. It would help the reader to understand the underlying mechanism to show the responses of various model components during some of these stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). For example, you could highlight two regions of the stimulus in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, one that changes and one that doesn't, and illustrate the responses of some of the key model components during and after the transition. Adding a panel between 8B and 8C showing the time series responses of each of the cell types in the model in responses to different transition types would I think make it far easier to grasp. Also, adding a cartoon of the actual anatomy to complement 8A would be a nice addition.</p><p>5) Model parameter sensitivity: Some statement about parameter sensitivity in the model would be appreciated. Also a concise statement of the total number of free parameters in the model would help.</p><p>6) Evidence for AII: The evidence that the slow ON amacrine cell in this circuit is the AII amacrine is largely circumstantial and based on past work under different conditions. I would suggest softening the focus on this specific amacrine cell and instead highlight the proposed general circuit organization.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22431.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Major points to address in revision:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Function of IRS cells for natural eye movements in mice: do mice show saccadic eye movements, with saccadic intrusions, that would help to stabilize and fixate the image, as the authors speculate in the discussion?

From a population perspective this suggests that for a given transition, some subset of cells will show IRS-like responses and others will not. Some discussion of encoding by this heterogeneous population would be useful to include.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, most information on complex gaze shifting patterns, such as saccadic intrusions, and their dependence on visual stimuli come from humans, and unfortunately, data for mice are still scarce, despite the fact that the existence of saccadic eye movements is now well documented. Complications for obtaining such data come from the fact that eye movements in body-restrained mice are considerably reduced (e.g. Wang et al., J Neurosci 2015) and that both head and eye movements can contribute to gaze shifts. We now comment on the lack of mouse gaze shift data in the Discussion under “Consequences for neural coding”.</p><p>Regarding the variability of the IRS responses under shifted natural images, this likely comes from variations in the visual patterns that stimulate the receptive field (see also the response below to point 3). From the perspective of encoding image recurrences, it seems sufficient if a subset of the IRS cells displays a robust IRS response after an image recurrence to provide a robust IRS population response -- likely those IRS cells that have sufficient structure within their receptive fields for this particular fixation. For different images or fixations, different subsets of IRS cells would then contribute to this population response. We now explain this potential population code for image recurrences in the context of the responses under natural images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) IRS brain target region: Given the fact that the ganglion cell type is identified, the authors could discuss to which target region in the mouse brain this ganglion cell is sending its axon to.</italic> </p><p>Transient Off-α cells are known to project to both LGN and superior colliculus (Huberman et al., Neuron 2008; Hong et al., J Comp Neurol 2011). We have included a corresponding section in the Discussion under “Cell type identity of IRS cells”, where we now also draw the connection to the known role of the superior colliculus in controlling saccades.</p><p><italic>3) Sources of response variability: From the data it is difficult to get a sense of the sources of variability in the responses. The proposed mechanism behind IRS seems to depend on the appropriate amount of negative contrast within the RF. Similarly, if the variable transition response (e.g <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) is an offset response, then it would rely on there being sufficient positive contrast in the starting position. Can you explain any of the variability in these responses based on the portion of the grating that is within each cell's RF? This sort of analysis would be especially useful in the context of the natural image experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which show much less robust IRS responses. Can you use the computational model to predict which natural images will or will not show an IRS response?</italic> </p><p>Yes, indeed, the strength of the responses, both at transition onset as well as at fixation onset after image recurrence, should depend on the amount of darkening inside the receptive field, and this should be expected to lead to variability between the responses for different images or different fixation positions. As suggested, we now tested this by computing the correlation between the amount of darkening inside the receptive field and the corresponding response. We found systematic positive correlations both for transition onset and fixation onset and report on these findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. This indicates that, as expected, variations of stimulus structure inside the receptive field are an important source of response variability. We did not aim at predicting these variations through our model because this would require substantial additional assumptions and parameters, regarding the size and placement of the actual receptive fields of the circuit’s interneurons. We therefore feel that our data-analytic approach here allows a more direct connection of the variations in stimulus structure and response strength.</p><p><italic>4) Illustrating the model: The computational model is a bit hard to follow and ultimately is not used as much as it could have been. It would help the reader to understand the underlying mechanism to show the responses of various model components during some of these stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). For example, you could highlight two regions of the stimulus in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, one that changes and one that doesn't, and illustrate the responses of some of the key model components during and after the transition. Adding a panel between 8B and 8C showing the time series responses of each of the cell types in the model in responses to different transition types would I think make it far easier to grasp. Also, adding a cartoon of the actual anatomy to complement 8A would be a nice addition.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we have included a panel of the activation of the local interneurons in the model to different local stimulus patterns (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This should indeed make it easier to understand how this model circuit operates. In particular, this shows that locations with net brightening across the transition provide slow, long-lasting inhibition, which suppresses activity after fixation onset. For recurring images, on the other hand, inhibition becomes suppressed after fixation onset at all locations, from darkening either at transition onset or at fixation onset. We have added explanations along these lines in the Results section when discussing the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>.</p><p>Note that, in order to facilitate these explanations and the interpretation of this new figure panel, we have slightly adjusted the model. Besides some of the model parameters, this concerns the target of the On-type inhibition, which previously acted both directly onto the ganglion cell and presynaptically onto the bipolar cells. To simplify the explanations and to focus on the essential model components, the standard model version now uses only direct inhibition onto the ganglion cell. However, we now show in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref> that presynaptic inhibition can be used just as well without changing the response of the model.</p><p>Regarding the circuit anatomy, the schematic circuit diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> is thought to serve as a cartoon of the anatomy, displaying the putative synaptic connections, complementing the mathematical implementation illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>. We do not feel that we have sufficient evidence to include further anatomical details about the circuit.</p><p><italic>5) Model parameter sensitivity: Some statement about parameter sensitivity in the model would be appreciated. Also a concise statement of the total number of free parameters in the model would help.</italic> </p><p>We have added a supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8 —figure supplement 2</xref>) which shows model responses when critical model parameters are doubled or halved. This shows that the model does not require fine tuning of parameters to qualitatively reproduce the IRS responses. Furthermore, we added some explanations regarding the model’s free parameters in the methods section. Please note, though, that we did not perform any systematic optimization of the free parameters to fit the experimental data because the model aims at providing a proof-of-principle explanation of the IRS responses rather than a detailed reproduction of the firing rate profiles.</p><p><italic>6) Evidence for AII: The evidence that the slow ON amacrine cell in this circuit is the AII amacrine is largely circumstantial and based on past work under different conditions. I would suggest softening the focus on this specific amacrine cell and instead highlight the proposed general circuit organization.</italic> </p><p>Yes, agreed. We have reformulated the corresponding statements to make it clearer that the AII here primarily serves only as an example of glycinergic signaling, which itself might be controlled or modulated by GABAergic inhibition.</p></body></sub-article></article>
