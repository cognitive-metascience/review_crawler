its electrophysiological surrogate long-term potentiation (LTP), effects that may be mediated by intra-neuronal oligomers uptake. Intrigued by these findings, we investigated whether oAβ and oTau share a common mechanism when they impair memory and LTP in mice. We found that as already shown for oAβ, also oTau can bind to amyloid precursor protein (APP). Moreover, efficient intra-neuronal uptake of oAβ and oTau requires expression of APP. Finally, the toxic effect of both extracellular oAβ and oTau on memory and LTP is dependent upon APP since APP-KO mice were resistant to oAβ- and oTau-induced defects in spatial/associative memory and LTP. Thus, APP might serve as a common therapeutic target against Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and a host of other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal levels of Aβ and/or Tau.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26991.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26991.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>amyloid-beta</kwd><kwd>tau</kwd><kwd>APP</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG049402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arancio</surname><given-names>Ottavio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Italian FFO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Puzzo</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name><name><surname>Palmeri</surname><given-names>Agostino</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fraser</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Catholic University Intramural Funds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grassi</surname><given-names>Claudio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Oligomeric Amyloid-β and Tau, two proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, require Amyloid Precursor Protein to enter neurons and exert their detrimental effect on synaptic plasticity and memory.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein aggregation and deposition have been considered key pathogenetic processes in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), tauopathies, Parkinson’s Disease, Huntington disease and many others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shelkovnikova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takalo et al., 2013</xref>). More recently, soluble small aggregates of these proteins have gained a lot of attention in studies aimed at understanding the etiopathogenesis of these diseases. This is particularly evident in AD, in which the abnormal increases of the levels of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and Tau proteins and their aggregation are crucial steps in the chain of events leading to dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Irvine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kopeikina et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The importance of soluble oligomeric forms of Aβ (oAβ) and Tau (oTau) has been corroborated by numerous evidences demonstrating their presence in human cerebrospinal fluid in healthy individuals and, in higher amounts, in AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hölttä et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sengupta et al., 2017</xref>). oAβ and oTau are also toxic to cell-to-cell communication, as they disrupt synaptic plasticity, paving the way to the subsequent cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Selkoe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fá et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, we have recently demonstrated that a brief exposure to a combination of subtoxic doses of extracellular oAβ and oTau dramatically reduces memory and its electrophysiological surrogate long-term potentiation (LTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fá et al., 2016</xref>). These findings beg the question of whether they act through a common pathway when they impair memory and LTP.</p><p>Aβ and Tau share numerous common biochemical features. Both proteins can form insoluble deposits: that is, extracellular amyloid plaques due to the accumulation of Aβ, and intracellular insoluble filaments and neurofibrillary tangles formed by Tau. In addition, Aβ and Tau are present as non-fibrillar soluble monomeric and oligomeric species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Selkoe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fá et al., 2016</xref>).

Moreover, both Aβ and Tau can bind to amyloid precursor protein (APP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lorenzo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Van Nostrand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shaked et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fogel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>), a protein with a central role in AD pathogenesis that might act as a cell surface receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deyts et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>APP, the precursor of Aβ, which derives from sequential cleavage of APP by β-secretase (also known as BACE1) and γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cole and Vassar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Strooper, 2007</xref>), has a central role in AD pathogenesis and might act as both an Aβ precursor and a cell surface receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deyts et al., 2016</xref>). Here we have postulated that oAβ and oTau involve APP as a common mechanism of action when they impair memory and LTP. This has been investigated through a series of experiments in which we have used APP knock-out (APP-KO) mice and assayed whether suppression of APP function blocks the deleterious effects of both oAβ and oTau onto memory and LTP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Similar to oAβ, oTau binds to APP</title><p>APP has been shown to bind both Aβ and Tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lorenzo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Van Nostrand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shaked et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fogel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>). The interaction between oAβ and APP has been thoroughly investigated in studies demonstrating that different species of Aβ (monomers, dimers, oligomers and fibrils) bind to APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lorenzo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Van Nostrand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shaked et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fogel et al., 2014</xref>). However, there is no proof that oTau binds to APP, as previous studies on Tau-APP binding did not use oligomers but fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giaccone et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Islam and Levy, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore decided to investigate whether the interaction between Tau and APP can be extended to oTau. This was accomplished through two different approaches. In the first one, we utilized membrane fractions from HEK293 cells stably transfected with human APP with the Swedish mutation (APPSw) and incubated with/out oTau derived from recombinant 4R/2N Tau protein. After incubation APP was immuno-precipitated (IP) and the IPs were tested for oTau binding. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, APP co-IPed oTau. In the second approach, as an alternative method to analyze protein-protein interaction dependent upon the presence of endogenous APP, we performed far-WB (fWB) on cultured hippocampal neurons from either wild type (WT) or APP-KO animals. We found that, in lysates from WT cultures, oTau (used as the bait protein) was detected at the molecular weight of APP (~110 KDa) by an anti-Tau antibody (Tau 5). Conversely, this band was not observed in lysates from control APP-KO cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), supporting the interaction between murine APP and oTau. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that oTau is able to bind APP.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26991.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>APP binds to oTau.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) WB with anti-Tau antibodies Tau5 showing oTau co-IPed with APP in HEK293 cells stably transfected with human APP with the Swedish mutation. * corresponds to the heavy chain of the antibody used for IP.

Given that both Aβ and Tau can bind to APP, our next goal was to establish whether APP is needed for oligomer internalization. To address this issue, we treated cultured hippocampal neurons obtained from WT and APP-KO mice with either 200 nM oAβ labeled with HiLyte Fluor 555 (oAβ−555) or 100 nM oTau labeled with IRIS-5 ester dye (oTau-IRIS5) for 20 min and we studied their cellular internalization by high-resolution confocal microscopy using an automated algorithm to detect and count intraneuronal spots. We found that WT neurons internalized much more Aβ and Tau than APP-KO cells. In fact, after extracellular oAβ−555 application, a higher percentage of WT neurons exhibited Aβ accumulation compared to APP-KO cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Aβ accumulation was found in 91 ± 3% of WT MAP2-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) and the mean number of intracellular fluorescent spots/neuron was 5.3 ± 0.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). When the same treatment was applied to APP-KO cultures we found that 73 ± 5% of total cells internalized Aβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) and the mean number of fluorescent spots was 2.9 ± 0.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Similar results were obtained when WT and APP-KO neurons were treated with extracellular oTau-IRIS5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) which was found in 80 ± 6% of WT cells containing 2.7 ± 0.2 fluorescent spots and in 47 ± 6% of APP-KO neurons exhibiting 1.4 ± 0.1 spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). Moreover, to provide a global estimate of the protein uploading into neurons, we performed quantitative analysis of these data through the ‘internalization index’, which showed a 61% reduction in APP-KO neurons compared to WT cells for oAβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>), and a 69% reduction for oTau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>). Notably, the amounts of Aβ and tau oligomers attached to neuronal surface did not significantly differ between WT and APP-KO cells. Specifically, fluorescent Aβ spots were 6.9 ± 0.5 and 6.5 ± 0.6 for WT and APP-KO, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>); whereas for Tau they were 4.3 ± 0.4 and 4.0 ± 0.4, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>). Collectively, these data show that APP suppression reduces the entrance of extracellular oligomers of both Aβ and Tau into neurons.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26991.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>APP suppression reduces internalization of oAβ and oTau into neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of cultured hippocampal neurons (microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP2) positive cells) obtained from either WT or APP-KO mice and treated with 200 nM human oligomeric Aβ42 labeled with HiLyteTM Fluor 555 (oAβ−555) for 20 min and immunostained for MAP-2.

Interestingly, both associative fear memory and spatial memory, two types of memory that are altered in AD patients, are impaired by oAβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Puzzo et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, these effects may require intra-neuronal uptake of oAβ. Since APP is required for efficient uptake of oAβ, we evaluated the effect of oAβ onto two types of memory, assessed through Fear Conditioning and 2 day Radial Arm Water Maze (RAWM), respectively, in the presence or absence of functional APP expression using 3–4 month-old WT and APP-KO mice.

This was determined by using mice deficient in BACE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luo et al., 2001</xref>). In previous WB analysis of these mice we had confirmed that they do not express BACE1 protein and have impaired β-processing of APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Del Prete et al., 2014</xref>). BST recording did not reveal any difference between WT and BACE1-KO slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14-data">Figure 5—source data 4</xref>). Slices perfusion with oAβ (200 nM for 20 min before the tetanus), or oTau (100 nM for 20 min before tetanus), or vehicle showed that, similar to WT mice, oAβ and oTau reduced LTP in slices from BACE1-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15-data">Figure 5—source data 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16-data">Figure 5—source data 6</xref>). Thus, these experiments demonstrate that APP processing is not involved in the toxicity of extracellularly-applied Aβ and Tau.</p><p>Finally, we asked whether the APP-dependence for the negative effects of oAβ and oTau onto LTP is specific to these oligomers, or a broader property of APP with β-sheet, oligomer forming proteins. To address this question, we selected human amylin (Amy), an amyloid protein of 37 amino-acids differing from Aβ<sub>42</sub> in its primary sequence, but sharing with it the ability to form β-sheets and oligomerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wineman-Fisher et al., 2016</xref>). Amy crosses the blood brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banks et al., 1995</xref>), and has a profile of neurotoxicity that is strikingly similar to that of Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jhamandas et al., 2011</xref>), including the marked reduction of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kimura et al., 2012</xref>). As previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kimura et al., 2012</xref>), perfusion of hippocampal slices for 20 min with 200 nM oligomeric Amy (oAmy) produced a marked reduction of LTP in WT slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD17-data">Figure 5—source data 7</xref>). The same impairment of LTP was observed in slices from APP-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD17-data">Figure 5—source data 7</xref>); thus, different than oTau and oAβ, oAmy does not require APP for its negative effect on synaptic plasticity. Collectively, these experiments suggest that a brief exposure to both oAβ or oTau, but not oAmy, needs the presence of endogenous APP to impair LTP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Protein aggregate accumulation in the brain is a common feature to neurodegenerative diseases, each disease displaying specific aggregating proteins and aggregate distribution. Oligomers of these proteins are gaining a lot of attention because they are likely to be involved in the cell-to-cell propagation of the pathology, and look more acutely toxic than large insoluble aggregates. For instance, in AD, oligomers of both Aβ and Tau have been shown to produce an immediate reduction of synaptic plasticity and memory when extracellularly applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fá et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, the negative effects of oAβ and oTau occurred not only with high concentrations of Aβ or Tau alone, but also when sub-toxic doses of oAβ were combined with sub-toxic doses of oTau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fá et al., 2016</xref>). These observations inspired the experiments shown in this manuscript. Here, we demonstrate that the suppression of APP, to which both oAβ and oTau can bind, causes a marked reduction of the oligomer entrance into neurons. Most importantly, we have found a common mechanism of action for extracellular Aβ and Tau oligomers, whose deleterious effect on LTP and memory depends upon the presence of endogenous APP.</p><p>Our finding that extracellular oAβ requires APP to impair synaptic plasticity and memory is consistent with previous studies showing that Aβ neurotoxicity might be mediated by APP, as suggested by the reduced vulnerability towards Aβ of cultured APP null neurons or mutated APP cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lorenzo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shaked et al., 2006</xref>). This finding is also consistent with the observation that the presence of APP is likely to contribute to hippocampal hyperactivity, which has been suggested as a key mechanism of disease etiopathogenesis both in AD animal models and patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Busche et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palop et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Verret et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vossel et al., 2013</xref>). Along with these studies, APP has been demonstrated to bind Aβ monomers and dimers leading to activity-dependent APP-APP conformational changes that enhance neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fogel et al., 2014</xref>). When Aβ is accumulating in the brain, this increase of release probability might induce hippocampal hyperactivity resulting in failure of synaptic plasticity and memory loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koppensteiner et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Another interesting finding in our studies is that extracellular oTau requires APP to impair synaptic plasticity and memory. In support of this observation a few studies published several years ago, prior to the introduction of the concept of Tau oligomers, supported a direct interaction between APP and Tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giaccone et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Islam and Levy, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith et al., 1995</xref>). Moreover, recently, APP has been involved in the uptake of Tau fibrils into cells influencing Tau intracellular aggregation and spreading in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The dependence for the presence of APP shared by both oAβ and oTau in order to impair synaptic plasticity, suggests that APP is a key molecule involved in a common mechanism by which extracellular oAβ and oTau interfere with second messenger cascades relevant to memory formation. Indeed, Aβ and Tau share numerous biochemical characteristics and previous studies have suggested a possible common toxicity mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gendreau et al., 2013</xref>). Both peptides are β-sheet forming proteins, which explains their propensity for oligomerization and close association with membrane. Furthermore, both peptides can bind APP, a protein with structural similarities to type I transmembrane receptors, that might act as a cell surface receptor.</p><p>APP is also the precursor of Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Müller and Zheng, 2012</xref>), which derives from sequential cleavage by γ- and β-secretases. We have therefore asked whether the toxicity of extracellular Aβ and Tau oligomers depends upon this amyloidogenic processing of APP. To this end we have used mice deficient in BACE1, the enzyme that initiates the amyloidogenic cascade. We found that BACE1-deficient mice are susceptible to the synapto-toxicity of oAβ and oTau in a similar fashion as WT littermates. Thus, amyloidogenic APP cleavage is not required for the impairment of LTP by the oligomers.</p><p>We also found that the APP dependence for the negative effect of oAβ and oTau onto LTP is specific to these proteins. This observation is consistent with the fact that both proteins are involved in AD. This conclusion derived from the experiments in which oAmy was capable of reducing LTP in APP-KO slices. Nevertheless, one cannot exclude that other β-sheet forming proteins besides Aβ and Tau require APP to impair synaptic plasticity. Regardless, the finding that Aβ and Tau share APP as a common mechanism for impairing LTP and memory is relevant and provides a common etiopathogenetic mechanism for their involvement in AD.</p><p>Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that APP serves as a common, direct molecular target for extracellular oAβ and oTau to impair LTP and memory. This is supported by the demonstration that both oAβ and oTau bind to APP. However, our experiments do not conclusively demonstrate that oligomer binding to APP is the cause of LTP and memory reduction, nor we can rigorously exclude the possibility that the two types of oligomers act on additional targets. For instance, it has been demonstrated that heparan sulfate and heparin sulphate proteoglycans bind with Aβ and Tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lindahl et al., 2009</xref>) and mediate their internalization and neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mirbaha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sandwall et al., 2010</xref>). Given that APP and heparan sulfate proteoglycans are likely to interact at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reinhard et al., 2013</xref>) and proteoglycans are rapidly degraded in the absence of proteins belonging to the APP superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cappai et al., 2005</xref>) proteoglycan degradation in the absence of APP might block the toxic action of oAβ and oTau. Nevertheless, the main observation of this manuscript showing that extracellular oAβ and oTau disrupt molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and memory via APP is clear and has relevant implications for understanding AD etiopathogenesis.</p><p>We have found that suppression of APP reduces oAβ and oTau entrance into cells. This observation combined with the finding that intracellular perfusion with 6E10 antibodies recognizing the sequence 1–16 of human Aβ<sub>42</sub>, rescues the LTP block by extracellular human oAβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ripoli et al., 2014</xref>), supports the hypothesis that, at least for oAβ, APP-dependent uploading of extracellular oligomers plays a critical role the impairment of synaptic plasticity, and presumably memory. APP might permit the entrance of the peptides into cells either directly into the cytosol or within vesicles during endocytosis, after which molecular mechanisms of learning and memory are impaired. A direct entrance into the cytosol might occur if APP functions as a channel through which the two oligomers both with a diameter in the low nm range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cizas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fá et al., 2016</xref>) enter cells. In agreement with this hypothesis, it has been reported that APP forms a non-selective channel when injected in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fraser et al., 1996</xref>). A variant on this hypothesis is that APP permits the formation of pores/channels by the oligomers, as ion conductance across lipid bilayers is increased by oligomers of several different amyloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kayed et al., 2004</xref>), which affect the permeability of the plasma membrane, leading to elevation of intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and toxic changes. With this regard, Aβ has been reported to form large conductance, non-specific ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fraser et al., 1997</xref>). The endocytotic mechanism, in turn, is supported by the demonstration that full-length APP is a transmembrane protein, which is endocytosed from the cell surface into endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nordstedt et al., 1993</xref>) and by studies showing endocytosis of Tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>Another aspect of our experiments is that APP suppression does not appear to dramatically affect the number of MAP2-positive cells taking up Aβ (only ~80% of WT cells), but does reduce the number of intracellular aggregates for the peptide per neuron (~55% of WT cells), whereas APP suppression clearly affects both the number of cells taking up Tau (~50%) and the number of intracellular aggregates for oTau (~52%). These findings open the question of whether the number of cells taking up oligomers and the amount of intracellular aggregates may reflect two different processes, i.e., uptake and degradation/clearance of aggregates. This is an interesting possibility that might explain our observations. Of note, to date there is no data showing that APP is involved in modulation of Aβ/Tau clearance. Nevertheless, it would be interesting in future experiments to explore whether mechanisms controlling protein degradation/clearance in neurons are regulated by APP.</p><p>Albeit the experiments on oligomer entrance support the hypothesis that APP serves as a Trojan horse for oAβ and oTau to enter neurons prior to impairing second messenger cascades relevant to synaptic plasticity and memory formation, they do not exclude an alternative scenario in which oligomer interaction with APP activates the intracellular segment of APP, AID/AICD, triggering a cascade of events leading to derangement of memory mechanisms. In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that phosphorylation of the intracellular threonine 668 of APP mediates synaptic plasticity deficits and memory loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lombino et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the AID/AICD fragment of APP could form a multimeric complex with the nuclear adaptor protein Fe65 and the histone acetyltransferase Tip60, potentially stimulating transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao and Südhof, 2001</xref>). If so, the entrance of the oligomers might serve other purposes rather than impairing synaptic plasticity and memory. For instance, it has been suggested that Tau entrance leads to propagation of Tau misfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frost et al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, our findings that APP is necessary for impairment of LTP and memory following elevation of Aβ and Tau is still relevant, as it sheds light into how the oligomers cause memory loss in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p>The prevailing hypothesis in the AD field is that Aβ triggers Tau pathology. Our data, however, do not support this hypothesis in which Aβ and Tau are placed in series but suggest a different scenario in which extracellular Aβ and Tau oligomers act in parallel, both through APP. Interestingly, this hypothesis would also explain why tauopathies result in neuronal loss similar to AD but in the absence of Aβ. The identification of the common biochemical neuronal modifications occurring after the APP involvement and underlying the derangement of the molecular mechanisms of gene transcription involved in memory formation, is beyond the scope of the present manuscript. Nevertheless, our findings are translationally significant, as they have permitted the identification of a common molecule, APP, which might be therapeutically targeted at sites serving for direct interaction with Aβ and Tau oligomers or, alternatively, with proteins downstream of such oligomers, other than the classical β- and γ-secretase sites.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All protocols involving animals were approved by Columbia University (#AC-AAAO5301), Università di Catania (#327/2013-B, #119–2017-PR), Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (#626–2016-PR), Albert Einstein College of Medicine (#20160407), and the respective Institutional Animal care and Use Committee (IACUC); experiments involving animals were performed in accordance with the relevant approved guidelines and regulations.

Samples (1.11 mg total protein) were incubated with a monoclonal antibody directed to the APP C-terminal domain (C1/6.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mathews et al., 2002</xref>); 5 µg, 2 hr) and immunoprecipitated using Protein G-Sepharose. Non-specific bound proteins were removed by successive washing with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated APP complexes were eluted with Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE (4–12% Bis-Tris gels, BioRad) and probed for Tau using Tau-5 antibodies (1:1,000) and APP-CTF (C1/6.1) to confirm the immunoprecipitation efficiency as well as the interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Far western blotting (fWB)</title><p>APP-Tau interaction was detected performing fWB as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). Hippocampal neurons were lysed in cold RIPA buffer containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, phosphatase and protease inhibitor mixtures (Sigma) and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. After incubation for 30 min on ice and centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C), the supernatant was removed and protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Each protein sample (30 μg) was separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA). The blotted proteins were then denatured with guanidine–HCl and then renatured by gradually reducing guanidine concentration (from 6 to 0 M). The last renaturing step with the guanidine-HCl-free buffer was maintained overnight at 4°C. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS, 1% tween-20 (TBST) for 1 hr at RT and then incubated overnight at 4°C with 10 μg of purified ‘bait’ protein oTau. After three washes with TBST, the membrane was incubated with one of the following primary antibodies for 1 hr a RT in 3% milk in the TBST buffer: anti Tau Ab-2 (clone Tau-5, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Membranes were then stripped by heating at 56°C in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, with 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS and re-incubated with anti APP-C terminus (Sigma) to check whether Tau and APP are on the same position on the membrane. Blots were developed with the Pierce ECL Plus Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and visualized using UVItec Cambridge Alliance. The BenchMark Pre-Stained Protein Ladder (Invitrogen) was used as molecular mass standards.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Assessment of oligomers entrance into neurons</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Primary hippocampal neuronal cultures</title><p>Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were obtained from C57BL/6J mice (WT), and B6.129S7-Apptm1Dbo/J (APP KO) mice as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Piacentini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scala et al., 2015</xref>).

The cell suspension was harvested and centrifuged at 235 × g for 8 min. The pellet was suspended in 88.8% Minimum Essential Medium (Biochrom), 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, 1% glutamine (2 mM), 1% penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin antibiotic mixture (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and glucose (25 mM). Cells were plated at a density of 10<sup>5</sup> cells on 20 mm coverslips (for immunocytochemical studies) and 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well on 35 mm six-well plates (for fWB studies), precoated with poly-L-lysine (0.1 mg/mL; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Twenty-four hours later, the culture medium was replaced with a mixture of 96.5% Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen), 2% B-27 (Invitrogen), 0.5% glutamine (2 mM), and 1% penicillin streptomycin- neomycin antibiotic mixture.

Briefly, peptide was diluted to 1 mM in 1,1,1,3,3,3,-hexafluoro-2-propanol to disassemble preformed aggregates and stored as dry films at −20°C before use. The film was dissolved at 1 mM in DMSO, sonicated for 10 min, diluted to 100 µM in cold PBS, and incubated for 12 hr at 4°C to promote protein oligomerization. Aβ<sub>42</sub>-555-labeled preparation was purified with Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter (2 KDa) and then was resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 100 mM before final dilution in the culture medium.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Preparation of labeled Tau</title><p>oTau preparations were labeled with the IRIS-5-NHS active ester dye (IRIS-5; λex: 633 nm; λem: 650–700 nm; Cyanine Technology Turin, Italy) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fá et al., 2016</xref>).

After treatment cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at RT, permeabilized for 15 min with 0.3% Triton X-100 [Sigma] in PBS, and incubated for 30 min with 0.3% BSA in PBS to block nonspecific binding sites. The primary antibody rabbit anti microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2, Immunological Sciences, Rome, Italy; 1:200 overnight at 4°C for 90 min) and the corresponding secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen 1:1000 for 90 min at RT) were then used to recognize neurons. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 0.5 μg/ml for 10 min; Invitrogen) and cells were coverslipped with ProLong Gold anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen), before being studied through high-resolution confocal microscopy. Confocal stacks made of images (512 × 512 pixels) were acquired with a confocal laser scanning system (Nikon A1 MP) and an oil-immersion objective (60× magnification; N.A. 1.4). Additional 2.5× magnification was applied to obtain a pixel size of 90 nm. Fluorescent dyes were excited with diode lasers (405, 488, 546 and 633 nm). The following criteria were used for spot detection: XY area ≥200 nm<sup>2</sup>; Z height ≥1.5 µm. The studied proteins were considered internalized when the overlapping of MAP2 fluorescence with the height of the fluorescent spots was greater than 65% (~1 µm). Conversely, they were considered attached to the neuronal surface when the fluorescence signals were close to each other, but with less than 30% overlap. Spots internalized in neurons were detected and counted by the Image J software, through an algorithm that automatically detects co-localization between MAP2 fluorescence and either Aβ555 or Tau-IRIS5. MAP2 fluorescence was binarized to form a mask of the fluorescence pattern for every single XY plane of the Z stacks, and this mask was multiplied plane-by-plane for the corresponding fluorescence of Aβ or Tau stacks. This operation selected only Aβ and Tau signals associated with MAP2-positive areas by deleting any Aβ and Tau signals unrelated to MAP-2 immunoreactivity. The resulting fluorescence signals gave an unbiased estimate of Aβ or Tau oligomers internalized in neurons within each microscopic field. The number of fluorescent spots were then counted by the ‘analyze particle’ macro of Image J after having done a maximum intensity projection of every Z stacks. To provide a global estimate of the protein uploading into neurons, internalization of oAβ and oTau was also quantified through the ‘internalization index’ obtained by multiplying the percentage of neurons internalizing fluorescent proteins by the mean number of fluorescent spots inside neurons. Assessment of fluorescent protein oligomers attached to the neuronal surface was carried out by spanning the XZ-YZ planes from Z stacks for every microscopic field acquired.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavioral studies</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Intrahippocampal administration of oAβ and oTau</title><p>To perform intrahippocampal infusions of oligomers, mice underwent stereotaxic surgery for cannulas implantation.

After 6–8 days of recovery, mice were bilaterally infused with oAβ or oTau preparations or vehicle in a final volume of 1 μl over 1 min with a microsyringe connected to the cannulas via polyethylene tubing. During infusion, animals were handled gently to minimize stress. After infusion, the needle was left in place for another minute to allow diffusion.

Our conditioning chamber, equipped with a camera placed on the top of the cage, was in a sound-attenuating box. The conditioning chamber had a bar insulated shock grid floor, removable. After each experimental test the floor was cleaned with 75% ethanol. Mice were handled once a day for 3 days before behavioral experiments. Only one animal at a time was present in the experimentation room. During the first day, mice were placed in the conditioning chamber for 2 min before the onset of a discrete tone [conditioned stimulus (CS)] (a sound that lasted 30 s at 2800 Hz and 85 dB). In the last 2 s of the CS, mice were given a foot shock [unconditioned stimulus (US)] of 0.80 mA for 2 s through the bars of the floor. After the CS/US pairing, the mice were left in the conditioning chamber for 30 s and then they were placed back in their home cages. Freezing behavior, defined as the absence of all movement except for that necessitated by breathing, was manually scored. During the second day, we evaluated the contextual fear learning. Mice were placed in the conditioning chamber and freezing was measured for five consecutive min. During the third day, we evaluated the cued fear learning. Mice were placed in a novel context (rectangular black cage with vanilla odorant) for 2 min (pre-CS test), after which they were exposed to the CS for 3 min (CS test), and freezing was measured. Sensory perception of the shock was determined 24 hr after the cued test through threshold assessment. Foot shock intensity started at 0.1 mA and increased by 0.1 mA every 30 s. We recorded the first visible, motor and vocal response.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>2 day radial arm water maze (RAWM)</title><p>RAWM was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Watterson et al., 2013</xref>). During the first day, mice were trained in 15 trials to identify the platform location in a goal arm by alternating between a visible and a hidden platform from trial 1 to 12 (beginning with the visible platform in the assigned arm). In the last four trials (trial 13–15) only a hidden platform was utilized. During the second day the same procedure was repeated by using only the hidden platform from trial 1 to 15. An entrance into an arm with no platform, or failure to select an arm after 15 s was counted as an error and the mouse was gently pulled back to the start arm. The duration of each trial was up to 1 min. At the end of each trial, mouse rested on the platform for 15 s. The goal arm was kept constant for all trials, with a different starting arm on successive trials. Data were analyzed and displayed as averages of blocks of 3 trials per mouse. A visible platform test was performed to control for possible motivational, visual and motor deficits. This consisted in a two-day test, with two sessions/day (each consisting of three 1 min trials), in which we recorded the time taken to reach a visible platform (randomly positioned in a different place each time) marked with a green flag.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Open field</title><p>Open Field was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fá et al., 2016</xref>).

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;LTP and memory impairment caused by extracellular Aβ and Tau oligomers is APP-dependent&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General assessment and central conclusions: The reviewers find that the manuscript describes and interesting set of studies demonstrating that both Aβ oligomers and Tau oligomers require endogenous APP to impair behavior (contextual fear and radial arm water maze) and LTP. This is particularly important because it suggests a common therapeutic target that could impact both Aβ and Tau-mediated cell dysfunction. The authors also include data that amylin oligomers do not require APP to impair LTP, strongly suggesting that Aβ and Tau oligomers are specifically acting to cause synaptic dysfunction, as opposed to a general effect by aggregated proteins.</p><p>The reviewers raise a number of concerns that must be addressed before the paper can be accepted.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> there was concern that the uptake of oligomers into neurons was not convincing and based on a small number of cells. We suggest rather than counting manually that an unbiased imaging approach be used that would allow a larger number of cells to be counted and eliminate and counting bias. Straight numbers rather than the internalization index would be better if larger numbers of cells are counted. Please also address whether cell surface oligomers differ between genotypes and whether the patterns from Aβ and Tau are similar or different.</p><p>2) The APP-KO result is very interesting and would be strengthened from a mechanistic perspective by the inclusion of data using BACE and/or γ secretase. Is APP processing required for Aβ and Tau toxicity?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26991.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> there was concern that the uptake of oligomers into neurons was not convincing and based on a small number of cells.
