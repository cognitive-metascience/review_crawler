document a collection of â¼7434 MiMIC (Minos Mediated Integration Cassette) insertions of which 2854 are inserted in coding introns. They allowed us to create a library of 400 GFP-tagged genes. We show that 72% of internally tagged proteins are functional, and that more than 90% can be imaged in unfixed tissues. Moreover, the tagged mRNAs can be knocked down by RNAi against GFP (iGFPi), and the tagged proteins can be efficiently knocked down by deGradFP technology. The phenotypes associated with RNA and protein knockdown typically correspond to severe loss of function or null mutant phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate reversible, spatial, and temporal knockdown of tagged proteins in larvae and adult flies. This new strategy and collection of strains allows unprecedented in vivo manipulations in flies for many genes. These strategies will likely extend to vertebrates.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05338.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05338.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05338.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the last few decades, technical advances in altering the genes of organisms have led to many discoveries about how genes work. For example, it is now possible to add a specific DNA sequence to a gene so that the protein it makes will carry a âtagâ that enables us to track it in cells. One such tag is called green fluorescent protein (GFP) and it is often used to study other proteins in living cells because it produces green fluorescence that can be detected under a microscope.</p><p>It is labor intensive to add tags to individual genes, so this limits the number of proteins that can be studied in this way. In 2011, researchers developed a new method that can easily tag many genes in fruit flies. It makes use of small sections of DNA called transposons, which are able to move around the genome by âcuttingâ themselves out of one location and âpastingâ themselves in somewhere else.</p><p>The researchers used a transposon called Minos, which is naturally found in fruit flies. When Minos inserts into a gene, it often disrupts the gene and stops it from working. However, the researchers could swap the inserted transposon for a gene encoding GFP by making use of a natural process that rearranges DNA in cells. This resulted in the protein encoded by the gene containing GFP and so it can be detected under a microscope. This method allowed the researchers to create a collection of fly lines that have the GFP tag on many different proteins.</p><p>Now, Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al. have greatly expanded this initial collection. More than 75% of GFP-tagged proteins worked normally and the flies producing these altered proteins remain healthy. It is possible to use a technique called RNA interference against the GFP to lower the production of the tagged proteins. Moreover, Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al. show that it is also possible to degrade the tagged proteins so that less protein is present. The removal of proteins is reversible and can be done in specific tissues during any phase in fly development. These techniques allow researchers to directly associate the loss of the protein with the consequences for the fly.</p><p>This collection of fruit fly lines is a useful resource that can help us understand how genes work. The method for tagging the proteins could also be modified to work in other animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Discoveries of gene function are most often driven by the integration of information related to cellular and subcellular protein expression patterns, genetic loss of function phenotypes, and proteinâprotein interactions. Antibodies to individual proteins can be used to localize their expression and for protein interaction studies. However, antibodies are not available for most proteins, and it is time consuming and expensive to generate them against a large number of individual proteins. Although antibodies have been documented against nearly 1900 fly proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">St Pierre et al., 2014</xref>), most have been lost or are not obtainable anymore. An extensive survey reveals that antibodies are currently available against â¼450 different proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a mere â¼3% of all protein coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>An alternative to generating antibodies to individual proteins is to tag the genes with a common protein segment for which antibodies are commercially available. Endogenous tagging of proteins with a fluorescent marker not only provides useful localization data, but may also permit the conditional removal of the gene products. Standard epitope tags such as Flag, HA, V5, GFP and other fluorescent tags allow the use of high-fidelity, commercially available antibodies against these tags, permitting biochemical experiments. Fluorescent tags also facilitate imaging in unfixed tissue or live animals. The most commonly used method of in vivo protein tagging is to introduce a transgene that contains a cDNA with a terminal epitope tag sequence that is expressed using an exogenous promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bischof et al., 2013</xref>). Although this may permit the determination of the subcellular localization of the protein, it does not allow assessment of the native expression pattern. It may also affect the distribution and function of the protein, because the transgene is typically not expressed at the endogenous level. An alternative is to tag the genomic locus using a genomic transgene, rather than a cDNA, because native regulatory elements then control the expression patterns and levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Venken et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ejsmont et al., 2009</xref>). This genomic transgene can be integrated by a site-specific integrase into a defined docking site to minimize chromosomal position effects on the expression of the transgene. The tagged genomic transgene allows the analysis of the spatial and temporal patterns of expression of the protein, but does not provide a means to alter the expression of the endogenous copy of the gene. Finally, the most effective and informative strategy is to tag genes in their endogenous locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Venken et al., 2011b</xref>). A large collection of such GFP tagged genes would permit numerous powerful genetic and biochemical applications in addition to determining expression patterns and protein distributions. These include efficient immunoprecipitations with anti-GFP nanoantibody followed by mass spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">NeumÃ¼ller et al., 2012</xref>), ChIP sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">NÃ¨gre et al., 2011</xref>), iGFPi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">NeumÃ¼ller et al., 2012</xref>) and deGradFP mediated protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Urban et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To tag numerous endogenous genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, protein trapping methods were previously developed based on screening untargeted insertions of transposable elements carrying a protein trap cassette. The first such protein trap vectors used <italic>P</italic>-elements, <italic>piggyBacs</italic> and <italic>piggyBacs</italic> with an internal <italic>P</italic>-element sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buszczak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">QuiÃ±ones-Coello et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aleksic et al., 2009</xref>). Only a small percentage of the transpositions function as protein traps, because the insertion must be within the intron between two protein-coding exons, as well as being in the right orientation and reading frame to create an in-frame protein fusion when the artificial exon is spliced into the mRNA of the inserted gene. The pooled results of three major efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buszczak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">QuiÃ±ones-Coello et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aleksic et al., 2009</xref>) yielded less than 600 unique genes containing protein traps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">QuiÃ±ones-Coello et al., 2007</xref>). Because of the insertion site biases of these transposons, it has been argued that this technology will not allow tagging more than about 5% of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes and that additional screening would yield very few novel tagged genes/proteins; hence, alternative approaches are needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aleksic et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that the <italic>Minos</italic> transposon-based MiMIC gene trap vector is much more efficient at generating intronic insertions in a much larger subset of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes than either <italic>P</italic>-element or <italic>piggyBac</italic> vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Venken et al., 2011a</xref>). Moreover, MiMIC insertions in coding introns can be efficiently converted using RMCE to label the protein with a GFP or other epitope tag. We have vastly expanded the MiMIC collection, which now totals more than 7400 lines. We show that MiMIC is highly mutagenic and is an extremely efficient tool for gene/protein tagging. We created a new resource of 400 protein tagged genes and show that â¼72â77% of essential genes with internal GFP tags are functional. Importantly, iGFPi and deGradFP permit a temperature-dependent conditional knockdown of gene function that mimics a severe loss of function in specific cells or tissues in most instances. Finally, we document the reversible tissue-specific knockdown of proteins and reversible loss of function of the <italic>dunce</italic> gene.

The resource and tools described here will allow researchers to address important biological questions, particularly in adult flies, as very limited tools are available to conditionally remove and restore protein function in the adult.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expanding the MiMIC insertion collection</title><p>The goal of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gene Disruption Project (GDP) is to create resources to manipulate as many genes as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bellen et al., 2011</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> we selected a total of 2854 MiMIC insertions in coding introns of 1862 distinct genes for inclusion in the GDP collection. Because many genes encode multiple protein isoforms, not all coding-intron insertions are equally useful. The collection includes 1732 insertions in constitutive coding introns that permit tagging of all annotated protein isoforms (Gold set), 814 insertions in alternative coding introns that permit tagging of more than 50% of annotated protein isoforms (Silver set), and 328 insertions in alternative coding that permit tagging of less than 50% of annotated protein isoforms (Bronze set). Note that 78 of the coding intron insertions map within coding introns of two distinct, overlapping genes. The expanded MiMIC collection also includes insertions in coding exons, untranslated regions, non-coding introns, and putative control regions (within 500 bp of the promoter) of 2860 protein-coding genes and 359 non-coding RNA genes, as well as 1439 intergenic insertions. In total, the collection comprises 7434 insertions in 7400 lines associated with 4367 genes; 34 lines contain two insertions each.

To further investigate the efficacy of MiMIC as a gene trap and other important properties of tagged proteins/genes, we characterized 200 genes with intronic MiMIC insertions by tagging with RMCE. To establish whether MiMIC functions as an efficient gene trap when inserted in the proper orientation in a coding intron, and to assess the efficiency of the splice acceptor site (SA) we focused on lethality. Of the 200 genes analyzed, 114 are essential genes based on FlyBase records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">St Pierre et al., 2014</xref>), 84 are non-essential, and 2 are unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). The MiMIC insertions in coding introns of 63 of the 114 essential genes are inserted in the correct orientation to function as gene traps, and 58 of these 63 cause homozygous lethality and fail to complement null alleles or deficiencies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1âsource data 2</xref>) that delete the target gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>); hence, MiMIC is highly mutagenic. The remaining 51 essential genes have a MiMIC insertion in the non-GT orientation. All these lines are homozygous viable or complement a null allele or a deletion, showing that an intronic MiMIC inserted in the wrong orientation does not significantly disrupt gene function. Note that; 11/51 of the MiMIC-bearing chromosomes are homozygous lethal, but this lethality is caused by second site mutations based on complementation data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). In summary, our data show that MiMIC functions as designed in 109/114 insertion lines, and is thus a highly reliable gene trap. The data also show that the SA in MiMIC is effective and that the integrated artificial exon is probably not frequently skipped by the pre-mRNA splicing machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Tagging 400 genes with EGFP-FlAsH-StrepII-TEV-3xFlag</title><p>MiMIC insertions in coding introns can be used to introduce an artificial exon encoding one or more protein tags via RMCE as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Venken et al., 2011a</xref>). We selected an EGFP-FlAsH-StrepII-TEV-3xFlag tag (hereafter abbreviated EGFP) that is flanked on either side with a 4X(GlyGlySer) flexible linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). There are three versions of this protein trap cassette, one for each of the three intron reading frames. When the cassette with the proper reading frame is inserted into a coding intron in the proper orientation, the tag will be spliced into the mRNA of the target gene, and translation of this mRNA will result in a fusion protein with an internal tag inserted. We injected a plasmid DNA containing the donor tag cassette into embryos of â¼700 MiMIC strains (intronic insertions) expressing phiC31 integrase. We identified G<sub>1</sub> progeny in which the RMCE event had occurred by the loss of the <italic>y+</italic> marker of the MiMIC gene trap cassette and determined which RMCE events were in the proper orientation using a PCR assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Venken et al., 2011a</xref>). We established 450 independent stocks in which â¼400 different genes are tagged. The success rate of obtaining at least one insertion in the correct orientation is currently 133/200 or 66%. Upon reinjection we obtained a 62% success rate. Hence, with two injections of about 500 embryos each we derived â¼175/200 properly tagged genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Internal tagging does not affect the function of â¼75% of proteins</title><p>A concern with protein tagging is that the tag might disrupt protein function. We were not able to assess what fraction of proteins retains normal function when tagged at terminal or internal locations, despite an extensive survey of the current literature. As a proxy, we characterized tagged alleles of essential genes. If a tag disrupts the function of an essential protein, it should cause lethality. After tagging 114 essential genes using RMCE as described above, we performed complementation tests with null mutations or deletions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1âsource data 2</xref>) to establish the fraction of tagged genes that failed to complement a severe loss of function or null allele. The lethality of 42 out of 58 lethal gene trap lines was reverted (72%) upon tagging. Moreover, all five of the essential tagged genes that contain an insertion in the GT orientation, but are viable, and 41 of the 51 essential tagged genes that contain an insertion in the non-GT orientation are homozygous viable or complement a severe allele or deficiency uncovering the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Hence, 85 show no obvious phenotypes and three show subtle morphological phenotypes, suggesting a minimal impact on protein function. The remaining 26 tagged essential genes failed to complement null alleles or deficiencies. Hence, our data indicate that 72% (42/58) to 77% (88/114) of proteins tagged at various internal locations retain function or are not severely affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). However, a significant number of these chromosomes are homozygous lethal, and in almost all cases tested we have been able to eliminate the lethal mutation with backcrosses.</p><p>To assess whether internal tagging of proteins within annotated protein domains is more disruptive than tagging within other regions of proteins, we mapped the tag insertion site in each of 200 tagged proteins and determined its position with respect to annotated protein domains. We observe a strong relationship between tagging location, annotated protein domains, and retention of protein function. Of the 88 tagged essential genes that retain protein function, 26 tags are inserted within annotated protein domains and 62 are not inserted within an annotated protein domain (Ï<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.0001). However, we found no such bias for internal tags that disrupt essential proteins: 14 tags inserted within annotated domains vs 12 inserted within unannotated sequences (Ï<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.7). In summary, insertion of a tag within known, conserved protein domains is more likely to disrupt protein function, and inserting an artificial exon that encodes a tag is effective and not disruptive in 77% of the proteins tested.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>90% of the tagged proteins can be detected in the third instar larval or adult CNS</title><p>The genes that were selected for tagging are a non-random set of genes whose expression is unknown in most cases.

There are two important advantages of GFP RNAi over gene-specific RNAi: no off-target effects have been documented and a single set of highly selective and efficient GFP shRNAs can be used to knock down the expression of any tagged gene. By using specific GAL4 drivers, knock down of a gene in almost any tissue or stage in developing animals or adults can be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jory et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manning et al., 2012</xref>).

The system uses the host ubiquitination machinery to target GFP-tagged proteins for proteasomal degradation.

The tagged protein is ubiquitously expressed in the eye disc and localizes to adherens junctions as previously reported for Î±-Cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sarpal et al., 2012</xref>). The signals from each antibody colocalize and the tagged Î±-Cat protein localizes to the proper intracellular domain, similar to the wild type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-a</xref>; data not shown). As tagging with RMCE integrates an artificial exon, we determined whether exon skipping occurs. Given that MiMIC functions as an effective gene trap (see above) and since we used the same SA in the EGFP tagging construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Venken et al., 2011a</xref>), we predicted that exon skipping would be rare.

Note that development takes about twice as long at 18Â°C and hence embryonic development lasts for about 2 full days.</p><p>The Dlg1-EGFP-Dlg1 expression pattern and subcellular distribution as revealed with the anti Dlg1 and anti GFP antibodies also correspond to the published protein distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-aâc</xref>), further confirming that the GFP tag does not disrupt Dlg1 localization. The <italic>y w dlg1-EGFP-dlg1;UAS-deGradFP/tub-GAL4</italic> flies raised at 18Â°C develop normally and eclose without obvious phenotype. Moreover, GFP expression is not affected in third instar larvae (data not shown). In contrast, embryos that are raised continuously at 28Â°C are embryonic lethal, an earlier lethal phase than <italic>dlg1</italic> null mutants, which are third instar lethal. However, in zygotic null mutants, there is a large maternal component of Dlg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Woods and Bryant, 1991</xref>), and germ line clones of <italic>dlg1</italic> null alleles are embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Perrimon, 1988</xref>), suggesting that the maternally deposited protein is degraded in <italic>y w dlg1-EGFP-dlg1; UAS-deGradFP/tub-GAL4</italic> animals grown at 28Â°C. Furthermore, animals that are shifted to 28Â°C as either first or second instar larvae display hyperproliferative imaginal disc and brain phenotypes as third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5DâE</xref>). In these animals, we also observe a significant decrease in Dlg1-EGFP-Dlg1 expression in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-câe</xref>) and in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) compared with controls. We also detect a mild decrease in NMJ growth in terms of bouton number and synapse complexity in the temperature shifted animals compared to unshifted controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-a,d</xref>-white arrows, data not shown), consistent with <italic>dlg1</italic> loss of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). However, the decrease in Dlg1-EGFP-Dlg1 in the muscle is far less robust compared with other tissues, such as the brain, because the Tubulin driver leads to stronger expression in the brain compared to third instar larval muscles (data not shown). In addition to hyperproliferation, <italic>y w dlg1-EGFP-dlg1; UAS-deGradFP/tub-GAL4</italic> animals shifted to 28Â°C as first instar larvae, much like <italic>dlg1</italic> zygotic mutants, also have defects in cell morphology and organization as observed in the larval midgut compared to animals raised at 18Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, these data show that deGradFP not only prevents zygotic expression of Dlg1, but also eliminates maternal deposited Dlg1, thus recapitulating phenotypes associated with zygotic null mutations and the lethality associated with mutant germ line clones.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Knockdown of bruchpilot with iGFPi and deGradFP: differences and similarities</title><p>Bruchpilot (Brp) is a functional homolog of the human presynaptic protein ELKS/CAST/ERC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wagh et al., 2006</xref>).

We used <italic>y w; deGradFP/n-Syb-GAL4</italic> larvae with an untagged <italic>brp</italic> gene as control. There are no significant differences in excitatory junction potential (EJP) amplitudes and miniature junctional potentials (mEJPs) in controls (EJP: 21.9 Â± 3.4 mV, and mEJP: 1.79 Â± 0.18, n = 6) and 0 hr experimental animals (EJP: 22.9 Â± 4.5 mV, and mEJP: 1.8 Â± 0.13, n = 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-câf</xref>). However when the temperature is shifted to 28Â°C during third instar larval development, there is a loss in amplitude of the EJPs that becomes progressively more severe the earlier that the shift is made. Larvae kept at 28Â°C for 18â24 hr have EJP amplitudes that are reduced by 76% (EJP: 5.5 Â± 0.37 and mEJP: 1.87 mV Â± 0.17, n = 5) compared to animals kept at 18Â°C (0 hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-câf</xref>). Moreover, larvae kept at 18Â°C (0 hr) show no locomotion defects, whereas larvae kept at 28Â°C for 18â24 hr show severe locomotion defects (data not shown). In summary, an 18 hr period of deGradFP expression at 28Â°C during third larval instar development is sufficient to remove most of the Brp-EGFP-Brp protein and cause severe loss of function phenotypes.</p><p>To assess whether knockdown of Brp-EGFP-Brp affects adult behavior and to compare deGradFP and iGFPi efficiency in adult flies, animals expressing <italic>n-Syb-GAL4</italic> were shifted from 18Â°C to 28Â°C at progressively later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The majority of animals raised continuously at 28Â°C and expressing deGradFP or iGFPi die as embryos or first instar larvae. Similarly, animals shifted to 28Â°C as first instar larvae (L1) die in late second instar (L2). However, later shifts show major differences between animals expressing deGradFP vs iGFPi: iGFPi animals shifted to 28Â°C as L2 larvae or adults show no obvious phenotypes, whereas deGradFP animals shifted as L2 larvae or adults show locomotor defects and die as pupae (L2 shifted) or adults (L2 or adult shifted). Moreover, temperature shifts to 28Â°C in adults allow flies to live for approximately 4 weeks after the shift. These data suggest that iGFPi is not as efficient as deGradFP at some stages of development or in some tissues, possibly because the Brp protein has a very long half-life and is less affected by depletion of mRNA levels by iGFPi than by degradation of the protein by deGradFP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Reversibly removing proteins</title><p>The temperature sensitivity of the GAL4-UAS system in combination with deGradFP should allow the reversible removal of proteins. A reversible knockdown has numerous advantages: it is quick, simple and only requires temperature shifts; it can be performed during development and in adult flies of any age; it allows the unambiguous assignment of the phenotype to the protein knockdown; it obviates the need of control genotypes; and it determines if damage to cells upon loss of a protein is reversible or permanent. We therefore tested if we were able to reversibly knock down and regenerate the proper expression pattern and protein distribution for a few tagged genes. We selected two proteins with a large extacellular domain, Roughest (<italic>rst</italic>) and NetrinA (<italic>NetA</italic>). The EGFP is inserted in the large extracellular domain of Rst and NetA. We were able to remove and re-establish protein expression and proper distribution of Roughest and NetrinA in third instar larval brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Both Rst and NetA have distinct expression patterns in the larval brain which are significantly reduced after 24 hr at the restrictive temperature, 28Â°C. However, when larvae are returned to the permissive temperature, 18Â°C, for 24 hr, protein expression is restored to a level comparable to larvae that were never exposed to the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Therefore, through temperature manipulation, GAL4, and subsequently deGradFP expression can be controlled to reversibly disrupt target protein expression level. Given that GFP is in the extracellular domain, the degradation of these proteins must occur efficiently during protein synthesis.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05338.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Knockdown and restoration of Rst and NetA protein expression in third instar larval brains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (<bold>a</bold>) <italic>Roughest</italic> (<italic>rst</italic>) gene map (chromosome X, based on FlyBase release FB2014_05) with the position of the MI04842 insertion shown by the red triangle.

The Dnc-EGFP-Dnc protein is expressed in the adult brain and is mostly restricted to mushroom bodies (MB), the center for learning and memory in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). A more detailed analysis reveals that the fusion protein is expressed in all MB lobes (Î±, Î±â², Î², Î²â² and Î³) in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), and the GFP staining reveals a much crisper expression pattern than the anti Dunce antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nighorn et al., 1991</xref>).

We observe a progressive loss of Dnc-EGFP-Dnc, and after 48 hr at 28Â°C we could not or barely detect the tagged protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Protein expression is restored 48 hr after a shift back to 18Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). To determine whether the decrease in Dnc-EGFP-Dnc expression levels correlates with a known behavioral phenotype associated with loss of <italic>dnc</italic>, we performed the aversive olfactory learning assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tully and Quinn, 1985</xref>).

The same flies were then returned to 18Â°C, Dnc-EGFP-Dnc expression in MB was re-established within 24 hr, and the learning phenotype was recovered fully within 48 hr.

Of these, 2800 insertions are in a coding intron and can be used for protein tagging of more than 1862 different genes. We introduced an artificial exon that encodes a SA-Linker-EGFP-FlAsH-StrepII-TEV-3xFlag-Linker-SD tag via RMCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Venken et al., 2011a</xref>) and created 450 protein trap alleles that tag 400 different genes. We present a detailed analysis of 200 tagged genes/proteins, and we performed a series of knockdown experiments on four tagged genes to assess the key features of this collection and demonstrate its power for functional analysis.</p><p>We previously described MiMIC insertions in a coding intron of three genes that had recessive lethal phenotypes and showed that the lethality could be reverted by removing the gene trap cassette by RMCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Venken et al., 2011a</xref>). Our data show that 92% of MiMICs inserted in a coding intron in the gene trap configuration are highly mutagenic and function as gene traps, while 100% of those that are in the opposite configuration are not mutagenic. These data demonstrate that the selected SA (Splice Acceptor) in the MiMIC element, also used in the tagging cassette, is highly efficient and minimizes exon skipping. This is also corroborated by the fact that we only observe the predicted tagged isoforms in three genes that were tested by Western blotting: <italic>Î±-Cat, dlg1</italic>, and <italic>brp</italic>. This minimal level of exon skipping permits robust knockdown of the transcripts and proteins encoded by these genes using iGFPi and deGradFP (see below).</p><p>The analysis of the expression patterns and genetic tests of the 200 tagged genes reveals three highly valuable and surprising features of the library. First, EGFP expression can be detected in CNS of 90% of tagged genes. This is a surprisingly high number as it shows that most genes are expressed at sufficiently high levels to be detected with EGFP in their endogenous context. Second, intronic tagging does not obviously disrupt protein function in 77% of the 114 cases examined. This is also a surprisingly high portion of genes and is possibly due to the presence of unstructured linkers on either side of the tag. Third, expression of EGFP can be imaged in unfixed tissues in more than 90% of the samples tested. Note that this percentage has steadily risen during our project and the use of better confocal scopes has dramatically improved these numbers. The latter data are important as they document that most genes are expressed at levels that should permit direct imaging of GFP fluorescence in live tissue. These features make the collection very valuable and useful for many different applications.</p><p>Comparison of two knockdown strategies based on iGFPi and deGradFP using four different genes reveals some differences. Both strategies appear to be efficient during development. RNAi expressed in the zygote is unlikely to remove the maternal proteins deposited in the egg, but they are removed or strongly reduced by deGradFP in the case of <italic>dlg1</italic>. deGradFP is more efficient than the iGFPi system, except with knockdown of <italic>Î±-Cat</italic> in eyes where iGFPi exhibits a more robust phenotype. In contrast, for Brp-EGFP-Brp, RNAi knockdown causes similar phenotypes to deGradFP in embryogenesis and first instar larvae, but iGFPi leads to milder or no phenotypes at later stages, especially when the temperature shifts are performed in adults. These results suggest that the Brp protein is stable in adults and that the deGradFP system is able to target and disrupt Brp function, although it takes much longer to achieve than in embryos or larvae. In summary, both knockdown strategies should be explored when possible.</p><p>It was previously shown that during embryogenesis deGradFP requires less than 3 hr to remove a protein encoded by a transgenic <italic>His2Av</italic> construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>). However, the temperature induced protein knockdowns that we observe take significantly longer. In the case of Brp-EGFP-Brp it takes at least 12 hr to observe a significant reduction in protein expression level in third instar larvae. Strong reductions in expression and a severe loss of synaptic transmission are observed 18 hr after a temperature shift in third instar larvae. For Dnc-EGFP-Dnc protein, we observe a severe knock down after 24 hr in adults, but it takes 48 hr at 28Â°C to observe a near complete loss of the protein in the mushroom bodies. In contrast to Brp-EFP-Brp and Dlg1-EGFP-Dlg1 where knockdown in adults can take up to 3 weeks or longer at 28Â°C to exhibit a severe phenotype. Yet, a ubiquitous adult knockdown with <italic>actin-GAL4</italic> driving UAS-deGradFP for Î±-Cat, WASp and Bifid (optomotorblind) results in lethality within a few days (data not shown). These observations suggest that differences in developmental stage, tissue, GAL4 strength and temperature will alter the dynamics of protein degradation with the deGradFP system leading to variation from protein to protein. As an additional note, we have observed that knockdown efficiency during developmental experiments is greatly enhanced when GAL4 is maternally deposited, by using GAL4 driver virgins.</p><p>The ability to tailor conditions will permit analyses of different knock down levels at different temperatures with different drivers. Given that allelic series have been shown to be extremely valuable in genetic studies, important biological information can be derived by varying the knockdown conditions, providing tremendous flexibility for in vivo analyses. While <italic>Drosophila</italic> is recognized as being one of the premier model organisms for the genetic analysis of gene function, one limitation has been the difficulty of conditionally knocking down genes or proteins in adults, especially in the adult nervous system. To achieve this goal, typically a complex set of reagents needs to be created, even with the simplest designs. These include a null or severe loss of function mutation, a UAS-cDNA rescue construct, a ubiquitously expressed GAL4 driver to rescue the mutation, and a GAL80<sup>ts</sup> construct to conditionally inactivate the GAL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McGuire et al., 2003</xref>). Using the library described here, we can now design large genetic screens in which we knock down proteins systematically in specific adult neurons or other tissues. The reversibility of the phenotype associated with the loss (28Â°C) and restoration (18Â°C) of the protein provide an important advantage as they permit us to directly pinpoint the cause of the phenotype, as well as the identity of the tissue that underlies the phenotype, as illustrated by the reversible MB-specific knockdown of the Dnc-EGFP-Dnc protein.</p><p>While we have focused on the uses of MiMIC insertions in coding introns in this paper, MiMIC insertions in other parts of genes and in intergenic regions can be used for many other genomic manipulation applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wesolowska and Rong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Venken et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Venken and Bellen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bateman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vilain et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, MiMICS in coding introns have recently been used to create gene specific GAL4 lines that permit one to reveal where genes are expressed when endogenous protein levels are low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diao et al., 2014</xref>, in press Cell Reports; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gnerer et al., 2015</xref>, in press Nucleic Acids Research). In summary, the resource that we have developed opens the door to numerous different applications and permits unprecedented manipulations of fly genes in vivo.</p><p>Given the breath of applications associated with in vivo tagged genes and proteins, a genome wide collection of MiMIC insertions and tagged genes would be extremely useful. We are therefore using RMCE to insert a GFP tag into an additional 1200 genes in which there is a MiMIC insertion in a coding intron. Finally, the GDP has recently embarked on a large-scale project to tag 5000 selected genes by inserting a MiMIC-like cassette that can be targeted precisely using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation, mapping and selection of MiMIC insertion lines</title><p>New MiMIC insertions were generated by mobilizing the MI00827 insertion from the <italic>X</italic> chromosome to autosomal sites or by mobilizing the MI00000A or MI00000B insertions from a <italic>TM3, Sb</italic> balancer chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>DNA segments flanking the new MiMIC insertions were amplified by inverse PCR, sequenced, and mapped by alignment to the reference genome sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Venken et al., 2011a</xref>).

Lines were selected for inclusion in the GDP collection by reviewing each insertion site with respect to annotated genes and the sites of other MiMIC insertions that were already part of the selected collection. Any insertion that was the first MiMIC hit in a gene was selected. When there were multiple insertions within a gene, priority was given to insertions within coding introns, coding exons, and introns in the 5â² UTR. Insertions within a coding intron or exon shared by the most annotated transcript isoforms were selected when possible. Multiple insertions were often selected for a gene if they hit different parts of the gene (e.g., one insertion in a coding intron and one in a coding exon) or if they provided a way of differentially tagging multiple annotated protein isoforms. We selected one insertion line in each of several tandemly repeated gene families (e.g., the histone and 5S rRNA genes), even though we could not localize the insertion to a unique copy within the tandem array. One of the goals of the MiMIC screen was to create an array of MiMIC insertions throughout the genome, spaced no more than 40 kb apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Venken et al., 2011a</xref>). Toward this end, we selected intergenic MiMIC insertions if they were inserted &gt;20 kb from other MiMICs already in the collection. The <italic>attP</italic> sites of intergenic MiMICs can facilitate targeted mutagenesis of nearby genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wesolowska and Rong, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58a">2013</xref>) and other genome engineering applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Venken and Bellen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bateman et al., 2013</xref>). Lines that were selected for the GDP collection were balanced, and their insertion sites were verified by resequencing, before delivery to the BDSC. The flanking sequences of all MiMIC insertions sent to the BDSC are available from the project website and have been submitted to GenBank.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Protein tagging via RMCE</title><p>Approximately 150 males of a specific MiMIC line were crossed to 400 virgins females expressing Î¦C31 integrase using the vasa promoter inserted on the X chromosome or on the IV chromosome (<italic>y</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup><italic>M{vas-int.B}ZH-2A w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup><italic>; sna</italic><sup><italic>Sco</italic></sup><italic>/SM6a</italic> or <italic>y</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup><italic>M{vas-int.B}ZH-2A w*; Sb/TM6b, Hu, Tb</italic> or <italic>FM7j, B[1]; M{vas-int.B}ZH-102D</italic>).

Briefly, wandering third instar larvae were dissected in ice-cold, 0.25 mM calcium HL-3 (70 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 115 mM sucrose, 5 mM trehalose, and 5 mM HEPES; pH 7.2), and rinsed with HL-3 containing 0.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. The fillet was incubated in the latter solution for at least 3 min before recording. Recordings were made from body-wall muscles 6 (abdominal segment 3) with sharp electrodes filled with a 2:1 mixture of 2 M potassium acetate and 2 M potassium chloride. Data were collected only when resting membrane potential was below â65 mV. EJPs were evoked by directly stimulating the hemisegmental nerve through a glass capillary electrode at 0.2 Hz. Stimulus pulses were generated by pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and the applied currents were 6 Î¼A Â± 3 with fixed stimulus duration at 0.3 ms. 30 evoked EJPs were recorded from each muscle for analysis. Miniature EJP (mEJP) events were collected for 2 min. Both EJPs and mEJPs were amplified with an Axoclamp 900A amplifier (Molecular Devices) and digitized by Digidata 1550 Digitizer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Experiments were performed at room temperature (20Â°Câ22Â°C). EJPs were analyzed with pClamp 10, and mEJPs were analyzed using the Mini Analysis Program (Synaptosoft 29 Inc., Decatur, GA). The EJPs amplitudes were corrected by nonlinear summation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17a">Feeney et al., 1998</xref>). The quantal content of evoked release was calculated from individual muscles by the ratio of the average EJP amplitude over the average mEJP amplitude.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Learning assays</title><p>All flies are in <italic>y w</italic> background for conditional knock-down. For conditional protein knock-down, 1 day after eclosion flies are transferred from 18Â°C to 28Â°C for 3 days. For testing the reversibility, these flies are returned from the 28Â°C back to 18Â°C for 2 days. Aversive olfactory learning was performed by T-maze apparatus with a Pavlovian conditioning procedure as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tully and Quinn, 1985</xref>). Briefly, one training session consists of approximately 100 flies. During each session electrical shock is paired with the presence of one of the two odors (3-octanol and 4-methylcyclohexanol). Learning was measured 3 min after a single training session. Eight sessions were conducted for this odor-shock pairing (â¼800 flies) and then eight additional sessions were conducted with the other odor paired with the shock (1600 flies in total). The score is calculated as the number of flies avoiding the conditioned odor minus the number of flies avoiding the unconditioned odor divided by the total number of flies. The Performance Index (PI) is calculated as the average score of the two performances. Statistical analyses used KaleidaGraph 4.1 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Performance Indexes were evaluated via one-way ANOVA followed by planned comparisons among the relevant groups with a Tukey Honestly Significant Difference test. All data are presented as mean Â± SEM. *p &lt; 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Ying Fang for injecting hundreds of thousands of embryos; Jianping Li, Zhihua Wang, Qiaohong Gao and Lily Wang for creating the 15,000 MiMIC insertion stocks; and Hongling Pan for complementation tests.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor), Mani Ramaswami (Reviewing editor), and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. Should this be accepted for publication, we would like to consider this as a Tools and resources article, a new category we are planning to introduce.</p><p>All the evaluators see the importance and interest of your manuscript. However, all concur that the comments below are useful and relevant to better establish and communicate the main conclusions and value of the manuscript. You should therefore address these in a revised manuscript. If there are any that you find to be difficult or feel are irrelevant, please let us know indicating your reasons and we will consider your arguments.</p><p>This manuscript represents a beautifully presented description of a new library of MiMIC insertions that will be of great benefit to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> community. This study by Bellen and colleagues describes an expanded resource of MiMIC insertions that can be of multiple use to the fly community. Technologically, it is a follow-up from earlier work (Venken, 2011, Nat Met) using the same technology, however providing lager numbers and showing additional applications. As a proof of principle, the authors tag 400 genes with a EGFP tag and provide evidence that incorporation of the tag generally does not interfere with protein function. The authors then show how the EGFP tag can be used with GFP-RNAi and deGrad-FP to knockdown tagged mRNAs and proteins. Lastly, they demonstrate the utility of the MiMIC lines by providing three examples of how these reagents can be used to genetically dissect gene function in the nervous system.</p><p>The major impact of this study is the numbers and not the biology. The study isolated 6,800 new MiMIC lines, 1,733 are in âcodingâ introns, of which 1,658 are predicted to label all isoforms. A selected set of lines was used to tag 200 genes with GFP by RMCE and a few of them were investigated in a bit more detail in this study. The authors state that 77% of the internally GFP tagged proteins are functional and &gt;90% can be detected in live tissue. The authors conclude that their tagging generally enables tissues specific knock-down, which can be controlled in time using deGradFP or GFP-RNAi.</p><p>These conclusions are in principle valid and important, however there are several concerns:</p><p>1) The authors conclude that 77% of the tagged lines are functional as 88 of 114 protein traps in (predicted) essential genes are viable. In the same paper they state that only 58 of 63 gene traps (within the same gene set of 114 genes) are actually lethal. Thus, not all gene traps in âessentialâ genes are lethal and hence the authors' conclusion of 77% is not valid. They should rather only count how many of the 58 lethal gene traps were reverted to viable proteins traps when inserting the GFP cassette. That number should be more accurate and takes potential exon skipping into consideration.</p><p>More generally, the conclusion that 77% of the tagged proteins âretain function or are not severely affectedâ is based, at least in part, on the assumption that their EGFP cassette sequence is incorporated into nearly 100% of the mature message. However, sequence context could potentially affect the efficiency of cassette splicing. The authors should consider toning down their language.</p><p>For example, in the second paragraph of the subsection headed âKnockdown of alpha-Catenin with iGFPi and deGradFP recapitulates known phenotypesâ, in the Results section, the authors state: âHence, we are not able to detect untagged protein in homozygous tagged animals, indicating that the vast majority or all protein is tagged.â However, a small amount of endogenous protein appears visible on the presented <italic>alpha-Cat</italic>, Dlg1 and Brp westerns. Therefore the authors should rewrite this sentence. Likewise, in the same paragraph, when stating that âwesterns with anti-GFP show a nearly identical banding pattern in these flies, demonstrating that little or no exon skipping is occurring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, bottom), the authors should delete âor noâ. Addressing such caveats throughout the paper and in the discussion would in no way diminish the usefulness of this resource.</p><p>2) The beauty of a GFP tagged protein is to investigate its sub cellular localisation. However, the authors only provide tissue expression data and that only from the larval nervous system. This information does not go much beyond the FlyAtlas data of gene expression. Not even the nuclear factors like Jumu-GFP or H6-like homeobox-GFP are shown to localize in the nuclei. Were any new or unexpected patterns discovered? The authors state that Ac78c-GFP labels a subset of neuronal membranes. I cannot see this from the data presented. A few images particularly carefully comparing antibody and tagged-GFP labelling will be useful.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is redundant with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. It would be much more useful to give an overview how the 200 genes for expression analysis were selected from the 400 tagged genes, which again were selected from the 1,600 MiMICs. Can the authors expand their explanation for how these lines were chosen that is a bit more specific than ânon-randomâ? Why were they âsuspectedâ to be expressed in the nervous system? Have they been selected using fly atlas above a certain RNA expression level?</p><p>4) The paper mainly focuses on the larval nervous system. As this resource is supposed to be of general use, it would be useful to show that the used muscle myosin heavy chain splice acceptor is indeed efficiently used in other tissues like muscle, epidermis, endoderm etc. This could be easily shown by selecting a couple of ubiquitous essential genes that should result in lethality when GFP RNAi is driven in various tissues.</p><p>5) The authors nicely show that <italic>Î±-CatGFP</italic> overlaps with anti-Î±-Cat antibody in eye discs and that deGradFP and GFP RNAi driven by ey-GAL4 can result in some eye phenotypes in these flies. How do these phenotypes compare to the various available <italic>Î±-Cat</italic> RNAi lines? How strong is the protein reduction? As western blots of the Cat-GFP lines are shown, these data should be easy to acquire. It would be even more important to generalize knock-down efficiency by testing a few different number used genes with western blots. Again, these are straight forward experiments that would be very valuable for the community to judge, how well the technology works in general and not only in a few selected examples.</p><p>6) The authors argue that one major advantage of their technology is to eliminate gene function tissue specifically. Following this logic, why was Tub-GAL4 used to knock-down Dlg1-GFP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>? The loss of epithelial polarity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Dâd</xref> vs. g is not clear. Better data need to be provided supporting that conclusion.</p><p>7) We do not understand the interpretation of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. anti-Brp clearly shows two bands on western from wild type but only one from Brp-GFP flies. However, anti-GFP detects two bands from Brp-GFP with inverted intensities. The authors interpret these data such that anti Brp does not recognize some Brp-GFP isoforms, because of the GFP insertion. My interpretation is that rather splicing is abnormal, inverting the intensities and partially skipping the exon that contains the anti-Brp epitope.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05338.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors conclude that 77% of the tagged lines are functional as 88 of 114 protein traps in (predicted) essential genes are viable.

We have also shown phenotypes associated with knockdown of these tagged proteins in a variety of tissues types: imaginal discs (<italic>alpha-Cat</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; Dlg1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), eye (<italic>alpha-Cat</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>), larval gut (Dlg1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and adult brain (Dnc, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) The authors nicely show that</italic> Î±-CatGFP <italic>overlaps with anti-Î±-Cat antibody in eye discs and that deGradFP and GFP RNAi driven by ey-GAL4 can result in some eye phenotypes in these flies.

Western blotting of this tissue is difficult because of very unequal loading of knockdown samples versus controls. To address how the phenotypes with knockdown using deGradFP and iGRPi compare to the available <italic>alpha-Cat</italic> RNAi lines, we have added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref> showing eye images after knockdown in eyes. We performed knockdown of <italic>alpha-Cat</italic> in eyes using three different available RNAi lines FBst0033430, FBst0038987, FBst0038197. FBst0033430, causes rough eyes and reduction in eye size that is comparable to deGradFP knockdown of alpha-Cat-EGFP. This is in agreement with the only RNAi knockdown of Î±-Cat in the eye published by Ulrich Tepass and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seppa et al., 2008</xref>). The other two, FBst0038987 and FBst0038197, cause pupal lethality with little or no head development. However, no data are available related to the specificity of these RNAis. These results are now discussed in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>It would be even more important to generalize knock-down efficiency by testing a few different number used genes with western blots.

For these experiments, we shifted adult animals raised at 18Â°C to 28Â°C for 1-3 days to express deGradFP under the control of either the n-Syb-GAL4 or actin5C-GAL4 driver. Western blots of head extracts against GFP showed a range of knockdown efficiencies from 45% to nearly 100%. The efficiency of protein knockdown, as observed by Western blot, is highly dependent on the specific gene being targeted, the GAL4 driver being used, the developmental stage of the animal, the temperature, the time the animals are kept at 28Â°C, etc. These parameters were already discussed in the previous version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) The authors argue that one major advantage of their technology is to eliminate gene function tissue specifically</italic>. <italic>Following this logic, why was Tub-GAL4 used to knock-down Dlg1-GFP in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>?</italic></p><p>We used tub-Gal4 to knock down Dlg1-EGFP-Dlg1 in the whole animal in a temperature dependent manner to compare with <italic>dlg1</italic> maternal and zygotic null mutant phenotypes in a variety of tissues (i.e. brain, imaginal disc, gut).</p><p><italic>The loss of epithelial polarity in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4Dâd</italic></xref> <italic>vs. g is not clear.

We have changed the figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and the text accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
