However, cells do not translate all of the template mRNAs that they have available into proteins; instead they have a number of ways to block the process to control when certain proteins are made.</p><p>In budding yeast, the mRNA that codes for a protein called Hac1 is always present in the cell but the protein is normally not detected. The Hac1 protein is responsible for helping the cell deal with certain types of stress, so it only accumulates when the cell is experiencing such stresses. The mRNA that encodes Hac1 (referred to as <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA) contains a sequence called an intron. These sequences are normally cut out of mRNAs before they are read by the ribosome. However, the intron in the <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA is unusual, because it is only removed when cells are subjected to stress. The rest of the time, this intron serves to block the production of Hac1 through a poorly understood mechanism.</p><p>Now, Di Santo et al. show the <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA uses two strategies to keep itself fully repressed—both of which involve its intron. One strategy relies on a structure formed in the <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA that prevents ribosomes from starting translation in the first place. However, this block is occasionally bypassed, causing some Hac1 protein to be produced when it should not be. To deal with this, the Hac1 protein that is produced contains a short protein sequence, encoded by the intron, that targets this unneeded protein for degradation. These two strategies together comprise a “fail-safe” mechanism to completely repress the <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA.</p><p>Following on from these findings, it will be important to determine whether other mRNAs – both in budding yeast and in other species including humans – use a similar fail-safe strategy to block proteins from being made when they should not be.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20069.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20069.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP5OD017895</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Di Santo</surname><given-names>Rachael</given-names></name><name><surname>Aboulhouda</surname><given-names>Soufiane</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinberg</surname><given-names>David E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008069</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Di Santo</surname><given-names>Rachael</given-names></name><name><surname>Aboulhouda</surname><given-names>Soufiane</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinberg</surname><given-names>David E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The unspliced <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA does not give rise to detectable protein in budding yeast, despite its cytoplasmic localization, due to a two-part post-transcriptional silencing mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a eukaryotic stress response pathway that is activated when unfolded proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>). In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the central effector of the UPR is the transcription factor Hac1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox and Walter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mori et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nikawa et al., 1996</xref>). <italic>HAC1</italic> (and its metazoan ortholog <italic>Xbp1</italic>) is unique among eukaryotic genes in that it contains an intron that is excised through an unconventional cytoplasmic splicing reaction mediated by two proteins, Ire1p and tRNA ligase, rather than the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox and Walter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawahara et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sidrauski and Walter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sidrauski et al., 1996</xref>). In the absence of ER protein-folding stress, the intron-containing mRNA (denoted <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic>; ‘u’ for UPR ‘uninduced’) is transcribed and exported to the cytoplasm but does not give rise to detectable protein due to the presence of the inhibitory intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox and Walter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapman and Walter, 1997</xref>). The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen activates the ER-resident transmembrane kinase–endonuclease Ire1p, which cleaves out the intron from <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA via its cytoplasmic nuclease domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sidrauski and Walter, 1997</xref>). After the exons are joined by tRNA ligase, the resulting spliced mRNA (denoted <italic>HAC1<sup>i</sup></italic>; ‘i’ for UPR ‘induced’) is now translated into Hac1<sup>i</sup>p. This active transcription factor is imported into the nucleus, where it activates the expression of UPR target genes involved in restoring protein-folding homeostasis in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chapman et al., 1998</xref>). Intron removal is both necessary and sufficient to relieve the post-transcriptional silencing of <italic>HAC1</italic> that otherwise prevents Hac1p accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapman and Walter, 1997</xref>).</p><p>The post-transcriptional silencing of <italic>HAC1</italic> and its subsequent reversal by cytoplasmic splicing together enable a rapid UPR that does not depend on <italic>de novo</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rüegsegger et al., 2001</xref>). At the same time, a robust silencing mechanism is required to prevent ectopic accumulation of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p from the abundant cytoplasmic pool of <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA that might otherwise turn on UPR target genes in the absence of ER stress. The current model for silencing is that elongating ribosomes are stalled on the mRNA during translation, thereby preventing synthesis of full-length Hac1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rüegsegger et al., 2001</xref>). According to this model, the mediator of translational attenuation is a long-range base-pairing interaction between the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) and intron of <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA.</p><p>The key data supporting the stalled elongation model is that the majority of <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA sediments in the polysome region of a sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arava et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapman and Walter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox and Walter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuhn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mori et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Payne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rüegsegger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sathe et al., 2015</xref>) despite no detectable Hac1<sup>u</sup>p. Furthermore, the heavy-sedimenting <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA is distributed in a discontinuous pattern with peaks and valleys that precisely match the peaks and valleys observed for polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rüegsegger et al., 2001</xref>). These data provide convincing evidence that heavy-sedimenting <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA reflects ribosome association rather than another high-molecular-weight complex that co-sediments with polysomes, or so-called ‘pseudo-polysomes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thermann and Hentze, 2007</xref>). Given this apparent ribosome association of <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA, an alternative explanation for the absence of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p is that Hac1<sup>u</sup>p is synthesized but immediately degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox and Walter, 1996</xref>). However, Hac1<sup>u</sup>p and Hac1<sup>i</sup>p are thought to have similar half lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapman and Walter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawahara et al., 1997</xref>), arguing against differential protein degradation as the primary mechanism that prevents Hac1<sup>u</sup>p accumulation yet allows Hac1<sup>i</sup>p accumulation.</p><p>Despite widespread acceptance of the stalled elongation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Richter and Coller, 2015</xref>), the mechanism by which base pairing between untranslated regions causes ribosomes to stall in the open reading frame (ORF) is unknown. The reduced efficiency of translational attenuation in vitro suggested that additional factors might be involved in the inhibitory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rüegsegger et al., 2001</xref>), perhaps acting to transduce the signal from the untranslated regions to translating ribosomes. However, the sequence of the base-pairing region can be changed without affecting silencing if base pairing is preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rüegsegger et al., 2001</xref>), making it unlikely that any sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins are involved. In addition, the more recent discovery of the No-Go Decay (NGD) pathway that recognizes stalled ribosomes and targets the associated mRNA for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doma and Parker, 2006</xref>) raises the question of how the ribosome–<italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNP evades detection and subsequent turnover by the quality-control machinery. For these reasons, and others described below, we revisited the stalled elongation model, which led us to instead identify an entirely different mechanism of post-transcriptional silencing of <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA that reconciles these issues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Very few ribosome footprints on unspliced <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA</title><p>We recently reported improved ribosome-footprint profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>) and mRNA-abundance measurements from exponentially growing <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weinberg et al., 2016</xref>). Under these growth conditions <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA is almost entirely unspliced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and is distributed across a sucrose gradient with ~50% in the non-translating fractions and the remaining ~50% extending across all of the translating (i.e., 80<italic>S</italic> and larger) fractions without substantial enrichment in any particular fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), similar to previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arava et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapman and Walter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox and Walter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuhn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mori et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Payne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rüegsegger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sathe et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, the well-translated actin (<italic>ACT1</italic>) mRNA is essentially absent from the non-translating fractions and is found mostly in large polysomes. Based on the sedimentation of <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNPs, we predicted that the mRNA would generate a large number of ribosome-protected fragments, in a quantity only ~2-fold fewer than similarly abundant mRNAs (based on the fraction of <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA in the untranslated fractions). Strikingly, however, after normalizing for mRNA abundance <italic>HAC1</italic> generates the fewest ribosome-protected fragments among all expressed yeast genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>)—and ~50-fold fewer than expected from the polysome profile. Rather than providing evidence for stalled ribosomes on <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA, instead these observations suggest that either ribosomes are stalled on the mRNA in a closely packed configuration that prevents nuclease cleavage between ribosomes, which would eliminate the ~28-nucleotide fragments that are sequenced in the ribosome-profiling method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, middle); or that there are not stalled ribosomes on <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, bottom).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20069.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ribosome density on unspliced <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Polysome analysis of <italic>HAC1</italic> and <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNAs.

Alternatively, the associated ribosomes might be bound in a conformation that is unrelated to translation of <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA. We therefore devised an experiment to definitively determine whether the ribosomes bound to <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA reflect ribosomes that were engaged in its translation. To do so, we took advantage of the observation that <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA is distributed across all of the translating fractions of a sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). If the deep sedimentation is due to multiple translating ribosomes being stalled on a single mRNA, then reducing the number of translating ribosomes that can fit on the mRNA should shift the sedimentation pattern toward lighter fractions. We designed a series of constructs containing point mutations in the first exon of <italic>HAC1</italic> that created premature termination codons, which reduce the size of the ORF and thereby limit the number of translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top). To ensure that the mutant alleles were expressed at near wild-type levels, we replaced the endogenous <italic>HAC1</italic> allele without disrupting flanking regulatory regions. Remarkably, each of the mutant mRNAs had a sedimentation pattern that was indistinguishable from the wild-type mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, bottom). In the most extreme case, the mRNA containing a 21-nucleotide ORF that can only accommodate a single translating ribosome still co-sedimented with polysomes containing upwards of 10 ribosomes (fraction 14 of the gradient). These data provide direct evidence that the polysome-like sedimentation of <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA is not due to stalled ribosomes on the mRNA.</p><p>We hypothesized that the ribosome association of <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA was instead due to non-specific interactions between the mRNA and bona fide polysomes formed on other mRNAs. To evaluate the extent of such non-specific interactions, we introduced an exogenous control RNA that should not be translated: an uncapped luciferase-encoding RNA purified from an in vitro transcription reaction. We analyzed the sedimentation behavior of this control RNA when it was added to lysis buffer compared to when it was added to the yeast lysate prior to centrifugation. Surprisingly, some of the exogenous RNA was found in the translating fractions of the lysate—a behavior not observed in lysis buffer alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, middle). Through extensive optimization, we found that the addition of heparin to the lysis buffer (at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml) was sufficient to largely prevent the deep sedimentation of exogenous RNA. The addition of heparin also had a major effect on the sedimentation of <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA, as most (83%) now sedimented in the non-translating fractions of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, bottom). In contrast, the sedimentation of <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, bottom) and the overall polysome profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, top) were largely unchanged, suggesting that heparin competed away non-specific interactions without disrupting bona fide polysomes.</p><p>Based on these results, we re-analyzed the <italic>HAC1</italic> mutants with shortened ORFs using heparin-containing lysis buffer. Under these conditions, the polysome co-sedimentation of each of the mRNAs was greatly reduced (from ~50% to &lt; 20%) but there was still no difference among the constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), providing further evidence against stalled ribosomes on <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA.

Together, these results demonstrate that at steady state <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA is not associated with either actively elongating or stalled ribosomes.

Remarkably, cells expressing this construct had no detectable GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), despite the corresponding mRNA being abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and detected on polysomes due to the absence of the base-pairing interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, the coding region at the 5′ end of the intron is sufficient for complete silencing of the GFP reporter. Introducing a termination codon between <italic>GFP</italic> and the intron restored robust fluorescence comparable to that observed for the intronless construct, which implicated translation of the 5′ end of the intron as required for silencing. Furthermore, making 10 nucleotide changes that maintained the coding potential of the intron-encoded tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, bottom) had no effect on silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that the amino-acid sequence encoded by the 5′ end of the intron is more important than the nucleotide sequence itself.</p><p>To determine whether the 10-amino-acid element alone was sufficient for silencing in the absence of any other <italic>HAC1</italic> sequences, we expressed <italic>GFP</italic> from a different locus in the yeast genome (<italic>TMA7</italic>) either with or without the 10-amino-acid tail. When the 10-amino-acid sequence was either absent or not translated due to a premature stop codon, we observed robust GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, there was no fluorescence detected in cells expressing GFP containing the 10-amino-acid tail. Thus, the C-terminal tail of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p is sufficient for silencing independently of the rest of the <italic>HAC1</italic> intron and any other <italic>HAC1</italic> sequences.</p><p>Having established the effects of the 10-amino-acid tail in isolation, we next examined the effects of the tail when translation initiation was inhibited by the base-pairing interaction. In an otherwise wild-type <italic>HAC1</italic> context, preventing translation of the 10-amino-acid tail either by deleting the entire sequence or by introducing a stop codon caused GFP to accumulate to low but detectable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) without greatly affecting the sedimentation of the corresponding mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, even when base pairing is intact there is some low-level accumulation of GFP that is normally suppressed by the 10-amino-acid silencing element.</p><p>In the context of reporter constructs lacking the intron-encoded C-terminal tail, mutations in either the 5′-UTR or intron that disrupted base pairing greatly increased the amount of GFP, while the compensatory double-mutant construct with restored base pairing had only low levels of GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results are in agreement with previous GFP reporter experiments, which used constructs that contained a stop codon between the <italic>GFP</italic> and intron sequences and therefore had inadvertently eliminated the effects of the 10-amino-acid tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapman and Walter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rüegsegger et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Together, our GFP reporter experiments indicate that the <italic>HAC1</italic> intron mediates post-transcriptional silencing through a pair of independent but partially redundant mechanisms: base-pairing interactions with the 5′-UTR that inhibit translation initiation, and a novel silencing mechanism mediated by the intron-encoded C-terminal tail of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p. Robust expression requires that both silencing mechanisms be inactivated, as would happen simultaneously when the intron is removed by Ire1p-dependent splicing.</p><p>What is the mechanism by which the intron-encoded tail of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p silences gene expression? Because disrupting translation of the tail elevated protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) without affecting polysome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), we inferred that the tail was exerting its effect downstream of translation initiation. We therefore reasoned that the 10-amino-acid sequence was acting either by halting translation across the entire mRNA (after polysome formation); or by promoting protein degradation. Our inability to detect GFP containing the 10-amino-acid tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) prevented us from directly comparing the half lives of GFP with and without the tail. Instead, to distinguish between stalled elongation and protein degradation, we designed a reporter construct that generates two separate polypeptides from a single round of translation through co-translational ‘cleavage’ mediated by a viral 2A peptide (Sharma et al., 2012). After screening for a 2A peptide sequence that functions efficiently in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), we designed a construct containing HA-mRuby and GFP sequences separated by the P2A peptide (derived from porcine teschovirus-1). The GFP sequence downstream of P2A was appended with the 10-amino-acid tail (or was not, as a control), which should lead to the absence of detectable GFP regardless of the mechanism of action. In contrast, the upstream HA-tagged mRuby should only be detected if translation itself is not affected by the 10-amino-acid sequence, since it reports on the number of rounds of translation but is not covalently linked to the inhibitory tail. Assaying for GFP by immunoblotting revealed that accumulation of the protein was suppressed by the 10-amino-acid tail, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, HA-mRuby was detected at similar levels whether or not the tail was included in the construct. These results indicate that the tail functions downstream of translation, likely by acting as a ‘degron’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Varshavsky, 1991</xref>) that targets the protein for immediate degradation after synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox and Walter, 1996</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Identification of <italic>DUH1</italic> through a genetic selection</title><p>If the C-terminal tail of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p functions as a degron, additional proteins may be involved in recognizing the degron and targeting the covalently linked protein for degradation.

We constructed strains in which the first exon of <italic>HAC1</italic> was replaced by <italic>HIS3</italic>, which we reasoned might behave like the analogous <italic>GFP</italic> reporter genes and be completely silenced by the 10-amino-acid sequence.

We reasoned that such spontaneous suppressor strains would have very few mutations, making it possible to identify suppressor mutations by whole-genome sequencing without requiring backcrossing or forming complementation groups. Thus, to isolate mutants with defective <underline>d</underline>egron-<underline>d</underline>ependent <underline>s</underline>ilencing ('<italic>dds</italic> mutants') we simply plated the selection strain expressing HA-tagged His3p with the 10-amino-acid tail on histidine-lacking medium and isolated the rare single colonies that grew for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). From five independent platings we isolated a total of 123 mutant strains that, when re-streaked, could grow on medium lacking histidine. Sanger sequencing of the C-terminal region of the reporter gene in each mutant identified 15 strains harboring a <italic>cis</italic> mutation that either altered the sequence of the degron, introduced a premature stop codon before or within the degron, or removed the stop codon of the degron resulting in a six-amino-acid C-terminal extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>)—all of which provided confirmation that the genetic selection worked as desired.</p><p>From the strains that displayed histidine prototrophy, we picked 35 (including four <italic>cis</italic> mutants) to analyze by immunoblotting and found that all had detectable HA-His3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We selected 20 of these strains with unknown mutations for whole-genome sequencing (as well as the parental selection strain as a reference, and three strains with known mutations in the degron as positive controls for our variant-calling procedure), taking care to select strains that varied widely in HA-His3p abundance or growth rate to minimize our chances of sequencing the same mutation in multiple strains. We sequenced the 24 genomes together in a single lane of a HiSeq sequencer using 50-nucleotide single-end reads, which provided 38–74X coverage (9.3–18.0 million reads) of each yeast genome. We then used standard mapping and variant-calling tools (BWA and FreeBayes, respectively) to identify variants that were absent from the parental genome, which successfully recovered the positive-control <italic>cis</italic> mutants. Remarkably, 17 out of the 20 strains that we sequenced contained a mutation in the same gene <italic>YJL149W</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and in each case we confirmed the mutation by Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Because no other ORF was found mutated in more than one of the 20 mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), we focused our follow-up efforts on <italic>YJL149W</italic>.</p><p><italic>YJL149W</italic> had previously been named <italic>DAS1</italic> for '<underline>D</underline>st1-delta 6-<underline>A</underline>zauracil <underline>S</underline>ensitivity <underline>1</underline>' when it was identified in a genetic screen unrelated to the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gómez-Herreros et al., 2012</xref>). Based on the protein’s domain structure (containing an F-box domain and leucine-rich repeats) and physical interactions with the SCF core components Cdc53p and Skp1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Willems et al., 1999</xref>), <italic>YJL149W</italic> was annotated as a 'putative SCF ubiquitin ligase F-box protein' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cherry et al., 2012</xref>). F-box proteins act as adapters to target substrates for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore propose to rename this gene <italic>DUH1</italic> for '<underline>D</underline>egrader of <underline>U</underline>nspliced <italic><underline>H</underline>AC1</italic> gene product <underline>1</underline>' to reflect its role in the degradation of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p, as we demonstrate later.</p><p>The <italic>DUH1</italic> variants that we identified in our 17 strains comprised 16 different mutations, of which 8 were nonsense, 7 were missense, and 1 was a frameshift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right). The nonsense mutations tended to cluster in the first half of the ORF, suggesting that they likely functioned as null alleles. In addition, three of the 17 strains containing mutations in <italic>DUH1</italic> did not contain any other mutations, implicating the <italic>DUH1</italic> mutations as causative for the phenotype. We therefore tested whether knocking-out <italic>DUH1</italic> (which is non-essential) in the original selection strain recapitulated the de-silencing phenotype. Disrupting <italic>DUH1</italic> led to a dramatic increase in the steady-state abundance of HA-His3p containing the 10-amino-acid tail, while having no effect on HA-His3p lacking the tail or constructs repressed by long-range base pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Analogously, deleting <italic>DUH1</italic> in the GFP reporter strains completely eliminated the silencing effect of the Hac1<sup>u</sup>p tail but had no effect on base-pairing-mediated silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, in the absence of <italic>DUH1</italic> the GFP reporter in a wild-type <italic>HAC1</italic> context was now expressed at the same leaky level as previously seen for the reporter in which a stop codon was positioned between <italic>GFP</italic> and the intron, indicating that degron-dependent silencing is required to suppress leaky GFP expression.

All of the mRNAs encoding HA-tagged Hac1p variants were expressed at similar levels in the presence versus the absence of <italic>DUH1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Strikingly, at the protein level only the abundance of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p was affected by disruption of <italic>DUH1</italic>, increasing by ~five fold in the knock-out strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The increased abundance of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p in the absence of <italic>DUH1</italic> was not due to increased translation, as evidenced by deletion of <italic>DUH1</italic> having no impact on ribosome density on any of the HA-tagged reporter mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Deletion of <italic>DUH1</italic> stabilized Hac1<sup>u</sup>p and increased its half-life upper bound to 2 minutes.

Our results using constructs in which the base-pairing region was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) suggested that the previously observed accumulation of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p was unknowingly being buffered by Duh1p-dependent degradation. To directly address this possibility, we generated HA-tagged constructs in which the base-pairing region was disrupted by mutations in either the 5′-UTR or intron or was reconstituted by the compensatory mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and determined the effect of <italic>DUH1</italic> deletion on steady-state protein levels.

The existence of such a fail-safe silencing mechanism implies that ectopic production of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p has physiological consequences that negatively impact cellular fitness. However, a previous study suggested that Hac1<sup>u</sup>p is itself not an active transcription factor because it lacks the activating 18-amino-acid tail found in Hac1<sup>i</sup>p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mori et al., 2000</xref>), raising the question as to why Hac1<sup>u</sup>p accumulation would need to be tightly regulated. We hypothesized that Hac1<sup>u</sup>p was in fact an active transcription factor but that in the previous study its accumulation had been prevented due to the experiments being performed in a <italic>DUH1</italic> background. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the ability of strains that constitutively produced either Hac1<sup>i</sup>p, Hac1<sup>u</sup>p, or Hac1<sup>Δtail</sup>p to grow under conditions of chronic ER stress induced by the drug tunicamycin.

To test this possibility, we examined how strains expressing HA-tagged but otherwise unmodified <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA grew on media containing different concentrations of tunicamycin. At the highest tunicamycin concentration only strains expressing <italic>IRE1</italic> could grow regardless of whether <italic>DUH1</italic> was also present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), suggesting that growth was dependent on the abundant Hac1<sup>i</sup>p produced from <italic>HAC1</italic><sup>i</sup> mRNA.

The initial silencing mechanism that acts on <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA is a block to translation initiation, which is caused by secondary structure in the 5′-UTR that inhibits binding or progression of the scanning ribosome. However, this silencing mechanism does not entirely prevent translation, allowing the production of small amounts of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p. Because Hac1<sup>u</sup>p is an active transcription factor, even small amounts of this protein produced by leaky translation could activate the UPR and affect cellular physiology. To prevent this, a second silencing mechanism exists to rapidly degrade any Hac1<sup>u</sup>p that is produced by leaky translation. By relying on recognition of the unique C-terminal tail of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p by the F-box protein Duh1p, the protein-degradation mechanism selectively targets Hac1<sup>u</sup>p for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Because both translational repression and protein degradation rely on sequences found in the intron of <italic>HAC1</italic>, removal of the intron by Ire1p-dependent splicing simultaneously results in the inactivation of both silencing mechanisms. In this way, splicing allows the rapid accumulation of Hac1<sup>i</sup>p from the existing pool of <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20069.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Fail-safe post-transcriptional silencing of unspliced <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA.</title><p>See the main text for a description.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20069.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20069.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-20069-fig8-v3"/></fig></p><p>One surprising finding of our studies is that the polysome-like sedimentation of <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA is not due to translation of the mRNA. Instead, our results using mRNAs containing premature stop codons and using a modified lysis buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) indicate that translation initiation on <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA almost never occurs due to the 5′-UTR–intron base-pairing interaction. The lack of appreciable translation of <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA suggests that the substrate for Ire1p-dependent splicing is untranslated mRNA, rather than polysomal mRNA containing stalled ribosomes as originally proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rüegsegger et al., 2001</xref>). A corollary of this is that the synthesis of Hac1<sup>i</sup>p requires <italic>de novo</italic> translation initiation on <italic>HAC1<sup>i</sup></italic> mRNA, rather than just the resumption of translation by stalled ribosomes that initiated on <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA. The initial hint that <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA is translationally repressed at the initiation rather than elongation stage came from ribosome-profiling data, which revealed a lack of ribosome-protected fragments derived from <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weinberg et al., 2016</xref>). At least in this case, our findings suggest that ribosome profiling can provide a more accurate measurement of translation than traditional polysome profiling.</p><p>What is the molecular basis for the polysome-like sedimentation of <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA? The disruption of the pseudo-polysomes by addition of heparin, which is more negatively charged than RNA itself, suggests that electrostatic interactions are responsible. Moreover, the discontinuous distribution of <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA that matches the peaks and valleys observed for polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rüegsegger et al., 2001</xref>) indicates that <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA is associated with integral numbers of actual 80<italic>S</italic> ribosomes. On the basis of these data, we propose that electrostatic interactions between <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA and either non-translating 80<italic>S</italic> ribosomes or, more likely, bona fide polysomes (containing both ribosomes and mRNA) are responsible for its polysome-like sedimentation. <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA may be especially prone to such non-specific interactions because of the strong initiation block, though other untranslated mRNA molecules (including the small fraction of ribosome-free mRNA molecules observed even for well-translated genes) may also behave similarly. In this regard, the analysis method (i.e., use of constructs containing premature stop codons) and experimental tools (i.e., exogenous RNA controls combined with heparin-containing lysis buffer) that we utilized here to definitively establish the translation state of <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA will be generally useful in polysome-profiling studies in the future.</p><p>After the unexpected discovery that eliminating the 5′-UTR–intron base pairing alone did not result in detectable protein expression, we uncovered the effect of protein degradation caused by an intron-encoded C-terminal degron. The genetic selection that we performed to identify components of the protein-degradation pathway yielded just a single gene with recurrent mutations: <italic>DUH1</italic>. Our failure to isolate mutations in other components of the ubiquitin–proteasome machinery (i.e., the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that presents the ubiquitin to the Duh1p-containing SCF complex for transfer onto Hac1<sup>u</sup>p; and subunits of the proteasome itself) may reflect the pleiotropic nature of such mutations, which would hinder growth despite the <italic>HIS3</italic> reporter gene being de-silenced; an extreme case is the essential gene encoding the sole E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme in yeast, <italic>UBA1</italic>. In addition, our reliance on spontaneous mutagenesis made it unlikely that we would have isolated multiple mutations in redundant sets of genes, which may also explain our failure to isolate E2 mutants given their sometimes overlapping functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 1993</xref>). Nonetheless, the fact that we isolated 16 different mutations in <italic>DUH1</italic> in 17 of our 20 sequenced strains illustrates the power of our genetic selection system. A noteworthy feature of our selection was that by combining spontaneous mutagenesis with whole-genome sequencing, we were able to rapidly go directly from phenotypic mutants to genotypic mutations without any crosses and relying on only simple computational tools for analysis.</p><p>Compared to an alternative silencing mechanism involving only protein degradation with no translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox and Walter, 1996</xref>), the fail-safe mechanism we discovered has the advantage of not wasting resources on the production of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p that will anyway be rapidly degraded. But why does budding yeast rely on a pair of silencing mechanisms to prevent accumulation of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p, rather than just completely blocking translation in the first place? An intriguing possibility is that the marginal stability of the 5′-UTR–intron base-pairing interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) is the cause of leaky translation but is also required to make the translational repression reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rüegsegger et al., 2001</xref>). If the base-pairing interaction were more stable and prevented translation altogether, splicing might not be sufficient for the intron to dissociate from the 5′-UTR despite their being covalently unlinked. Another possibility is that the act of translating the mRNA has a function. For example, a pioneer round of translation on <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA might be required to form the 5′-UTR–intron interaction that inhibits subsequent rounds of translation. Such a requirement might be due to the ribosome physically bringing the distant sequences together through a tethering mechanism, or due to the ribosome unwinding alternative competing structures that initially form with the ORF. A third possibility is that the small amount of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p being constantly produced and degraded has a function. In particular, the ability to regulate accumulation of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p through Duh1p without relying on Ire1p activation would provide a means of rapidly producing a small pool of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p in the absence of ER protein-folding stress. A constitutively produced yet transient pool of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p might also contribute to the switch-like behavior of the UPR, based on the predicted ability of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p to heterodimerize with Hac1<sup>i</sup>p and thereby facilitate proteasomal degradation of any Hac1<sup>i</sup>p produced from background splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, the leaky translation of <italic>HAC1<sup>u</sup></italic> mRNA that we discovered may reflect a more fundamental property of translational repression: that it is inherently incomplete. The two predominant mechanisms known to inhibit cap-dependent translation are upstream ORFs (uORFs) and 5′-UTR secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gebauer and Hentze, 2004</xref>). Inhibition by uORFs has been shown to be only partial, due to both leaky scanning enabling bypass of the uORF and reinitiation facilitating translation of the downstream ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meijer and Thomas, 2002</xref>). Our findings suggest that inhibition by 5′-UTR secondary structure may also be incomplete, potentially due to the action of RNA helicases that are constantly unwinding RNA structures <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rouskin et al., 2014</xref>). Future work may shed light on both the causes and consequences of the incomplete translational repression of unspliced <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast growth</title><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study were derived from BY4741 (<italic>MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0</italic>) and are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Rachel Green (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has also agreed to reveal their identity: Traude Beilharz (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an outstanding manuscript that tells a very complete story about multiple pathways for regulating the expression of Hac1p, such that protein is produced only during conditions of UPR stress. The study includes multiple approaches to address each question including a genetic screen with a novel E3 ligase identified. All three reviewers feel the manuscript is highly suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> with minor changes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors should address the citation issues raised by reviewer 2 and the figure issues raised by reviewers 1 and 3 (colors for exons/introns etc.). Finally, some language about the &quot;only&quot; gene that emerged from the strain should be corrected (full reviews included below).</p><p>Congratulations on an outstanding study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is a very complete and compelling manuscript defining the mechanisms though which Hac1 expression is controlled in the absence of UPR stress in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Contrary to earlier studies, DiSanto et al. establish that Hac1 translation is controlled first at the level of initiation through secondary structural interactions between the 5'UTR and the intron, and secondly, through protein degradation via a novel E3 ligase targeting the intron-encoded 8 aa sequence. The manuscript nicely resolves many small issues in the literature regarding this tightly regulated and biologically critical gene. A few small points are suggested below but this manuscript is highly suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The pseudo-polysome phenomenon is nicely addressed experimentally but could be more clearly described in the text. What is observed is A260 that rises about background in a rather amorphous smear – earlier studies that collected more fractions saw the ribosome peaks emerging – this could be discussed more explicitly. To the non-expert, the modest background A260 will not be particularly compelling, and so the modest reduction will not seem compelling either. This is a request for textual changes.</p><p>2) In all Figures, the 5' and 3' UTR are colored in black as though they are not part of the exons – for clarity, these should be colored in exon color but in thin lines instead of thick (for coding).</p><p>3) RNA level changes are dismissed as not relevant though in some figures (3A for example), there are substantial changes in RNA level that should not be so quickly dismissed.</p><p>4) Discussion of why this transcription factor Hac1u needs to be so tightly controlled, but why translational control is not sufficient, was a bit too long and speculative. This portion of the Discussion could be reduced.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript from the Weinberg lab addresses a longstanding mystery in the UPR field: why does the HAC1 mRNA appear in heavy polysomes even though it does not generate any protein product? Existing data supported a model where blockage of initiation by base-pairing between the intron and 5'UTR prevented HAC1 translation. It was assumed that this blockage somehow also stalled 80S elongating ribosomes and thereby accounted for the migration in heavy polysome fractions. Recently, ribosome profiling datasets revealed that the mRNA did not appear to be bound to translating 80S ribosomes. Experiments in this manuscript resolve this contradiction by showing the old polysome profiling methods were flawed and that the base-pairing between intron and 5'UTR does appear to block most translation from initiating. Surprisingly, however, the authors also found that elimination of this base-pairing interaction did not result in protein production, even though it does lead to migration of the mRNA in heavy polysome fractions (as observed by an improved polysome profiling method).</p><p>The authors then meticulously build a case for a model where the amino acid sequence encoded by the intron encodes a degron tag. This tag is recognized by a previously unknown E3 ligase that results in degradation of any Hac1 protein that happens to be produced from the unspliced transcript. Presumably, this system is important for eliminating protein produced by low levels of HAC1 translation that escape the initiation-based inhibition mechanism. The paper therefore reveals a new layer of regulation of this regulatory network and opens up many new questions for the field to explore.</p><p>The experimental work is very convincing and aside from a few minor points about inadequate citation (see below), I have no major concerns. I think this paper will generate wide interest because it raises so many new questions about UPR regulation and, more generally, the breadth of targets of the ubiquitin proteasome system.</p><p>Concern about adequate citation:</p><p>The original discovery of Hac1p function by Cox and Walter in 1996 showed that 1) Uninduced Hac1p is an effective stimulator of the UPR and 2) E2 ligases are involved in degrading uninduced Hac1p. Subsequent papers (including most recently work by the Dever and Dey labs) also showed that uninduced Hac1p is capable of conferring resistance to tunicamycin.</p><p>Therefore, the authors should eliminate the statement that their results, &quot;confirm our hypothesis that Hac1up is indeed a functional UPR transcription factor.&quot; This was already established and should be acknowledged as such. Second, they should point out that the idea of the intron &quot;tail&quot; sequence serving as a degron dates back two decades. While it's true that this model was not strongly embraced by the field, the Walter lab should be cited for first proposing and testing it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>I like this manuscript. It seems to me to reconcile multiple conflicts in the literature and to provide new insight in to the regulation of the UPR with a satisfying level of clarity. The data are of high quality and have been clearly designed and executed to probe the precise aspect of the experimental hypotheses in question. E.g., the clever use of reporters/ mutant strains/ and new technologies mean there is no confusion regarding the source of regulatory control. The problem of mRNA co-sedimentation with polysomes in the absence of translation is satisfyingly dealt with, although it will likely to confound the literature for some time to come. The sequencing of spontaneous suppressor mutants to define the second-phase repression by proteolysis is also lovely.</p><p>My comments/questions are therefor of a fairly minor nature, but might also be of interest to other readers.</p><p>1) In the figures, can the authors unify the schematics for the mRNA structures. Specifically, I thought <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> should have the same colour coding and intron included. At first reading of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, it took a while to recognise that fat-to-thin line transition meant inclusion of 3' nonsense stop codons. I'm not sure if this needs more explicit marks on the figures. Also should the purple line on the left-hand panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> be fat?</p><p>2) On the topic of the truncating stop-codons should there be comment about why these don't trigger NMD? Or is the fact that they don't more evidence toward the point that these mRNA are not translated.</p><p>3) At the end of the second paragraph of the subsection “An additional silencing mechanism downstream of translation initiation”: prompted by the point about 5'-3' looping being an impediment to &quot;binding or progress of the scanning ribosome&quot; I checked the recent TCP-seq App from Archer et al. Nature 2016 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioapps.erc.monash.edu/TCP/">http://bioapps.erc.monash.edu/TCP/</ext-link>) to see the HAC1 transcript had any interesting regulation by small subunit scanning. However, there is no-data, which is unexpected given HAC1s abundance. But it does suggest that the inhibition precedes binding of even a single SSU necessary for the TCP-seq approach.</p><p>4) In the Discussion: I wondered if an additional purpose or benefit of leaky translation might be that inhibition of proteolysis might be a kinetically quicker way to get a functional transcription factor with which to initiate the UPR, then by first splicing and new translation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20069.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The pseudo-polysome phenomenon is nicely addressed experimentally but could be more clearly described in the text.

In addition we have included two references to the ribosome peaks of <italic>HAC1</italic> signal that were observed in an earlier study.</p><p><italic>To the non-expert, the modest background A260 will not be particularly compelling, and so the modest reduction will not seem compelling either. This is a request for textual changes.</italic> </p><p>We have revised the text to highlight the fact that the modest background smear of signal represents a substantial fraction (~50%) of the total mRNA when considered in aggregate and that the reduction is also quite substantial (from ~50% down to &lt;20%).</p><p><italic>2) In all Figures, the 5' and 3' UTR are colored in black as though they are not part of the exons – for clarity, these should be colored in exon color but in thin lines instead of thick (for coding).</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer bringing to our attention this issue with the mRNA schematics. Because we have used similar mRNA schematics for <italic>HAC1</italic> variants as well as for <italic>GFP</italic> and <italic>HIS3</italic> reporter genes, the proposed solution is not ideal, as this would introduce confusion about the 5′-UTR portion of exon 1. In addition, we think it’s helpful to visually distinguish the constitutive 5′ and 3′ UTRs from the variably noncoding regions of the exons. Therefore, we have kept the thin black lines depicting the constitutive 5′ and 3′ UTRs of <italic>HAC1</italic> but have revised the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to better explain the mRNA schematics that we use throughout the manuscript. The revised legend now explicitly indicates that ‘constitutive 5′- and 3′-UTRs located within exons 1 and 2, respectively, are shown as thin black lines’ and that ‘the coding regions of exons 1 (teal) and 2 (purple) are labeled as “<italic>HAC1</italic> exon1” and “exon2”, respectively’.</p><p><italic>3) RNA level changes are dismissed as not relevant though in some figures (3A for example), there are substantial changes in RNA level that should not be so quickly dismissed.</italic> </p><p>We also noticed that in some cases RNA levels differed among constructs (as might be expected) and did not intend to dismiss these differences as irrelevant. Rather, our intent was to highlight the fact that differences in RNA levels alone cannot explain the differences in protein output that we observe. In two instances in the text, we describe the mRNA abundance data using the phrases “could not be accounted for” and “was not explained by” to explicitly make this point. In the two other instances where we refer to mRNA levels, we have revised the text to better convey this message: When describing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, we now explicitly refer to the comparison of construct 3 with constructs 5–6 as the data supporting the statement that “the mutant mRNAs were present at similar levels compared to the intronless mRNA”; and when referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, we now indicate that mRNAs were similar in abundance when comparing “the presence versus the absence of <italic>DUH1</italic>” rather than when comparing among constructs as originally implied. Importantly, in the figure that the referee mentioned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the largest differences in RNA levels corresponded to the constructs expressed from the <italic>TMA7</italic> locus compared to the <italic>HAC1</italic> locus, which is unsurprising given the alternative promoter.</p><p><italic>4) Discussion of why this transcription factor Hac1u needs to be so tightly controlled, but why translational control is not sufficient, was a bit too long and speculative. This portion of the Discussion could be reduced.</italic> </p><p>We have removed the most speculative portion of this discussion to make it shorter, while also incorporating the additional suggestion of Reviewer #3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>The experimental work is very convincing and aside from a few minor points about inadequate citation (see below), I have no major concerns. I think this paper will generate wide interest because it raises so many new questions about UPR regulation and, more generally, the breadth of targets of the ubiquitin proteasome system.</italic> </p><p><italic>Concern about adequate citation:</italic> </p><p><italic>The original discovery of Hac1p function by Cox and Walter in 1996 showed that 1) Uninduced Hac1p is an effective stimulator of the UPR and 2) E2 ligases are involved in degrading uninduced Hac1p. Subsequent papers (including most recently work by the Dever and Dey labs) also showed that uninduced Hac1p is capable of conferring resistance to tunicamycin.</italic> </p><p><italic>Therefore, the authors should eliminate the statement that their results, &quot;confirm our hypothesis that Hac1up is indeed a functional UPR transcription factor.&quot; This was already established and should be acknowledged as such.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the confusion caused by the poor wording of this statement and have revised the manuscript accordingly. The hypothesis confirmed by our results was that “Duh1p-dependent degradation normally masks the activity of Hac1<sup>u</sup>p”, not that Hac1<sup>u</sup>p is an active transcription factor.</p><p><italic>Second, they should point out that the idea of the intron &quot;tail&quot; sequence serving as a degron dates back two decades. While it's true that this model was not strongly embraced by the field, the Walter lab should be cited for first proposing and testing it.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we have added three additional citations to the Cox &amp; Walter (1996) publication that first proposed that the tail could act as a degron (once each in the Introduction, Results, and Discussion sections).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>My comments/questions are therefor of a fairly minor nature, but might also be of interest to other readers.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) In the figures, can the authors unify the schematics for the mRNA structures. Specifically, I thought <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> should have the same colour coding and intron included.</italic> </p><p>We meant for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> to depict an arbitrary mRNA rather than <italic>HAC1</italic>, which is why we chose to use a different color scheme. We have indicated this in the figure legend by referring to “an mRNA” rather than “<italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA”.</p><p><italic>At first reading of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, it took a while to recognise that fat-to-thin line transition meant inclusion of 3' nonsense stop codons. I'm not sure if this needs more explicit marks on the figures.</italic> </p><p>To maintain consistency with other schematics, we did not explicitly mark the nonsense stop codons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> but instead described in the legend “resulting ORFs shown as thick colored boxes”.</p><p><italic>Also should the purple line on the left-hand panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> be fat?</italic> </p><p>We confirmed that the purple lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> are correctly depicted as thick/thin lines where appropriate.</p><p><italic>2) On the topic of the truncating stop-codons should there be comment about why these don't trigger NMD? Or is the fact that they don't more evidence toward the point that these mRNA are not translated.</italic> </p><p>Our preliminary analysis of mRNA abundances suggests that the early stop codons don’t trigger NMD, which would be consistent with the mRNAs being untranslated since NMD requires translation. However, we have not directly measured the impact of NMD disruption (e.g., knockout of Upf1/2/3) on mRNA abundances and, therefore, cannot draw definitive conclusions about their NMD sensitivity.</p><p><italic>3) At the end of the second paragraph of the subsection “An additional silencing mechanism downstream of translation initiation”: prompted by the point about 5'-3' looping being an impediment to &quot;binding or progress of the scanning ribosome&quot; I checked the recent TCP-seq App from Archer et al. Nature 2016 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioapps.erc.monash.edu/TCP/">http://bioapps.erc.monash.edu/TCP/</ext-link>) to see the HAC1 transcript had any interesting regulation by small subunit scanning. However, there is no-data, which is unexpected given HAC1s abundance. But it does suggest that the inhibition precedes binding of even a single SSU necessary for the TCP-seq approach.</italic> </p><p>We, too, were excited to inspect <italic>HAC1</italic> in the recent TCP-seq dataset and found that there was no data. However, the TCP-seq data were generated in such a way that 80S-free mRNPs like <italic>HAC1</italic> would have been missed due to the initial pelleting step in the protocol. Therefore, we unfortunately could not use the data to gain further insight into the inhibition of <italic>HAC1</italic>.</p><p><italic>4) In the Discussion: I wondered if an additional purpose or benefit of leaky translation might be that inhibition of proteolysis might be a kinetically quicker way to get a functional transcription factor with which to initiate the UPR, then by first splicing and new translation.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and have incorporated this idea into the revised Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
