placenta is essential for the development of the fetus. Here, we were interested in the role of channels of the calcium homeostasis modulator (CALHM) family in the human placenta. By transcript analysis, we found the paralogs CALHM2, 4, and 6 to be highly expressed in this organ and upregulated during trophoblast differentiation. Based on electrophysiology, we observed that activation of these paralogs differs from the voltage- and calcium-gated channel CALHM1. Cryo-EM structures of CALHM4 display decameric and undecameric assemblies with large cylindrical pore, while in CALHM6 a conformational change has converted the pore shape into a conus that narrows at the intracellular side, thus describing distinct functional states of the channel. The pore geometry alters the distribution of lipids, which occupy the cylindrical pore of CALHM4 in a bilayer-like arrangement whereas they have redistributed in the conical pore of CALHM6 with potential functional consequences.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CALHM channels</kwd><kwd>placenta</kwd><kwd>transcription analysis</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>lipids</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_163421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dutzler</surname><given-names>Raimund</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stiftung Lindenhof Bern</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albrecht</surname><given-names>Christiane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCCR TransCure</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albrecht</surname><given-names>Christiane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Members of the calcium homeostasis modulator family expressed in the placenta form large channels with unknown activation properties that harbor a lipid bilayer on the inside of a cylindrical pore.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The placenta, a complex organ that develops during pregnancy, serves as a hub for the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the mother and the fetus. The flow of substances across the placenta is controlled by two distinct cell-layers, namely fetal capillary endothelial cells and syncytiotrophoblasts (STB). While endothelial cells lining the fetal vessels allow to a certain extent diffusion of (small) molecules through paracellular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edwards et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>), the STB layer constitutes a tight diffusion barrier. STB are polarized multinucleated cells presenting their apical side towards the maternal blood and their basal side towards the fetal capillaries. Hence, the targeted expression of receptors, channels or transport proteins of the STB determines the directionality of transport across the placenta, which is essential for the adequate development of the fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lager and Powell, 2012</xref>). Among the transport proteins in the placenta, the role of the calcium homeostasis modulator (CALHM) family is currently unknown. In humans, the CALHM family encompasses six paralogs, some of which function as non-selective channels that are permeable to large substances such as ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). CALHM1, the currently best characterized paralog, forms ion channels that are activated by depolarization and a decrease in the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taruno et al., 2013b</xref>) with mutations being associated with an increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dreses-Werringloer et al., 2008</xref>). Although functional on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma et al., 2012</xref>), in a physiological context CALHM1 probably forms heteromers with the subunit CALHM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma et al., 2018b</xref>). These heteromeric channels play an important role as secondary receptors for sweet, bitter and umami taste reception in type II taste bud cells by catalyzing the non-vesicular release of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Taruno et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taruno et al., 2013b</xref>). A second paralog with an assigned physiological role is CALHM2, which is ubiquitously expressed and was proposed to mediate ATP release in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ma et al., 2018a</xref>). The role of other paralogs has thus far remained elusive. Insight into the structural properties of the family was recently provided from studies on CALHM1 and 2 by cryo-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Demura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref>). CALHM2 was found to assemble into undecameric channels, which in certain cases dimerize via contacts on the extracellular side in an assembly that resembles gap-junctions. Based on this architecture, a potential role of CALHM2 as intercellular channels was proposed. Although predicted to be related to connexins and volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) of the LRRC8 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siebert et al., 2013</xref>), the four membrane-spanning helices of the CALHM subunit exhibit a distinct arrangement, which refutes a common structural ancestry between these protein families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast to CALHM2 channels, the structure of CALHM1 shows a smaller octameric organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Demura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref>), thus suggesting that the functional properties of activation and conduction might not be conserved within the family.</p><p>In the present study we were investigating the structural and functional properties of CALHM channels in the context of the placenta. We identified the three paralogs, CALHM2, 4 and 6, to be highly expressed in this organ. A systematic comparative functional characterization by electrophysiology did not reveal pronounced activity of either of these paralogs under conditions where CALHM1 channels are open, thus suggesting that the former might be regulated by different and currently unknown mechanisms. The structural characterization of the three paralogs reveals insight into their organization and into potential gating transitions which, although related to previously described properties of CALHM2, show distinct features with respect to subunit organization, conformational changes and the distribution of lipids residing inside the wide pore of CALHM channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of CALHM channels in the human placenta</title><p>To investigate the role of CALHM channels in the placenta, we have characterized the expression of family members in healthy human placental tissues obtained from term pregnancies. Quantification of transcripts by reverse transcription (RT) PCR revealed high levels of CALHM2, 4, and 6, but comparably low expression of other paralogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We also analyzed the expression patterns of CALHM paralogs in primary trophoblast cells isolated from healthy term placentae and examined changes during the differentiation process of trophoblast precursor cells into mature STB. We found marked upregulation of CALHM2, 4 and 6 during differentiation, which was most pronounced for CALHM4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and which might indicate a differentiation-dependent role of these proteins in the human placenta. In all cases, the concentrations of the respective CALHM mRNAs are high in comparison to other transport proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggesting their involvement in important placenta-related membrane transport processes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression analysis of CALHM genes in the human placenta.</title><p>mRNA abundances of different CALMH paralogs in (<bold>A</bold>), human placental tissues (n = 10) and (<bold>B</bold>), human trophoblasts isolated from healthy term placentae (n = 5) was assessed by quantitative RT PCR and normalized to the reference gene YWHAZ.

Apart from CALHM2, which was described to form ATP-conducting channels in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ma et al., 2018a</xref>), they have so far not been characterized. For a functional comparison of channels composed of the three placental subunits with the well-studied protein CALHM1, we have expressed the homomeric proteins in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes and recorded currents by two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. This method has previously allowed a detailed characterization of CALHM1, which is activated by depolarization and the removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the extracellular side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). To detect proteins in the plasma membrane, we have used a surface-biotinylation approach and found all placental paralogs to be expressed and targeted at high levels to the surface of oocytes at the time of the measurement (<italic>i.e.</italic> 40–60 hr after injection of mRNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Assuming that CALHM proteins form channels of large conductance, we thus can directly compare the average magnitude of recorded currents between populations of oocytes expressing the respective constructs and relate their activation properties in response to voltage change and the depletion of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the well-characterized CALHM1. In our studies, we were able to reproduce the functional hallmarks of CALHM1, which are manifested in the absence of currents at negative voltage and slowly activating currents at positive voltage at millimolar concentrations of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and a strong increase of currents upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal in the entire voltage range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). In contrast to CALHM1, the current response of homomeric CALHM2, 4, and 6 channels was generally small and within the range of endogenous currents of <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes not expressing any of the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-F</xref>). These currents neither showed pronounced voltage-dependence nor were they altered by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-removal in a statistically significant manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). We thus conclude that the CALHM channels expressed in the placenta are not regulated in a similar manner as CALHM1-subunit containing channels and that their activation instead proceeds by distinct, currently unknown mechanisms.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Functional characterization of CALHM channels expressed in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot of proteins located in the plasma membrane of <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes heterologously expressing the indicated CALHM channels.

In contrast to the poor yields obtained for human CALHM1, all three placental paralogs expressed high levels of protein. The elution properties of fusions to green fluorescent protein (GFP) extracted in the detergent glycol-diosgenin (GDN) and analyzed by fluorescent size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kawate and Gouaux, 2006</xref>) indicate assemblies of high molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We next proceeded with a scale-up of homomeric CALHM2, 4 and 6 channels in HEK293 cells and purified each protein in the detergent GDN. Consistent with FSEC studies, all purified constructs eluted as large oligomers during gel-filtration chromatography, although at different volumes. The highest elution volume was observed for CALHM6, a similar but slightly lower volume for CALHM2 and the smallest volume for CALHM4, thus hinting towards distinct oligomeric organizations of the three proteins with CALHM4 forming larger complexes than CALHM6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The peak fractions were concentrated, vitrified on cryo-EM grids and used for data collection by cryo-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref>). As expected from the size-exclusion profiles, all paralogs form large and heterogenic multimeric assemblies containing between 10 and 12 subunits. Whereas in the CALHM6 sample a vast majority of these oligomeric channels do not interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), we have found almost complete dimerization for CALHM4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>) and a significant fraction of particles to dimerize in case of CALHM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Unlike to previous reports of CALHM2 structures, where interactions between channels were mediated by extracellular loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref>), the pairing in the CALHM4 sample proceeds via contacts at the intracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We also observed two distinct protein conformations in our data with CALHM4 and CALHM6 channels forming cylindrical and conical pores, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Although 2D class averages of CALHM2 appear of high quality, 3D classification of this dataset did not yield high-resolution structures. We believe that the strong preferential orientation of CALHM2 particles resulting in a predominance of views along the pore axis combined with sample heterogeneity has limited our data processing workflow to 2D classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). In general, we found an oligomeric distribution of CALHM2 channels that corresponds to previously determined structure with a majority of channels being organized as undecamers and a smaller population showing dodecameric assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>).

In each case, we found a heterogeneous, about equal distribution of particles with two distinct oligomeric states. The smaller particles are composed of decameric and the larger of undecameric assemblies, both of which we refer to as CALHM4 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Due to the slightly higher quality of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free sample, we continued to use this data for our further analysis unless specifically indicated. The cryo-EM density of the decamers extends to a resolution of 4.1 Å and undecamers to 3.7 Å, which in both cases permitted the unambiguous interpretation by an atomic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In each structure, the subunits are arranged around a central axis of symmetry that defines the ion-conduction path. As described before, both assemblies contain pairs of CALHM4 channels of the same size related by two-fold symmetry that interact via their cytoplasmic parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). The CALHM4 channels form approximately 90 Å high cylindrical proteins that span the lipid bilayer with regions at their respective periphery extending into the aqueous environment on either side of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In the plane of the membrane, the dimensions of decameric and undecameric CALHM4 channels amount to 110 Å and 120 Å respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). Irrespective of their distinct oligomerization, the individual subunits in both assemblies show equivalent conformations, which resemble the recently described structures of CALHM1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Demura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref>) and thus define an organization that is likely general for the CALHM family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although the members of this family were predicted to share their architecture with connexins and related innexin and LRRC8 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siebert et al., 2013</xref>), this turns out not to be the case. Whereas subunits in all families contain four transmembrane helices, which run perpendicular to the membrane, the mutual arrangement of these α-helices differs between CALHM channels and their connexin-like counterparts. When viewed from the extracellular side, the transmembrane helices in connexin, innexin and VRAC channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deneka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kasuya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kefauver et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maeda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oshima et al., 2016</xref>) are arranged in a clockwise manner, whereas the arrangement in CALHM channels is anticlockwise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Moreover, in connexins and related channels, the four helices form a tightly interacting left-handed bundle with a common core, resulting in a structure with an oval cross-section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Conversely, the helices of the CALHM subunit are organized as two layers conferring an overall trapezoid cross-section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Finally, whereas connexins and LRRC8 channels form hexamers, and innexins form octamers, an oligomeric arrangement that has also been observed for CALHM1, the larger CALHM4 channels contain either 10 or 11 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). The outer layer of the CALHM subunit is composed of the interacting α-helices TM2-4, which are arranged in one row sharing mutual interactions only with their respective neighbor. The inner layer consists of TM1, which on its entire length exclusively interacts with TM3, the central helix of the outer layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). When assembled into oligomers, the helices of the outer layer form a ring, which defines the boundaries of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In this outer ring, the peripheral helices TM2 and 4 are involved in extended interactions with neighboring subunits resulting in a tightly packed interface. Apart from a small fenestration between TM3 and 4 in the center of each subunit, this structural unit shields the interior of the pore from the surrounding membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In contrast, the respective TM1 helices forming the inner layer are distant from each other and thus not involved in mutual inter-subunit interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). In the region preceding TM1, the residues of the N-terminus form a helix (NH) that is oriented perpendicular to the first transmembrane segment parallel to the plane of the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Among the family members of known structures, the conformations of NH and TM1 are best defined in CALHM4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>), whereas weaker density of these fragments in the equivalent state of CALHM1 and 2 points towards a higher mobility of this region in latter proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref>). On the extracellular side, a short loop bridges α-helices TM1 and 2 and an extended region containing two short α-helices (E1H and E2H), connects TM3 with the long TM4, which extends beyond the membrane plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Both segments of the extracellular domain are stabilized by two conserved disulfide bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). On the intracellular side, TM2 precedes a short helix (CLH) that projects away from the pore axis with TM3 being bent in the same direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Both α-helices are connected by a 12-residue long loop that is probably mobile and thus not defined in the density. Downstream of TM4, we find an extended intracellular region. The first halve of this region consists of a long α-helix (CTH), which is tilted by 70° towards the membrane plane.

This arrangement creates clefts between neighboring helices of the inner ring which are delimited by helices TM2 and 4 at the respective subunit interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,E</xref>). In our sample, this cleft appears to be filled with lipids as indicated by the residual density observed in the cryo-EM maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Due to the prevalence of aliphatic residues lining the pore at the assumed location of the membrane core, the pore is highly hydrophobic, whereas the regions extending into the aqueous environment contain polar and charged residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Similarly, the side of the helical N-terminus, which faces the membrane at its intracellular boundary, is hydrophobic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In light of its large cross-section and high hydrophobicity, it is conceivable that the interior of the pore would accommodate lipids, which potentially could form bilayers that would restrict ion permeation as recently suggested for CALHM2 based on molecular dynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref>). In our data, we find strong evidence for a layered distribution of density inside the pore within the presumed membrane region in non-symmetrized maps and after application of symmetry. This density is observed with similar properties in decameric and undecameric proteins in both datasets of CALHM4 obtained in either absence or presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Its distribution displays features that quantitatively match the corresponding properties of lipid membranes obtained from a comparison to cryo-EM density of liposomes and computer simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>) and could thus either reflect the presence of lipids or detergent molecules arranging in a bilayer-like structure facilitated by the confined pore geometry. We thus analyzed the composition of small molecules that are co-purified with CALHM4 by mass spectrometry and were able to detect phospholipids that are commonly found in the membranes of HEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Collectively, our data are compatible with the presence of a lipid bilayer located within the pore region of CALHM4 channels, which could interfere with the diffusion of charged substances. Thus, despite of its large pore diameter, it is at this point unclear whether the CALHM4 structure defines a conductive conformation of CALHM channel or alternatively a conformation that harbors a membrane-like assembly residing inside the pore that would impede ion conduction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conical pore conformation of the CALHM6 structure</title><p>As in case of CALHM4, data of CALHM6 shows a heterogeneous distribution of decameric and undecameric channels, but in this case with a prevalence of the former amounting to 60% of the classified particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Both assemblies of CALHM6 contain subunits with equivalent conformations, which are better defined in the smaller oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). We have thus chosen the decameric CALHM6 structure for a description of the conical pore of a CALHM channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A–C</xref>). Unlike CALHM4, the lower resolution of the CALHM6 density of 4.4 Å, precludes a detailed interpretation of the structure for all parts of the protein. Still, the high homology between the two paralogs and density attributable to large side chains constrains the placement of helices and conserved loop regions and thus allows the credible analysis of major conformational differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Unlike CALHM4, there is no dimerization of CALHM6 channels and the C-terminal region following the cytoplasmic helix CTH instead appears to engage in intramolecular interactions with the outside of the cytoplasmic rim for most of its length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This observation further supports the notion that the dimerization of CALHM4 might be a consequence of interactions formed between solubilized proteins where the mobile C-terminus could equally well engage in intra- and intermolecular interactions, of which the latter would be multiplied in the highly symmetric arrangement. Although the general organization of the CALHM6 channel closely resembles CALHM4, it shows a distinctly different state of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Upon comparison of decameric channels of both paralogs, in CALHM6 we find a slight expansion of the protein parallel to the membrane and an accompanying moderate contraction in perpendicular direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). In a superposition of the subunits, similar conformations are observed for α-helices TM2 and 4 and the C-terminal helix CTH and larger differences in the interacting helices TM1 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). These differences are most pronounced for TM1, which in CALHM6 has detached from TM3 and moved by 60° towards the pore axis around a hinge located upstream of a conserved phenylalanine at the end of TM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–E</xref>). In both structures, the conformation of the proximal loop connecting TM1 and 2 is stabilized by two conserved cysteines, which are involved in disulfide bridges with the region connecting TM3 and TM4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). As a consequence of the disruption of its interaction with TM1, the intracellular halve of TM3 tilts away from the pore axis by 30° around a pivot located close to a conserved proline residue (P115 in CALHM4), which probably destabilizes the helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B,D</xref>). The transition from a conformation observed in CALHM4 to a conformation defined by CALHM6 is accompanied by the dissociation of interactions between TM1 and 3, which are mediated by conserved residues involving a cluster of hydrophobic interactions at the extracellular side and additional interactions on the entire length of both α-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). The iris-like movement of TM1 in the oligomeric channel in its transition between conformations probably requires concerted rearrangements to avoid steric clashes in the crowded environment of the pore. When viewed from the outside this transition thus resembles the closing of an aperture and it converts a cylindrical pore to a funnel which narrows towards the intracellular side while creating a large cavity between TM1 and TM3 that becomes accessible from the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). In the cryo-EM density, TM1 is less well defined compared to the rest of the protein reflecting its increased flexibility in the observed structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Since the conformation of NH, which has moved towards the pore axis, is not defined in the density, the size of the CALHM6 channel at its constriction remains ambiguous. It could range from an occluded pore if NH helices make contacts in the center of the channel (modeled as clogged conformation) to a pore with similar diameter as found at the CALHM4 constriction. The latter could be obtained in case the mutual relationship between TM1 and NH remains unchanged compared to the CALHM4 structure (defined as kinked conformation) or if NH straightens in continuation of TM1 (in an extended conformation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In any case, the large conformational changes would affect the location of lipids within the pore, which in case of an internal bilayer would have to rearrange in response to the severely altered pore geometry. Such rearrangement is reflected in the changed distribution of the residual electron density inside the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Whereas, compared to CALHM4, we find density at the location of the intracellular layer of lipids and further towards the cytoplasm, part of which might be attributable to the mobile N-terminal α-helix NH, the outer layer of density corresponding to the putative extracellular leaflet of a bilayer has disappeared. A comparable distribution of pore density is found in the structure of CALHM2 in complex with ruthenium red, which resides in a similar conical pore conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, despite the pronounced conformational differences to CALHM4 and the fact that the CALHM6 structure appears to contain features of a closed pore, a definitive functional assignment remains also in this case ambiguous.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>CALHM6 structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon representation of the decameric CALHM6 structure viewed from within the membrane.

Their high expression compared to other membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggests an important functional relevance of these membrane channels in mediating transport processes during the development of the fetus, although their detailed role still awaits to be explored.</p><p>The structural characterization of the three placental paralogs by cryo-electron microscopy has provided insight into fundamental features of the family which largely conform with properties that have recently been described for CALHM1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Demura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref>) but which also show substantial differences. Similar to previous studies, our structures have defined the architecture of the CALHM subunit which, although containing the same number of membrane-spanning helices as VRACs and gap-junctions forming connexins, innexins and pannexins, is distinct from these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). The CALHM subunits thus constitute unique modular building blocks that assemble with different stoichiometries into large membrane channels. In contrast to previously described CALHM structures, where the oligomeric state of individual channels was described as uniform, our data show heterogeneous populations with CALHM4 and CALHM6 assembling as decameric and undecameric channels with similar abundance and CALHM2 as predominantly undecameric proteins with a smaller population of dodecamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref>). The diverse oligomerization of different paralogs is generally consistent with the assemblies observed for the previously described CALHM1 and CALHM2 structures, which were reported to form octamers and undecamers, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Demura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Syrjanen et al., 2020</xref>), and it underlines the ability of CALHM proteins to constitute membrane channels of different sizes. Although the physiological role of these different oligomeric states is currently unclear, the observed heterogeneity might reflect the low energetic penalty for the incorporation of additional subunits into large oligomeric channels of the CALHM family. In this respect, the smaller size of CALHM1 channels could be responsible for its functional properties, which are manifested in electrophysiological recordings. Whereas CALHM1 in our hands showed the previously described functional hallmarks of a channel that is activated by depolarization and removal of extracellular calcium, we have not observed pronounced activity of CALHM2, 4 and 6 under the same conditions, despite their efficient targeting to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The low current response contrasts with the larger oligomeric organization of these proteins, which should lead to channels of even higher conductance than observed for CALHM1, and thus likely reflects their low open probability. Together our findings suggest that CALHM2, 4, and 6 are regulated by distinct, still unknown mechanisms. In that respect it remains puzzling how the large pores observed for the investigated structures (with diameters of CALHM4 decamers exceeding 40 Å within the membrane and 20 Å at the respective constriction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) can be regulated to prevent leakage of substances under resting conditions, which would be deleterious to the cell. Despite the unknown activating stimuli, our study has provided insight into gating transitions of CALHM channels by showing two conformations with either a cylindrical pore of uniform large dimeter within the membrane that is constricted at the intracellular side as in case of CALHM4 and a conical pore that continuously narrows from its extracellular entry towards the cytoplasm as in case of CALHM6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). The main difference in the pore geometry results from a large rearrangement of the pore-lining α-helix TM1 which is accompanied by a smaller change in TM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Whereas in the cylindrical pore conformation of CALHM4, TM1 tightly interacts with TM3, which is a part of a densely packed outer rim of the pore consisting of TM2-4, the helix has dissociated from its interaction site and instead moved towards the symmetry axis to alter the pore geometry in the conical conformation of CALHM6. Similar conformational properties have previously been described for CALHM2 channels, although with a different orientation of TM1 in the conical pore conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). In this previous study, the cylindrical conformation was assigned to an open state and the conical conformation to a closed state of the pore, a proposal that is further supported by a structure of the bound blocker rubidium red which appears to stabilize the conical conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). While, at first glance, the relationship between observed pore conformations and their corresponding functional states appears evident, there are still puzzling questions which prevent a definitive assignment at this stage. For example in light of the large diameter of the CALHM4 pore, the poor conductance properties in functional recordings remain mysterious. In that respect, the presence of lipids within the pore of large CALHM channels is noteworthy as it offers a potential alternative mechanism for regulation. In our structure of CALHM4, we find bound lipids inside the pore to stabilize the gap between non-interacting TM1 helices from different subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Additionally, the bimodal diffuse residual cryo-EM density within the hydrophobic interior of CALHM4, which either originates form detergents or co-purified lipids that assemble as bilayers in the constrained environment of the pore are remarkable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This distribution of density has changed markedly in the conical structure of CALHM6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>) and hints at a potential role of lipids in shaping the activation and permeation properties of large CALHM channels, which is currently still not understood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We thus could envision two alternative scenarios which might underly regulation in large CALHM channels where the gate in the closed state could either be formed by part of the protein or by lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Both models are at this stage hypothetical and it is still unclear how lipids in the pore would rearrange during activation. Another remarkable feature of large CALHM channels concerns their tendency to form pairwise assemblies upon extraction from the membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref>). This property has previously been observed for undecameric CALHM2 channels, which were described to dimerize on the extracellular side thus forming structures that resemble gap-junctions, and in the present study, where dimerization was found to some degree in all samples. In our data, the described behavior is most pronounced in case of CALHM4 where dimerization proceeds on the intracellular side mediated by interactions with the partly mobile C-terminus. Although intriguing, it is currently unclear whether any of the observed pairwise interactions is of relevance in a physiological context.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical gating mechanisms.</title><p>Schematic illustration of hypothetical gating mechanisms of large CALHM channels. Left, ‘protein gate’. The gate impeding ion conduction of large CALHM channels (i.e. CALHM2, 4, 6) in the closed state is formed by the N-terminus of the protein, which closes the pore as observed in the modeled ‘clogged’ conformation of CALHM6 (top). In this case the conical conformation of CALHM6 would display a closed pore and the cylindrical conformation (bottom) an open pore. Right, ‘lipid gate’. The gate impeding ion conduction of large CALHM channels in the closed state is formed by lipids assembling as a bilayer within the protein, which impedes ion conduction. Since bilayer formation is facilitated in the cylindrical conformation of CALHM4, this structure represents a closed pore (top) whereas the structure of the bilayer would be disturbed in the conical conformation of CALHM6 (bottom). Since both the ‘kinked’ and ‘extended’ pore conformations of CALHM6 show a large opening, these conformations could represent open pores.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55853-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig8s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of pore conformations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of the structures of subunits determined in this study to recent structures of CALHM2.

An important area of future investigations relates to the characterization of the localization of CALHM channels in different placental cell types and the identification of their subcellular distribution. Knowledge of their localization would provide a first glimpse into potential roles of these large channels for transport processes in this organ and should provide answers on the potential relevance of intra- and extracellular interactions of channel pairs. Another question concerns the ability of the three paralogs to heteromerize and the potential relevance of such heteromeric channels in a physiological environment. Finally, it will be important to study the activation mechanism of the described channels and whether they are embedded in larger interaction networks, which shape their activation properties. These topics will be addressed in future studies for which our current data provide an important foundation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Placenta collection</title><p>Human placental tissues were collected from the Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lindenhofgruppe Bern, Switzerland, under approval by the ethical commission of the Canton of Bern (approval No. Basec 2016–00250).

Particles of CALHM4 and CALHM6 were initially picked using the Laplacian-of-Gaussian method and subjected to 2D classification. 2D class averages showing protein features were subsequently used as templates for more accurate auto-picking as well as input for generating an initial 3D model. From dataset one, 422,281 particles were extracted with a box size of 234 pixels, down-scaled three times and subjected to 2D classification. Having discarded false positives and particles of poor quality, the dataset was reduced to 201,782 particles. Two rounds of non-symmetrized 3D classification using the 60 Å low-pass filtered initial 3D model as a reference allowed to isolate two populations of homogenous particles representing dihedrally-related decameric and undecameric assemblies. These two subsets were refined separately with either D10 or D11 symmetry imposed followed by unbinning to an original pixel size and iterative rounds of 3D refinement, per-particle CTF correction and Bayesian polishing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zivanov et al., 2019</xref>). Extra 3D classification without angular alignment showed increased flexibility within the dimerization interface of interacting intracellular regions in the decameric assembly while no such flexibility was observed for the undecameric population. In order to improve the resolution of the reconstructions, localized reconstruction was performed. For this purpose, the signal corresponding to the detergent belt and to one dihedrally-related monomer was subtracted from each particle followed by auto-refinement of merged in silico modified particles in the presence of a soft mask around the protein density with either C10 or C11 symmetry imposed. The final map of the decameric and undecameric assembly was improved to 4.07 Å and 3.92 Å, respectively. The maps were sharpened using isotropic b-factors of –200 Å<sup>2</sup> and –177 Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Datasets of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free CALHM4 and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CALHM6 were processed in a similar manner. Briefly, from dataset two, 576,841 particles were extracted and cleaned by 2D classification. The pool, reduced to 97,978 particles, was subjected to non-symmetrized 3D classification that also yielded two populations of dihedrally-related decameric and undecameric assemblies. The final map of the decameric assembly at 4.07 Å and of the undecameric assembly at 3.69 Å was sharpened using isotropic b-factors of –169 Å<sup>2</sup> and –126 Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively. From dataset three, 216,859 particles were extracted with a box size of 200 pixels and reduced to 201,761 particles after 2D classification. Non-symmetrized 3D classification also revealed decameric and undecameric populations, although no dihedrally-symmetrized dimers, as in case of CALHM4 in the presence and absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, were observed. The final auto-refined map of the decameric assembly at 4.39 Å and of the undecameric assembly at 6.23 Å was sharpened using isotropic b-factors of –259 Å<sup>2</sup> and –435 Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively.

In order to recover projections at orientations other than from the extracellular side, representative 2D class averages of CALHM4 and 6 were combined and used as 2D templates for auto-picking. The pool of 417,612 particles was subjected to two rounds of 2D classification, after which the dataset was reduced to 71,555 particles. 2D class averages showed that the majority of the remaining particles comprised a view from the extracellular side with only a small fraction representing other orientations. As a consequence of this preferential orientation, projections from other angles were underpopulated and did not show high-resolution features. In other to separate monomeric and dimeric populations, non-symmetrized 3D classification was performed using low-pass filtered reconstructions of CALHM4 and CALHM6. However, both monomeric and dimeric 3D reconstructions of CALHM2 suffered from missing views and therefore were not able to converge to a reliable model during 3D auto-refinement. Additional 2D classification on particles classified either as CALHM2 monomers or dimers showed significant amount of remaining heterogeneity in form of undecameric and dodecameric assemblies, which together with the preferential orientation impeded obtaining a high-resolution reconstruction from this dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Model building and refinement</title><p>The models of CALHM4 and CALHM6 were built in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>).

Figures and videos containing molecular structures and densities were prepared with DINO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dino3d.org">http://www.dino3d.org</ext-link>), PyMOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">DeLano, 2002</xref>), Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) and ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goddard et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analysis of the density inside the pore</title><p>For analysis of the density inside the pore, non-symmetrized final 3D reconstructions of CALHM4 and CALHM6 were opened as a stack in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>), where the mean density of the area inside the pore was quantified along the slices of each 3D reconstruction. The size of the measured area was chosen based on the 3D mask generated from the atomic models of CALHM4 and 6. In both cases, the area of 6 × 6 pixels centered around the pore axis was located outside the 3D mask ensuring that the procedure did not include density of CALHM4 or 6.</p><p>The ‘experimental’ reference profile was generated based on the electron density map of the MPEG-1 protein bound to a lipidic vesicle (EMD-20622) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pang et al., 2019</xref>). The electron density corresponding to the protein was selected and subtracted in Chimera using the structure of MPEG-1 (PDBID 6U2W). Due to the membrane deformation, the central region of the bilayer was excluded from the measurement. The ‘simulation’ reference profile was generated using the atomistic model of a membrane obtained from the MemProtMD database (PDBID 2N5S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mineev et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Newport et al., 2019</xref>). All atoms corresponding to protein, ions and water molecules were removed from the model and the remaining lipids were used to generate an electron density map with 1.34 Å pixel spacing at 6 Å resolution using Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). Electron density profiles were generated by measuring a mean pixel intensity of selected regions on map slices along the Z- axis using the Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Two-electrode voltage-clamp recording</title><p>For preparation of cRNA coding for CALHM paralogs, <italic>CALHM</italic>-pTLNX DNA constructs were linearized with the FastDigest MluI restriction enzyme (ThermoFisher) purified, transcribed in vitro with the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) and purified with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen).

Oocytes used as negative control (neg.) were injected with 10 ng of Cx38 ASO only. For protein expression, oocytes were kept in ND69 solution (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM Na-pyruvate, 5 mM HEPES and 50 µg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.5) at 16°C. Two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) measurements were performed 48–60 hr after RNA injections at 20°C. TEVC data were recorded on an OC-725B amplifier (Warner Instrument Corp.) Data recorded at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz were and digitized using a Digidata interface board (1322A or 1440A, Axon Instruments) and analyzed with pCLAMP 10.3 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Microelectrodes with a resistance of 1–4 MΩ were filled with 3 M KCl. A VC-8 valve controller (Warner Instruments) was used for perfusion of different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Prior to recording, oocytes were additionally injected with a 50 nl of a mixture containing 20 mM BAPTA and 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution to minimize activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> currents. High Ca<sup>2+</sup> bath solutions contained,100 mM Na<sup>+</sup>, 5.4 mM K<sup>+</sup>, 95 mM Cl<sup>-</sup>, 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2. Divalent cation-free solutions contained 0.5 mM EGTA and 0.5 mM EDTA instead of divalent cations. Intermediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations were prepared from both stocks by mixing solution according to the volume calculated with WEBMAXC calculator.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cell surface biotinylation</title><p>Surface biotinylation of proteins expressed in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes was performed using the Pierce Cell Surface Protein Isolation kit. Oocytes (20-50), injected with <italic>CALHM</italic> cRNAs and incubated for 40–60 hr, were washed three times with ND96 solution, transferred to a white 6-well plate (NUNC) and biotinylated by 30 min incubation in 4 ml ND96 solution supplemented with 0.5 mg ml<sup>–1</sup> EZ-link sulfo-NHS-SS biotin. After incubation, the biotinylation reaction was stopped by addition of quenching solution and oocytes were washed several times with ND96 solution to remove residual reagents. For protein extraction, oocytes were incubated in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% LMNG, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, protease inhibitors, RNase, DNase, pH 7.6) for 1 hr at 4°C and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min. The supernatants were collected and incubated with NeutrAvidin agarose slurry for 1 hr at room temperature under constant mixing. After this step, agarose beads binding the biotinylated proteins were washed with wash solution (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.0058% GDN, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, protease inhibitors, RNase, DNase). Subsequently, the unbound material was discarded and biotinylated proteins were incubated with SDS-Page sample buffer containing 50 mM DTT for 1 hr at RT. Eluted protein fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 2 min at RT. Membrane protein samples were stored at −20°C. For western blot analysis, samples were loaded on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoretic separation, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane by a semi-dry blotting procedure. The membranes were first blocked at room temperature for 2 hr with 5% non-fat milk in TBS-T buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.075% Tween20, pH 7.5) and then incubated with respective anti-CALHM primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. To remove unbound primary antibodies, the membranes were washed with TBS-T buffer and subsequently blotted with goat anti-rabbit-HRP conjugated secondary antibody for 2 hr at 4°C. The membranes were washed again with TBS-T buffer and chemiluminescent signals were developed with the Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection kit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistics and reproducibility</title><p>Paired 2-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test was applied to detect differences in placental mRNA levels of CALHM isoforms between undifferentiated cytotrophoblast and differentiated syncytiotrophoblast cells.

Electrophysiology data were repeated multiple times with different batches of cRNA and <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes with very similar results. Conclusions of experiments were not changed upon inclusion of further data. In all cases, leaky oocytes were discarded. For Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration-response analysis using TEVC methods, statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance and by Student’s t test.

In this manuscript, Katarzyna Drozdzyk, Marta Sawicka and their colleagues identified three subtypes of large-pore calcium homeostasis modulator (CALHM) channels in human placenta based on transcript analysis and solved near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structures of CALHM4 and CALHM6, revealing similar overall architectures, with interesting differences in the TM1 helix that lines the central permeation pathway. In CALHM4, TM1 packs against the rest of the channel, creating a wide, cylindrical pore that remarkably appears to be filled with lipids, which they also measure using mass spectrometry. In CALHM6, the density for TM1 is less well-resolved, but adopts a bent conformation extending towards the central axis of the channel to give the pore a conical shape. The authors also clearly demonstrate that CALHM channels can be assembled from different numbers of subunits, with both CALHM4 and CALHM6 channels showing both decameric and undecameric forms, suggesting that the energy penalty for inserting additional subunits into the oligomeric channel is low. These new structures raise fascinating possibilities for how CALHM channels might open and close to enable transport of substrates and ions, including alternating between conical and cylindrical pores, with lipids filling the pore in the closed state and reorganizing to provide a permeation pathway in the open state. These interesting new results are presented with clarity, making provocative and important contributions to our understanding of this intriguing family of large-pore CALHM channels.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cryo-EM structures and functional properties of CALHM channels of the human placenta&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Wei Lü (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this report by Drozdzyk and colleagues, three members of the CALHM family (CALHM2, CALHM4 and CALHM6) are identified as being highly abundant in human placenta tissue based on transcript analysis. However, no currents could be detected from these three paralogs by two-electrode voltage clamp in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, while cells expressing CALHM1 displayed Ca<sup>2+</sup> and voltage-dependent currents. FSEC analysis of transiently expressed CALHM2, CALHM4 and CALHM6 revealed the presence of large oligomeric assemblies of varying size, which was supported by single-particle cryo-EM analysis of purified proteins. Single-particle cryo-EM density maps of CALHM4 and CALHM6 at 3.9 Å and 4.5 Å, respectively, revealed similar overall architectures with the exception of TM1. In CALHM4, TM1 packs against the rest of the channel, creating a wide, cylindrical pore that appears to be filled with lipids. In CALHM6, the density TM1 is poorly resolved, but in lower resolution map can be seen adopting a bent conformation extending towards the central axis of the channel. The lower resolution precludes assessment of the functional state of CALHM6, but the presence of a continuous bilayer-like structure in CALHM4 suggests that it is represents a non-conductive state. Based on these two structures, the authors propose a model whereby exchanging between the two states may be associated with channel gating due to the displacement of the lipid bilayer. The data are nicely presented and contribute to the growing understanding of this family of six putative ion channels. Many questions remain, but the availability of these structures will now enable testing of specific hypotheses, most notably whether these so-called &quot;large&quot; CALHM proteins are actually ion channels.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors observed unresolved densities within the cylindrical pore of CALHM4, and found the distribution of these densities approximately matches the one of lipid bilayer density derived from MD simulation. Therefore, they believe these densities represent lipid/detergent molecules. While the authors could be right that these densities are indeed from lipid/detergent molecules, they might want to turn down this conclusion as the evidence in the present manuscript not conclusive. Moreover, such a distribution of unresolved densities is not present in the CALHM6 (this study) and CALHM2 structures (Choi et al., 2019), both have a conical pore; while the former has been discussed in the manuscript, the latter should also be clearly mentioned. If the authors want to present the idea of lipids filling the pore, we would highly recommend doing mass spectroscopic analysis of CALHM4 and CALHM6 to identify these densities and their abundance to better understand the differences between CALHM4 and CALHM6.</p><p>2) The authors proposed the lipid-gated mechanism based on their observation of unresolved densities within the pore of CALHM4 that may represent lipid or detergent molecules. We have several concerns regarding this mechanism for the following reasons (Figure 8, right panels).</p><p>– The S1 helix tightly interacts with S3 in the resting closed state in which the cylindrical-shaped pore is filled by lipid molecules (Discussion, second paragraph). Where does the energy come from to break such tight interactions, and to push out the lipid molecules to open the pore?</p><p>– After the lipids are pushed out by the S1 helix, how do they leave the pore and where do they go?</p><p>– When the channel transits from open to closed state, how the lipids are recruited to fill the pore? What are the possible mechanism and pathways for the lipid molecules to re-enter the pore?</p><p>– The authors hypothesized the unresolved densities within the pore are lipids with one of the reasons being that the S1 helix contains mostly aliphatic residues, which makes the pore highly hydrophobic. If this is the case, the conformation of the S1 helix in the open state (Figure 8 lower right) seems energetically very unfavorable because the majority of the S1 helix becomes solvent exposed.</p><p>– If the authors believe the space between the S1 and S3 helices are filled by lipid molecules in the conical pore of the open state (Figure 8 lower right), why should and could the lipid molecules be removed from other places of the pore, particularly in the extracellular half of the pore?</p><p>3) TM1 of CALHM6 is poorly ordered in the structure and resolvable only in a map low-pass filtered at 6 Å. To model TM, the authors relied on the close homology with CALHM4. Because the gating mechanism proposed by the authors relies on differences between the conformations of TM1 between CALHM4 and CALHM6, focused refinements of individual and several adjacent subunits, both with or without signal subtraction should be employed to better understand the conformational diversity of TM1 and its effects on the pore.

Therefore, they believe these densities represent lipid/detergent molecules. While the authors could be right that these densities are indeed from lipid/detergent molecules, they might want to turn down this conclusion as the evidence in the present manuscript not conclusive. Moreover, such a distribution of unresolved densities is not present in the CALHM6 (this study) and CALHM2 structures (Choi et al., 2019), both have a conical pore; while the former has been discussed in the manuscript, the latter should also be clearly mentioned. If the authors want to present the idea of lipids filling the pore, we would highly recommend doing mass spectroscopic analysis of CALHM4 and CALHM6 to identify these densities and their abundance to better understand the differences between CALHM4 and CALHM6.</p></disp-quote><p>In our revised manuscript, we have provided a lipid analysis by mass spectrometry, which demonstrates the presence of membrane lipids in our CALHM4 samples. For this experiment, we have purified CALHM4 in the same way as for cryo-EM studies, extracted co-purified lipids in chloroform and analyzed them by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. In these samples, we were able to detect several compounds that are not present in the equivalent extraction of the buffer and that can be assigned with confidence to phospholipids and their fragments that are constituents of the HEK cell membranes. The data is presented as Figure 6—figure supplement 2. The chemical detection of lipids further strengthens the possibility that the observed bilayer-like densities in the CALHM4 structure might indeed originate from lipids. After careful analysis, we also find very similar density in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free data of CALHM4, which was collected from an independent protein preparation (and which is now described in additional panels of Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Remarkably, a very similar density distribution is also found in 2D projections of dimers of CALHM2 channels shown in Figure 3C (top), which we think also resides in the same cylindrical pore conformation. We also want to emphasize that we do not claim that no lipids would be associated with the conical pore conformation in CALHM6, although we find a clear different distribution of residual density in this channel conformation. In the CALHM6 data, the density assigned to the potential outer leaflet of the membrane is absent, whereas there is density at the position of the inner leaflet. Lipids in this part might thus be less well ordered but they still could be present. We thus refrained from the equivalent analysis of lipids in CALHM6. We also would like to emphasize that the lipid analysis is demanding and has required as much protein as used for structure determination and that we can at the moment not provide additional data in light of the shutdown of research facilities at UZH related to the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>The observation of extra density present inside the pore of CALHM4 is in general agreement with equivalent density observed inside the pore of human CALHM2 (Syrjanen et al., 2020), which also displays a cylindrical pore conformation (although in the displayed map this density is fragmented as a consequence of map sharpening). In their publication, these observations were further supported by molecular dynamics simulations that showed that the CALHM2 undecamer but not the CALHM1 octamer would be able to accommodate lipids in a bilayer-like state. In agreement with our CALHM6 data, no such density is found in the conical conformation of CALHM2 (Choi et al., 2019) which we now also mention in the manuscript.</p><p>Changes in the manuscript:</p><p>“We thus analyzed the composition of small molecules that are co-purified with CALHM4 by mass spectrometry and were able to detect phospholipids that are commonly found in the membranes of HEK cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 2).”</p><p>Addition of Figure 6—figure supplement 2.</p><p>Addition of lipid analysis in the Materials and methods.</p><p>“A comparable distribution of pore density is found in the structure of CALHM2 in complex with ruthenium red, which resides in a similar conical pore conformation (Choi et al., 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors proposed the lipid-gated mechanism based on their observation of unresolved densities within the pore of CALHM4 that may represent lipid or detergent molecules. We have several concerns regarding this mechanism for the following reasons (Figure 8, right panels).</p><p>– The S1 helix tightly interacts with S3 in the resting closed state in which the cylindrical-shaped pore is filled by lipid molecules (Discussion, second paragraph). Where does the energy come from to break such tight interactions, and to push out the lipid molecules to open the pore?</p></disp-quote><p>The open-probability of a channel depends on the energy differences between open and closed conformations, which are populated according to a Boltzmann distribution. During gating, the energy difference between states alters. Depending on the class of channels, opening can be triggered in response to changes in the transmembrane voltage, the binding of agonists or dissociation of antagonists. Although both voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal influence the open probability of CALHM1, the activating stimulus of CALHM2, 4 and 6 is at this stage unknown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– After the lipids are pushed out by the S1 helix, how do they leave the pore and where do they go?</p><p>– When the channel transits from open to closed state, how the lipids are recruited to fill the pore? What are the possible mechanism and pathways for the lipid molecules to re-enter the pore?</p></disp-quote><p>The exact trajectory of lipids during structural changes is still unclear, particularly since, due to the tight interactions between subunits, it is not obvious how lipids might diffuse into and out of the pore region. Currently, we cannot exclude that this might be facilitated by a transient lateral opening of the channel. Alternatively, it is possible that the conformational rearrangement from a cylindrical to a conical conformation would not displace lipids but instead cause their redistribution, which would affect the bilayer-like structure and its barrier function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors hypothesized the unresolved densities within the pore are lipids with one of the reasons being that the S1 helix contains mostly aliphatic residues, which makes the pore highly hydrophobic. If this is the case, the conformation of the S1 helix in the open state (Figure 8 lower right) seems energetically very unfavorable because the majority of the S1 helix becomes solvent exposed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is not necessarily the case, since TM1 rotates during the rearrangement thereby exposing some hydrophilic residues to the lining of the cylindrical pore (see Figure 7F, G, Video 4). It should also be emphasized that parts of the pore lining at the wide entrance of different ion channels can be hydrophobic (as observed in K-channels, pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, bestrophins and volume-regulated chloride channels to name few of them).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– If the authors believe the space between the S1 and S3 helices are filled by lipid molecules in the conical pore of the open state (Figure 8 lower right), why should and could the lipid molecules be removed from other places of the pore, particularly in the extracellular half of the pore?</p></disp-quote><p>We could envision a redistribution of lipids upon conformational changes. Although the presence of a lipid bilayer inside the pore of a large channel is an intriguing possibility, it is not clear whether it would have the same energetic properties in such confined environment as in the bulk of the membrane. The energetics for redistribution could thus be smaller than in a larger membrane.</p><p>Altogether, the reviewer has raised valid questions, which we can at this stage not fully explain. We want to emphasize that the potential regulation of the pore by lipids is at this stage speculative and it is put forward as one of two alternative mechanisms how conduction in a large channel could be regulated. Whereas the presence of lipids inside the pore could explain why we did not observe conduction in placental CALHM channels, despite their apparent large pore diameter, it is at this stage not clear whether such regulation might at all be of physiological relevance. Potentially, the bilayers inside the pore could be an artefact of overexpression and they might form in the absence of a regulatory protein, which would be present in a physiological context. It should also be mentioned that the presence of lipids inside the pore of large channels is a novel but recurrent theme which has also been proposed for connexins and VRAC channels.</p><p>Changes in the manuscript:</p><p>“Both models are at this stage hypothetical and it is still unclear how lipids in the pore would rearrange during activation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) TM1 of CALHM6 is poorly ordered in the structure and resolvable only in a map low-pass filtered at 6 Å. To model TM, the authors relied on the close homology with CALHM4. Because the gating mechanism proposed by the authors relies on differences between the conformations of TM1 between CALHM4 and CALHM6, focused refinements of individual and several adjacent subunits, both with or without signal subtraction should be employed to better understand the conformational diversity of TM1 and its effects on the pore. If focused refinements do not help resolve the density, it would be better if the side chains are excluded from the model.</p></disp-quote><p>By careful reprocessing of the data, we were able to substantially improve the quality of the CALHM6 structure. Although the nominal resolution only improved from 4.5 to 4.4 Å, many features of the map including the region connecting TM1 with TM2 are well-defined and allow an unambiguous interpretation by an atomic model. Due to the high sequence conservation in this region, conformational differences can be described with confidence.</p><p>Despite the application of different approaches to improve the resolution of TM1 (summarized below), none of them has led to a better definition of this part of the protein. Our model thus starts with residue 20. The poor definition of TM1 underlines the intrinsic flexibility of the region in the observed conformation, which is expected in the absence of strong interactions with other parts of the structure. However, since the end of TM1 is well-defined, we are confident about the register of residues along the α-helix. The detailed sidechain conformation is in several cases of course arbitrary.</p><p>Attempts to improve the density of TM1 included:</p><p>– 3D refinement with the symmetry relaxed to either C5, C2 or C1 to detect any asymmetry of the TM1 and NTH between individual protomers. In all cases, TM1 was resolved to the same extend as in C10 map – the resolution estimates were 4.7 Å, 5.15 Å and 6.1 Å, respectively.</p><p>– Focused 3D classification with no symmetry imposed on C10-symmetry expanded particles. In order to increase the sensitivity of the alignment, the regularization parameter T was increased to 40. Out of 10 classes, only one including 50% of particles was further refined to 4.6 Å. No improvement in TM1 density was observed.</p><p>– Focused 3D classification with no symmetry imposed on particles where the density of other nine protomers was subtracted. In order to increase the sensitivity of the alignment, the regularization parameter T was increased to 40. Particles (83%) belonging to a selected class were reverted to original particles and subjected to 3D refinement. The class was resolved to 4.6 Å and no improvement in TM1 density was observed.</p><p>– Extensive 3D classification with either C1 or C10 symmetry applied. In order to determine any possible conformational heterogeneity independent classifications were done with and without particle alignment. In all cases, TM1 was found in the same conformation although the best achieved resolution was 4.6 Å and the reconstruction did not show better resolved features.</p><p>– Focused 3D refinement on C10 symmetry expanded particles with and without signal subtraction did not improve the density of TM1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors suggested that, based on 2D class averages in top/down views, human CALHM2 assembles as both 11-mer and 12-mer. This is different from recent two published reports that human CALHM2 is a 11-mer. They should discuss potential reasons that may cause such a difference.</p></disp-quote><p>We have obtained populations with different oligomeric states in all of our samples including CALHM2. This feature appears to be more pronounced in our study compared to others and it could potentially be a consequence of the different expression host and mode of transfection (i.e. transient transfection in HEK293 cells in our study vs. virus-based transfection in insect cells in other studies). Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that different oligomers for CALHM2 were also observed by other groups. E.g., in the study by Choi et. al, one of the 3D classes of CALHM2 in the presence of RuR shows a dodecameric assembly accounting for 14.2% of the particles (see Choi at al., 2019, Extended Data Figure 4) although this class has not been processed further. The observed heterogeneity probably reflects the low energetic penalty for the incorporation of an additional subunit to channels of large oligomeric state as found in case of CALHM2, 4 and 6. At this stage we do not know whether this is a consequence of heterologous overexpression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The CALHM4 assembles as both 10-mer and 11-mer, which is a very interesting observation. But why do two different stoichiometries co-exist for the same protein? Are both stoichiometries physiologically relevant?</p></disp-quote><p>We observed 10-mer and 11-mer assemblies for CALHM4 and CALHM6. In both cases, the two populations are present at ratios of 40% to 60%. Whereas in case of CALHM4, the predominant assembly is the 11-mer, for CALHM6 it is a 10-mer. Currently we do not know whether both assemblies are physiologically relevant, as different oligomerization states might result from overexpression of the proteins, which is controlled by a strong viral promotor. In any case, we conclude that the energy penalty for the incorporation of an additional subunit to a large CALHM channel is low, which is reflected in the similar abundance of both populations. It should be emphasized that we currently understand very little about the physiological role of the three paralogs investigated in this study as it is still unknown whether the proteins form heteromers, are part of a larger complex or whether there are endogenous factors that control the assembly in a native environment. The ultimate resolution of this question will require purification of the respective proteins from native sources.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) CALHM4 assembles as 10-mer and 11-mer, yet with the same CTH helix in both structures. This observation is somewhat different from the hypothesis by Syrjanen et al., 2020 that CTH determines the oligomeric state of CALHMs, and should be discussed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The proposal by Syrjanen et al. is interesting in light of experiments provided in their manuscript. In their study, the claim that the oligomerization of CALHM channels would be determined by the cytoplasmic CTH regions and the linker connecting TM4 and CTH is supported by chimeric proteins, where the transfer of the linker and CTH of CALHM2 to CALHM1 changes the oligomerization of the chimeric protein from octamers to undecamers. This observation supports the notion that the C-terminus plays a role in oligomerization and that it contributes to the stability of the octameric assembly found for CALHM1. Different results were obtained from similar CALHM1-CALHM2 chimeras investigated by Demura et al., 2020. In contrast to the study by Syrjanen, their chimera form octa- and nonamers leading to the conclusion that oligomerization would be predominantly driven by inter-subunit interactions in the transmembrane region. Thus, whereas it is likely that the C-terminus would be important for the oligomeric organization of CALHM channels, its contribution might not be as dominant as initially suggested. Particularly, it is unlikely that it would discriminate between the formation of 10- and 11-mers in CALHM4 and 6. Since the CALHM1 structure is not a subject in this study, we prefer not to engage in an extended discussion on the role of the C-terminus on oligomerization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other suggestions:</p><p>1) If the authors have access to tissue sections, it would be helpful to employ immunohistochemistry using the antibodies from Figure 2 to characterize the localization of the various CALHM proteins in the placenta, especially as their molecular function is poorly understood.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the subcellular localization of the different CALHM paralogs in placental tissue, is one of the critical next steps that will have to be performed to provide insight into the potential role of CALHM channels in the placenta. However, this work relies on highly specific antibodies to be able to come up with meaningful conclusions. We have already started some experiments in this direction, but at the moment found only the CALHM2 antibody to be suitable for such studies. Whereas all three antibodies used in this study are subunit-specific, as judged from Western blots of purified CALHM2, CALHM4 and CALHM6 proteins, the CALHM4 and CALHM6 antibodies also recognize other proteins in tissue lysates as well as isolated placental membrane fractions, which are probably not related to CALHM channels. This is presumably due to the fact that the all antibodies are polyclonal. Evidence for this behavior is found in Figure 2A where the diffuse band between 37 and 50 kDa probably originates from proteins other than CALHM4. We are currently putting large efforts in obtaining better antibodies to clarify the question of tissue localization in a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A comparison between the structures of the non-conducting CALHM4 and CALHM6 and the conducting CALHM1 pores in terms of size and hydrophobicity would be helpful in understanding the origin of the proposed lipid bilayers in CALHM4 and CALHM6 and their potential role in gating, as is proposed in Figure 8.</p></disp-quote><p>Whereas the sequence alignment of TM1 helices of CALHM1 and CALHM4 pores does not show a strong difference in hydrophobicity of presumable pore-lining residues, detailed differences of the pore region of both proteins cannot be determined based on currently available structures, since TM1 of CALHM1 is not well-resolved in the structure determined by Syrjanen et al., (which is the only CALHM1 structure that is currently available in the PDB). This is different in the equivalent CALHM1 structure described by Demura et al. (although maps and models are in this case not yet available). In latter structure, TM1 is resolved and the N-terminal helix NTH appears to fold back towards TM1, which would further constrict the CALHM1 pore and change its polar character. The position of NTH is different in our structure of CALHM4, where NTH is located horizontal to the membrane. Thus both, the strongly reduced pore diameter due to the lower oligomeric state of CALHM1 and the presence of NTH in the pore lining strongly influences the size and the polar character of the CALHM1 pore, which might prevent the formation of a stable lipid bilayer as suggested by Syrjanen et al. based on molecular dynamics simulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the subsection “Biochemical characterization and structure determination of CALHM2, 4, and 6”, the authors claim that CALHM2 forms both cylindrical pore seen in CALHM4 structure and the canonical pore seen in the CALHM6 structure? While both paired and unpaired structures can be readily distinguished from the averages shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 6B, it is unclear how the conformation of the pore is identified from inspection of the 2D averages. It would be helpful in Figure 3—figure supplement 6B to identify 2D class averages that display 11 subunits and those that display 12. It is difficult from the images shown to distinguish the class averages.</p></disp-quote><p>Indications for a difference in the pore conformation in distinct populations of CALHM2 channels are found in the 2D classes shown in Figure 3C. The bilayer-like pore density in the paired channel shown on top indicates a cylindrical conformation of the protein, whereas the altered density in the unpaired channel below might correspond to a conical conformation. However, since the evidence is weak compared to the data presented for CALHM4 and CALHM6, we removed the claim that we find both conformations in the data of CALHM2 in the revised manuscript. We also labeled 2D classes of top views showing either 11- or 12-mers in Figure 3—figure supplement 6B.</p><p>Changes in the manuscript:</p><p>“Although 2D class averages of CALHM2 appear of high quality, 3D classification of this dataset did not yield high-resolution structures. We believe that the strong preferential orientation of CALHM2 particles resulting in a predominance of views along the pore axis combined with sample heterogeneity has limited our data processing workflow to 2D classification”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors have included an ATP molecule in the center of the pore in Figures 4 and 5) This may be confusing to readers as no ATP molecules were resolved in the cryo-EM density map and ATP conductance has not been demonstrated for CALHM4.
