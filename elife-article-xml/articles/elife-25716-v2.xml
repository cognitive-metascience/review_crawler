Here we co-expressed different types of signalling-incompetent DDR1 mutants (‘receiver’) with functional DDR1 (‘donor’) and demonstrate phosphorylation of receiver DDR1 by donor DDR1 in response to collagen. Making use of enforced covalent DDR1 dimerisation, which does not affect receptor function, we show that receiver dimers are phosphorylated in trans by the donor; this process requires the kinase activity of the donor but not that of the receiver. The receiver ectodomain is not required, but phosphorylation in trans is abolished by mutation of the transmembrane domain. Finally, we show that mutant DDR1 that cannot bind collagen is recruited into DDR1 signalling clusters. Our results support an activation mechanism whereby collagen induces lateral association of DDR1 dimers and phosphorylation between dimers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25716.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25716.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25716.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The membrane surrounding each living cell contains a variety of proteins that carry out different roles. For example, proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases help a cell to receive signals from its external environment. Receptor tyrosine kinases span the membrane so that one part of the protein known as the ectodomain sticks out from the surface of the cell, while another part (called the kinase domain) sits inside the cell.</p><p>When a signalling molecule binds to the ectodomain, the kinase domain becomes active and starts to add chemical groups called phosphates to other proteins. This process, known as phosphorylation, changes the protein’s activity, which in turn influences the cell’s behaviour. In most cases, the signalling molecule causes two receptor tyrosine kinase proteins to bind to each other and form a “dimer” in which the kinase domains are able to phosphorylate, and thus activate, each other.</p><p>Female mammals need a receptor tyrosine kinase called DDR1 to develop mammary glands (the glands that produce milk). DDR1 is activated when a signalling molecule called collagen binds to its ectodomain. Unlike many other receptor tyrosine kinases, DDR1 exists as a dimer even before it binds to collagen, so it is not clear how collagen activates DDR1. One possibility is that collagen causes several DDR1 dimers to form clusters on the membrane so that kinases on neighbouring dimers can phosphorylate each other. Juskaite et al. explored this idea by pairing up normal DDR1 proteins with mutant versions that are unable to bind to collagen.</p><p>The experiments show that when collagen binds to the normal DDR1 molecules, DDR1 dimers do indeed form clusters. This enables the normal protein molecules in neighbouring dimers to phosphorylate each other as well as the mutant proteins. In this way, the clustered DDR1 dimers can become active even if the clusters contain one or more mutant versions that are unable to detect collagen. Further experiments show that specific contacts need to form between neighbouring dimers for this phosphorylation to occur.</p><p>Abnormal DDR1 activity is associated with several diseases including cancer, inflammation and fibrosis. The findings of Juskaite et al. suggest that developing new drugs that can prevent DDR1 from forming clusters may help to treat people with these conditions. Further work is also needed to analyse the size and structure of DDR1 clusters and investigate if other proteins also associate with the clusters.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25716.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25716.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>receptor tyrosine kinase</kwd><kwd>mechanism of receptor activation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRC Doctoral Training Partnership PhD Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Juskaite</surname><given-names>Victoria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000850</institution-id><institution>National Heart and Lung Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NHLI Foundation studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corcoran</surname><given-names>David S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ligand binding induces DDR1 kinase activity through recruitment of DDR1 receptors into signalling clusters in which phosphorylation occurs across different dimers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The discoidin domain receptor (DDR) subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) comprises two members, DDR1 and DDR2. The DDRs regulate cell adhesion, cell migration and differentiation in a number of mammalian tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leitinger, 2014</xref>). Both DDRs play key roles in embryo development: DDR1, for instance, is essential for mammary gland development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vogel et al., 2001</xref>), while DDR2 mediates bone growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bargal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Labrador et al., 2001</xref>). The DDRs also play key roles in disease progression in a wide range of disorders including organ fibrosis, inflammation, osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis and many different types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borza and Pozzi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leitinger, 2014</xref>). Both DDRs are well-recognised drug targets but how ligand binding translates to DDR kinase activation has been poorly defined.</p><p>Uniquely among RTKs, the DDRs bind to key structural proteins found in all types of extracellular matrices, namely different types of collagen. Fibrillar collagens are ligands for both DDR1 and DDR2, while non-fibrillar collagens have different DDR preferences, with collagen IV exclusively binding to DDR1 and collagen X preferring DDR2 over DDR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leitinger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leitinger and Kwan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shrivastava et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vogel et al., 1997</xref>). The interactions of the DDRs with fibrillar collagens are well understood: receptor binding sites have been mapped to specific amino acid motifs with the use of collagen-mimetic triple-helical peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Konitsiotis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2011</xref>), and structural studies have revealed the details of the interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carafoli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ichikawa et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, the nature of DDR binding sites on non-fibrillar collagens is currently not known.</p><p>Like all RTKs, the DDRs are composed of a ligand-binding extracellular region, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic region that contains the catalytic kinase domain. DDR1 and DDR2 share a high degree of homology, in particular in their globular domains. The extracellular DDR region contains two globular domains: an N-terminal, ligand-binding discoidin domain that is tightly linked to a discoidin-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leitinger, 2014</xref>). These globular domains are followed by a highly flexible extracellular juxtamembrane region rich in glycine and proline residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). The intracellular DDR regions contain unusually large juxtamembrane regions (up to 171 amino acids in DDR1, depending on the isoform, and 142 amino acids in DDR2) that are followed by a catalytic kinase domain lacking a C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leitinger, 2014</xref>). The collagen-binding site of DDRs is entirely contained in the discoidin domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ichikawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leitinger, 2003</xref>), which forms an 8-stranded β-barrel structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carafoli et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ichikawa et al., 2007</xref>). A conserved trench at the top of the discoidin domain accommodates the collagen triple helix. The structures of the collagen-bound DDR2 discoidin domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carafoli et al., 2009</xref>) and that of the DDR1 discoidin domain in the absence of ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carafoli et al., 2012</xref>) are very similar and do not provide any information on how ligand binding results in intracellular kinase activation. This is in sharp contrast to the situation of collagen-binding integrins where large conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain are transmitted to the rest of the receptor to drive transmembrane signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>A crystal structure of the inactive DDR1 kinase revealed a typical bilobal architecture, with kinase autoinhibition through interactions of the activation loop with the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canning et al., 2014</xref>). The DDR cytoplasmic regions contain several sites of potential tyrosine phosphorylation, both in the juxtamembrane regions and in the kinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leitinger, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lemeer et al., 2012</xref>). While ligand-induced activation loop phosphorylation of the kinase domain has been demonstrated experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Iwai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lemeer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), only a few juxtamembrane tyrosines have been shown to be phosphorylated in response to collagen binding to cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Iwai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lemeer et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, little is known about signalling pathways that are initiated by the phosphorylation of particular DDR tyrosine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leitinger, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The DDRs differ from typical RTKs by several unusual features, the mechanistic bases of which are poorly understood. One of their puzzling characteristics is the slow kinetics of collagen-induced autophosphorylation, which in some cell types can take hours to reach a maximum and then remains detectable for more than a day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shrivastava et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vogel et al., 1997</xref>). Another distinguishing feature is that the DDRs form stable, non-covalent dimers in the absence of ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mihai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Noordeen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). A key dimerisation interface is located in the DDR transmembrane domain via a leucine-based sequence motif; however, multiple receptor-receptor contacts in the extracellular and cytosolic regions also seem to contribute to DDR dimerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Noordeen et al., 2006</xref>). The isolated DDR1 and DDR2 transmembrane helices interact very strongly, as detected in a bacterial TOXCAT reporter assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Noordeen et al., 2006</xref>). In fact, a systematic study that compared the self-interaction potential of all RTK transmembrane domains found that the DDR1 and DDR2 transmembrane domains gave the strongest signal of all RTKs in this assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Finger et al., 2009</xref>). In previous work, we performed cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the 10 extracellular juxtamembrane residues closest to the DDR1 transmembrane domain and found that most of the mutant constructs were crosslinked with nearly 100% efficiency, which led us to conclude that DDR1 dimerisation is constitutive, rather than in a dynamic equilibrium with monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). We further concluded that dimerisation occurs during biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Noordeen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). While ligand-independent non-covalent dimerisation has been observed for other RTKs, including the EGF receptor family, these RTKs exist in a dynamic equilibrium between monomers and inactive dimers (discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maruyama, 2014</xref>]).</p><p>Because the DDRs are constitutively dimerised in the absence of ligand, the paradigm of ligand-induced RTK dimerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>) cannot apply to them. The insulin receptor is a covalently-linked dimer that is activated by ligand-induced conformational changes within the dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kavran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ward et al., 2013</xref>). However, structural studies found no evidence for ligand-induced conformational changes in the DDR ectodomains (see above; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carafoli et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ichikawa et al., 2007</xref>]), and biochemical experiments led to the conclusion that transmembrane signalling of DDR1 occurs without coupling through the flexible juxtamembrane region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Together, these studies ruled out a mechanism of signalling within DDR1 dimers and led to the hypothesis that DDR1 activation may be associated with ligand-induced clustering (lateral association) of receptors in the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here we show evidence for a mechanism that is compatible with ligand-induced clustering of DDR1 dimers. Co-expression studies using a range of signalling-incompetent DDR1 mutants with different forms of signalling-competent DDR1 and DDR2 showed that collagen-induced DDR1 activation involves phosphorylation in trans between neighbouring DDR1 dimers. Phosphorylation between DDR1 dimers occurs both on the juxtamembrane region and the kinase activation loop and can be elicited by different types of ligand. Moreover, phosphorylation in trans requires specific contacts between the transmembrane domains, but not between the ectodomains. These findings define a unique mechanism of transmembrane signalling by DDR1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental approach</title><p>In this study we explored the mechanism of ligand-induced phosphorylation of DDR1 by co-expression of signalling-defective DDR1 mutants with signalling-competent DDR1. Receptor phosphorylation was visualised by Western blotting with a phospho-specific antibody (Ab) against a key tyrosine phosphorylation site in the intracellular juxtamembrane region, tyrosine-513 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). DDR1 has two main isoforms, DDR1a and DDR1b, with DDR1b containing an additional 37 amino acids in its cytosolic juxtamembrane region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leitinger, 2014</xref>). Tyrosine-513 within this alternatively spliced insert is one of the few experimentally verified ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the juxtamembrane region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lemeer et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The signalling-defective DDR1 mutants had mutations in the ectodomains but intact cytosolic juxtamembrane regions and kinase domains. As detailed below, co-expression with signalling-competent DDR1 resulted in ligand-induced phosphorylation of the signalling-defective mutants, which on their own could not be phosphorylated in response to collagen. Hence, in our co-expression experiments, we use the terms ‘donor kinase’ for the signalling-competent DDR1 and ‘receiver kinase’ for the signalling-defective mutants, respectively. In order to distinguish the cytoplasmic domains of receiver and donor DDR1 we replaced tyrosine-513 in the donor receptor with a phenylalanine, thereby creating DDR1b-Y513F, which cannot be phosphorylated at this residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This allowed us to monitor exclusively the phosphorylation of receiver DDR1 by Western blotting with the Ab against phosphorylated tyrosine-513.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25716.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Co-expression of DDR1 donor kinase with signalling-incompetent receiver DDR1 mutants leads to collagen-induced phosphorylation of receiver DDR1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagrams of wild-type and mutant DDR1b.

Collagen binding induces phosphorylation of DDR1b on cytoplasmic tyrosine residues; Y513 in the JM region and the three activation loop tyrosines are shown in phosphorylated form for WT DDR1b as yellow circles. DDR1b-Y513F is phosphorylated on the activation loop but cannot be phosphorylated on Y513.

Collagen-induced autophosphorylation of the activation loop (anti-pY792) was detected at similar levels as in wild-type DDR1b, whereas, as expected, no signal was detectable for DDR1b-Y513F with the Ab against phosphorylated tyrosine-513 (anti-pY513; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mutation of a key ligand-binding residue in DDR2, tryptophan-52 (conserved in DDR1 where it corresponds to tryptophan-53), severely reduces collagen binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carafoli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ichikawa et al., 2007</xref>) and renders the full-length receptor unable to become activated by collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carafoli et al., 2009</xref>). We created DDR1b-W53A as a ligand binding-defective DDR1 construct, which, on its own, does not respond to collagen with increased autophosphorylation. Co-expression with DDR1b-Y513F, however, led to collagen I-induced phosphorylation of tyrosine-513 in DDR1-W53A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Rescue of DDR1b-W53A phosphorylation through co-expression with DDR1b-Y513F was not restricted to activation by fibrillar collagen I, but could also be induced by binding to the network-forming collagen IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Phosphorylation of signalling-defective receiver DDR1 mutants in the co-expression system could arise through transphosphorylation within heterodimers of receiver and donor receptors and/or phosphorylation between dimers in trans. To investigate whether the receiver mutants were phosphorylated as a dimer, we created covalently-linked homodimers of the DDR1 receiver mutants. Cysteine replacement of threonine-416, a residue in the extracellular DDR1 juxtamembrane region close to the transmembrane domain, results in covalently cross-linked DDR1 dimers via a disulphide bond at residue 416, without affecting collagen-induced receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2014</xref>).

A potential concern is that over-expression may lead to artificial DDR1 aggregates, which are responsible for phosphorylation between dimers. Flow cytometry of DDR1 showed that under standard transfection conditions used for co-expression experiments, mean DDR1 fluorescence levels were similar to those on the breast cancer cell line T47D but approximately three times higher than those on primary keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; HEK 5 μg DNA vs T47D). To exclude that phosphorylation between dimers is dependent on high DDR1 expression levels, we performed co-expression experiments with lower DDR1 expression levels and used the most sensitive chemiluminescence substrate for detection of tyrosine-513 phosphorylation. Ligand-induced dimer phosphorylation was detected for both DDR1-R32-Cys and DDR1-ΔECD-Cys at a range of expression levels including those that would lead to surface levels comparable to those on keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In a previous study we identified a leucine-based sequence motif in the DDR1 transmembrane domain that is required for strong transmembrane helix association, as well as for collagen-induced receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Noordeen et al., 2006</xref>). In order to analyse whether transmembrane helix interactions play a role in signalling between DDR1 dimers, we introduced the inactivating transmembrane mutation (L430G/L431P, termed TM1) into the ectodomain deletion constructs. Surface immunostaining and flow cytometry confirmed that the TM1 mutants were present on the cell surface at comparable levels with the respective constructs with wild-type transmembrane regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), demonstrating that the transmembrane mutations did not affect protein trafficking. However, these constructs could no longer be phosphorylated through co-expression with DDR1b-Y513F, despite the presence of cysteine-linked dimers in the ΔECD-Cys-TM1 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Previous work showed that DDR1 forms constitutive dimers (or higher oligomers) in the absence of ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mihai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Noordeen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2014</xref>) ruling out the widely accepted RTK activation model of ligand-induced dimerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). Structural studies did not detect conformational differences between ligand-bound and unliganded DDR discoidin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carafoli et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ichikawa et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, the long and flexible extracellular DDR1 juxtamembrane region does not appear to couple conformational changes to the intracellular region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). These observations led to the hypothesis that collagen binding may induce clustering of DDR1 in the cell membrane. In the present study we show that collagen binding results in DDR1 redistribution into a more compact structure on the cell surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ligand binding induces phosphorylation in trans between DDR1 dimers (as opposed to phosphorylation exclusively within a dimer), which can only occur if neighbouring dimers are brought into close proximity. These data, therefore, strongly support a clustering mechanism of DDR1 activation.</p><p>Our experiments with disulphide-linked constructs clearly demonstrate that inactive DDR1 mutants can be phosphorylated in a dimeric state. Phosphorylation of a key juxtamembrane tyrosine in the receiver construct (Y513) requires kinase activity of the donor but not of the receiver kinase. These data indicate a mechanism where the juxtamembrane regions of DDR1 dimers act as substrates for the kinase activity of neighbouring DDR1 molecules, rather than being phosphorylated exclusively through kinase activity within the same dimer. In addition to juxtamembrane phosphorylation, the activation loop of the receiver kinase was phosphorylated in our co-expression studies, again independently of receiver kinase activity, indicating that the activation loop can also act as a substrate for neighbouring DDR1 dimers. Activation loop phosphorylation is a major regulatory mechanism that releases cis-autoinhibition of kinases, including the majority of RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). The DDR1 kinase domain is auto-inhibited through activation loop interactions with the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canning et al., 2014</xref>). Our collective biochemical and microscopic data suggest that DDRs are activated by a mechanism in which collagen binding promotes lateral association of DDR1 dimers, which contributes to activation loop phosphorylation and perhaps also to the release of cis-autoinhibition of the kinase domain.</p><p>Co-clustering with, and phosphorylation by, catalytically active DDR1 was independent of ectodomain contacts but required specific transmembrane domain interactions. These data reinforce a key role for the DDR1 transmembrane domain in signalling. DDR1 transmembrane helices have the highest propensity for self-association amongst all RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Finger et al., 2009</xref>), and DDR1 mutants with mutations that weaken transmembrane helix interactions are severely compromised in collagen-induced receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Noordeen et al., 2006</xref>). The present data show that intact transmembrane associations are not only essential for DDR1 as an enzyme kinase but also as a substrate kinase. It is possible that weakened transmembrane domain contacts affect the conformation of the cytoplasmic region in such a way that it no longer functions as a substrate for donor DDR1 kinase. Transmembrane domain contacts may also be required for DDR1 clustering, which could either involve direct receptor-receptor contacts or another membrane protein. In breast cancer cells, it was recently shown that the tetraspanin TM4SF1 promotes clustering of DDR1; however, in this scenario the DDR1 ectodomain was necessary for interaction with TM4SF1, while the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions were dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>DDR1 activation in our co-expression experiments was achieved with fibrillar and non-fibrillar collagens, a collagen-mimetic peptide, as well as by clustering with a multimeric anti-DDR1 mAb. The fact that a short collagen-mimetic peptide efficiently induced signalling between DDR1 dimers suggests that DDR1 clustering is receptor-mediated, rather than achieved through cross-linking via the ligand. While most RTKs are thought to signal as dimers, ligand-induced clustering is a key step in signalling of the Eph family of RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Himanen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Seiradake et al., 2010</xref>). DDR1 activation shares some, but not all of the characteristics of Eph receptor activation. Similar to what we show in this report for DDR1, ligand binding-defective Eph receptors co-cluster with functional Eph receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Seiradake et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wimmer-Kleikamp et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, kinase-dead EphB6 clusters with EphB1, resulting in EphB6 transphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Freywald et al., 2002</xref>). However, unlike in DDR1 clusters, structurally defined ectodomain contacts are important for Eph receptor clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Himanen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Seiradake et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Another difference is that Eph receptor signalling clusters can exceed the size of the ligand contact zone several fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wimmer-Kleikamp et al., 2004</xref>), while we observed that DDR1 signalling clusters were strictly confined to the ligand contact area.</p><p>Interestingly, signalling between DDR1 dimers did not require identical cytoplasmic regions and was also observed with DDR2 as the donor kinase. These findings have functional implications in that catalytically incompetent DDR1 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alves et al., 2001</xref>) could contribute to signalling when co-expressed with catalytically competent DDR1 isoforms or DDR2, with the signalling outcome likely dependent on the balance between catalytically active and inactive receptors, as has been suggested for Eph receptor signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Truitt and Freywald, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have shown that oligomerisation beyond dimerisation also plays a role in signalling of RTKs that have traditionally been assumed to signal exclusively as dimers. Thus, EGF binding to the EGF receptor can result in formation of tetramers and higher-order oligomers, which may boost autophosphorylation of C-terminal tail tyrosines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clayton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Needham et al., 2016</xref>). However, conflicting structural models have been proposed for the architecture and stoichiometry of EGF-bound EGF receptor multimers: one model involves self-association of ligand-bound dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2016</xref>), while another model involves association via unoccupied ligand-binding sites, resulting in oligomers that can bind two EGF molecules at most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Needham et al., 2016</xref>). Our microscopic and biochemical data define a ligand-induced clustering mechanism and phosphorylation between neighbouring DDR1 dimers in trans; the size and structure of DDR1 signalling clusters and whether other molecules are required to co-associate with DDR1 remain to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, monkey Cos-7 fibroblast-like kidney cells, and human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were from ATCC, Manassas, VA, and were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F12 nutrient mixture (DMEM/F12; Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin and 10% foetal bovine serum.

Cos-7 cells were grown on coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates and transfected with Fugene HD (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>DDR1 autophosphorylation assay</title><p>The assay was performed as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leitinger, 2003</xref>). Briefly, 24 hr after transfection, the cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 16 hr. Cells were then stimulated with 10 µg/ml collagen I, 50 µg/ml collagen IV, 50 µg/ml collagen-mimetic DDR-selective peptide, or the multimeric anti-DDR1 Ab (mAb513, 1:500 dilution from ascites) for 90 min at 37°C. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 5 mM NaF. Aliquots of the lysates were analysed by reducing SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. In experiments with cysteine mutants, the lysis procedure was as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 30 mM NEM to avoid potential non-native disulphide formation during lysis, and aliquots of lysates were analysed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE on 5% or 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. This was followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed first with anti-phospho-DDR1 Abs followed by horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary Abs, then stripped in Antibody Stripping Solution (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, Texas) and re-probed with anti-DDR1 Abs followed by horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary Abs. To detect expression of DDR2 or the truncated DDR1 construct lacking the kinase domain (DDR1-MDN) in co-expression experiments, blots were probed first with anti-DDR2 or anti-DDR1 against the ectodomain, respectively, followed by horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-goat secondary Abs. Signal detection was performed using Enhanced Chemiluminescence Plus or Enhanced Chemiluminescence Select reagents (Amersham Biosciences) on an Ettan DIGE imager, a Typhoon FLA 9500 Imager (GE Healthcare Biosciences) or X-ray film.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>DDR1 protein expression</title><p>HEK293, T47D and MCF7 cells were grown in 6-well tissue culture plates and primary keratinocytes were grown in 10 cm dishes. HEK293 cells were transfected with varying amounts of DDR1b expression plasmid. Cells were serum-starved for 16 hr and lysed as above. Equal amounts of protein were analysed by reducing SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. This was followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with anti-DDR1 Ab followed by horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat-anti-rabbit secondary Ab, or anti-tubulin Ab followed by horseradish peroxidase conjugated sheep-anti-mouse secondary Ab.

This was followed by washing, fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, blocking in 8% BSA in PBS for 1 hr, and incubation with anti-mouse IgG1 Alexa-Fluor-488 secondary Ab. Cos-7 cells transiently expressing DDR1b wildtype were stimulated with 10 µg/ml collagen I or a mixture of 10 µg/ml collagen and 10 µg/ml mouse anti-DDR1 7A9 IgG1 mAb, for 10 min at 37°C. The cells were washed with PBS, and incubated with mAb 7A9 for 1 hr on ice to label cell surface DDR1. This was followed by fixation and incubation with secondary Ab as above.

For comparison of surface DDR1 expression, HEK293, T47D and MCF7 cells were grown in 6-well tissue culture plates and primary keratinocytes were grown in 10 cm dishes. HEK293 cells were transfected with varying amounts of DDR1b expression plasmid. Cells dissociation, Ab staining and fixation were done as above, except that the primary Ab was anti-mouse DDR1 (mAb 7A9) and the secondary Ab was FITC-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Reinhard Fässler (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The findings of your paper show that (1) ligand binding-induced clustering leads to the activation of DDR dimers, (2) active DDR dimers phosphorylate neighbouring DDR dimers in the juxtamembrane and activation loop, (3) the ectodomain is not required for these phosphorylation events in the receiving neighbouring DDR dimers, and (4) the TM domain interaction is essential for donor as well as neighbouring receiver DDR dimers. Despite some clear strengths of the submitted manuscript, the research has some important shortcomings and limitations, which the authors should address in a revised submission:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is necessary to exclude that over-expressed DDR does not lead to artificial aggregates, How do the overexpressed surface levels compare to wild type level? Key experiments could be repeated at low expression levels if overexpressed levels are indeed much higher than endogenous levels.</p><p>2) It is necessary to show functional relevance (e.g. adhesion) of DDR clustering.</p><p>3) The dimer size is unclear. Confirm the dimer size in SDS-PAGE with appropriate molecular size markers. Indicate molecular weights in gels and blots.</p><p>4) The authors use cysteine mutants to further separate phosphorylation within dimers and across different dimers. It is shown that for inter-dimer phosphorylation the receiver requires specific transmembrane sequences and the donor requires catalytic activity. Although activation loop phosphorylation can also occur across dimers, it appears that intra-dimer phosphorylation of the activation loop is more efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A-B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This indicates that important ligand induced signaling also occurs independent of receptor clustering. Whereas activation loop phosphorylation has a clear role in DDR kinase activation, the role for juxtamembrane phosphorylation is less clear. Therefore, although the data does quite convincingly show that juxtamembrane phosphorylation does occur across dimers, its importance is not clear. It is necessary to clarify whether the phosphorylation of the activation loop is due to cross-dimer and/or intra-dimer phosphorylation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Collagen induces activation of DDR1 through lateral dimer association and phosphorylation between dimers&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Key experiments could be repeated at low expression levels if overexpressed levels are indeed much higher than endogenous levels.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ concern and have repeated key experiments at low DDR1 expression levels that clearly demonstrate dimer phosphorylation of receiver kinases, similar to the results of our original experiments. The new data rule out that the phosphorylation between neighbouring DDR1 dimers is due to aggregation of DDR1 at artificially high expression levels.</p><p>DDR1 is expressed in a wide range of tissues but no systematic study has been carried out to compare expression levels of endogenous DDR1 in different cell types. Immortalised cancer cell lines have varying levels of surface DDR1. We used flow cytometry to compare surface levels of DDR1 in our HEK293 cell expression system with the levels on primary human keratinocytes and two commonly used breast cancer cell lines. The new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) show that the mean DDR1 surface levels resulting from the transfection conditions used in most of our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) are similar to those on T47D breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, HEK-5ug DNA vs. T47D) and approximately 3 times higher than those on primary keratinocytes. We have repeated key co-expression experiments under conditions that result in DDR1 surface levels that are comparable with those on primary keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; HEK-1ug DNA vs Keratinocytes). Detection of the phosphorylation signal was possible by using the most sensitive ECL substrates that are commercially available. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> shows collagen-induced phosphorylation of DDR1-R32E-Cys and DDR1-ΔECD-Cys receiver dimers when co-expressed with DDR1-Y513F donor kinase, using a range of different expression levels.</p><p>Because our experimental approach relies on co-expression of mutant DDR1 constructs, our experiments can only be done under transfection conditions. Collagen-induced DDR1 phosphorylation is a characteristically slow process, which would be expected to occur with faster kinetics if over-expression lead to a different form, or enhanced, levels of DDR1 aggregation. However, this is not the case, further arguing against an activation mechanism that is dependent on very high levels of DDR1 expression.</p><p><italic>2) It is necessary to show functional relevance (e.g. adhesion) of DDR clustering.</italic> </p><p>In a previous publication (Carafoli et al., Structure, 2012) we identified a number of function-blocking anti-DDR1 antibodies we believe are interfering with DDR1 clustering. Blocking DDR1 clustering by other means is likely to result in a similar complete inhibition of ligand-induced DDR1 phosphorylation, with functional consequences for any cellular process that relies on DDR1 kinase activity.</p><p>In unpublished experiments that go beyond the scope of the current manuscript, we have shown that collagen binding to DDR1 leads to re-distribution of DDR1 on the cell surface from a punctate into a more compact structure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 1</xref>). This phenomenon can be described as ligand-induced clustering. Because this happens with fast kinetics, before phosphorylation is detected, our current molecular model of DDR1 activation involves ligand-induced receptor clustering as the first step, followed by kinase activation and further down-stream signalling. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 1</xref>, collagen-induced clustering can be prevented by addition of our function-blocking anti-DDR1 monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies bind to an extracellular epitope and allosterically block collagen-induced DDR1 phosphorylation (Carafoli et al., Structure, 2012). Together with the data attached to this rebuttal, this demonstrates that clustering is a key step in DDR1 activation. We note that our anti-DDR1 antibodies also block DDR1-mediated affinity regulation of collagen-binding integrins, which leads to enhanced adhesion (Xu et al., PLOS one, 2012). Hence DDR1 clustering is functionally important for cell adhesion.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25716.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Anti-DDR1 mAbs inhibit collagen-induced DDR1 clustering.</title><p>Cos-7 cells expressing DDR1 were incubated with 10 μg/ml collagen I for 10 minutes at 37°C, left unstimulated, or incubated with collagen I in the presence of function-blocking anti-DDR1 mAbs.

Confirm the dimer size in SDS-PAGE with appropriate molecular size markers. Indicate molecular weights in gels and blots.</italic> </p><p>In a previous publication on disulphide-linked DDR1 constructs (including DDR1-T416C used in the present study), we showed blots of non-reducing gels with molecular mass markers up to 460 kDa (Xu et al., JBC, 2014). From these blots, it can be seen that full-length DDR1-Cys dimers are ~240 kDa, compared with ~120 kDa for DDR1 monomers on the same blot. The data shown in the new Figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) are shown with the same molecular size markers up to 460 kDa, as in our original study.</p><p><italic>4) The authors use cysteine mutants to further separate phosphorylation within dimers and across different dimers. It is shown that for inter-dimer phosphorylation the receiver requires specific transmembrane sequences and the donor requires catalytic activity. Although activation loop phosphorylation can also occur across dimers, it appears that intra-dimer phosphorylation of the activation loop is more efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A-B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This indicates that important ligand induced signaling also occurs independent of receptor clustering. Whereas activation loop phosphorylation has a clear role in DDR kinase activation, the role for juxtamembrane phosphorylation is less clear. Therefore, although the data does quite convincingly show that juxtamembrane phosphorylation does occur across dimers, its importance is not clear. It is necessary to clarify whether the phosphorylation of the activation loop is due to cross-dimer and/or intra-dimer phosphorylation.</italic> </p><p>There is indeed strong activation loop phosphorylation at the position of donor DDR1a or DDR1-Y513F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), but we do not agree with the reviewers’ conclusion that this signal necessarily results from phosphorylation within a dimer. It is equally possible that activation loop phosphorylation occurs by the same inter-dimer mechanism that we unequivocally demonstrate for Y513.</p><p>With regards to the activation loop phosphorylation signals shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, we note that the signal obtained at the position of DDR1a and DDR1-Y513F represents both homodimers of functional receptor (DDR1a or DDR1-Y513F) and any heterodimers that might form between DDR1-R32E-Cys and DDR1a or DDR1-R32E-Cys and DDR1-Y513F. Therefore, these signals will also include some DDR1-R32E-Cys molecules; we have now clarified in the figure legends to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> that the position of DDR1a/Y513F includes heterodimers. Furthermore, fully functional receptor constructs (DDR1a, DDR1-Y513F) are expected to be phosphorylated very efficiently, since they functionally engage with the ligand, in contrast to the receiver kinase. Local signal propagation involving functional DDR1 may be more effective than recruiting signalling-incompetent DDR1 molecules into functional signalling clusters, which could account for the difference in autophosphorylation signals seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-B</xref>. We further note that, in our hands, DDR1a activation loop phosphorylation signals are usually stronger than those of DDR1b (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, right hand side), for reasons that are unclear at present. This may account for the particularly strong activation loop signals at the DDR1a position when DDR1-R32E-Cys is co-expressed with DDR1a.</p><p>The reviewers would like us to clarify whether activation loop phosphorylation is due to inter-dimer phosphorylation or phosphorylation within a dimer. The experiments that we present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A-B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> clearly show that activation loop phosphorylation of the receiver can occur as a consequence of inter-dimer phosphorylation. We have now extended this point and provide evidence that a kinase-dead receiver dimer is also phosphorylated on the activation loop (new Figure; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data clearly demonstrate that activation loop phosphorylation of receiver kinase occurs as a result of phosphorylation in trans, in the absence of receiver kinase activity. Because our experimental setup can only detect receiver (and not donor) kinases in dimeric form, it is not possible to test whether donor kinase phosphorylation occurs as a result of inter-dimer phosphorylation.</p><p>Our experimental design does not allow us to rule out that collagen-induced intra-dimer phosphorylation occurs. In fact, one might speculate that for closely apposed DDR1 dimers in signalling clusters, there is no functional difference between kinase domains that are linked via the transmembrane domain and those that are not. Due to the unusually large and unstructured intracellular juxtamembrane region, it is conceivable that within a signalling cluster all DDR1 kinase domains are at equal distance from one another.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance.</italic> </p><p><italic>Your figure provided to the reviewers demonstrates that DDR function prevents formation of larger aggregates.
